Eleven public-school primary classrooms were observed, and the interactions between the teachers and students were studied. Verbal and nonverbal interactions were recorded and categorized using emergent and "a priori " categories to discover similarities and inconsistencies when comparing regular and small-size classes. Teachers in the small-size classes spent more time on task-related interactions than did teachers in regular-size classes. Teachers in regular-size classes spent more time on institutional interactions. The emergent categori_es of positive attention and examples, negative attention, acknowledgment, directive, and procedural were documented. When all interactions were compared, teachers in small classes were observed during more <b>separate</b> <b>directive</b> interaction events than were teachers in regular-size classes, and they were devoting more time to interactions that were task-related and less time to negative behavior...|$|E

40|$|Master of EducationDevelopments in {{the field}} of {{sociolinguistics}} have focused attention on differences in the purposes to which speech is put and on the structures that emerge from the speaker's perception of his own purposes and the likely effect of his words on the listener. The study of the patterning of language in response to the influence of social context is the field of the ethnography of speaking. This project was devised to study the relationship between the directive function of language in children of lower primary school age and the range of linguistic forms directives would have when children were engaged in co-operative tasks. Possible elaboration in response to the social variable "status of addressee" was tested by placing each subject in partnership with a younger child, one the same age, an older child and an adult. Children aged 6, 7 and 8 years of age were used as subjects. Drawing principally on the work of Searle, children's directive utterances were first selected from the transcripts of conversation {{on the basis of their}} directive intent determined from the context. Directives were then grouped according to their syntactic sentence types and finally were compared to the classification of adult directives compiled by Ervin-Tripp. The analysis examined 565 <b>separate</b> <b>directive</b> utterances from both subjects and partners. The principle finding of the study was that the children's directives were selected in response to the demands of the task and the co-operative framework in which it was carried out. They showed little tendency to elaborate directives to take account of the social variable present. Recognition of interpersonal relationships was marked by variations in the amounts of directive utterance produced and in the responses the hearers made to directive utterances. As a by-product of the project, it has been shown that an approach to the study of children's language using the meaning of context as a point of departure is a viable and fruitful strategy.

40|$|The European laws surveilling {{surveillance}} may possibly {{soon become}} more complex or more uncertain, depending on developments {{during the next}} 12 - 36 months. On the 25 th January 2012 the European Commission published two, not one, proposals for new legislation in the ever-growing field of privacy and data protection. One of these two proposals is the mildly-named but potent “Regulation” covering most sectors of activity except for the law enforcement and criminal justice sectors which are proposed to be governed by a <b>separate</b> <b>Directive.</b> Both the Article 29 Working Party and the European Data Protection Supervisor in March 2012 overall welcomed the Draft Regulation, whereas they strongly criticised the Draft Directive which is regarded as being greatly inferior to the Draft Regulation. This level of criticism begs {{a number of important}} questions: why is the police and justice sector being handled differently and separately from other sectors? Why does the current (1995) data protection directive allegedly lead to fragmentation to the extent that in 2012 the Commission proposes a Regulation to replace it yet at the same time, almost in the same breath, in 2012 and still in 2013, it is proposing that the Police and Criminal Justice sector be regulated by a Directive? Would the new Directive on Police use of personal data not produce the same level of fragmentation as the old 1995 Directive did in other sectors? Is this not inconsistent? This paper examines whether these new laws are fit-for-purpose by first laying out the realities that the law must presumably set out to regulate. It then examines the problems with the logic and indeed the credibility of some answers provided publicly by the European Commission. After dealing with the logical inconsistencies implicit in the current approach, the paper questions the usefulness of the Draft Directive from a substantive point of view and especially {{in the wake of the}} Snowden revelations about the modalities of surveillance being employed world-wide. Utilising summary findings from the PUPIE project, this paper makes the point that, in fact, most of the principles of the Draft Directive are already provided for in the laws of many EU member states so the degree of legislative innovation being proposed is questionable, the harmonization benefits may be minimal, while the allegedly undesirable fragmentation will remain. The paper then traces how, since May 2013, the European debate on data protection was overtaken by,and now benefits from, the revelations made by Edward Snowden. It demonstrates the relative legal impotence of the EU in such matters on account of the fact that matters of national security are reserved to national governments by virtue of Article 4 (2) of the EU Treaty. After analyzing the relevant developments to end October 2013 the paper concludes that the most suitable, and possibly - though not necessarily - the most likely option to European policy-makers is that of pushing for a new Council of Europe convention on Cyber-Security in an effort to balance the privacy and security interests inherent to a debate about surveillance. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{constant}} {{expansion of}} the European Community, the harmonization {{in the fields of}} European company law and development of internal European market have emerged into considerably bigger and more complex issues. Aspects of corporate mobility, having a direct simultaneous connection to the right of freedom of establishment, {{have been one of the}} most problematic spheres for reaching international consensus. Despite numerous directives adopted by Member States (MS) European undertakings continue to be regulated by national legislations. The idea of a common European limited liability company, sc. Societas Europaea (SE), was put into process of realization in order to facilitate the internal trade and to help multinational companies to obtain legal certainty and trans-European character by rising above the variety of national legislations. Furthermore, the SE was to make cross-border enterprise management more flexible and less bureaucratic and to help improving the general competitiveness of Community enterprises. The process of formation of the European Company Statue took over forty years and the result of the final adoption turned out to be something completely different from the es-sential idea of the European Company. Due to the historical, socio-political and legal dif-ferences MSs had difficulties with compromising on the majority of aspects and instead of one common SE form, the Community had basically adopted 28 different alternatives, loosing the original valuable supranational character. The strongest advantage of the SE are the rights conferred to it by the Regulation. The frequent use of renvoi technique undermines this aspect of SE’s precedence over national legislation. The true potential of the European Company remains thus highly theoretical and the current shape of the SE presents only a weak alternative to the national corporate forms of the MSs. A European Company cannot be freely incorporated solely by investment of private capi-tal. There is a need for existence of at least two legal enterprises which furthermore must fall under the scope of different national legislations. In other words in order to create an SE, the definite cross-border element between companies at hand must be visible or can be identified. It can be formed by means of merger, creation of a holding, incorporation of a subsidiary or conversion. The subscribed capital for the SE shall at its minimum equal € 120 000. The Council Regulation on SE provides a flexible management regime, permit-ting companies to choose between two administration systems (one-tier/two-tier) that exist in the Community. The issues of employee involvement are regulated in <b>separate</b> <b>directive</b> that is a supplement to the Regulation. Despite the recent developments of freedom of establishment through the case-law, the matter remains utterly complicated. The SE may seem on one hand as a logical solution, being able to incorporate in different MSs, to merge or to form a holding without burden-some processes of winding-up and re-incorporation. On the other hand the Regulation re-stricts the mobility of the SE by provisions prohibiting location of registered and head of-fice of the company in different MSs, depriving it thus from one of the basic Community freedoms. Prudent attitude to mobility and aspiration to protect national interests have partly diminished essential advantages of the SE. It appears to be impossible to conduct business in one MS while being registered in another. Possible amendments are awaited shortly, but so far the SE has definitely not achieved many of practical goals considering mobility and has fulfilled very few of its important theoretical expectations. National perspective on the adoption of the SE seems to be relatively positive, accepting the theoretical advantages of corporate mobility, options of structure and management and possibility to obtain an essentially European trademark. However, there is also an amount of skepticism addressed to deficient practical functioning due to the lack of uniform legislation. European organizations and companies tend to have a slightly more cautious and restrained approach. The idea of a European Company is praised more for its genuinely European character. Representatives for established SEs prefer to talk about internationalization of trade, European recognition, enhanced competitiveness and market integration, while very little speaks about the true practical potential. The SE is furthermore often observed as a useful but still mainly theoretical legal instrument, playing an indispensable part in the overall development of European company law. Political motives seem to be considerably heavier while discussing the question of necessity of adoption that later attracted so little interest. Additionally, the basic idea of the SE also seems to include definite measures for general European unification, granting SE the symbolic value of commonly European enterprise. Consequently, failing in purely practical application in the absence of a clear need for common limited liability company, the SE has its theoretical and crucially important socio-psychological purposes...|$|E

50|$|Waste {{has become}} an {{important}} part of EU policy. A framework of different regulations and directives exist to improve the management of waste in the EU and EFTA countries. EU policy can be separated into product related regulation such as the ELV Directive, WEEE Directive or Battery Directive to only name a few, general waste legislation such as the Waste Framework Directive or Waste Shipment Regulation, and treatment related legislation e.g. Landfill Directive, Incineration Directive. The product related waste regulation is subordinate to the general waste regulation. An important principle of product specific regulation is that a given product can not fall under the jurisdiction of two <b>separate</b> <b>directives</b> at the same time. For instance, the lead acid battery in an end-of-life vehicle is covered under the ELV Directive, whereas a lead-acid battery being a replacement part during life cycle of the vehicle is subject to the Battery Directive.|$|R

40|$|Access {{to justice}} {{has been a}} topic of {{interest}} in the EU even prior to the 1998 Aarhus Convention. The Aarhus Convention focuses on procedural rights and not substantive matters. While dealing with access to justice, Article 9 of the Convention takes account of access to information, public participation in the decision-making and access to administrative and judicial procedures. At the EU level, two <b>separate</b> <b>directives</b> deal with access to information and public participation in the decision-making, respectively. The draft EU directive on access to justice in environmental matters (2003), which is discussed in this paper, concentrates on the enforcement of legislation relating to the environment by members of the public. The concerns of the NGO communities were clear from the consultations carried out by the EU on the proposed EU Directive on access to justice in environmental matters. The main concerns related to the definitions which, in some cases, did not follow the wordings of Aarhus Convention. In their view, the provisions related to standing and recognition procedure are also not satisfactory. Questions were raised regarding the necessity of the opt-out mechanism. There was also an issue that the draft directive on access to justice in environmental matters should have taken a more effective role on the cost implications of any legal action brought by environmental organisations. Moreover, some non-legal barriers might jeopardise the effectiveness of the directive. Though all the EU member states have signed the Aarhus Convention, only a handful of members have so far managed to ratify it. One of the member states, the UK, is working towards a speedy ratification. A case study of the UK suggests that quite a large number of research works have been done on all three pillars of Aarhus Convention. This paper mentions, albeit briefly, three recently completed research projects on access to justice in the UK. So far as standing is concerned, UK law refers to a ‘sufficient interest’ test. In most of the environmental cases, the judges have taken a restricted approach while defining and applying the ‘sufficient interest’ test. The judiciary in the UK can review decisions taken by public authorities. However, they are only allowed to examine the procedural, and not substantive, illegality or impropriety. This situation creates an obstruction to justice when one considers that there is no third party right of appeal in the UK. There is a concern as to the expensive and time-consuming legal system of the UK which is not fair and equitable and will not pass the Aarhus test. This paper explores the issue of a separate environment court and whether that would create an ‘independent and impartial tribunal’ for environmental matters. The paper concludes with a hopeful note that the EU’s directive on access to justice in environmental matters will provide member states the necessary guidance and will lead to a better access to justice in all EU member states...|$|R

This monastery, situated in the Sonian Forest in Belgium, formed since 1413 part of the Congregation of Windesheim, a branch of the Augustinian order. The starting point is to investigate what the rule of Augustine has to say about wrongdoing and punishment, and in how far it could be considered to subscribe to solitary confinement as a punishment. Next, not only the prescriptions laid down in the Constitutions and the Statutes of Windesheim, but also the decisions of the general and provincial chapters provide us with information about which offenders faced incarceration. Some individual cases will be presented of those who received a poena carceralis from the 16 th to the 18 th c.

40|$|Land cover (LC) is a {{scientific}} landscape classification based on physical properties of earth materials. This information is usually retrieved through remote sensing techniques (e. g. forest cover, urban, clay content, among others). In contrast, Land use (LU) is defined from an anthropocentric point of view. It describes how a specific area is used (e. g. it is usual {{to indicate whether}} a territory supports an intensive, extensive use or it is unused). Both geospatial layers are essential inputs in many socio-economic and environmental studies. The INSPIRE directive provides technical data specifications for harmonization and sharing of voluminous LU/ LC datasets across all countries of the EU. The INSPIRE initiative proposes Object-Oriented Modelling as a data modelling methodology. However, the most used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are built upon relational databases. This may jeopardize LU/LC data usability, since GIS practitioners will eventually face the object-relational impedance mismatch. In this paper, the authors introduce the SIOSE database (Spanish Land Cover and Land Use Information System), {{which was the first}} implementation of an object-oriented land cover and Land-use datamodel, in line with the recommendation of the INSPIRE <b>Directive,</b> <b>separating</b> both themes. SIOSE data can be downloaded as relational database files, where information describing each single LU/LC object is divided among several related tables, so database queries can be complex and time consuming. The authors show these technical complexities through a computational experience, comparing SQL and NoSQL databases for querying spatial data downloaded from SIOSE. Finally, the authors conclude that NoSQL geodatabases deserve to be further explored because they could scale for LU/LC data, both horizontally and vertically, better than relational geodatabases, improving usability and making the most of the EU harmonization efforts...|$|R
40|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to arrive at a set of competencies for inclusion in accounting programs in many countries. The concern about evaluating of what was being taught to accounting students in order to prepare them for the profession stretches back to the 1950 s (Palmer et al. 2004). However more contemporary studies were kick-started by the ‘Big White Paper’ in 1989 which resurrected the debate in the United States and has led to many studies in Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Europe. In 1998, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC 1998) defined competency as “the ability to perform the tasks and roles expected of a professional accountant, both newly qualified and experienced, to the standard expected by employers and the general public”. IFAC now requires that all member associations comply with the competency standards (and should have complied by January 2005). Given that all member association need to comply, the question needs to be asked - Can a set of competency skills developed mainly in the USA be applicable to other countries particularly developing countries who have not the same history of accounting education and professional conduct? This paper describes how the application of the international competency framework was applied to an Indonesian university under an Asian Development Bank program to improve the standard of accounting education in that country. It highlights the difference in cultural approaches to accounting education as the country is in its infancy in establishing accounting as a recognised profession <b>separate</b> from government <b>directive.</b> A number of obstacles needed to be overcome because of the way accounting academics are employed and undertake their roles as teachers. The project involved analysis of all accounting courses in the undergraduate program against the benchmark of the competency framework using gap analysis. This analysis identified what skills were not covered in each course and the entire program. Using surveys, focus groups and meetings all stakeholders were consulted as to the needs of the accounting profession by business, government and other organisations. This was matched with the views of existing students, graduates and their employers providing a rich set of data from which to evaluate whether the international competencies were appropriate for Indonesia. As a result of the findings, the accounting program was redesigned to incorporate an adapted set of competencies which would comply with IFAC requirements but be sensitive to the current contextual position of the accounting profession in Indonesia. The redesign was sympathetic to the university’s resource constraints and proposed a strategy of incremental changes that could be effected within three to four years. This project shows that if the competency standards can be contextualised they can apply to a very different environment to that from which they evolved. ...|$|R
