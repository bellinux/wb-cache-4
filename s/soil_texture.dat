2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four soil series recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, <b>soil</b> <b>texture,</b> structure, consistence, pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs. [...] The San Joaquin soil was first recognized in the survey of the Fresno Area in 1900.|$|E

Therefore, survival, growth, nutrient uptake and fecundity of two co-occurring, invasive Physalis species were tested under water and salinity stresses, and different <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> in the current study. Five different water stress levels (100, 75, 50, 25, and 12. 5 % pot water contents), four different soil salinity levels (0, 3, 6, and 12 dSm- 1) and four different <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> (67 % clay, 50 % clay, silt clay loam and sandy loam) were included in three different pot experiments. Both weeds survived under all levels of water stress except 12. 5 % water contents and on all soil types however, behaved differently under increasing salinity. The weeds responded similarly to salinity up till 3 dSm- 1 whereas, P. philadelphica survived for longer time than P. angulata under remaining salinity regimes. Water and salinity stress hampered the growth and fecundity of both weeds while, <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> had slight effect. Both weeds preferred clay textured soils for better growth and nutrient uptake however, interactive effect of weeds and <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> was non-significant. P. angulata accumulated higher K and Na while P. philadelphica accrued more Ca and Mg as well as maintained better K/Na ratio. P. angulata accumulated more Na and P under salinity stress while, P. philadelphica accrued higher K and Mg, and maintained higher K/Na ratio. Collectively, highest nutrient accumulation was observed under stress free conditions and on clay textured soils. P. philadelphica exhibited higher reproductive output under all experimental conditions than P. angulata. It is predicted that P. philadelphica will be more problematic under optimal water supply and high salinity while P. angulata can better adapt water limited environments. The results indicate that both weeds have considerable potential to further expand their ranges in semi-arid regions of Turkey...|$|R

From these profiles, obtained for different soils, we derived the characteristic electrical parameters, such as relative permittivity (epsilonr) and electrical conductivity (sigma), and their variation in time, employing empirical relations available in the scientific literature. The simulation through {{mathematical model}}s has been performed taking into account different types of soils characterized by the percentage composition of sand, clay and silt in the textural triangle, which provides some physical and chemical properties that affect the water retention in the soil. The resulting simulated profiles of SWC and consequently permittivity and conductivity profiles, span over a certain range of values suggesting the best techniques and the limits in geophysical investigation. Moreover this a-prior knowledge helps in the elaboration and interpretation of permittivity and conductivity data obtained by the measurements. Permittivity and conductivity profiles are particularly useful in some environmental applications when the <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> are (or supposed to be) known as in the typical case of landfill leachate dispersion.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{unsaturated}} Darcy's law, the Talbot-Ogden method provides a fast unconditional mass conservative algorithm to simulate groundwater infiltration in various unsaturated <b>soil</b> <b>textures.</b> Unlike advanced reservoir modelling methods that compute unsaturated flow in space, it only discretizes the moisture content domain into a suitable number of bins so that the vertical water movement is estimated piecewise in each bin. The dimensionality of the moisture content domain is extended from one dimensional to two dimensional in this study, which allows us to distinguish pore shapes within the same moisture content range. The vertical movement {{of water in the}} extended model imitates the infiltration phase in the Talbot-Ogden method. However, the difference in this extension is the directional redistribution, which represents the horizontal inter-bin flow and causes the water content distribution to have an effect on infiltration. Using this extension, we mathematically analyse the general relationship between infiltration and the moisture content distribution associated with wetting front depths in different bins. We show that a more negatively skewed moisture content distribution can produce a longer ponding time, whereas a higher overall flux cannot be guaranteed in this situation. It is proven on {{the basis of}} the water content probability distribution independent of <b>soil</b> <b>textures.</b> To illustrate this analysis, we also present numerical examples for both fine and coarse <b>soil</b> <b>textures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Infiltration {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters affecting irrigation. For this reason, measuring and estimating this parameter is very important, particularly when designing and managing irrigation systems. Infiltration affects water flow and solute transport in the soil surface and subsurface. Due to temporal and spatial variability, Many measurements are needed to explain the average soil infiltration characteristics under field conditions. Stochastic characteristics of the different natural phenomena led to the application of random variables and time series in predicting the performance of these phenomena. Time-series analysis is a simple and efficient method for prediction, which is widely used in various sciences. However, a few researches have investigated the time-series modeling to predict soil infiltration characteristics. In this study, capability of time series in estimating infiltration rate for different <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> was evaluated. Materials and methods: For this purpose, the 60 and 120 minutes data of double ring infiltrometer test in Lali plain, Khuzestan, Iran, with its proposed time intervals (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 minutes) were used to predict cumulative infiltration until the end of the experiment time for heavy (clay), medium (loam) and light (sand) <b>soil</b> <b>textures.</b> Moreover, used parameters of Kostiakov-Lewis equation recommended by NRCS, 24 hours cumulative infiltration curves were applied in time-series modeling for six different <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> (clay, clay loam, silty, silty loam, sandy loam and sand). Different time-series models including Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ARMA model with eXogenous variables (ARMAX) and AR model with eXogenous variables (ARX) were evaluated in predicting cumulative infiltration. Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation charts for each variable time-series models were investigated. The evaluation indices were the coefficient of determination (R 2), root of mean square error (RMSE) and standard error (SE). Results and discussion: The results showed that the AR(p), ARX(p,x) and ARMAX(p,q,x) time series models with various degrees 1, 2, 3 successfully predicted infiltration rates for duration of the test in different soils. Significant correlation between actual and estimated values of cumulative infiltration was almost obtained. The values of SE varied between 2 and 5 percent for three <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> in Lali plain. Reducing input data from two hours to one hour did not have major impact on infiltration prediction.

40|$|Subsoil {{compaction}} {{is a major}} yield {{limiting factor}} for most agricultural crops. Tillage is the most efficient method to quickly treat compacted subsoil, {{but it is also}} expensive, increases erosion, and accelerates nutrient cycling. The use of real-time electrical conductivity (EC) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance values to differentiate compacted areas from uncompacted areas was studied. This method has potential to reduce monetary and time investments inherent in traditional grid sampling and the resultant deep tillage of an entire field. EC and NIR reflectance are both very sensitive to spatial variability of soil attributes. The objective of this research was to determine whether the amount of soil moisture affects the efficacy of EC and NIR spectroscopy (at 2151. 9 nm) in identifying subsoil compaction through correlation analysis, and also to determine whether a minimum level of compaction was necessary for these same methods to detect compaction in three different <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> across a variable water gradient. Bulk density measurements were taken in late 2007 from plots traversing an induced soil moisture gradient, and low, medium, and high levels of compaction at three locations with different <b>soil</b> <b>textures.</b> A Veris Technologies (Salina, KS) Near-Infrared Spectrophotometer equipped with an Electrical Conductivity Surveyor 3150 was used to measure and geo-reference EC and NIR reflectance data over the same plots. Analysis of the data for a correlation between compaction (bulk density values) and EC, as well as compaction and NIR reflectance, produced clear results. It was found that electrical conductivity is not significantly different between compacted or uncompacted soils even when tested at all moisture extremes and in different <b>soil</b> <b>textures</b> in Utah. Also, NIR spectroscopy was unsuccessful at identifying subsoil compaction because all tested procedures to induce a spectrometer into the soil resulted in changes the physical properties of the soil...|$|R
