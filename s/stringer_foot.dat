40|$|Interlaminar {{fracture}} mechanics has proven useful for characterizing {{the onset of}} delaminations in composites and has been used with limited success primarily to investigate onset in fracture toughness specimens and laboratory size coupon type specimens. Future acceptance of the methodology by industry and certification authorities however, requires the successful demonstration of the methodology on structural level. For this purpose a panel was selected that is reinforced with stringers. Shear loading causes the panel to buckle and the resulting out-of-plane deformations initiate skin/stringer separation {{at the location of}} an embedded defect. For finite element analysis, the panel and surrounding load fixture were modeled with shell elements. A small section of the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot</b> and the panel {{in the vicinity of the}} embedded defect were modeled with a local 3 D solid model. Across the width of the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot</b> the mixed-mode strain energy release rates were calculated using the virtual crack closure technique. A failure index was calculated by correlating the results with the mixed-mode failure criterion of the graphite/epoxy material. For small applied loads the failure index is well below one across the entire width. With increasing load the failure index approaches one first near the edge of the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot</b> from which delamination is expected to grow. With increasing delamination lengths the buckling pattern of the panel changes and the failure index increases which suggests that rapid delamination growth from the initial defect is to be expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the buckling and postbuckling behavior of stringer reinforced fiber composite plates in theory and experiments. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the analysis of stringer peel-off mechanisms which may occur as a result of buckled skin fields. At the same time production defects were simulated and their effects as well as impact damage were studied. Calculations of the postbuckling condition used a geometrically nonlinear mixed finite element scheme (FiPPS) based on a generalized working principle in accordance with Hellinger-Reissner. Quantitative statements became possible with the introduction of a failure model on the basis of critical energy release rates. The critical values determined by means of simple specimen tests are independent of local stiffness discontinuities; their validity range rather covers all adhesive bonded joints produced from the material T 300 / 913 C using the one-shot process. As a result it was possible to numerically acquire a variety of variations with respect to the influence of local delaminations under the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot</b> as well as different laminate lay-ups of the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot.</b> The bottom line is that initial failure of the stringer-skin bonded joints occurs at a point quite far into the postbuckling range. Therefore, with proper stringer design, there is an initial possibility of utilizing the postbuckling range beyond the safe operating load of an aircraft for the static case.

40|$|A shear loaded, {{stringer}} reinforced {{composite panel}} is analyzed {{to evaluate the}} fidelity of computational fracture mechanics analyses of complex structures. Shear loading causes the panel to buckle. The resulting out -of-plane deformations initiate skin/stringer separation {{at the location of}} an embedded defect. The panel and surrounding load fixture were modeled with shell elements. A small section of the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot,</b> web and noodle as well as the panel skin near the delamination front were modeled with a local 3 D solid model. Across the width of the stringer fo to, the mixed-mode strain energy release rates were calculated using the virtual crack closure technique.

The objective was to study the effect of the fidelity of the local 3 D finite element model on the computed mixed-mode strain energy release rates and the failure index...|$|E
40|$|Elastic-plastic, large-deflection {{nonlinear}} thermo-mechanical stress {{analyses are}} performed for the Space Shuttle external tank s intertank stringers. Detailed threedimensional {{finite element models}} are developed and used to investigate the stringer s elastic-plastic response for different thermal and mechanical loading events from assembly through flight. Assembly strains caused by initial installation on an intertank panel are accounted for in the analyses. Thermal loading due to tanking {{was determined to be}} the bounding loading event. The cryogenic shrinkage caused by tanking resulted in a rotation of the intertank chord flange towards the center of the intertank, which in turn loaded the intertank <b>stringer</b> <b>feet.</b> The analyses suggest that the strain levels near the first three fasteners remain sufficiently high that a failure may occur. The analyses also confirmed that the installation of radius blocks on the <b>stringer</b> <b>feet</b> ends results in an increase in the stringer capability...|$|R

In contrast to previous versions it is possible in version 5. 0 to define strip-wise different skin properties for one panel. In that way, the skin stiffening effect of the <b>stringer</b> <b>feet</b> can be considered by adding the foot stiffness to the stiffness of the corresponding skin element. This approach was closer investigated and described in referenc...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the Lamb Wave {{propagation}} in a CFRP omega-stringer stiffened panel, specifically {{on the influence of}} the structural parameters. The structural influences have already been studied on other stiffened structures, although for different materials and geometries. For the actuation and sensing a network of bonded piezo ceramic transducer has been used and sealant tape has been applied on the structure surface in order to selectively damp travelling waves at that place. Comparing the wave packet amplitudes in the pristine state with the amplitudes after damping material application it is observable which wave packet shave been affected by the presence of damping material at a specific place, giving information about the wave paths. The selective application of damping material has been used to detect multiple wave path within the panel. By experimental means, A 0 -mode wave packet stravelling through the stringer head and interacting with the <b>stringer</b> <b>feet</b> have been identified. In the S 0 -mode dominated frequency range a S 0 -mode wave packet propagating through the stringer head has been detected. Additionally, another wave packet with a velocity corresponding toan A 0 -mode has been identified, indicating a mode conversion at the <b>stringer</b> <b>feet</b> edges...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} activities {{developed by}} the authors within the EC funded research program named FACE (Friendly Aircraft Cabin Environment) aimed at characterising some aeronautical composite structural components from the vibro-acoustic behaviour point of view. In this document will be also presented the overall analysis of a carbon resin primary fuselage structure from low to medium-high frequency range. Vibro-acoustic behaviour is simulated by means of numerical predictive methods. The modelling techniques are shown {{with reference to the}} simulation of dynamic behaviour of panels coupled with a fluid volume, in order to predict Transmission Loss properties. Particularly, the models and results have been referred to a typical aeronautical structure for fuselage: 4 bay fuselage side panel, made of skin, stringers and frames. The first test article consists in a composite panel that has been modeled numerically and tested in order to characterize its vibro-acoustic behaviour. It is a curved panel, global dimensions of 2. 2 m x 1. 5 m, where the skin is a pre-preg composite laminate, frames are Z-section pre-preg composite laminate and stringers are T-section braided tube with a pre-preg offset bulb. Numerical simulations have been carried on, in order to reproduce the vibrations and noise transmission: in low frequency range by means of Finite Element Method (FEM), and in medium-high frequency range by means of Statistical Energetic Analysis (SEA). For what concerning the FEM dynamic analysis the mesh size values of the elements are consistent with the maximum frequency chosen. According to the procedures described in the work, a FEM model has been built, having 9266 nodes and 14069 elements; the skin has been modeled with shell elements; the frames have been modeled with beam elements and stringers have been split, modeling the <b>stringer</b> <b>foot</b> with shell elements, web and bulb with beam elements. The MSC/NASTRAN has been used throughout the F. E. calculations of this article. The numerical modal analysis has been performed in [0 - 2000] Hz frequency range, considering panel as free-free suspended. For what concerning the SEA, the modelling approach employed has been a mixed “ribbed plate“ – “subsystem” approach. Source and receiving rooms have been modelled as acoustic cavities subsystems with one of the enclosing faces of each room corresponding with the panel area and geometry. Correlation between numerical and experimental modal analysis results has been used in order to validate numerical FEM models, while energetic parameters (mean square velocity) and modal density have been used for SEA models validation. Subsequently, model sensitivity has been analysed by varying some geometrical parameters critical from an acoustic point of view. Results confirm the theory at the basis of noise transmission and give some important information about the composite materials behavior used in primary structures in place of well known metallic materials. Final result of the work is the model of a fuselage section assembled by mixing many Graphite Fibres Reinforced Panels layups...|$|E
40|$|The {{first attempt}} to launch the STS- 133 Space Shuttle mission {{in the fall of}} 2010 was halted due to {{indications}} of a gaseous hydrogen leak at the External Tank ground umbilical carrier plate seal. Subsequent inspection of the external tank (figure 1) hardware and recorded video footage revealed that the foam insulation covering the forward end of the intertank near the liquid oxygen tank had cracked severely enough to have been cause for halting the launch attempt on its own (figure 2). An investigation into the cause of the insulation crack revealed that two adjacent hat-section sheet metal stringers (figure 3) had cracks up to nine inches long in the forward ends of the <b>stringer</b> flanges, or <b>feet,</b> near the fasteners that attach the stringer to the skin of the intertank (figure 4). A repair of those two stringers was implemented and the investigation effort widened to understand the root cause of the stringer cracks and to determine whether there was sufficient flight rationale to launch with the repairs and the other installed stringers...|$|R
