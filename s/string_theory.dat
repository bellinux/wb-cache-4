5|$|In 1990, Edward Witten {{introduced}} topological <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> {{a simplified}} version of <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> and physicists {{showed that there}} is a version of mirror symmetry for topological <b>string</b> <b>theory.</b> This statement about topological <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> is usually taken as the definition of mirror symmetry in the mathematical literature. In an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994, mathematician Maxim Kontsevich presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of mirror symmetry in topological <b>string</b> <b>theory.</b> Known as homological mirror symmetry, this conjecture formalizes mirror symmetry as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the Fukaya category of its mirror.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a non-perturbative formulation of <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> {{was one of the}} original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories which are equivalent to <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a definition of <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} bosonic <b>string</b> <b>theories,</b> RNS <b>string</b> <b>theories</b> and heterotic <b>string</b> <b>theories</b> on flat supermanifolds. For these <b>string</b> <b>theories,</b> we show cancellations of {{the central}} charges and modular invariance. Bosonic <b>string</b> <b>theories</b> on supermanifolds have dimensions (D_B,D_F) =(26, 0),(28, 2),(30, 4), [...] ., where D_B and D_F are the numbers of bosonic coordinates and fermionic coordinates, respectively. We show that in type II <b>string</b> <b>theories</b> the one loop vacuum amplitudes vanish. From this result, we can suggest the existence of supersymmetry on supermanifolds. As examples of the heterotic <b>string</b> <b>theories,</b> we construct those whose massless spectra are related to N= 1 supergravity theories and N= 1 super Yang-Mills theories with orthosymplectic supergroups on the bosonic flat 10 dimensional Minkowski space. Also, we construct D-branes on supermanifolds and compute tensions of the D-branes. We show {{that the number of}} fermionic coordinates contributes to the tensions of the D-branes as an inverse power of the contribution of bosonic coordinates. Moreover, we find some configurations of two D-branes which satisfy the BPS-like no-force conditions if ν_B - ν_F = 0, 4 and 8, where ν_B and ν_F are the numbers of Dirichlet-Neumann directions in the bosonic coordinates and in the fermionic coordinates, respectively.

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> called type IIA <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{feature of}} <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial dimensions, and one time dimension), while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial dimensions, and one time dimension). In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E
5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> and quantum chromodynamics, taking <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E

5|$|Quantum {{gravity is}} {{the branch of}} physics that seeks to {{describe}} gravity using the principles of quantum mechanics. Currently, the most popular approach to quantum gravity is <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings.

5|$|<b>String</b> <b>theory</b> is a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. <b>String</b> <b>theory</b> describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> and quantum gravity.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in <b>string</b> <b>theory.</b> In the A-model of topological <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in <b>string</b> <b>theory.</b> Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By outsourcing calculations to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|E
5|$|In physics, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> a simplified version of <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E

5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is <b>string</b> <b>theory,</b> a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory {{promises to be a}} unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|Speaking at the <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> {{conference at}} the University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in <b>string</b> <b>theory.</b> In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, <b>string</b> <b>theory</b> does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
