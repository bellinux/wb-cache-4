500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that I also like {{people to know that}} I don't currently and haven't in a long time." [...] Billboard reporter Carla Hay also noted, [...] "I don't think people who buy records are too concerned about the background of the video's director." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably <b>soft-focus</b> affair".

Barry Walters from The San Francisco Examiner praised the album as Madonna's most low-key album and her best work at the date. J.D. Considine, while writing his review for the album for The Baltimore Sun, declared that Bedtime Stories was more listener-friendly than Madonna's previous albums. He added that it [...] "seems remarkably close in spirit to the singer's first album, emphasizing dance grooves and pop melodies over genre exercises and conceptual statements", while praising Madonna's vocal performance. Linda L. Labin from the Bangor Daily News, noted that [...] " [...] isn't taking any chances. This time around, her daring {{has more to do with}} music than lyrics", while also praising her vocals; [...] "If anything, her singing is the album's greatest strength. Madonna uses every trick from her repertoire. [...] Bedtime Stories turns in some of the strongest performances of her career. 'Madonna sings well' — bet you don't see that headline in the tabloids anytime soon". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave it two-stars-and-a-half out of four, writing that the album [...] "seems the least remarkable of all Madonna's albums. But it's not necessarily the least of them. [...] It has a nice, consistently relaxed feel, its slow jams hip-hop-inflected but not as self-consciously as last time".|$|E

50|$|In his retirement, he {{continued}} his preservationist activities. His discovery of a plastic plate, Fiberloid, as a matrix for printmaking suited his <b>soft-focused</b> street scenes. Within five years he executed 115 etchings, which were then printed by his brother, Ellsworth. In 1938, he published French Quarter Etchings, reproducing fifty-four architectural views with annotations regarding history, renovation, and destruction of the structures. Many of his paintings, drawings, and etchings record historic landmarks that were no longer standing {{at the time of}} the publication. Another of Woodward's legacies comes through the 1964 posthumous publication of a small guide book, Early Views of the Vieux Carré A Guide to the French Quarter, which illustrates thirty-three of his architectural drawings and etchings.

40|$|Abstract—Materials that exhibit {{negative}} refraction {{may have}} many novel applications. We seek {{to evaluate the}} possibility of <b>soft-focusing</b> of microwave signals using a medium with an indefinite (hyperbolic) anisotropic permittivity tensor. We fabricated a 147 mm thick and 220 mm wide Styrofoam sample with an embedded array of 12 -gauge brass wires of 6. 35 mm lattice spacing. Two single-loop antennas were used to approximately generate a transverse magnetic (TM) point source and the associated detector. Using an Agilent 8510 C Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), the frequency spectrum was scanned between 7 and 9 GHz. Relative gain or loss measurements were taken at equal spatial steps behind the sample. A scanning robot was used for automatic scanning in the x, y, and z directions, {{in order to establish}} the focusing patterns. The signal amplitudes measured in the presence and absence of the sample were compared. The robot was controlled using LabVIEW†, which also collected the data from the VNA and passed it to MATLAB ‡ for processing. A soft focusing spot was observed when the antennas were placed in two different symmetric configurations with respect to the sample. These results suggest a method for focusing electromagnetic waves using negative refraction in indefinite (hyperbolic) anisotropic materials. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{broadening}} {{application range}} has {{increased demand for}} advanced RF control. Recent research has identified several metamaterials to provide this control. This work seeks to expand this idea through several novel metamaterials with enhanced electromagnetic properties. First copper wires braided with Kevlar and nylon to form conductive coils are woven among structural fiber to create a fabric. This yielded a composite with all coils possessing the same handedness, producing a chiral material. The measured scattering parameters showed considerable chirality within the 5. 5 - 8 GHz frequency band, agreeing with simulation results. Electronic chirality tuning is investigated by integrating varactor diodes into an array of helical elements on a printed circuit board. Applying a varied reverse bias voltage across the sample effectively tunes the chiral behavior of the material. The measurements demonstrate the feasibility of creating a rigid helix composite with tuned chirality in the 5. 5 - 12. 4 GHz frequency band. Chirality can be further tuned mechanically through the deformation of an array of conductive coils. Parallel, metallic helices embedded in a polyurethane matrix are subjected to mechanical stretching for pitch adjustment. This change in pitch directly affects the overall chirality of the composite. Repeatable elastic deformation is achieved up to 50 % axial strain. Over the 5. 5 - 12. 5 GHz frequency range, an increase of 30 % axial strain yields an ~ 18 % change in axial chirality. Hyperbolic microwave focusing is explored through an indefinite medium with anisotropic permittivity. An array of 12 -gauge brass wires is embedded in Styrofoam and scanned over the 7 - 9 GHz frequency band to establish focusing patterns. A <b>soft-focusing</b> spot is observed at 7. 6 GHz with a relative gain of ~ 7 dB over averaged background. Applying an axial refractive gradient to a coil composite creates a lens capable of fine adjustment in the microwave range. The gradient required to achieve sharp focusing, {{and the extent of}} this effect, is calculated through an anisotropic ray-tracing analysis. A composite is created using coils of opposite handedness to minimize chiral effects. Through extension of these coils, the refractive index can effectively be fine-tuned to achieve the desired result. Measurements and full-wave simulations confirm a gain of 6 - 8 dB over averaged background at the predicted focal frequencie...|$|R
