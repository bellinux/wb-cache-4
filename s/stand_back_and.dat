5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let him reduce their power.|$|E
25|$|The {{two-level}} approach involves {{engaging in}} critical reasoning and considering {{all the possible}} ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one {{is not in a}} position to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reason on a more critical level.|$|E
25|$|I {{arranged}} the pieces haphazardly in that space. I {{wanted to create}} an environment where one just moved from piece to piece without having the chance to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> think about the piece as a real object. I wanted to eliminate all that.|$|E

25|$|After the {{massacre}} in the church, Ahmet Aga summoned all the surviving villagers outside, {{saying that it}} would be {{in order to make a}} list of the slain and the widows. The better part of the survivors gathered, since those who did not obey would be killed. They were divided in two groups of women and men; then the Ottoman commander made the women <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> slew all the remaining 300 men. Those women who protested were also raped and killed. On the same day there were another 300 people murdered on the wooden bridge beside the school, first their arms were cut off, then their ears, noses, shoulders, and only after that they were finished.|$|E

However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unawares in his residence at Thurso.

500|$|Velázquez's {{portraits of}} the royal family {{themselves}} had until then been straightforward, if often unflatteringly direct and highly complex in expression. On the other hand, his royal portraits, designed to be seen across vast palace rooms, feature more strongly than his other works the bravura handling for which he is famous: [...] "Velázquez's handling of paint is exceptionally free, and as one approaches Las Meninas there is a point at which the figures suddenly dissolve into smears and blobs of paint. The long-handled brushes he used enabled him to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> judge the total effect." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the door}} was opened by a very old woman, who <b>stood</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> beckoned them to enter. 'Whence do you come, and whither do you go?' said she.|$|R
60|$|They had, by this time, {{arrived at}} the {{entrance}} of the king's tent. The two sentries on duty there <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> saluted, as the earl entered, followed by Oswald.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> looked at me.|$|R
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2007 Republican debate, Romney {{was asked}} about [...] "the use of {{tactical}} nuclear weapons" [...] to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb and responded that [...] "You don't take options off the table, but {{what you do is}} <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say, 'What's going on here?' [...] You see what's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iran." [...] In 2007 he also ...|$|E
2500|$|Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "Sometimes hilarious quizzes {{summarizing}} the main points of each chapter demonstrate Trump's audacity, itinerant poor judgment {{and the kind}} of hubris one can only <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch with astonishment and a sort of clandestine admiration. O'Brien chronicles Trump's rise, fall and rise again from both public favor and the Forbes rich list, and deftly balances irreverence and respect for his subject. [...] O'Brien's reportorial style, peppered with wit and irony, is the perfect base to Trump's acidic persona; he is the straight man to this contemporary P.T. Barnum." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled at}} me through her tears. The light of heaven was in that smile, and I have dreamed of it even since age has crept upon me. Truly, God sets his own mark on the pure in heart, on the unselfish.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Trelawny {{leaned over}} and touched the linen robe. He lifted a fold at the neck, and I knew from the quick intake of his breath that {{something}} had surprised him. He lifted yet a little more; and then he, too, <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> pointed, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Two men in {{sackcloth}} aprons {{were considering}} an untrimmed hedge that {{ran down the}} hillside and disappeared into mist beside those roarings. They <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> took stock of the neglected growth, tapped an elbow of hedge-oak here, a mossed beech-stub there, swayed a stooled ash <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth, and looked at each other.|$|R
2500|$|Education {{is often}} {{depicted}} cynically in Petals of Blood. Munira is a teacher, but lacks strong abilities to guide his pupils, instead preferring to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> not to assert {{any of his}} own beliefs. He rejects the claims of others that the children should be taught more about being African, instead preferring that they be taught politics, and things which are [...] "fact". Two of the three [...] "betrayers of the people", those who are ultimately murdered, are also educators; they are untrustworthy, and depict the education system as a [...] "problematic institution" [...] in independent Kenya.|$|E
2500|$|At one point, the {{officers}} {{told the crowd}} to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> threatened to tase anyone who approached too closely. A female student said that {{the officers}} threatened to tase her when she asked an officer for his name and badge number. According to an ACLU attorney, such a threat of force {{in response to a}} badge number request constitutes illegal assault. At 6:36 in the video, an officer tells a male student, [...] "Get back over there or you’re going to get tased, too." [...] The student, wearing a white t-shirt in the video, can be seen [...] "using intense body language" [...] and [...] "talking heatedly and with raised [...] " [...] prior to being confronted. The officer first tells the student to [...] "back up" [...] before threatening tasing.|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by David Arnold, {{played by the}} Sinfonia of London and conducted by Nicholas Dodd. It was the second motion picture Arnold had composed and the first major motion picture. At the time of production, Arnold had recently started {{to work in a}} local video store in London. Once hired, he spent several months in a hotel room working on the soundtrack, spending more time rewriting the music and improving it as delays were being created due to film companies trying to get the rights to distribution. According to Arnold [...] "when I first read the script for StarGate, I knew what approach to take, which was to be as big and bold as possible," [...] he kept on saying: [...] "Every time there was an amazing sight, the characters would <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Oh my God!' But James would just smile and walk towards it. That was the basis for the Stargate score, moving forward with a sense of majesty instead of being frightened by what's around the corner." ...|$|E

6000|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> laughed. [...] "If {{there are}} any more of his brothel-mates in the house, they can escape as he did. They will be more {{fortunate}} than that one." [...] And he pointed up to the limp figure hanging from the balcony, so that I now learnt what already I have told you.|$|R
60|$|I {{said not}} a word, {{hoping that the}} unlooked-for sight of Owen would break down her resolution. I just held out my hand to her, and led her downstairs. She clung to me and her hands were as cold as snow. When I opened the parlor door I <b>stood</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> pushed her in before me.|$|R
2500|$|Thomas then faints, and {{the male}} zoogoers argue with their wives about how to revive him. Carboy, {{explaining}} {{that he is a}} physician, asks the crowd to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> steps in to help. After making a quick examination, he writes a prescription, which Eliza takes to be filled. Thomas now revives briefly, and before passing out again, makes a delirious comment that implies that he is of noble birth. Carboy unfastens his patient's jacket, and the crowd are shocked to find that Thomas is a Knight of the Garter. Thomas revives, {{and it turns out that}} he is the Duke of Islington (a joke reference, since Islington was then a working-class Cockney neighbourhood). He had disguised himself as a commoner so that he could search for a humble, virtuous wife without revealing his true rank. [...] Now that his secret is discovered, Thomas makes a garbled but well-received speech and, taking the perceptive crowd's advice, resolves to propose marriage to Eliza as soon as he can change into his [...] "native guise." [...] He exits.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, {{during a}} Clannad tour of Switzerland, Nicky {{called for a}} band meeting as several issues had arisen and felt {{they needed to be}} addressed. He added, [...] "It was short and only {{required}} a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say nothing". Enya chose to leave to pursue a solo career with the Ryans, which initially caused some friction between the three and her family but she preferred being independent and disliked being confined in the group as [...] "somebody in the background". Nicky then suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore [...] "with no particular definite future", or live with him and Roma in their home, then located in the northern Dublin suburb of Artane, [...] "and see what happens, musically". After their bank denied them a loan, Enya sold her saxophone and gave piano lessons and the Ryans used what they could afford from their savings to build a recording facility named Aigle Studio, named after the French word for [...] "eagle", in a shed in their back garden, and rented it out to other artists to cover its costs. They formed a musical partnership in the process with Nicky as Enya's producer and arranger and Roma her lyricist, and became directors of their music company, Aigle Music. In the following two years, Enya developed her playing and composing by recording herself recite classical pieces on the piano and listening back to them. The process was repeated until she started to improvise sections and develop her own piano arrangements. Her first composition was [...] "An Taibhse Uaighneach", Gaelic for [...] "The Lonely Ghost". During this time, Enya played the synthesiser on Ceol Aduaidh (1983) by Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh and Frankie Kennedy and performed with the duo and Mhaonaigh's brother Gearóid in their short lived group, Ragairne.|$|E

Natty old chips, shrewd portly fellows, Jews, trainers {{looking as if}} they had never been guilty of seeing a horse in their lives; tall, flapping, languid women, or brisk, loud-voiced women; young men with an air as if trying to take it seriously--two or three of them with only one arm! ...|$|R
60|$|Cap'n Bill knew {{he could}} not kill the Kalidah, for no living thing in Oz can be killed, so he <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watched the beast wriggle and growl and paw the earth with its sharp claws, and then, {{satisfied}} it could not escape, he told Trot {{to come out of}} the water again and dry her wet shoes and stockings in the sun.|$|R

50|$|Sacco {{combines}} the oral histories of his interviewees {{with his own}} observations on conditions in the enclave {{as well as his}} feelings about being in a danger zone. He keeps his primary focus on roughly half a dozen people, which helps to structure the collection of vignettes into something of a narrative, while also including interviews with a number of other people. Sacco <b>stands</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> lets the interviewees tell their stories, keeping his editorializing and personal reflections to interludes.|$|R
