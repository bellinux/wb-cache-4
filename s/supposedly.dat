5|$|Arms were {{attributed}} to important pre-heraldic kings. Among the best known are those assigned to the King of the Franks, who was given three toads. The three fleurs-de-lis of France <b>supposedly</b> derive from these (Neubecker, 225).|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which <b>supposedly</b> had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by seaborgium) for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals <b>supposedly</b> containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium. His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|Magnum XL-200 {{has been}} the target of false rumors since 1998 {{claiming}} the structure was sinking due to unstable ground. The rumors <b>supposedly</b> started as an April Fools Day joke in an Ohio newspaper, but quickly spread via the Internet. Cedar Point quickly denounced such rumors.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was <b>supposedly</b> from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots <b>supposedly</b> from Guadeloupe, is now thought to have been based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E

5|$|Moravec's paradox: Proving theorems {{and solving}} {{geometry}} problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a <b>supposedly</b> simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. This {{helps explain why}} research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Mullah Tor Jan, Musa Qala area commander, <b>supposedly</b> {{killed in}} an airstrike. His actual {{whereabouts}} remain unknown, as he was again reported {{killed in an}} engagement with Afghan and Coalition forces on March 13, 2008.|$|E

Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and <b>supposedly</b> uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, the match did not happen because Hogan changed his mind, as he was <b>supposedly</b> {{not happy with the}} planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E
5|$|According to {{internal}} White House and Commission documents posted in February 2016 by the National Security Archive at The George Washington University, the Gerald Ford White House significantly altered {{the final report}} of the <b>supposedly</b> independent 1975 Rockefeller Commission investigating CIA domestic activities, {{over the objections of}} senior Commission staff.

The supposed target of Ironside was {{the mouth of the}} Gironde estuary, with a landing site at Royan.|$|E
5|$|After the hearing, Jones {{allegedly}} spat in {{the face}} of his son's attorney, Carol Powell-Lexing, and <b>supposedly</b> pushed her to the floor. Jones denied assaulting Powell-Lexing, saying he would never get into a physical fight with a woman. Jones was charged with assault. Despite the alleged assault, Powell-Lexing continued as part of Bell's defense team.|$|E
5|$|Although Old Jock {{has already}} changed hands on several occasions, {{prior to the}} Crystal Palace Show of 1870 he was sold from Mr. W. Cropper to Mr. J.H. Murchinson for the sum of around £60, which was <b>supposedly</b> the dog's weight in silver. It was in Murchinson's {{possession}} that Jock died in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was <b>supposedly</b> supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
