5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable {{until the end of}} the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} fraying social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fiancé {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E

5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|She reports {{her brother}} Jake after she {{witnessed}} {{him trying to}} rape Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox). Steph told Max that he and Tom were now her family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E
5|$|Some of Garrison's staff {{begin to}} doubt his motives and {{disagree}} with his methods, {{and leave the}} investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) complains that he is spending {{more time on the}} case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.|$|E

5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline {{involving}} Ric Flair, Michaels faced Flair in a Career Threatening {{match at}} WrestleMania XXIV, in which he won by performing Sweet Chin Music and thus ending Flair's career. Afterwards, Batista confronted Michaels about his actions at WrestleMania, calling him <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> egotistical. The two faced off at Backlash with Chris Jericho as the guest referee. Michaels won after faking a knee injury and performing Sweet Chin Music. Jericho then confronted Michaels on this matter, in which Michaels admitted to faking the injury in order to defeat Batista. Michaels then defeated Jericho at Judgment Day. At One Night Stand, Michaels lost to Batista in a stretcher match, thus ending their feud. On the June 9 episode of Raw, Michaels was attacked by Chris Jericho during his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, being thrown directly through a television screen. The following week, it was revealed that, {{within the context of}} the storyline, Michaels had suffered a detached retina. At The Great American Bash, a match between Michaels and Jericho was scheduled, in which Jericho assaulted Michaels' eye, which caused Jericho to win by referee stoppage.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{landing on}} the Island, she decides to join Sayid on a hike to {{transmit}} a distress signal, after she and Boone have an argument about her selfishness. When they discover a French looped signal already being transmitted, Shannon's knowledge of the language is used to translate it. Later, Shannon has an asthma attack, but her inhalers are nowhere to be found. Sun (Yunjin Kim) cures her, by using eucalyptus plants to help her breathing. Because of her <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> manipulative behavior, Boone brands Shannon useless. Sayid enlists her to help translate the maps belonging to the French woman who made the radio transmission, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). Shannon and Sayid soon form a romantic relationship. After returning from a romantic night along the beach with Sayid, she learns Boone has died after falling from a great height. At his funeral, Shannon does not speak, but allows Sayid to talk instead. Shannon holds Locke (Terry O'Quinn) responsible for Boone's death, and asks Sayid to take action. When he refuses, she steals {{the key to the}} gun case from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and holds Locke at gunpoint in the jungle. When Rousseau arrives on the beach one morning to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival, Shannon prepares to migrate to the caves {{with the rest of the}} group. Before leaving on the raft the survivors have built, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) gives Shannon guardianship of his dog, Vincent, as a means to help her recover from her loss.|$|E

25|$|He {{is famous}} for his uncompromising stance against {{corruption}} among the government officials at the time. He upheld justice and refused to yield to higher powers including the Emperor's Father-in-Law (國丈), who was also appointed as the Grand Tutor (太師) and was known as Grand Tutor Pang (龐太師). He treated Bao as an enemy. Although Grand Tutor Pang is often depicted in myth as an archetypical villain (arrogant, <b>selfish,</b> <b>and</b> cruel), the historical reasons for his bitter rivalry with Bao remain unclear.|$|E
25|$|Poodles are {{commonly}} known as extensively groomed show dogs and companions with a distinctive clip, {{to such a degree that}} poodles in short pet clips often go unrecognised or mistaken as Poodle crosses ("Doodles"). This association of the breed's appearance and the resulting preconceptions is strong, and reflects in popular culture, where poodles most often are depicted as spoiled and perhaps obnoxious pets, or if anthropomorphic, snobby, <b>selfish,</b> <b>and</b> vain. Poodle owners are perceived stereotypically as fussy, frivolous, and impractical.|$|E

It gives each player a goal that is both <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> team-oriented: play in Busch Stadium twice in one year. The one-game finale also grants the league definitive closure.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|Part two (Chapters 16 to 44) {{is taken}} from Helen's diaries, in which she {{describes}} her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon. The handsome, witty Huntingdon is also spoilt, <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> self-indulgent.

Helen, blinded by love, marries him, and resolves to reform him with gentle persuasion and good example.

Both girls are <b>selfish</b> <b>and</b> sometimes unpleasant, and although Agnes's position is slightly {{better than it was}} at Wellwood house, she is frequently ignored or used in the girls' schemes.|$|E
