40|$|Aurora B kinase {{is a key}} {{component}} of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which regulates chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. An ortholog of Aurora B was characterized in Trypanosoma brucei (TbAUK 1), but other conserved components of the complex have not been found. Here we identified four novel TbAUK 1 associated proteins by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Among these four proteins, TbKIN-A and TbKIN-B are novel kinesin homologs, whereas TbCPC 1 and TbCPC 2 are hypothetical proteins without any sequence similarity to those known CPC components from yeasts and metazoans. RNAi-mediated silencing of each of the four genes led to loss of spindle assembly, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. TbKIN-A localizes to the mitotic spindle and TbKIN-B to the spindle midzone during mitosis, whereas TbCPC 1, TbCPC 2 and TbAUK 1 display the dynamic localization pattern of a CPC. After mitosis, the CPC disappears from the central spindle and re-localizes at a dorsal mid-point of the mother cell, where the anterior tip of the daughter cell is tethered, to <b>start</b> <b>cell</b> division toward the posterior end, indicating a most unusual CPC-initiate...|$|E
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{it has long}} been thought that cells must reach a {{critical}} cell size, called the “setpoint,” in order to allow the <b>Start</b> <b>cell</b> cycle transition. Recent evidence suggests that this setpoint is lowered when ribosome biogenesis is slowed. Here we present evidence that yeast can sense ribosome biogenesis independently of mature ribosome levels and protein synthetic capacity. Our results suggest that ribosome biogenesis directly promotes passage through Start through Whi 5, the yeast functional equivalent to the human tumor suppressor Rb. When ribosome biogenesis is inhibited, a Whi 5 -dependent mechanism inhibits passage through Start before significant decreases in both the number of ribosomes and in overall translation capacity of the cell become evident. This delay at Start in response to decreases in ribosome biogenesis occurs independently of Cln 3, the major known Whi 5 antagonist. Thus ribosome biogenesis may be sensed at multiple steps in Start regulation. Ribosome biogenesis may thus both delay Start by increasing the cell size setpoint and independently may promote Start by inactivating Whi 5...|$|E
40|$|In WCDMA 3 rd Generation (3 G) systems {{although}} {{there is no need for}} frequency planning as the case with second generation (2 G) systems, the limitation of both capacity and coverage by the interference level in the system rendered the planning task for 3 G systems far more complex than 2 G systems. As the 3 G radio networks now more sensitive to radio environment and traffic conditions, the advantage of dropping frequency planning could be cumbersome due to difficulties linked to what is called Cell-Breathing Phenomenon (CBP). In this work we propose a Dynamic WCDMA system that adjusts the spreading factor adaptively to overcome this problem. The simulation design will have the output of mapping the network load in terms of the number of users to the E b/N 0 required; this will give the network controller an idea about the number and type of users that may cause coverage to shrink i. e. <b>start</b> <b>cell</b> breathing.

40|$|Reversible {{performance}} loss {{induced by}} sequential failed cold start of PEM fuel cellsThis study correlates the post <b>start</b> <b>cell</b> performance and impedance {{with the cold}} start process in the subzero environment. The sequential failed cold starts are deliberately conducted {{as well as the}} start at small current density. Here the failed cold start means the cell voltage drops to or below zero within very short time during the start process. It is found that there are reversible performance losses for the sequential failed cold starts, while not obvious degradation and no recovery happen for the start at small current density. Using the thin film and agglomerate model, it is confirmed that {{this is due to the}} water blocking effect. Comparing the results from different start processes, a model with respect to the shifting of reactive region within the catalyst layer is applied to explain that the reversible performance loss is associated with the amount of the generated water or ice and the water location or distribution during cold start. The relationship of the cold start performance at high current density and the pore volume in the catalyst layer is also discussed. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{algorithm}} for automatic detection and suppression of Forest fires is proposed. The algorithm is implemented using parallel distributed model of neural network with three activation functions {{to determine the}} next consecutive moves to the cells for the actor. The algorithm uses reinforcement learning with weights determined dynamically in each iteration. The Entire forest is decomposed into grid of square cells with initial position of the Actor {{is assumed to be}} the cell 1 and the goal cell is the cell where the fire has occurred. The neural network model uses starting cell, goal cell and number of cells in each row or column and three activation functions to determine the next consecutive cells in which the robot has to travel. It uses only three movements LEFT, DIAGONAL and UP to reach the target cell. After calculating next cell, the check will be made for presence of obstacles in that cell. If there is any obstacle in that cell, then one cell from other two cells obtained using other two movements, which is free from obstacle will be chosen for next move. Then the cell number is stored in memory. This process is repeated till the next cell computed is same as the goal cell. The Actor will begin to move from <b>start</b> <b>cell</b> and reach the goal cell using the cell numbers available in the memory to extinguish Forest fire. This algorithm is designed keeping in mind only static obstacles and hence it works well for Forest environment with static obstacles. Computer simulation results show that path has been found successfully without collision with obstacles...|$|E
50|$|Pawns move {{straight}} forward and capture obliquely forward to an adjacent cell (shown as crosses in the diagram); the pawn's capturing move direction is not diagonal like the bishop's move, {{as is the}} case in standard chess. All pawns can make a double step from their <b>starting</b> <b>cells.</b> If a pawn captures from its <b>starting</b> <b>cell</b> in such a way that it then occupies a <b>starting</b> <b>cell</b> of another pawn, it can still make a double move. For example, if the pawn on e4 were to capture a black piece on f5, the pawn retains the option to move to f7. The white pawn in the middle file (cell f5) cannot make a double step in the initial setup, since the target cell is occupied (a black pawn is on f7), but the double-step move could be made later when the cell is empty. En passant captures are also possible: for example, if the black pawn on c7 in the diagram moves to c5 in a single move, the white pawn on b5 can capture it: bxc6. Pawns promote on the last cell of a file; white pawns promote on the cells in the diagram marked with stars.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective One of {{the main}} open {{questions}} in chondrocyte transplantation is {{the fate of the}} implanted cells in vivo. We intended to establish prerequisites for such studies in animal models and to show the feasibility of this approach in rabbits. Isolated articular chondrocytes were retrovirally marked using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a cell-specific marker in order to allow an in vivo follow-up of these cells. Methods Chondrocytes from rabbits, sheep, cattle and humans were isolated and infected with murine leukemia virus-derived retroviruses carrying the GFP gene. The influence of the host range of three packaging cell lines (PA 317, PT 67, PG 13), <b>start</b> <b>cell</b> concentrations, number of cell passages and number of infection cycles on the efficiency of infection was investigated. Stability of GFP expression was followed by FACS analysis, confocal imaging and fluorescence microscopy. For in vivo follow-up of GFP expression we used marked allogeneic chondrocyte populations grown on scaffold material and implanted them into full-thickness defects in knee joints of rabbits. ResultsRetroviruses from all three packaging cell lines were able to infect rabbit and human chondrocytes, whereas only retroviruses released from PG 13 cells were able to infect sheep and bovine chondrocytes efficiently. Optimization of the infection with these viruses resulted in efficiencies of 60 – 90 % GFP-expressing chondrocytes. Populations of 100 % marked chondrocytes were obtained by cell sorting. GFP expression stability of such marked chondrocyte populations was followed in monolayer culture and in 3 -D culture on different scaffold materials. The expression of GFP was stable on all tested materials for at least 4 weeks. In monolayer culture GFP expression was stable for more than 8 months. In vivo, we observed stable GFP expression in the transplants during a four-week time course. Conclusion Retroviral GFP gene transfer led to long-term expression in chondrocytes from rabbits, sheep, cattle and humans. Transgene expression and the number of implanted chondrocytes remain stable for at least 4 weeks in vivo. This method permits a rapid monitoring of chondrocytes and provides a basis for following the fate of these cells in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Active {{magnetic}} resonance imaging implants, for example stents, stent grafts or vena cava filters, are constructed as wireless inductively coupled transmit and receive coils. They are built as a resonator tuned to the Larmor frequency of a {{magnetic resonance}} system. The resonator {{can be added to}} or incorporated within the implant. This technology can counteract the shielding caused by eddy currents inside the metallic implant structure. This may allow getting diagnostic information of the implant lumen (in stent stenosis or thrombosis for example). The electro magnetic rf-pulses during {{magnetic resonance imaging}} induce a current in the circuit path of the resonator. A by material fatigue provoked partial rupture of the circuit path or a broken wire with touching surfaces can set up a relatively high resistance on a very short distance, which may behave as a point-like power source, a hot spot, inside the body part the resonator is implanted to. This local power loss inside a small volume can reach ¼ of the total power loss of the intact resonating circuit, which itself is proportional to the product of the resonator volume and the quality factor and depends as well from the orientation of the resonator with respect to the main magnetic field and the imaging sequence the resonator is exposed to. Methods First an analytical solution of a hot spot for thermal equilibrium is described. This analytical solution with a definite hot spot power loss represents the worst case scenario for thermal equilibrium inside a homogeneous medium without cooling effects. Starting with this worst case assumptions additional conditions are considered in a numerical simulation, which are more realistic and may make the results less critical. The analytical solution as well as the numerical simulations use the experimental experience of the maximum hot spot power loss of implanted resonators with a definite volume during magnetic resonance imaging investigations. The finite volume analysis calculates the time developing temperature maps for the model of a broken linear metallic wire embedded in tissue. Half of the total hot spot power loss is assumed to diffuse into both wire parts at the location of a defect. The energy is distributed from there by heat conduction. Additionally the effect of blood perfusion and blood flow is respected in some simulations because the simultaneous appearance of all worst case conditions, especially the absence of blood perfusion and blood flow near the hot spot, is very unlikely for vessel implants. Results The analytical solution as worst case scenario as well as the finite volume analysis for near worst case situations show not negligible volumes with critical temperature increases for part of the modeled hot spot situations. MR investigations with a high rf-pulse density lasting below a minute can establish volumes of several cubic millimeters with temperature increases high enough to <b>start</b> <b>cell</b> destruction. Longer exposure times can involve volumes larger than 100 mm 3. Even temperature increases in the range of thermal ablation are reached for substantial volumes. MR sequence exposure time and hot spot power loss are the primary factors influencing the volume with critical temperature increases. Wire radius, wire material as well as the physiological parameters blood perfusion and blood flow inside larger vessels reduce the volume with critical temperature increases, but do not exclude a volume with critical tissue heating for resonators with a large product of resonator volume and quality factor. Conclusion The worst case scenario assumes thermal equilibrium for a hot spot embedded in homogeneous tissue without any cooling due to blood perfusion or flow. The finite volume analysis can calculate the results for near and not close to worst case conditions. For both cases a substantial volume can reach a critical temperature increase in a short time. The analytical solution, as absolute worst case, points out that resonators with a small product of inductance volume and quality factor (Q V ind 3) are definitely save. Stents for coronary vessels or resonators used as tracking devices for interventional procedures therefore have no risk of high temperature increases. The finite volume analysis shows for sure that also conditions not close to the worst case reach physiologically critical temperature increases for implants with a large product of inductance volume and quality factor (Q V ind > 10 cm 3). Such resonators exclude patients from exactly the MRI investigation these devices are made for. </p...|$|E

40|$|To measure cell-to-cell {{variation}} in protein-mediated functions — {{a hallmark of}} biological processes — we developed an approach to conduct ~ 103 concurrent single-cell western blots (scWesterns) in ~ 4 hours. A microscope slide supporting a 30 µm-thick photoactive polyacrylamide gel enables western blotting comprised of: settling of single cells into microwells, lysis in situ, gel electrophoresis, photoinitiated blotting to immobilize proteins, and antibody probing. We apply this scWestern to monitor single rat neural stem cell differentiation and responses to mitogen stimulation.
