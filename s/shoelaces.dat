5|$|On September 5, 2009, in Michigan's {{season opener}} against Western Michigan, Robinson scored a {{touchdown}} {{on his first}} collegiate (fumbled) snap. As the ESPN television broadcast focused on his untied <b>shoelaces,</b> Robinson took the snap in the shotgun formation, ran to the right, broke a tackle at the 40-yard line, then cut left and ran 43 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Traditional <b>shoelaces</b> {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other {{materials}} used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern <b>shoelaces</b> often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic <b>shoelaces</b> generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in safety boots for firefighters.|$|E

50|$|Deubré is {{a generic}} term, {{originating}} at Nike, Inc., for an ornamental <b>shoelace</b> tag. Typically, a deubré {{will have two}} holes through which a <b>shoelace</b> is threaded, like a bead on string. When the shoe is laced, the deubré is centered between the first two eyelets (closest to the toe), with the <b>shoelace</b> passing through and behind the deubré. A deubré is typically made of metal, plastic, or leather, and may be decorated with a logo or text. It is distinguished from a bead {{in that it is}} non-tubular; it has two points of entry/exit for the <b>shoelace,</b> as a belt or webbing may pass through a buckle. One could argue a deubré is functional in that once threaded to the midpoint of a <b>shoelace,</b> it assists in centering the <b>shoelace</b> in the shoe, though not all deubré and <b>shoelace</b> combinations necessarily will provide enough friction to hold the deubré in place while lacing.|$|R
25|$|When {{tying the}} half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot {{followed}} by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or reef knot, a fairly effective knot {{for the purpose of}} tying <b>shoelaces.</b> However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. Most people who use it will find themselves regularly retying their <b>shoelaces.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Shoelaces</b> can be coated, {{either in}} the factory or with {{aftermarket}} products, to increase friction and help them stay tied.|$|E
500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are pretty fast, I just think Vick's older; he's not really that fast like how <b>Shoelace</b> is. I think <b>Shoelace</b> is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's pretty fast still. I think <b>Shoelace</b> might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|R

25|$|The medial is {{the part}} of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry, and the lateral is on the {{opposite}} side, away from their center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the outsole or the vamp. Most shoes have <b>shoelaces</b> on the upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet. In 1968, Puma SE introduced the first pair of sneakers with Velcro straps in lieu of <b>shoelaces,</b> and these became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the elderly.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the process}} of running the <b>shoelaces</b> through the holes, eyelets, loops, or hooks to hold {{together}} the sides of the shoe with many common lacing methods. There are, in fact, almost two trillion ways to lace a shoe with six pairs of eyelets.|$|E

The scenes depicted are not distinctively Thracian, but certain elements of composition, decorative motifs, and illustrated items (such as the <b>shoelaces</b> on the antlered figure) identify it as Thracian work.|$|E

25|$|As for <b>shoelaces</b> in {{the sense}} that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has {{documented}} examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, 1993, José Ernesto Medellín (an 18-year-old Mexican citizen) {{and several}} other gang members participated {{in the murder of}} Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña, when they raped a 14-year-old and 16-year-old girl for an hour in Houston, Texas. Both girls were killed to prevent them from {{identifying}} their assailants. Medellín strangled one of the girls with her own <b>shoelaces.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Shoelaces</b> are {{typically}} tied {{off at the}} top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one on top of the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E

25|$|The Saga of Eric the Red further relates {{that around}} her neck she wore a {{necklace}} of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of amadou from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the <b>shoelaces</b> had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.|$|E
25|$|By {{knowing what}} {{developmental}} stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can {{be tailored to}} helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully. If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying <b>shoelaces),</b> giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.|$|E
25|$|Kane {{struggled}} with severe depression {{for many years}} and was twice voluntarily admitted to the Maudsley Hospital in London. However, she wrote consistently, if slowly, throughout her adult life. For a year she was writer-in-residence for Paines Plough, a theatre company promoting new writing, where she actively encouraged other writers. Before that, she had worked briefly as literary associate for the Bush Theatre, London. Kane died in 1999, when, two days after taking an overdose of prescription drugs, she committed suicide by hanging herself by her <b>shoelaces</b> in a bathroom at London's King's College Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Knot {{theory is}} the study of {{mathematical}} knots. While inspired by knots that appear in daily life in <b>shoelaces</b> and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In precise mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3. Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shoelaces,</b> {{also called}} shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system {{commonly}} used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist {{of a pair of}} strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks {{on either side of the}} shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.|$|E

And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing {{compared}} to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
