25|$|Although Xeris {{spectrum}} {{does not}} have any symbiotic fungi, it often takes advantage of the fungal symbionts of other <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> species. A study of the reproductive strategies of Xeris spectrum showed that the females often lay their eggs on wood where other <b>wood</b> <b>wasps</b> of species with symbiotic fungi have already laid their eggs. This allows the Xeris spectrum larvae to benefit from the fungi. In addition, adult Xeris spectrum emerge from their holes at two different times: one group emerges in summer with the species of other <b>wood</b> <b>wasps,</b> while the other group emerges the next spring.|$|R

It has the remarkable behavior of ovipositing only in recently burnt incense-cedar (Calocedrus), red cedar (Thuja) or juniper (Juniperus); the wood is often still smoldering when the wasp is laying its eggs, and the larvae develop in the wood. It occurs from the mountains of central California to southern British Columbia, but is very rarely seen, except by firefighters.|$|R

A low mass and low power system, like an insect, capable of drilling into wood is of the highest interest for planetary drilling and terrestrial drilling alike.

Over the three or four years I got a pretty complete record of the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> and its parasites and the way they behaved. But, on the stills of course, you cannot show the real behaviour.

50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> {{ovipositor}} {{contains two}} interlocking valves. Each valve {{is covered with}} teeth that are backward-facing.

This process leads in the ovipositor drilling almost an inch into the sapwood. The force used for this process is minimal. Buckling or breaking does not take place during the process.|$|R

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|R
