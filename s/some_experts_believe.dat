5|$|Tuatara {{probably}} have the slowest {{growth rates of}} any reptile, continuing to grow larger for the first 35years of their lives. The average lifespan is about 60years, but they can live to be well over 100years old. One such male even reproduced successfully {{for the first time}} at 111 years of age with an 80 year old female. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years.|$|E

5000|$|Critical systems whose network {{addresses}} {{would not}} be generally known were targeted, including those serving telephony and financial transaction processing. Although {{not all of the}} computer crackers behind the cyberwarfare have been unveiled, <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believed</b> that such efforts exceed the skills of individual activists or even organised crime as they require a co-operation of a state and a large telecom company.|$|R
25|$|Some {{messages}} are {{presented to the}} listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and {{a different set of}} words going backwards). <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.|$|E
25|$|Another main {{factor is}} the tension placed on the ligaments that support the navicular bone. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that the {{degenerative}} process begins with excess tension placed on these ligaments, causing strain and inflammation. Inflammation from strain of the impar ligament can decrease blood flow {{to and from the}} navicular bone, as the major blood vessels supplying the bone run up and down this area. If the ligament continues to be strained, it can thicken and permanently reduce blood flow to the navicular bone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> {{post-concussion}} {{symptoms are}} caused by structural damage to the brain or disruption of neurotransmitter systems, resulting from the impact that caused the concussion. Others believe that post-concussion symptoms are related to common psychological factors. Most common symptoms like headache, dizziness, and sleep problems {{are similar to those}} often experienced by individuals diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. In many cases, both physiological effects of brain trauma and emotional reactions to these events {{play a role in the}} development of symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|By then <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believed</b> that [...] "desktop presentations", using {{computers}} to create flip charts and overhead transparencies, could become as large a market as desktop publishing. That year Forethought {{was bought by}} Microsoft for $14 million ($ in present-day terms), and became Microsoft's Graphics Business Unit, which continued to develop the software further.

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> {{the main}} reason the Modern Persian {{language}} today {{is more or less}} the same language as that of Ferdowsi's time over 1000 years ago is due to the very existence of works like the Shahnameh, which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the Shahnameh itself has become one of the main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the Shahnameh in their works.|$|E
25|$|North Korea {{has tested}} {{a series of}} {{different}} missiles, including short-, medium-, intermediate-, and intercontinental- range, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Estimates of the country’s nuclear stockpile vary: <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> Pyongyang has between fifteen and twenty nuclear weapons, while U.S. intelligence believes the number to be between thirty and sixty bombs. The regime conducted two tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead in July 2017. The Pentagon confirmed North Korea’s ICBM tests, and analysts estimate that the new missile has a potential range of 10,400 kilometers (6,500 miles) and, if fired on a flatter trajectory, could be capable of reaching mainland U.S. territory.|$|E
25|$|In the end, the Russian {{population}} {{pays for}} this corruption. For example, <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that the rapid increases in tariffs for housing, water, gas and electricity, which significantly outpace {{the rate of}} inflation, are {{a direct result of}} high volumes of corruption at the highest levels. In the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed: starting from Putin's second term, very few corruption cases {{have been the subject of}} outrage. Putin's system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business, as well as its use of relatives, friends, and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property. Corporate, property, and land raiding is commonplace.|$|E
25|$|After this incident, {{there was}} a huge {{division}} of opinions over the fate of the Gulf Cartel. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believed</b> that the death of Ezekiel would be dreadful for the Gulf Cartel, and that Los Zetas would overthrow them and eventually take control of Tamaulipas. Others explained how his death allowed Costilla Sánchez to take full directive of the cartel, and that would tighten relations with Colombia and straighten the Gulf Cartel's path, something quite difficult with Ezekiel as co-leader.|$|R

50|$|<b>Some</b> {{nutritional}} <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> {{that early}} hominids evolved into eating meat {{as a result}} of huge climatic changes that took place three to four million years ago, when forests and jungles dried up and became open grasslands and opened hunting and scavenging opportunities.|$|R
25|$|The ship or wharf rat {{has contributed}} to the {{extinction}} of many species of wildlife including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands. True rats are omnivorous and capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods. True rats have a very high birth rate. When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce {{to take advantage of the}} new food supply. In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus have no fear of predators. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that rats are to blame for between 40 percent and 60 percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with 90 percent of those occurring on islands. Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.|$|E
25|$|While the {{achievements}} of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) {{pale in comparison to}} the milestones set by the former Soviet Union and the United States, <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration. China has been the leader of Asia's space race {{since the beginning of the}} 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria, many under {{pressure}} {{as a result}} of the communist Zhivkov regime's assimilation campaign (though up to a third returned before the end of the year). That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt Bulgarian names and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign is unclear; however, <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor. During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would only be issued in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity were removed. Mosques were closed. According to estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were imprisoned, sent to labor camps or forcibly resettled.|$|E

500|$|Welsh Springers {{are often}} {{confused}} with the English Springer Spaniel, but there are marked differences. The Welsh Springer is slightly smaller, and its reddish markings on a white background {{as opposed to the}} English Springers black or liver-coloured markings. Both breeds are admired for their hunting abilities and their trademark trait of [...] "springing" [...] at game. This can be seen during play also, as a dog may [...] "spring" [...] on his toy. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> that the Welsh Springer Spaniel and the Brittany share the same ancestry as {{there is a great deal}} of resemblance between the two breeds. The colours of the Welsh Springer, while exclusive from the English Springer, appear in the Brittany and the Brittany and Welsh Springers are both of similar sizes. The Welsh Springer is larger than the English Cocker Spaniel.|$|E

[...] The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service, and the Royal Standard flies. The purses are carried into the church by the Yeomen on silver dishes, held above their heads. [...] The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor; <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from grabbing at the food prematurely; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed by the smell of fish.|$|E

50|$|As with Zhiyanzhai, the {{identity}} of Odd Tablet has eluded modern Redologists, with <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> <b>believing</b> {{that they could be}} the same person. But noted Redologist Cai Yijiang (蔡義江) wrote an essay speculating that Odd Tablet should be author Cao Xueqin's father. What is known for certain now is that Odd Tablet was a person of some authority over Cao Xueqin. He ordered Cao Xueqin to remove a passage detailing the incestuous adultery between Qin Keqing and her father-in-law from Xueqin's original text, leading to Cao Xueqin resorting to very oblique references when writing the sensitive passage. The incident appeared to be based on a household scandal during Cao Xueqin's grandfather, Cao Yin's (曹寅) lifetime.|$|R
