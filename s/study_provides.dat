25|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{in the field of}} Japanese encephalitis therapeutics is the identification of macrophage receptor involvement in the disease severity. A recent report of an Indian group demonstrates the involvement of monocyte and macrophage receptor CLEC5A in severe inflammatory response in Japanese Encephalitis infection of the brain. This transcriptomic <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> a hypothesis of neuroinflammation and a new lead in development of appropriate therapeutic against Japanese encephalitis.|$|E

Results of the survey were analyzed using SPSS.|$|E
25|$|In {{in-vitro}} experiments THC at {{extremely high}} concentrations, {{which could not}} be reached with commonly consumed doses, caused competitive inhibition of the AChE enzyme and inhibition of β-amyloid peptide aggregation, implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A aggregation, and this <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may impact the progression of this debilitating disease.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} {{released}} in January 2014 by the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, Emmanuel Deruty and Damien Tardieu performed a systematic study describing {{the influence of}} compressors and brickwall limiters on the musical audio signal. The experiment involved four software limiters: Waves L2, Sonnox Oxford Limiter, Thomas Mundt’s Loudmax, Blue Cat’s Protector, as well as four software compressors: Waves H-Comp, Sonnox Oxford Dynamics, Sonalksis SV-3157, and URS 1970. The <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> objective data on what limiters and compressors do to the audio signal.|$|E
25|$|Levitt, Moser, & Jamison's 1994 <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> a general, if outdated, {{description}} of characteristics {{of women in the}} sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture. They state that women in S/M tend to have higher education, become more aware of their desires as a young adult, {{are less likely to be}} married than the general population. The researchers found the majority of females identified as heterosexual and submissive, a substantial minority were versatile—able to switch between dominant and submissive roles—and a smaller minority identified with the dominant role exclusively. Oral sex, bondage and master-slave script were among the most popular activities, while feces/watersports were the least popular.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies from}} the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) {{show that the}} daughters of women who were exposed in utero to DES {{may be less likely}} than the unexposed to have regular menstrual periods. A {{possible}} increased risk of infertility in the older, third generation daughters was also noted. The NCI <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> limited evidence of an increased risk of birth defects in the sons or daughters of women who were exposed prenatally to DES. An increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of women exposed in utero was observed, but it was based on three cases of almost 800, so the finding is considered preliminary and requires further study.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} by Pedersen et al. indicates that TNFα increase {{in response to}} sepsis is inhibited by the exercise-induced production of myokines. To study whether acute exercise induces a true anti-inflammatory response, a model of ‘low grade inflammation’ was established in which a low dose of E. coli endotoxin was administered to healthy volunteers, who had been randomised to either rest or exercise prior to endotoxin administration. In resting subjects, endotoxin induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of TNFα. In contrast, when the subjects performed 3 hours of ergometer cycling and received the endotoxin bolus at 2.5 h, the TNFα response was totally blunted. This <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> some evidence that acute exercise may inhibit TNF production.|$|E

This <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> this statistic of [...] "The median household income of African Americans were 62 percent of non-Hispanic Whites ($27,910 vs. $44,504)" [...] However, blacks were forced by system to be in urban and poor areas while the whites lived together, being able to afford the more expensive homes. These forced measures promoted poverty levels to rise and belittle blacks.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{funded by}} WWF and {{conducted}} by ILRI between 1989 and 2003 monitored hoofed {{species in the}} Mara on a monthly basis, and found that losses were as high as 75 percent for giraffes, 80 percent for common warthogs, 76 percent for hartebeest, and 67 percent for impala. The study blames the loss of animals on increased human settlement {{in and around the}} reserve. The higher human population density leads to an increased number of livestock grazing in the park and an increase in poaching. The article claims, [...] "The <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> the most detailed evidence to date on the declines in the ungulate (hoofed animals) populations in the Mara and how this phenomenon is linked to the rapid expansion of human populations near the boundaries of the reserve." ...|$|E

In a synthesis report published in Science in 2015, 22 leading marine scientists stated that [...] from burning fossil fuels is changing the oceans' chemistry more rapidly {{than at any time since}} the Great Dying, Earth's most severe known extinction event, emphasizing that the 2°C maximum temperature increase agreed upon by governments reflects too small a cut in emissions to prevent [...] "dramatic impacts" [...] on the world's oceans, with lead author Jean-Pierre Gattuso remarking that [...] "The ocean has been minimally considered at previous climate negotiations.

2500|$|During Diệm's reign, the Commissariat General for Civic Action (Vietnamese: Công Dân vụ) was {{established}} in March 1955 to [...] "improve the intellectual level of the rural population and to raise {{the standard of living}} in rural areas in view to setting up a democratic basis and to promote a rural and material rearmament among the people". The Civic Action was considered a practical tool of Diệm's government to serve [...] "the power vacuum" [...] and make a rural influence for Diệm's government in countryside due to the departure of Việt Minh cadres after the Geneva Accords (1954). Steward's <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> a clearer picture of Diệm's domestic policies and a further understanding of his government's efforts in reaching and connecting with local communities in South Vietnam that shows [...] "an indigenous initiative" [...] of South Vietnam government in building an independent and viable nation.|$|E
