25|$|George desperately {{appeals to}} Potter for a loan. When George offers his life {{insurance}} policy as collateral, Potter <b>says</b> <b>George</b> is worth more dead than alive and phones the police to have him arrested. George gets drunk at a local bar and {{is involved in a}} fight before he leaves and goes to a nearby bridge, thinking of suicide. The film's narrative catches up to the time of the opening scene. Before he can jump, Clarence dives into the river just before George does, causing George to rescue Clarence rather than killing himself. George does not believe Clarence's subsequent claim to be his guardian angel.|$|E
2500|$|Defenders of Marquette Bank {{point to}} {{increased}} {{competition in the}} credit card market as a positive result. [...] "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Marquette did not lay a foundation for runaway bank profits and consumer suffering," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George</b> Mason University School of Law professor Todd Zywicki. [...] "Rather, by eliminating archaic and largely ineffective usury restrictions, Marquette increased efficiency and competition in the credit card industry, made the market more responsive to consumer demand, and provided large benefits to consumers." [...] Specifically, he cites the shift from retailer-issued credit to third-party bank credit as the biggest component of this change made possible.|$|E

60|$|Lady Kelsey {{began to}} cry again, and Mrs. Crowley sat in silence, {{not knowing what to}} <b>say.</b> <b>George</b> walked about in agitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>say,</b> <b>George!</b> Do you know, I don't think I should {{much like}} {{going back to}} Virginia?" [...] says Harry, in a low, alarmed voice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And did I say I wasn't, miss? I am not {{setting up}} to be sentimental about George Sampson. I only <b>say</b> <b>George</b> Sampson was better than nothing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, p'r'aps three {{thousand}} head," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George,</b> reflecting. [...] "We don't know, takes five men to look 'em up and keep run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so, Phil," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George</b> of the {{shooting}} gallery after several turns in silence, [...] "you were dreaming of the country last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And when {{my uncle}} Sir Miles {{was out of}} town," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George,</b> looking towards the Baronet, who smiles at him with affectionate approval.|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't risk it," [...] I interrupted, in my turn; [...] "it is a {{delicate}} matter, and I see {{a way out of}} it. We will <b>say</b> <b>George</b> suggested the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There she is, my hearty; lay her aside, {{and hang}} {{me if she}} don't strike. I <b>say,</b> <b>George,</b> faint heart never won fair lady: {{remember}} that, my boy; no, nor a French ship." ...|$|R
5000|$|The X-Seed 4000 [...] "is {{never meant}} to be built," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Georges</b> Binder, {{managing}} director of Buildings & Data, a firm which compiles data banks on buildings worldwide.

60|$|DAISY. [Snatching {{her hands}} away.] Let me go, you fool. [To the AMAH.] He <b>says</b> <b>George</b> Conway {{is engaged to}} Harold Knox's sister. It's not true.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} young," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George,</b> with {{another of his}} old-fashioned bows. [...] "We shall be fifteen soon. Any {{compensation}} that is usual amongst gentlemen" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so we {{have been}} coaxing and cuddling in the window, and we part good friends, Harry? Is it not so?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>George</b> to his charioteer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now for it," [...] said she, as {{she stood}} before the glass, and shook down her silky {{abundance}} of black curly hair. [...] "I <b>say,</b> <b>George,</b> it's almost a pity, isn't it," [...] she said, as she held up some of it, playfully,--"pity it's all got to come off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} dine with her," [...] he said. [...] "I brought her and Lady Rockminster {{up from the}} country to-day--made two days of it--slept last night at Bath--I <b>say,</b> <b>George,</b> come and dine, too. I may ask any one I please, and the old lady is {{constantly}} talking about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'd {{have had}} a better time. <b>Say,</b> <b>George,</b> {{did you see the}} awful mistake on Nature's part that Babe Sinclair showed up with towards the middle of the proceedings? You must have noticed him, because he took up more room than any one man was {{entitled}} to. His name was Spenser Gray." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{one of us}} were to fall in defence of his country, we have {{a mother}} in Sparta who would think and write so too," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him manage his own house, not mine," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George,</b> very haughtily. And the caution, {{far from}} benefiting him, only {{rendered}} the lad more supercilious and refractory.|$|E
5000|$|He died at Paris {{after months}} of severe suffering, requesting, as the only {{decoration}} of his grave, a garland of flowers gathered from the fifty-eight families he had differentiated - [...] "a touching though transitory image," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Georges</b> Cuvier, [...] "of the more durable monument which he has erected to himself in his works." ...|$|R
40|$|From Changi {{airport and}} {{shopping}} malls to hotel lobbies and the lavatories at upscale restaurants, the city-state is festooned with delicate flowers, {{so it is}} hardly surprising that late last year Singapore hosted the World Orchid Conference. To say this event is a riot of colour is to <b>say</b> <b>George</b> Clooney is not bad looking. (McCabe 2012 : 1...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Hilda {{walked slowly}} on into Chancery Lane, {{then turned to}} the left till she came into Holborn, and thence made her way round by another route back to Lincoln's Inn Fields.

6000|$|... "Now we've done it," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George</b> in my ear. [...] "Our skin-friction {{that last}} slide, has played Old Harry with the tensions! Look out for laterals, Tim, she'll want some holding." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> Mr. <b>George</b> {{opened the}} Guide Book, {{and turned to}} the index.|$|R
6000|$|... "You should thank your stars, child, that I {{saved the}} letter," [...] cried she. [...] "See! here are his own words, in his great big {{handwriting}} like a clerk. It {{was not my}} fault that he wrote them, or that I found them.

6000|$|... "It was but natural, madam. We {{have had}} common hearts and purses {{since we were}} born. I but feigned hard-heartedness {{in order to try}} those people yonder," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George,</b> with filling eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's the till, Harry," [...] <b>says</b> <b>George,</b> {{pointing}} {{from his}} bed. [...] "Put your hand in, and {{take what you}} will. What a lovely morning, and how fresh the Bedford House garden looks!" ...|$|E

60|$|CLARE. [Facing her] You <b>say</b> <b>George</b> is generous! If {{he wanted}} to be that he'd never have claimed these damages. It's revenge he wants--I heard him here. You think I've done him an injury. So I did--when I married him. I don't know what I shall come to, Dolly, but I shan't fall so low as to take money from him. That's as certain as that I shall die.|$|R
