30|$|The use of glued {{laminated}} timber products in Japanese post and beam housing has grown {{dramatically in the}} last decade. This leads to a growing market for wood lamina which is a prior product for manufacturing {{glued laminated}} posts and beams in Japan. The Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) for glued laminated timber and <b>structural</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber are dictated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) Notification 1152 [1] and MAFF Notification 235 [2] respectively.

30|$|Sugi (Japanese cedar: Cryptomeria japonica) is {{the most}} {{important}} afforestation species in Japan. Its growing stock has been increasing year by year. Thus, development of new wood products made of sugi has been a national priority for more than two decades. Development of sugi <b>structural</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber (glulam) was one of the responses to this push. However, in the 1990 s, the Japanese glued laminated timber (GLT) industry did not accept sugi as a raw material for glulam, because several problems existed in the wood quality of sugi such as lower strength properties than those of the major imported species. This drawback spurred intensive research on sugi glulam in Japan. The results contributed to the significant revision of the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) for GLT in 2008. The standard permitted the use of various new laminae and products such as a sugi composite GLT beams using different species of laminae with high modulus of elasticity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{multiple}} bolted connections {{in accordance with}} Appendix E of the National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS) has incorporated provisions for evaluating localized member failure modes of row and group tear-out when the connections are closely spaced. Originally based on <b>structural</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber (glulam) members made with all L 1 Douglas fir-Larch laminating lumber, the NDS provisions were confirmed by additional analysis, which indicates {{the applicability of the}} provisions to glulam with reduced design shear values. Due to the similarity to glulam in the grain orientation and layup strategy, laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is subject to similar failure modes. As a result, a study was initiated by APA – The Engineered Wood Association and the LVL industry, in collaboration with the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to evaluate if a reduced design shear stress is necessary for LVL under similar multiple bolted connection configurations.

40|$|Shear {{strength}} of <b>structural</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber (glulam) beams {{may be affected}} by the in-service conditions or manufacturing processes. While glulam is typically manufactured with kiln-dry lumber and therefore less susceptible to checking and splitting, glulam beams still check or split, usually at the first or second glueline and at the beam ends, as they gain or lose moisture in response to direct exposure to water, changing relative humidity and temperature in the surrounding environment. Literature is available for determining the effect of checks or splits on the horizontal shear {{strength of}} glulam beams based on conservative assumptions. It is not uncommon for the architect, builder or homeowner to be alarmed when a significant check or split is found on a glulam beam. In many instances, however, the check or split may have limited influence on the horizontal shear strength of a glulam beam and the structural integrity of the glulam beam is not compromised.

In workpieces which had a loose knot, all deep holes deviated in the direction of the loose knot. The average value of both the AE and power consumption became larger with increasing feed per revolution.

For most glulam products, the design shear stresses so derived are conservative. In recent years, the demand to optimize the design shear stress has been increased due to a higher design shear stress offered by competing structural wood composites, such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and parallel strand lumber (PSL). Since 1997, APA has {{conducted a series of}} full-size shear tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and Spruce-Pine-Fir. A four-point load method with a clear distance between the edge of the reaction bearing plate {{to the edge of the}} nearest curved load bearing block of at least 2 times the specimen depth was used to test all specimens. Based on this experience, the full-size shear test method has been adopted in ASTM D 3737 as a standard test method for determining the horizontal shear strength of glulam. This paper provides detailed descriptions of the test methods, experimental results, and data analyses. The test results obtained from this study indicate that the characteristic shear strength values based on full-size shear tests are approximately 70 % of the values determined from small block shear tests. However, the allowable horizontal shear stress could be increased by a factor of at least 1. 25, including a 10 % reduction to allow for occasional seasoning checks. This increase can be attributed in part to the difference in the procedures used to derive the design value between the full-size and small block shear tests...|$|R

In recent years, however, information has been generated, suggesting that the allowable shear stresses so derived may be overly conservative {{when compared to the}} results of full-size flexure tests. Unfortunately, all available U. S. data on full-size glulam tests, as related to shear strength, were either proprietary or conducted using a non standard test method. Moreover, the different test setups used by these studies made the data comparison difficult. A systematic evaluation on major wood species used in the production of glulam in the U. S. based on a consistent full-size flexure test method was considered critical by the U. S. glulam industry to determine the appropriate allowable horizontal shear stresses for glulam. During 1996 - 97, APA- The Engineered Wood Association conducted a total of 201 full-size tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and Spruce-Pine-Fir.

Results of this study indicated that the allowable horizontal shear stress for those species tested can be increased from the previously published values by a factor of at least 1. 25, including a 10 % reduction to allow for occasional seasoning checks.
