50|$|The M60 was {{designed}} for mass production, just like the MG42 it was based on. While the M1919 required much machining for its large, recoil operated internal mechanisms, the M60's stamped <b>sheet</b> <b>receiver</b> had a gas operated, carrier-cammed bolt mechanism; {{the same type of}} mechanism was used on the Lewis machine gun.|$|E

5000|$|Hi-Point {{carbines}} use a polymer stock, stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> cover, and {{a receiver}} and bolt cast from zamak-3. The barrel is steel and button rifled using a 1-10" [...] right hand twist.|$|R
5000|$|Experimental stamped receiver: Very rare. A {{small number}} of Type 56 SKS rifles were {{manufactured}} with experimental stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receivers</b> as a cost and weight saving measure but did not enter large scale production.|$|R
50|$|WASR-series rifles are {{manufactured}} with stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receivers</b> that were originally intended for single-stack magazines. Featuring hard chrome-lined barrels, side-mount scope rail and wooden stocks, WASR-series rifles are commonly imported to the United States by Century International Arms.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{difficulties}} {{during the initial}} phase of production. The first production models had stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receivers</b> with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert, and a stamped body. Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates. Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver.</b> This was a more costly process, {{but the use of}} machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier Mosin-Nagant rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim SKS rifle continued.|$|R
50|$|The Bushmaster M17S is a {{semi-automatic}} rifle {{that uses a}} gas-operated, rotating bolt. The design takes the operating system of the Armalite AR-18 and moves the pistol grip forward {{in a manner similar}} to the British SA80. Instead of the <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> of the AR18 and SA80, the Bushmaster M17S uses an extruded 7075-T6 aluminum receiver that serves as the stock and foregrip as well. This method of construction is particularly efficient and was subsequently copied by other designs.|$|R
50|$|The Approval is a {{laminate}} based {{system where}} up to 6 color donors can transfer images to a <b>receiver</b> <b>sheet</b> by a high-powered laser. Once imaging is complete the image can be {{transfer to a}} wide variety of substrates including papers, boards, shrink wrap, plastics, metals, etc.|$|R
50|$|The M2 is {{a simple}} {{blowback}} operated design, although {{it was difficult to}} make. The receiver was built from a steel forging and a seamless tubular section, which took extra time and effort to machine and finish, causing the US Army to adopt the M3 with a simple stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver,</b> instead. Like the American Thompson and Finnish Suomi designs, the M2 bolt was shaped with large diameter rear and slender front sections. Unlike the all metal M3 with a collapsing wire stock, the M2 had a fixed wooden stock with wooden handgrip and handguard.|$|R
50|$|The AKM’s receiver, {{compared}} to the AK-47, is stamped from a smooth 1.0 mm sheet of steel. To the U-shaped stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> housing a rear stock trunnion and forward barrel trunnion are fastened using rivets. The receiver housing also features a rigid tubular cross-section support that adds structural strength. Guide rails that assist the bolt carrier’s movement which also incorporates the ejector are installed inside the receiver through spot welding. As a weight-saving measure, the stamped receiver cover is of thinner gauge metal {{than that of the}} AK-47. In order to maintain strength and durability it employs both longitudinal and latitudinal reinforcing ribs.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{manufacturing}} difficulties of non milled receivers had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (M for [...] "modernized" [...] or [...] "upgraded"; in Russian: Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy) {{was introduced in}} 1959. This new model used a stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> and featured a slanted muzzle brake {{on the end of}} the barrel to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed), during rapid or automatic fire. This is also sometimes referred to as a [...] "cyclic rate reducer", or simply [...] "rate reducer", as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during automatic fire. It was also roughly one-third lighter than the previous model.|$|R
50|$|Like the RPK, the NHM-91 {{utilizes}} a heavier-gauge stamped <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> {{built from}} 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal {{instead of the}} 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or European AKM. Other Chinese-made AKM rifles such as the MAK 90 and NHM 90 have thicker receivers as well, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The MAK 90 rifles may have either a straight cut stamped receiver or a slant cut stamped receiver. Both were imported after the 1989 ban with thumb hole stocks. The MAK 91 has the long barrel as well, but features a milled, slant cut receiver. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 and MAK 91 rifles a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62×39mm ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|The AK-47 is a select-fire, 7.62×39mm, air-cooled, long-stroke-piston gas-operated, magazine-fed rifle, with a {{rotating}} bolt. It {{was designed to}} be a simple, reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s. The AK-47's barrel and bolt were milled out of a steel billet and hard chromed. Its receiver was originally designed to be stamped from sheet metal with a milled trunnion insert. However, there were many difficulties during the initial phase of production causing high rejection rates due to faulty receivers. Instead of halting production, a heavy forged steel machined receiver was substituted for the <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver.</b> This was a more costly and time consuming process, but advanced the program's development and accelerated production. [...] The AK's furniture was simply made out of wood, which was a non-strategic material, and perfectly fits the Soviet manufacturing philosophy, where large manufacturing plants produce basic weapons in very large quantities.|$|R
25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted <b>sheet</b> metal steel <b>receiver,</b> {{but due to}} {{the higher}} {{operating}} pressures of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.|$|R
2500|$|In 1954, {{a variant}} of the U.S. M3A1 submachine gun was {{designed}} at the Argentine FMAP (Fábrica Militar de Armas Portátiles) factory in the city of Rosario and put into production the following year as the P.A.M. 1 (Pistola Ametrelladora Modelo 1). [...] Constructed of somewhat thinner-gauge steel than the U.S. M3A1, the P.A.M. 1 was in essence a 7/8 scale replica of the U.S. weapon in 9mm Parabellum caliber, but was lighter and had a higher rate of fire. This was due to an incomplete transfer of all details to Argentina. [...] In service, the P.A.M. 1's thinner <b>sheet</b> steel <b>receiver</b> tended to overheat with extended firing, while the gun itself proved somewhat more difficult to control in automatic fire despite the smaller caliber. [...] Additionally, triggering the weapon to fire individual shots proved difficult owing to the increased rate of fire. [...] Problems with accidental discharges and accuracy with the P.A.M. 1 led to an improved selective-fire version with a grip safety on the magazine housing known as the P.A.M. 2, first introduced in 1963.|$|R
2500|$|The pinned and riveted <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> of the Bizon {{is derived}} from the AKS-74 and has been {{modified}} at the front end, since the gas system was omitted. The handguard is a sheet metal stamping with three rectangular ventilation slots on each side. The magazine serves as the lower handguard and the current models of the magazine are ribbed to enhance grip. The Bizon also shares the same trigger and safety mechanisms of the AK-74 rifle. The selector lever is placed {{on the right side of}} the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and in this position the lever physically blocks the bolt's integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked [...] "АВ") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position ("ОД") will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the trigger unit and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.|$|R

5000|$|The RPK {{also has}} a {{slightly}} longer receiver, by about 20 mm or less. This was done to decrease the fire rate slightly, but not significantly enough to lower it any less than 600 rounds per minute (RPM). The U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel (compared to the 1.0 mm <b>sheet</b> metal <b>receiver</b> used on the standard AKM rifles. It uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly, that consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring. It features a thick laminated wood foregrip, and a fixed laminated wood [...] "club-foot" [...] buttstock, similar to the stock used on the RPD, {{which is designed to}} allow the user to fire from the prone position more comfortably. It uses a standard AKM pistol grip and can also use standard AKM detachable box magazines, but it is most commonly used with a 40-round box magazine or a 75-round drum magazine. Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM are moderate.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Some {{desirable}} {{features of}} a solar energy collector are listed and a collector design is presented which incorporates their features. As the collector is operated, air flows within the collector enclosure and is heated as it passes through a porous radiant energy receiver mounted in the enclosure. The porous energy <b>receiver</b> consists of <b>sheets</b> of blackened expanded metal. A hardware model of the experimental collector was constructed to allow comparison of this design with a typical flat-plate air-heating collector. Testing demonstrated that the experimental collector was approximately twice as efficient as the standard flat-plate collector. This performance differential was largely due to manipulation of airflow paths within the enclosure of the experimental collector. A mathematical model of the experimental collector was developed and correlated to the hardware model. This hardware-software correlation provided insight into the radiant energy and airflow distributions within the porous receiver and enabled investigation of the sensitivity of collector performance to changes in design parameters such as air flowrate, <b>receiver</b> <b>sheet</b> thermal conductivity, etc. The material cost for the experimental collector is approximately 3 - 4 per square foot (1979 prices). Efficiency for the collector is 75...|$|R
40|$|A {{digital image}} {{hardcopy}} device {{has been designed}} using a laser exposure mechanism, a pigmented wax /resin donor ink sheet, and an opaque <b>receiver</b> <b>sheet.</b> The writing system relies on image-wise thermal mass transfer of molten ink to the receiver {{in order to produce}} high resolution output. With the receiver media and a specially designed donor ribbon being held to a platen through vacuum pressure, a pulsed solid-state diode pumped near IR NdrYAG laser provides the energy necessary to complete the thermal transfer process. By varying pulse width, dot size variation is possible. A mathematical model was developed to explain the physics of the imaging process and aid further experimentation. In order to maximize photothermal conversion and transfer efficiency while maintaining environmental friendliness, a water/ alcohol based multi-layer donor ribbon was designed. Digital image analysis techniques and processing algorithms were developed specifically to provide a reliable quantification scheme for all variables. A randomized four factor central composite design provided a statistically robust means by which to map measured image quality. Response surface methods of factorial experimental design afforded a means to model the ribbon design space. Utilization of the Downhill Simplex Method (Nelder and Mead, 1965) yielded the optimum point on the estimated image quality response surface. The optimum point represented the final donor ribbon composition. It is primarily the continuously variable dot size capability and high thermal efficiency of the developed system that sets this research apart from other published works related to laser driven thermal transfer...|$|R
