40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a variant of}} a spare parts inventory model with cold <b>stand-by</b> <b>redundancy</b> on system level. Redundancy on system level implies that not all systems need to be operational {{in order to have}} the whole system operational. The cold stand-by feature implies that only the minimum required systems are operational. In order to determine a cost effective spare parts package such that in a cold <b>stand-by</b> <b>redundancy</b> situation a sufficient number of systems is operational for a specified period we extend the METRIC methodology. To compute the probability that the number of operating systems during the operational period is sufficient, we present both an exact, but time-consuming method, and a fast approximation method based on fitting distributions on the first two moments. This approximation method shows very small differences when compared to the exact method. Finally, we compare both methods to a simulation model in order to test the validity and impact of our modelling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} 30 years, EDF has {{acquired}} a thorough experience in modelling reliability and safety of nuclear power plants. Relying on this experience, R&D division decided to carry out reliability studies of electrical systems in order to optimise EDF’s electrical network asset management. But this type of system, usually with <b>stand-by</b> <b>redundancies,</b> is difficult to treat with classic reliability methods like fault-trees or reliability block diagrams. This paper presents a tool called OPALE, based on innovative methods developed by EDF R&D. A demonstration of OPALE is done on a complex electrical network with <b>stand-by</b> <b>redundancies...</b>|$|R
