5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1682 Johan Hadorph {{travelled}} together with the draughtsman Johan Leitz through Järfälla and mapped all the inscriptions that had been mentioned in Searching for Antiquity {{with the exception of}} the rune stone at the front way, that probably never existed. Hadorph additionally discovered a previously unknown rune at Järfälla church (U82). Johan Hadorph's Travelling Journal or <b>Scribbling</b> <b>pad</b> Notes from 1682 has been preserved and is now in the National Library of Sweden (Swedish: Kungliga biblioteket, KB, meaning [...] "the Royal Library"). Among Järfälla runic inscriptions, however, Hadorph here only listed one of the rune stones at Skälby (U89). From the drawings of Hadorph's trips there were made woodcuts. These woodcuts should be part of a work with all of the country's rune stones. Hadorph could issue only a small part of this planned work of the rune stones (Färentuna Häradz Runstenar, 1680).|$|E

60|$|The same afternoon, while Dick was out {{and away}} with Froelig and Martinez and Graham, Paula stole {{a pilgrimage to}} Dick's quarters. Out on his {{sleeping}} porch she looked over his rows of press buttons, his switchboard that from his bed connected him with {{every part of the}} ranch and {{most of the rest of}} California, his phonograph on the hinged and swinging bracket, the orderly array of books and magazines and agricultural bulletins waiting to be read, the ash tray, cigarettes, <b>scribble</b> <b>pads,</b> and thermos bottle.|$|R
6000|$|When Dick had shaved, {{he looked}} at the shower, hesitated a moment, then his face set stubbornly. I'm darned if I will, was his thought; a sheer waste of time. He did, however, change his shoes to a pair of heavy, high-laced ones fit for the {{roughness}} of hunting. He was at his desk again, looking over the notes in his <b>scribble</b> <b>pads</b> for the morning's work, when Paula entered. She did not call her [...] "Good morning, merry gentleman"; but came quite close to him before she greeted him softly with: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with <b>scribble</b> <b>pads</b> for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|R
60|$|Nor was Dick ever to {{know that}} Paula had come so near to him with her need and gone away. Again, not aimlessly, but to run through {{for the last time}} the notes of the <b>scribble</b> <b>pad</b> by his bed, he was out on his {{sleeping}} porch. His house was in order. There was nothing left but to sign up the morning's dictation, answer several telegrams, then would come lunch and the hunting in the Sycamore hills. Oh, he would do it well. The Outlaw would bear the blame. And he would have an eye- witness, either Froelig or Martinez. But not both of them. One pair of eyes would be enough to satisfy when the martingale parted and the mare reared and toppled backward upon him into the brush. And from that screen of brush, swiftly linking accident to catastrophe, the witness would hear the rifle go off.|$|R
60|$|Morales tore a {{strip of}} paper from a <b>pad,</b> <b>scribbled</b> upon it and flung it {{across the table to}} the tobacco merchant, who passed it to Appleby.|$|R
6000|$|Much he {{saw that}} pleased him. Once, he murmured aloud, [...] "A fat land, a fat land." [...] Divers things {{he saw that}} did not please him and that won a note in his <b>scribble</b> <b>pad.</b> Completing the circle about the Big House and riding beyond the circle half a mile to an {{isolated}} group of sheds and corrals, he reached {{the objective of the}} ride: the hospital. Here he found but two young heifers being tested for tuberculosis, and a magnificent Duroc Jersey boar in magnificent condition. Weighing fully six hundred pounds, its bright eyes, brisk movements, and sheen of hair shouted out that there was nothing the matter with it. Nevertheless, according to the ranch practice, being a fresh importation from Iowa, it was undergoing the regular period of quarantine. Burgess Premier was its name in the herd books of the association, age two years, and it had cost Forrest five hundred dollars laid down on the ranch.|$|R
50|$|A {{desk pad}} or blotter is a table {{protector}} used when work such as painting or writing would otherwise damage the table or desk. Different desk pads have specific uses, for example Chinese calligraphy uses a black velour desk pad since Chinese calligraphy is written using an ink brush. Westerners use simpler writing pads with disposable paper surfaces {{that can be}} used for writing, note taking, and <b>scribbling.</b> Often these <b>pads</b> are pre-printed with calendar pages.|$|R
5000|$|... "Sometimes, I wake up {{at night}} and write a song. Sometimes a tune comes to my head when I'm walking in the hills, and I {{have to make up}} words for it. Sometimes I sit in a bar in San Francisco and scribble into a notepad what I call my 'streams of unconsciousness.' When I have enough <b>scribbles</b> in the <b>pad,</b> and enough tunes in my head, I go into the studio and make an album. That's how I made this one." ...|$|R
5000|$|McCabe {{is the son}} of a {{bus driver}} father and a social worker mother and has two older brothers, Alan and Paul. When asked what it was that {{inspired}} him to become a guitarist, he answered: [...] "That was me, I just got a guitar, and I could play a few things on it, and I liked messing with it, and I liked making my own things up." [...] He attended Haydock High School, and later met Richard Ashcroft at Winstanley College. Ashcroft described McCabe's guitar playing as sounding like [...] "a whole other universe"; the two briefly played in a band whilst at college. After leaving college, McCabe began a career as a quantity surveyor. He later recalled: [...] "I hated it. I used to sit there all day <b>scribbling</b> in my <b>pad</b> thinking about guitar sounds." [...] He gave this up to be part of The Verve along with Ashcroft, Simon Jones and Peter Salisbury.|$|R
5000|$|Allen hadn't {{wanted to}} write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was {{put off by the}} book's {{non-linear}} story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her, and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and <b>scribble</b> on legal <b>pads.</b> She was terrified {{that she would have to}} tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci’s tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed. (When asked if the original author ever has anything to say about how their book is treated, Allen replied: [...] "Not if I can help it. You cannot open that can of worms. You sell your book, you go to the bank, you shut up.") ...|$|R
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her.
