50|$|Early {{in the day}} the two Aston Martins, Tony Quinn's DBRS9 in GT3 Class A, and the St Gallen Vantage GT4 of Baenziger, Kamelger and Porritt in Class C, had {{a coming}} {{together}} {{at the top of}} Conrod Straight. Quinn's race was ended and the Vantage GT4 recommenced racing, albeit several laps down. The #22 FPV FG GT of Robinson Racing Developments broke a <b>supercharger</b> <b>pulley</b> late in the day. The car was repaired using a part taken off a road car belonging to a crowd member, allowing the team to finish the race. The car recommenced racing in the last five laps and the team returned the borrowed part following the end of the race.|$|E
5000|$|The 4A-GZE (produced {{in various}} forms from August 1986 through 1995) was a {{supercharged}} version of the 4A-GE. Based on the same block and cylinder head, the 4A-GZE engine was equipped with a Roots type supercharger producing [...] peak manifold pressure, and the compression ratio was lowered to 8:1 {{with the use of}} forged and dished pistons. Although fitted with upgraded pistons, they still had the same ports, valve timing, and head gasket as the naturally aspirated 4A-GE engine, although T-VIS was omitted. It was used in the supercharged MR2, rated at [...] at 6400 rpm and 190 Nm at 4400. In 1990 it was updated with the [...] "smallport" [...] cylinder head, 8.9:1 compression, and MAP D-Jetronic load sensing and a smaller <b>supercharger</b> <b>pulley</b> producing [...] These updated 4A-GZE motors were rated at [...] and 210 Nm for the 1990/1991 AE92 Corolla and [...] for the AE101.|$|E

5000|$|GM offered dealer-installed {{performance}} upgrade packages called [...] "stage kits" [...] {{that were}} covered by factory warranty.The Stage 1 kit consists of new fuel injectors and a reprogram of the ECU, and yields up to a [...] improvement. The Stage 2 kit consists of new fuel injectors and the same reprogram with a smaller serpentine belt and pulley for the supercharger, producing a 36 hp improvement and 18 lbft of torque. Both stage 1 and 2 kits increase the engine redline to 7,000 rpm. The Stage 3 kit consists of a smaller, [...] <b>supercharger</b> <b>pulley,</b> a 2&#8209;pass intercooler end plate and a customizable replacement ECU. The Stage 3 ECU allows {{for the use of}} a 50&#8209;shot of nitrous, 100 octane fuel and an adjustable redline from 6,750 to 8,000 rpm. Stage 3 produces [...] using 93 octane fuel, up 260 hp using 100 octane fuel, and much higher power with nitrous. Stage 3 is for track use only, and to emphasize this, air conditioning is disabled with the Stage 3 ECU.|$|E

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Turbocharging {{is used as a}} means to downsize petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. Due to the presence of a throttle valve in the intake system in petrol engines, flow is restricted at the outlet pipe of the compressor during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions and, thus, generating surge noise. This Thesis describes an experimental and simulation method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. Initially, experimental transient tip-in and tip-out maneuver was performed on a non turbocharged car with a petrol engine. The measured noise level in the intake manifold, at a low frequency of up to 1200 Hz, was analysed and was shown not to represent surge noise. Next, a one dimensional simulation method was applied to simulate the noise of the engine and this demonstrated an increase in the acoustic pressure level in the intake manifold during the tip in and tip out maneuver. However, a surge noise pattern was not observed in the analysis of acoustic pressure signals in the intake system using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The simulation procedure was also used to inform the design of an experimental rig to recreate the surge noise under laboratory conditions. An experimental turbocharger noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained in the Thesis. Important component parts likely {{to be involved in the}} surge noise generation such as the intake system, compressor, throttle body, compressor recirculation valve and measurement and control systems were integrated into the test rig. Background noise contributions from the electric motor, AC mains, <b>supercharger</b> <b>pulley,</b> throttle body, inverter fan, throttle body gearing and structural vibration of the supporting structure were identified from the analysed frequency components of the signals from surface microphone measurements taken at the intake system. This helped to clearly identify the surge noise frequency components (3250 Hz) in the STFT analysis. The fundamental mechanism of noise generation was identified using an analysis of the experimental results and a frequency calculation for vortex shedding and the radial acoustic resonances. One of the main conclusions of the Thesis is that the compressor recirculation valve (CRV) open or close position, the CRV delay time and the throttle position are major contributing factors to the cause of the surge noise. Another major conclusion is that the radial acoustic resonance may be a mechanism of surge noise generation. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed. A pipe with cross ribs is designed as a passive solution using the radial acoustic resonance calculation and the corresponding nodal patterns. This solution demonstrated a measured intake system noise reduction of up to 10 dB under compressor surge conditions...|$|E
