25|$|Typical European four-operation {{machines}} use the Odhner mechanism, or {{variations of}} it. This kind of machine included the Original Odhner, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although {{most of these}} were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the <b>setting</b> <b>lever</b> positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the researched changeover from Operational Excellence (OE) {{to the new}} path of Operations Excellence (OsE). Operational Excellence (OE) predominantly deals with the efficiency (productivity), effectiveness (customer/market orientation) and optimization of production processes. In comparison, Operations Excellence (OsE) enlarges that perspective to see operations as <b>setting</b> <b>lever</b> by providing enablers as a central role for operational long-term success. The assessment of required against existing setting of enabler criteria in an organization (e. g., high performance culture, methods and instruments, employee empowerment, etc.) supports to become a plant's future health foreseeable and to identify its capability to achieve sustainability and excellence in terms of operations. To support a methodical integration of Operations Excellence in organizations, an OsE assessment framework has been developed within the applied research project “IMFT”. The model design containing the identification of relevant criteria and their cause-effect relationships {{is a key element}} of the present paper...|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were <b>lever</b> <b>setting,</b> with a unique design of <b>set</b> <b>lever</b> which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{involves}} {{a mixture of}} arcade adventure, maze game and strategy. The player controls robots (which are designed, built and named in-game) around {{the interior of the}} Omega and must shut down its four reactors. These robots have a limited amount of artificial intelligence and can be programmed to take set routes or allowed to explore of their own accord. The player can also directly control the robots. Occasionally, simple puzzles (often involving <b>setting</b> <b>levers</b> correctly) must be solved or hostile robots aboard the Omega must be combatted.|$|R

50|$|The lever tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting lever lock {{required}} the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R

50|$|Mandatory for all {{railroad}} watches after roughly 1908, {{this kind}} of pocket watch was set by opening the crystal and bezel and pulling out the setting-lever (most hunter-cases have levers accessible without removing the crystal or bezel), which was generally found at either the 10 or 2 o'clock positions on open-faced watches, and at 5:00 on hunting cased watches. Once the lever was pulled out, the crown could be turned to set the time. The lever was then pushed back in and the crystal and bezel were closed over the dial again. This method of time setting on pocket watches was preferred by American and Canadian railroads, as <b>lever</b> <b>setting</b> watches make accidental time changes impossible. After 1908, <b>lever</b> <b>setting</b> was generally required for new watches entering service on American railroads.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{filling the}} vacuum in the mobile content 1 {{literature}} addressing {{the following two}} macro-topics: the identification, classification and assessment of problems and inhibitor factors thwarting players involved in the mobile content market in the U. S.; second, the analysis of drivers that companies along the mobile content value chain may harness for breaking such challenges down. In the end, the research study provides a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> which companies {{can take advantage of}} for increasing their performances as well as meeting critical success factors. To accomplish our objectives, we have employed the multiple case studies methodology and performed a multi-criteria analysis along the value chain position (e. g., content provisioning, content aggregation) and types of content offered (e. g., video, music). Specifically, the sample of analysis comprises 67 companies throughout the value chain and offerings. We have identified, at an industry level, six problems hampering the mobile content market in the U. S. : customer awareness and education as well as user habits and acceptance; pricing strategies; regulations; platform’s standards and solutions; OffDeck underdevelopment; economics and monetization opportunities. For each of them, we have delineated a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> which players have started taking into account for overcoming such inhibitor factors (e. g., social network mediums, smartphones and new distribution channels, pricing plans) ...|$|R

50|$|Biomineralization is the {{production}} of mineralized parts by organisms. Hypotheses to explain the evolution of biomineralization include physiological adaptation to changing chemistry of the oceans, defense against predators {{and the opportunity to}} grow larger. The functions of biomineralization in SSFs vary: some SSFs are not yet understood; some are components of armor; and some are skeletons. A skeleton is any fairly rigid structure of an animal, irrespective of whether it has joints and irrespective of whether it is biomineralized. Although some SSFs may not be skeletons, SSFs are biomineralized by definition, being shelly. Skeletons provide a wide range of possible advantages, including: protection, support, attachment to a surface, a platform or <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> for muscles to act on, traction when moving on a surface, food handling, provision of filtration chambers and storage of essential substances.|$|R

It proposes three <b>sets</b> of <b>levers</b> influenced by governance that have potential to influence what happens at the point of care: harnessing the autonomy and expertise of professionals at a collective level to work towards better safety and quality; creating enabling contexts for cross-fertilization of clinical and organizational expertise, notably through teamwork; and patient and public engagement to achieve greater agreement on improvement priorities and overcome provider/manager tensions. Good governance provides guidance at a distance but also goes deep enough to influence clinical habits. ...|$|R
