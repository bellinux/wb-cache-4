5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

Three participants were interviewed and the relevant themes that emerged from those interviews were coded and reported. The study was conducted from a qualitative perspective that was grounded in <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> methodology. The survivors' individual <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> meaning {{at the time of their}} sexual abuse, their introduction to the <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> meaning about child sexual abuse and the double bind between these constructions are reported. The survivors' narratives are representations of the positive way they constructed meaning about their experiences as a way of coping. Their stories are also reflections of the confusion they experienced when introduced to the <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> child sexual abuse that differed from the meaning they attributed to their experiences. The study is a representation of the double bind that the difference between the individual and <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> their child sexual abuse created for them...|$|R

500|$|Feminist {{theory has}} {{explored}} the <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> masculinity {{and its implications}} for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations. Patriarchal cultures are criticized for [...] "limiting forms of masculinity" [...] available to men and thus narrowing their life choices. Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.|$|E
500|$|But I'm a Cheerleader is {{not only}} about sexuality, but also gender and the <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> gender roles.

Chris Holmlund in Contemporary American Independent Film notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes [...] "gender-tuned." [...] Ted Gideonse in Out magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of knowledge is}} the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the {{sociology of}} knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The <b>Social</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare socially constructed reality). The [...] "archaeological" [...] and [...] "genealogical" [...] studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.|$|E

500|$|A 2005 study {{reported}} that, among {{a sample of}} undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources for knowledge about the clitoris were school and friends, {{and that this was}} associated with the least amount of tested knowledge. Knowledge of the clitoris by self-exploration was the least cited, but [...] "respondents correctly answered, on average, three of the five clitoral knowledge measures". The authors stated that [...] "nowledge correlated significantly with the frequency of women's orgasm in masturbation but not partnered sex" [...] and that their [...] "results are discussed in light of gender inequality and a <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> sexuality, endorsed by both men and women, that privileges men's sexual pleasure over women's, such that orgasm for women is pleasing, but ultimately incidental."
