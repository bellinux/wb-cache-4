40|$|Purpose. Despite {{the steady}} {{increase}} in the length of sections of continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, wooden railway sleepers, {{as one of the}} options of under-rail bearings, are still operated on a sufficiently large number of areas, in particular, remain uncontested in the curve of up to 350 m radius, {{as well as on the}} main ways of subways. The main types of fasteners in the most common types of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers are track <b>screws</b> and <b>spikes.</b> Since the «wheel-rail» system contact peculiarities existing in track curved sections have a significant impact on the processes of interaction between the railway track and rolling stock, it is necessary in this work to determine the rigidity of the track <b>screws</b> and <b>spikes,</b> which are directly involved in the formation of spatial rigidity of the intermediate rail fastening nodes under the influence of horizontal transverse forces. Methodology. The study of the track <b>screw</b> and <b>spike</b> rigidity was conducted experimentally for the two types of intermediate rail fastenings – D 0 and «Metro». To carry out experimental tests, 10 test sites were selected on the roads of the regional branch of «Southern Railway» of «Ukrzaliznytsia», and 8 – in the main routes of KP «Kharkiv Metro». Each of the test sites was in approximately the same operating conditions, but had different values of passed tonnage. Findings. The values of the track <b>screw</b> and <b>spike</b> rigidity were obtained. Originality. The authors first obtained the experimental data on variation in rigidity of track <b>screw</b> and <b>spike,</b> depending on the useful life for the main railways and subway routes. This allows calculation of the horizontal shear forces in track curved sections (particularly in curves of up to 350 m radius), as well as the forecast evaluation of their level change during operation. Practical value. Based on the experimental data, it was found that variation in rigidity of track <b>screw</b> and <b>spike</b> depending on the lifetime is nonlinear. These experiments allow a more rational approach to the issue of determining the optimal design of the intermediate rail fasteners, based on the specific operating conditions, and may also contribute to the development of measures to improve the reliability of the components of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers...|$|R

40|$|Summary. In {{this paper}} {{technology}} of <b>screw</b> <b>spikes</b> manufacturing, {{based on the}} flashless forging and hot rolling in double configuration, is presented. The forging takes place in closed dies and the obtained workpiece is rolled in its middle part on cross-wedge rolling mill {{in order to make}} screw thread. As the result of this process, it is possible to eliminate disadvantages of the former technology: flash and groove on the head surface of the workpiece thread part. The new technology designing based on computer simulations and experimental research, which considerably lowered the costs of implementation. The advantages of using the new technology include: improving the finished product functional quality, increasing of productivity and obtained economic effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Cross wedge rolling (CWR) {{is a very}} {{efficient}} technological process which has a favourable effect on properties of rolled products. At the same time, however, this forming technique causes complex non-linear problems resulting from variable contact conditions in the deformation zone. During the rolling process either adhesion or surface slip on the rolling contact surface may occur. The situation is further complicated by complexly-shaped wedge tools with thread-forming grooves. Those problems notwithstanding, the cross wedge rolling process can be examined effectively {{with the aid of}} computer simulations which precede both laboratory and industrial tests. Lublin University of Technology has developed and implemented a novel method of <b>screw</b> <b>spike</b> rolling as well as it has conducted computer simulations and model tests of rolling semi-finished gears. Even though the rolling tests have been carried out on semi-finished gears, it is expected that significant material savings can be yielded in the process of producing finished products. Given the rolling tests conducted on other products, it can be assumed that the quality of produced gears thus can be also improved, in contrast to gears produced by means of metal machining methods. Apart from screw spikes, hot cross wedge rolling also allows to produce coarse-pitch gears, which is not possible in a cold cross wedge rolling operation. ?????????-???????? ????????

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation on the flexural and shear behaviour of a new type of fibre composite sleeper for railway turnout application. The building block of this innovative railway sleeper is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre composite skins and modified phenolic core material that has been specifically developed for civil engineering applications. Three different section configurations for railway sleepers were produced by gluing layers of fibre composite sandwich structure together in flatwise (horizontal) and in edgewise (vertical) orientations and tested under 4 -point static bending and asymmetrical beam shear tests. The effects of the orientation of sandwich lamination on the mechanical behavior of sleepers were investigated. The capacity of the fibre composite sleepers in holding spike-screws was also evaluated. The results showed that the orientation of sandwich laminations has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of fibre composite railway sleepers. The sleeper section with glued sandwich structures in the edgewise position presented appropriate strength and stiffness for railway sleeper application and has high resistance to hold <b>screw</b> <b>spikes.</b> The mechanical properties of the fibre composite sleeper are far better than most of the available composite railway sleepers and are comparable with the existing timber turnout sleepers demonstrating that the new fibre composite sleeper is a viable alternative sleeper material for railway turnouts. ...|$|R
40|$|Spike {{productivity}} was {{the highest}} in genetic resources with a <b>screwed</b> <b>spike</b> rachis (Scr), with standard spike morphotype (NS) and with vertically structured spikelets (VSS). The correlation dependence between the weight of spike kernels and the stalks {{was found to be}} highly significant, indicating that the increasing spike productivity in itself need not be accompanied by adequately increased values of the harvest index. It was proved that the character of the number of kernels in a spike was more important for the formation of the weight of spike kernels than the character of caryopsis weight. The number of kernels in the spike was markedly correlated with the stalk diameter, what is obviously associated with the higher number of vascular bundles nourishing the individual kernels. A significant correlation was found between the number of articulations of the spike rachis and the stage of ear formation, apparently associated with the longer period necessary to form a higher number of articulations of the spike rachis during differentiation of the growth apex in the course of its organogenesis. The highly significant correlation between the weight of spike kernels and number of kernels of spikelets in the spike (r = 0. 75 ++) and negative correlation between the weight of spike kernels and number of spilkelets in spike (r - 0. 35 ++) indicate that forms with a higher number of kernels in the spiklelet (multifloret) are more prospective than forms with more spikelets but less kernels on the respective nodes of the spike rachis. In 1996 and 1997 on 5 m 2 plots in three random replications we studied the effect of increasing seeding rates: 2. 0; 2. 5; 3. 0; 3. 5; 4. 0; 4. 5 and 5. 0 million germinating seeds (MGS) per 1 ha on yield characteristics of three genetic resources of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with a higher weight of grain in the spike, associated with a different spike morphology. We used: KM 142 - 94 with a markedly elongated spike - normal structure (NS) gigas, KM 1307 - 95 with vertical sessile spikelets (VSS), KM 2217 - 95 with <b>screwed</b> <b>spike</b> rachis (SCR) and two control varieties, i. e. Astella and Record. The results confirmed the capacity of the KM-genotypes with a higher spike productivity to maintain a higher spike weight even when the seeding rate was higher. In general, however, the yields of the Astella and Record varieties were considerably higher. Genotypes with a non-standard morphological spike structure showed a lower tillering capacity and lower number of spikes per 1 m 2 compared with the controls. Maximal yields were obtained when the seeding rate was lower (3, 5 4, 5 MGS per 1 ha), while the higher yields of control varieties were obtained with higher seeding rates (4, 0 4, 5 MGS per 1 ha). The weight of the grain in the spike of genotypes with a non-standard spike morphology was higher with all the seeding ratesAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R

The graft used for ACL reconstruction was fresh ovine doubled Achilles tendon (DAT). Femurs and tibias were tested separately. Two mechanical test series were performed on the specimens: a load-to-failure test and a cyclic loading test. On the femoral side, transcondylar screw showed the greatest fixation strength and stiffness and the lowest elongation at cyclic loading. Tibial fixation complexes seemed to have poorer structural properties in comparison to femoral fixation. Among the tibial fixation devices, absorbable screw with staple fixation showed the greatest strength and stiffness. Spiked washer fixation showed the greatest elongation under cyclic loading...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} five {{different}} protection harnesses for hunting dogs against canidae attacks were assessed. Hunting dogs can be attacked and severely injured or killed by wolves (Canis lupus) when released during hunting. So far {{there is no}} effective protection method. Similar problems are reported with African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and dholes (Cuon alpinus) with other domestic animals. In this study the experimental harnesses were presented on a dummy to lure the animals to attack them. The harnesses with physical (<b>screws</b> or <b>spikes</b> on the back) and ultrasound (immediate bite controlled and 19 second continuous ultrasound) deterrents were only assessed during wolf attacks, whereas the harness with electric shocks was also tested on the other two species. Neither physical nor ultrasound deterrents showed a large enough aversive response in the wolves. Electric shocks, given to the animals when biting the dummy, triggered an immediate release of the dummy in all three species. Long term effects differed between species and individuals. The exposed wolf did not touch the dummy again after a second exposure, whereas all except one African wild dog bit the dummy again in consecutive trials. Some individuals returned to bite a second time even in the same trial. An assessment of the long term effect on dholes was not possible, as the individuals were undistinguishable. Based on the data obtained in this study a harness with electric deterrent seems the most promising...|$|R

Embedded in these lush naturalistic forms are fragments of industrial urban culture: iron <b>spikes,</b> <b>screws</b> and hooks. For artist Neil Tetkowski, clay {{is a metaphor for}} the Earth. His art consists of transforming raw material into another state, imbuing it with a sense of soul and identity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fractures of the {{intercondylar}} {{spine of}} the tibia are enigmatic injuries. The mechanism of injury remains obscure, and appropriate treatment is unclear. METHODS: The authors analyzed a series of 26 cases of displaced fractures of the intercondylar eminence of the tibia treated with an arthroscopically placed, intrafocal <b>screw</b> with <b>spiked</b> washer. The patients were reviewed after a minimum follow-up of 24 months and a maximum of 8 years. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had a type II tibia eminence fracture according to Meyers and McKeever (mean age, 15 years; male/female ratio, 11 : 5). Ten patients had a type III tibia eminence fracture (mean age, 17 years; male/female ratio, 1 : 1). We encountered neither stiffness nor iatrogenic chondral abrasion. Only three patients with type II had no laxity. The 13 other patients in this fracture group had a minor laxity without correlation with the clinical result. In four patients with a type III lesion, a residual laxity without functional deficit was noticed. In two cases with a type III lesion, a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament was necessary 3 years after trauma. In four patients with a type III fracture, the fragment remained elevated, with minor impairment of the mobility (extension lag). No mechanical failure or infection was seen in this series. CONCLUSION: The authors found the intrafocal screw fixation for displaced fracture of the intercondylar eminence to be a reliable and safe technique, although complete restoration of the anteroposterior knee stability was seldom seen. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|There was {{a marked}} {{difference}} betwixt {{the appearance of}} these new comers {{and that of the}} party by which our escort had been defeated--and it was greatly in favour of the former. Among the Highlanders who surrounded the Chieftainess, if I may presume to call her so without offence to grammar, were men in the extremity of age, boys scarce able to bear a sword, and even women--all, in short, whom the last necessity urges to take up arms; and it added a shade of bitter shame to the defection which clouded Thornton's manly countenance, when he found that the numbers and position of a foe, otherwise so despicable, had enabled them to conquer his brave veterans. But the thirty or forty Highlanders who now joined the others, were all men in the prime of youth or manhood, active clean-made fellows, whose short hose and belted plaids set out their sinewy limbs to the best advantage. Their arms were as superior to those of the first party as their dress and appearance. The followers of the female Chief had axes, scythes, and other antique weapons, in aid of their guns; and some had only clubs, daggers, and long knives.
