5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} heavy metal had {{branched}} in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known {{for one of}} these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Exodus, Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and Overkill, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.|$|E

5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, {{at a lower price}} to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E
5|$|The team took a brief hiatus after Brands Hatch, {{returning}} for Imola {{once again}} {{but they were}} unable to repeat their previous performance, both cars crashing out. Lancia once again skipped Fuji in Japan, returning for the South African round at Kyalami where Patrese and Nannini led home a 1-2 finish. Although the LC2 earned its second win, none of the leading Porsche teams attended the event in protest of the countries Apartheid laws. Unable to challenge further for the Constructors or Drivers Championships, the team did not attend the final round of the year at Sandown Park in Melbourne, Australia.

Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
25|$|Centrality indices {{have two}} {{important}} limitations, one obvious {{and the other}} subtle.

25|$|Beginning in the 1990s, {{the number}} of comics {{featuring}} Batman mushroomed with spin-off titles, limited series, and graphic novels.

25|$|As the {{economic}} and political capital of Indonesia with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> languages and ethnic groups, it is difficult to describe or define a common culture for Jakarta, as the city attracts many native immigrants, from the vast and diverse Indonesian archipelago, who also bring their various languages, dialects, foods and customs. This diversity of origins and languages leads to differences in regard to religion, traditions and linguistics. However ethnic Betawi are considered as the indigenous people of Jakarta.|$|E
25|$|The single genetic {{regulatory}} network hypothesis {{proposes that}} domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes. For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, {{may be caused}} by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition. These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes. A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> traits.|$|E
25|$|Opitz {{argues that}} the binding of {{different}} brain areas is mediated by the hippocampus. Relational bindings, or relationships between separate objects, concepts, and memories, are very flexible because the targets can be combined in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> {{ways to deal with}} the present situation, and the hippocampus ensures that these parts are arranged into a coherent whole. Particularly, the hippocampus has been implicated in binding that is involved with episodic memory, working memory, and language acquisition. According to Opitz, this is viable because the hippocampus meets all criteria to be suitable for the regulation relational binding and, based on its patterns of activity, it is likely that it is involved.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{restrictions}} of IrisGL was that it only provided access to features supported by the underlying hardware. If the graphics hardware did not support a feature natively, then the application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing software implementations of features unsupported by hardware, allowing applications to use advanced graphics on relatively low-powered systems. OpenGL standardized access to hardware, pushed the development responsibility of hardware interface programs (device drivers) to hardware manufacturers, and delegated windowing functions to the underlying operating system. With <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> kinds of graphics hardware, getting them all to {{speak the same language}} in this way had a remarkable impact by giving software developers a higher level platform for 3D-software development.|$|E
25|$|While California's wine regions can be {{generally}} {{classified as a}} Mediterranean climate, there are also regions with more continental dry climates. Proximity to the Pacific or bays as well as unobstructed access to the cool currents that come off them dictate the relative coolness of the wine region. Areas surrounded by mountain barriers, like some parts of Sonoma and Napa counties will be warmer {{due to the lack}} of this cooling influence. The soil types and landforms of California vary greatly, having been influenced by the plate tectonics of the North American and Pacific Plates. In some areas the soils can be so diverse that vineyards will establish blocks of the same vine variety planted on different soils for purpose of identifying different blending components. This diversity is one of the reasons why California has <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> and distinct American Viticultural Areas.|$|E
25|$|The grape was {{historically}} a major planting in Bordeaux, providing {{color and}} fruit to the blend, {{but in the}} 20th century started to lose ground to Merlot and Cabernet Franc due, in part, to its sensitivities to <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost). The severe 1956 frost wiped out {{a significant portion of}} Malbec vines in Bordeaux, allowing many growers a chance to start anew with different varieties. By 1968 plantings in the Libournais was down to 12,100 acres (4,900 hectares) and fell further to 3,460 acres (1,400 hectares) by 2000. While Malbec has since become a popular component of New World meritages or Bordeaux blends, and it is still a permitted variety in all major wine regions of Bordeaux, its presence in Bordeaux is as a distinctly minor variety. Only the regions of the Côtes-de-Bourg, Blaye and Entre-Deux-Mers have any significant plantings in Bordeaux.|$|E
