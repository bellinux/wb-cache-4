25|$|The phonograph, {{record player}} or {{gramophone}} is {{an instrument for}} recording, reproducing and playing back sounds. The earliest phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was played. Later, the gramophone record with modulated <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves</b> set atop a rotating turntable. The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. On February 8, 1878, Edison was issued the first patent (U.S. patent #200,521) for the phonograph.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{commercial}} disc is {{engraved with}} two sound-bearing concentric <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves,</b> {{one on each}} side, running from the outside edge towards the center. The {{last part of the}} spiral meets an earlier part to form a circle. The sound is encoded by fine variations in the edges of the groove that cause a stylus (needle) placed in it to vibrate at acoustic frequencies when the disc is rotated at the correct speed. Generally, the outer and inner parts of the groove bear no intended sound (exceptions include the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Split Enz's Mental Notes).|$|E
30|$|During the {{polishing}} process, it {{was found}} that the surface roughness of the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and the outer surface were not changed much at 5, 10, and 15  min, and the surface roughness was significantly lower than that of the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> at a time of 20  min. The roughness of the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and the outer surface are basically the same at 50  min, and no longer change. In this case, the Ra value was 0.93  μm as determined using a hand-held surface roughness meter. Therefore, it can be determined that the surface roughness value Ra of the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> is also 0.93  μm. This indicates that the limit of the surface roughness for the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> polishing under this particular process condition is 0.93  μm.|$|R

30|$|If β′ {{can be made}} {{consistent}} with the design curve of a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the workpiece surface through an adjustment, then the abrasive balls will generate a relative helical motion that runs against the curve of a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the surface, thereby producing a cutting polish. The design curve of a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the workpiece surface is taken as a reference for the relative motion of the abrasive balls. Therefore, not only can the polishing mentioned above reduce the surface roughness of a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove,</b> it can also correct any errors in shape.|$|R
500|$|The {{shell of}} this species was given the common name [...] "Scotch bonnet" [...] because of a vague {{resemblance}} to a tam o' shanter, a traditional tartan hat {{which used to be}} commonly worn in Scotland. The shell has a regular pattern of square or rectangular patches that are orange, tan, or brown in color. The shell can sometimes be smooth except for growth lines, but in other individuals it can have a sculpture of incised <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves</b> and even weak axial ribs which, together with the colored patches on the shell, create an effect that is reminiscent of the pattern of a Scottish plaid.|$|E
500|$|The egg-shaped {{shell of}} this species usually grows to 40–55mm in length (1 1/2" [...] - 2 1/8") (the maximum {{recorded}} shell length is 121mm (4.76in)). It is thick and solid, with a moderately high spire and rounded body whorl, and adult specimens have approximately five whorls. The protoconch is rounded, colored cream with an orange to brown apex. The teleoconch is sculptured by <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves</b> crossed by mostly rather faint growth lines. Its surface varies {{in the degree of}} shell sculpture that is present. Some shells are completely smooth with a high gloss, whereas other shells are grooved. The surface of some shells is granulated, and some even have nodules on the shoulders of the whorls. Several times at different growth stages, the shell develops a thick outer lip, which is characteristic of the subfamily Cassinae. The snail rests between each of these stages of growth, and usually absorbs the entire outer lip before it begins to grow again. In some cases, especially in deep water, the Scotch bonnet does not absorb the outer lip completely, leaving behind a varix on the whorls of the mature shell.|$|E

30|$|With {{the typical}} {{structure}} of a rotor <b>spiral</b> <b>groove,</b> the component is equipped with the function of a grooved cylindrical cam. The curve of the groove {{was designed to be}} a trade–off between a sinusoid and an exponential curve. The left and right sides of the curve intersect, and a curve connection is employed at the reverse location for a transition, forming a closed cycle. As a result, its groove shape is much more complicated than that of a common rotor <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> [21]. Therefore, it is of universal significance for the polishing of a rotor <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> to verify the groove drum.|$|R

2500|$|Thin, closely spaced <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves</b> {{that allow}} for {{increased}} playing time on a rpm microgroove LP lead to a tinny pre-echo warning of upcoming loud sounds. The cutting stylus unavoidably transfers some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. It is discernible by some listeners throughout certain recordings, but a quiet passage followed by a loud sound will allow anyone to hear a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time. This problem can also appear as [...] "post"-echo, with a tinny ghost of the sound arriving 1.8 seconds after its main impulse.|$|E
2500|$|Like I. brasiliensis, the largetooth cookiecutter shark is an {{ectoparasite}} {{that feeds}} by excising plugs of flesh from larger animals. While I. brasiliensis is theorized to latch {{onto the surface}} of its prey and bite with a twisting motion, producing a circular wound containing <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves</b> inside from its lower teeth, the largetooth cookiecutter shark seems to employ a [...] "sweeping" [...] bite that produces a larger, more elongate (twice as long as the width of the mouth), oval wound containing parallel tooth grooves. This shark has been known to bite bony fishes, sharks, and marine mammals. One study has found that the largetooth cookiecutter shark is responsible for 80% of the cookiecutter wounds found on cetaceans off Bahia, Brazil. The flank was the most often-attacked area, followed by the head and abdomen. In at least three cases, bites to dolphins appeared to have resulted in their subsequent deaths by stranding. Another prey species in the area is the subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis); at least two cases of juveniles fatally stranding after being bitten have also been recorded.|$|E
60|$|Now, however, {{with the}} terrible {{artillery}} invented in modern times, a single man, {{if he has}} the requisite courage, coolness, and steadiness of nerve, is a match for such a lion. The weapon used is a double-barreled carabine, both barrels being rifled, that is, provided with <b>spiral</b> <b>grooves</b> within, that operate to give the bullets a rotary motion as they issue from the muzzle, by which they bore {{their way through the}} air, as it were, to their destination, with a surprising directness and precision. The bullets discharged by these carabines are not balls, but cylinders, pointed with a cone at the forward end. They are hollow, and are filled with a fulminating composition which is capable of exploding with a force vastly greater than that of gunpowder. The conical point at the end is made separate from the body of the cylinder, and slides into it by a sort of shank, which, when the bullet strikes the body of the lion or other wild beast, acts like a sort of percussion cap to explode the fulminating powder, and thus the instant that the missile enters the animal's body it bursts with a terrible explosion, and scatters the iron fragments of the cylinder among his vitals. Thus, while an ordinary musket ball might lodge in his flesh, or even pass entirely through some parts of his body, without producing any other effect than to arouse him to a phrensy, and redouble the force with which he would spring upon his foe, the bursting of one of these fulminating bullets almost any where within his body brings him down in an instant, and leaves him writhing and rolling upon the ground in the agonies of death.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} compare {{optimized}} pump per-formance of a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> viscous pump with a shrouded Rayleigh-step viscous pump {{as well as}} with. the semicircular multilobe viscous pump (Etsion and Yaier, 1988). Their {{results show that the}} <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and Rayleigh-step viscous pumps are comparable to each other and that both pumps produce higher flow rates than the multilobe viscous pump for the operating conditions (as represented by AP/A) investigated. The optimization of the multilobe viscous pump performed by Etsion and Yaier (1988) is limited and is revised in Mainland and Green (1991). Figure A-l duplicates Fig. 10, the pump performance curve, and shows that the revised multilobe op-timization still results in less pumping capability than the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> viscous pump. An improvement to the multilobe vis-cous pump is the V-lobe viscous pump of Mainland and Green (1991). Still, the best possible V-lobe pump, which has nine lobes for the operating conditions shown, is outperformed by the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> pump as shown in Fig. A-l. Note, however, that the pumps are compared for a relatively large value of the operating conditions parameter, AP/A. These large values correspond for example to those that would be encountered in gas applications. For liquid applications, the operating con-ditions parameter could be much smaller due to the relatively larger viscosity. Optimization of the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> viscous pump (Eq. (1)) was reproduced by the discussers and was extended over a larger range of AP/A as shown in Fig. A- 2. Figure A- 2 also shows a comparison of the viscous pumps over the larger range of the operating conditions parameter. The pumping capabilities of the semicircular lobe is consistently lower than the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and V-lobe viscous pumps. Although the comparison between <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and V-lobe pumps depends on the number of lobes selected for the V-lobe, in general it can be concluded that at relatively large values of the operating conditions parameter (e. g., gas applications) the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> performs the best.
