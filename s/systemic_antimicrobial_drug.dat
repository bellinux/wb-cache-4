Veterinarians have higher rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal {{carriage}} compared {{to the general population}} and many human infections have been attributed to close animal contacts. Researchers in Europe favor the view that livestock particularly pigs and horses may represent an important reservoir for MRSA. In studies from three continents, MRSA has been isolated from retail meat products from milk and meat samples and from meat industry workers. Some studies have not found any colonization among surveyed pets, for example, among 200 healthy dogs in Europe. One outbreak of MRSA in a family was linked to pet cat. The clearance of ST 80 MRSA colonization in family member with furunculosis did not occur until <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> therapy was administered to the cat, which was colonized with same strain.

40|$|Background: Acne vulgaris is {{the most}} common skin disease. Local and <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> are used for its treatment. But {{increasing}} resistance of Propionibacterium acnes to antibiotics has been reported. Materials and Methods: In a double-blind clinical trial, 40 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were recruited. one side of the face was treated with Clindamycin Gel 1 % and the other side with Azithromycin Topical Gel 2 % BID for 8 weeks and then they were assessed. Results: Average age was 21. 8 ± 7 years. 82. 5 % of them were female. Average number of papules, pustules and comedones was similarly reduced in both groups and, no significant difference was observed between the two groups (P > 0. 05, repeated measurs ANOVA). The mean indexes of ASI and TLC also significantly decreased during treatment in both groups, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. (P > 0. 05, repeated measurs ANOVA). Also, impact of both drugs on papules and pustules was 2 - 3 times greater than the effect on comedones. Average satisfaction score was not significant between the two groups (P = 0. 6, repeated measurs ANOVA). finally, frequency distribution of complications was not significant between the two groups (P > 0. 05, Fisher Exact test). Conclusion: Azithromycin gel has medical impact at least similar to Clindamycin Gel in treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, and it may be consider as suitable drug for resistant acne to conventional topical therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the actual practice of}} diagnostics {{and treatment of}} patients with acute tonsillitis in order to assess the quality of primary prophylaxis of poststreptococcal diseases in different regions of Russia. Material and methods. The medical charts of 1333 adult outpts with acute tonsillitis in seven cities were analyzed. The data on each pts such as demographics, case history, bacteriological examinations results, prescribed medications, adverse events and outcomes of therapy were documented in case record forms. Data management was carried out using software. Results. Microbiological identifications of group A-streptococcus (GAS) were performed only in 0, 3 % of analyzed cases, so diagnosis of tonsillitis was based commonly on clinical data. <b>Systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> were prescribed to 95, 3 % of pts, among them to 91, 5 % as monotherapy and to 3, 8 % as combined therapy. Ampicillin was the most often initial antimicrobial (45, 0 %), other relatively frequently prescribed drugs were erythomycin (19, 1 %), ciprofloxacin (7, 0 %), doxycycline (5, 6 %), amoxycillin (5, 2 %), midecamycin (4, 4 %), ampicillin/oxacillin (3, 2 %). Two courses of antimicrobials were used in 8, 5 % of pts. The average duration of antibacterial therapy was 7, 4 ± 3, 4 days. The adverse events were noted in 0, 9 % of analyzed cases. Conclusion. The main problems of primary prophylaxis of poststreptococcal diseases were: (1) the diagnosis of tonsillitis without microbiological GAS identification, (2) prescribing antimicrobials without consideration of appropriate recommendation and (3) the lack of pathogen eradication control...|$|R

40|$|Importance: Inappropriate {{antimicrobial}} prescribing {{leads to}} antimicrobial resistance and suboptimal clinical outcomes. Changing antimicrobial prescribing {{is a complex}} behavioral process that is not often {{taken into account in}} antimicrobial stewardship programs. Objective: To examine whether an antimicrobial stewardship approach grounded in behavioral theory and focusing on preserving prescriber autonomy and participation is effective in improving appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Dutch Unique Method for Antimicrobial Stewardship (DUMAS) study was a prospective, stepped-wedge, participatory intervention study performed from October 1, 2011, through December 31, 2015. Outcomes were measured during a baseline period of 16 months and an intervention period of 12 months. The study was performed at 7 clinical departments (2 medical, 3 surgical, and 2 pediatric) in a tertiary care medical center and a general teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Physicians prescribing <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> for any indication for patients admitted to the participating departments during the study period were included in the study. Interventions: We offered prescribers a free choice of how to improve their antimicrobial prescribing. Prescribers were stimulated to choose interventions with higher potential for success based on a root cause analysis of inappropriate prescribing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions was determined using a validated approach based on guideline adherence and motivated guideline deviation and measured with repeated point prevalence surveys (6 per year). Appropriateness judgment was masked for the study period. Antimicrobial consumption was extracted from pharmacy records and measured as days of therapy per admission. We used linear and logistic mixed-model regression analysis to model outcomes over time. Results: A total of 1121 patient cases with 700 antimicrobial prescriptions were assessed during the baseline period and 882 patient cases with 531 antimicrobial prescriptions during the intervention period. The mean antimicrobial appropriateness increased from 64. 1 % at intervention start to 77. 4 % at 12 -month follow-up (+ 13. 3 %; relative risk, 1. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 1. 27), without a change in slope. No decrease in antimicrobial consumption was found. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of a behavioral approach preserving prescriber autonomy resulted in an increase in antimicrobial appropriateness sustained for at least 12 months. The approach is inexpensive and could be easily transferable to various health care environments. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to answer}} three {{relevant}} questions: can <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> be efficacious if the biofilm is not disrupted? Can the type of debridement of the subgingival biofilm impact upon the clinical outcomes of the adjunctive antimicrobial therapy? Is {{the efficacy of the}} adjunctive <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy dependent {{on the quality of the}} debridement of the subgingival biofilm and the sequence debridement-antibiotic usage? Material and Methods: Relevant papers were searched, critically analysed and their data were extracted. Results: For the first question, studies assessing susceptibility of bacteria in biofilms, and clinical studies evaluating <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> as monotherapy, were reviewed. For the second question, clinical studies comparing <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> as adjuncts to non-surgical debridement or to periodontal surgery and clinical trials using systemic antibiotics with periodontal surgery were evaluated.

We reviewed the literature from January 1980 to November 2003 to identify rigorous evaluations of interventions to improve hospital prescribing of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs.</b> We identified 66 studies with interpretable data, of which 16 reported 20 microbiologic outcomes: gram-negative resistant bacteria, 10 studies; Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea, 5 studies; vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 3 studies; and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 2 studies.

40|$|Fifteen years (1984 – 1998) {{of records}} from a Veterinary Teaching Hospital were {{analyzed}} {{to determine whether}} <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. intermedius) isolated from clinical infections in dogs has increased, and whether {{there has been a}} change in the species of bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections in dogs. In coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp., a complex pattern showing both increases and decreases of resistance to different classes of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> was observed, reflecting the changing use of different <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> classes in the hospital over a similar period (1990 – 1999). In canine urinary tract infections identified from 1984 to 1998, an increase in the incidence of multiresistant Enterococcus spp. was apparent, with marginal increases also in incidence in Enterobacter spp. and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both of which, like Enterococcus spp., are innately antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.

40|$|Although {{conventional}} <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have been}} viewed as miraculous cure-alls for the past 80 years, increasing <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> resistance requires a major and rapid intervention. However, the development of novel but still conventional <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably {{only a matter of}} time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that offer a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fields, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development...|$|R

The ten patients in the other group included three cases of fungal ulcers, three mixed (fungal and viral) ulcers, three viral ulcers, and one bacterial ulcer as proven with microbial culture and sensitivity tests. Eight cases of the control group and seven cases of the other group were associated with hypopyon. Before laser treatment, a drop of benoxinate hydrochloride  0. 4 % and a single drop of fluorescein sodium  0. 25 % were instilled. Argon laser irradiation of the affected cornea was performed using an argon  532  nm wavelength (Carl Zeiss LSL  532 s AG; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). A spot size of  500  µm, pulse duration of  0. 2  seconds, and power of  900  mW were used. All cases were followed up for  3  months after healing was achieved.

40|$|<b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> are fed {{to animals}} at low levels to treat diseases, to promote growth, and to {{increase}} feed efficiency. Incorporating low levels of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> in livestock feeds {{has been shown to}} be a factor stimulating the development of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> resistant bacteria in livestock. Since many of the drugs used to treat livestock are the same as or are related to drugs used in human health care, there is concern that resistant organisms may pass from animals to humans through the handling of animals or food derived from animals. The movement of pathogens from animals to humans, and vice versa, has been documented, but the extent to which it has occurred or could occur is unknown. Although it is estimated that as little as 10 percent of the problems of drug-resistant pathogens in humans originate in livestock health care practices, there is currently considerable debate about the frequency and costs of human disease outbreaks resulting from animals infected with drug-resistant pathogens. Several European countries have banned the growth-promoting use of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> in livestock production as a precautionary measure to prevent resistant organisms from passing from animals to humans. This report presents preliminary estimates suggesting that discontinuing the use of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> in hog production would initially decrease feed efficiency, raise feed costs, reduce production, and raise prices to consumers. Longer term effects were not examined. <b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs,</b> pathogens, growth promotion, feed efficiency, therapeutic drug use, subtherapeutic drug use, subclinical, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> was {{evaluated}} the Internal Medicine Service of the National Hospital "Dos de Mayo," hospital of level IV place in Lima. The {{objective of the}} study was evaluate the use of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> through selected and developed Indicators in "How To Investigate you <b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>Drug</b> use in Hospital" published by Management Sciences for Health (MSH). This is a retrospective study of descriptive type, carried out during the months january to june the year 2002, was revised the clinical histories of 401 patients that after applying the approaches of inclusion and exclusion was selected 180 of them that they was patients that received treatment with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs,</b> obtaining it that the 44, 89 % they of hospitalized patients receive treatment with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs,</b> the number average of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> that was prescribed for patient hospitalized with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> was 2, 58 + 0, 40, the 91, 38 % of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> was prescribed according to the National Petitorio of Essential Medications, the 97, 63 % of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> was prescribed for generic name, the average of the treatment with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> was from 5, 34 + 0, 51 days, the average of hospitalization of patients with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> was from 15, 94 + 2, 36 days, in the 9, 44 % of patient a sensibility test was executed, the 69, 60 % of patients with doses antimicrobial prescribed was really administered, the cost average of treatment with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> for patient was from US $ 65. 92 + 11. 96. We could conclude that patients’ high percentage exists that they receive <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs,</b> these was prescribed for their generic name and with high adherence to the National Petitorio of Essential Medications. The number of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> that was prescribed for patient was 2 to 3. The duration of the treatment was short, but the cost is elevated favoring the percentage of dose of drugs not administered, being this significantly high. Se evaluó el uso de antimicrobianos en el Servicio de Medicina Interna del Hospital Nacional “Dos de Mayo”, hospital de nivel IV ubicado en Lima. El objetivo del estudio fue evaluar el uso de antimicrobianos a través de indicadores seleccionados y desarrollados en “Cómo investigar drogas antimicrobianas usada en hospital" publicado por Management Sciences for Health (MSH). Estudio retrospectivo de tipo descriptivo, realizado durante los meses de enero a junio del año 2002, se revisó las historias clínicas de 401 pacientes que después de aplicar los criterios de inclusión y exclusión se seleccionaron 180 de ellas que fueron pacientes que recibieron tratamiento con drogas antimicrobianas, obteniéndose que el 44, 89 % de pacientes hospitalizados reciben tratamiento con drogas antimicrobianas, el número promedio de drogas antimicrobianas que se prescribió por paciente hospitalizado con antimicrobiano fue 2, 58 + 0, 40, el 91, 38 % de drogas antimicrobianas se prescribió de acuerdo al Petitorio Nacional de Medicamentos Esenciales, el 97, 63 % de drogas antimicrobianas se prescribió por nombre genérico, el promedio del tratamiento con droga antimicrobiana fue de 5, 34 + 0, 51 días, el promedio de hospitalización de pacientes con drogas antimicrobianas fue de 15, 94 + 2, 36 días, en el 9, 44 % de pacientes se ejecutó un test de sensibilidad, el 69, 60 % de pacientes con dosis antimicrobianas prescritas fue realmente administrados, el costo promedio de tratamiento con droga antimicrobiana por paciente fue de US $ 65. 92 + 11. 96. Podemos concluir que existe un alto porcentaje de pacientes que reciben drogas antimicrobianas, estas se prescribieron por su nombre genérico y con alta adherencia al Petitorio Nacional de Medicamentos Esenciales.
