50|$|Gastrointestinal {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most common causes of acute nausea and vomiting. Chronic nausea may be the presentation of many gastrointestinal disorders, occasionally <b>as</b> the major <b>symptom,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> gastroesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, peptic ulcer, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, hepatitis, upper gastrointestinal malignancy, and pancreatic cancer. Uncomplicated Helicobacter pylori infection does not cause chronic nausea.|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with neuroacanthocytosis {{also often}} suffer from parkinsonism, the {{uncontrolled}} slowness of movements, and dystonia, abnormal body postures.

50|$|In general, none of {{the signs}} of {{pre-eclampsia}} are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy {{are more likely to}} have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a <b>symptom</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Hypothalamic {{hypopituitarism}} {{is relatively}} rare cause of secondary adrenal deficiency {{which is often}} accompanied by severe hypoglycemia. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy is essential for this condition, but gastrointestinal <b>symptom</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> nausea and vomiting is not well-recognized adverse effect of hydrocortisone.

5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> fatigue.|$|E
5|$|High {{blood lead}} levels in adults are also {{associated}} with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> depression and anxiety. It {{was found in a}} large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that blood lead levels in the range of 20–50μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects. Increases in blood lead levels from about 50 to about 100μg/dL in adults {{have been found to be}} associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.|$|E
30|$|We {{should be}} aware of the {{possibility}} of hypothalamic hypopituitarism as a cause of recurrent severe hypoglycemia. In addition, although gastrointestinal symptom is not common adverse effect of hydrocortisone, we {{should be aware}} that hydrocortisone could induce several gastrointestinal <b>symptom</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> nausea and/or vomiting. <b>Such</b> <b>symptom</b> disturbs sufficient steroid hormone replacement and leads to recurrent hypoglycemia. Therefore, in such a case we should stop hydrocortisone and instead start an alternative treatment with prednisolone without any hesitation in order to sufficiently replace steroid hormone and to avoid recurrent hypoglycemia.|$|R
50|$|The {{discussion}} {{of music as}} hypnosis was a development of Franz Mesmer, a German physician who invented the theory of ‘animal magnetism’ in the 18th century, combined with the romantic aesthetics of music that portrayed mesmeric trances to the self. It is a new conception {{of the self and}} the sensual aesthetics of music that portrayed musical mesmeric trance as a treatment to <b>symptom</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hysteria. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing music on a glass armonica.|$|R

5|$|In {{its current}} version, the BDI-II is {{designed}} for individuals aged 13 and over, and is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished, {{as well as physical}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> fatigue, weight loss, and lack of interest in sex.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> anxiety may simply {{indicate that the}} drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E
5|$|Resolution of DKA {{is defined}} as general {{improvement}} in the <b>symptoms,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the ability to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administrered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a {{rare disease}} of unknown {{etiology}} and only sporadic cases {{have been reported in}} the literature. This disease may be presented with a nonspesific <b>symptom</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> persistent cough and exact diagnosis may be delayed. This report describes a case presented with an only symptom of prolonged cough and could be diagnosed lately as TO. Physicians should consider TO in the differential diagnosis of persistent cough and further evaluation should be performed in order to identify the underlying cause in patients with chronic cough...|$|R
40|$|Children with deficits {{of higher}} mental {{function}} are often referred to paediatricians and child neurologists. The referrals may occur for the specific evaluation of a child’s school difficulties or because of a <b>symptom,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> school refusal, headache or deterioration in behaviour. It is generally accepted that examination of the higher mental abilities could be a routine part of a complete neurological examination in any child presenting with such problems.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar <b>symptoms,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause <b>symptoms</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like <b>symptoms,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
