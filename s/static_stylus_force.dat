5000|$|Quality arms employ an {{adjustable}} counterweight {{to offset the}} mass of the arm and various cartridges and headshells. On this counterweight, a calibrated dial enables easy adjustment of <b>stylus</b> <b>force.</b> After perfectly balancing the arm, the dial itself is [...] "zeroed"; the <b>stylus</b> <b>force</b> can then be dialed in by screwing the counterweight towards the fulcrum. (Sometimes a separate spring or smaller weight provides fine tuning.) <b>Stylus</b> <b>forces</b> of 10 to 20 mN (1 to 2 grams-force) are typical for modern consumer turntables, while forces of up to 50 mN (5 grams) are common for the tougher environmental demands of party deejaying or turntablism. Of special adjustment consideration, Stanton cartridges of the 681EE(E) series others like them feature a small record brush ahead of the cartridge. The upforce of this brush, and its added drag require compensation of both tracking force (add 1 gram) and anti-skating adjustment values (see next paragraph for description).|$|R

The profile of the surface was determined by a line scan using a pin-type profilometer (P- 12, KLA-Tencor Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA). The scan speed of 200 [*]μm[*]s− 1, scan length of 12 [*]mm, and <b>stylus</b> <b>force</b> of 10 [*]mg were the main parameters for the scanning.

40|$|A novel {{design of}} {{displacement}} profiler with a controllable <b>stylus</b> <b>force</b> is presented. It provides highly controlled conditions for contact measurement of, for example, small step heights or surface roughness. Incorporating an electromagnetic force actuator and force feedback control, the profiler provides electronically selectable contact {{force in the}} range of 0. 01 – 10 mN and gives a constant static and dynamic loading. In a typical configuration, it has a range of a few micrometers with a discrimination to better than 1 nm at a bandwidth higher than that of a conventional stylus instrument...|$|R
50|$|Different {{materials}} for the stylus have been used over time. Thomas Edison introduced the use of sapphire in 1892 {{and the use of}} diamond in 1910 for his cylinder phonographs. The Edison Diamond Disc players (1912-1929), when properly played, hardly ever required the stylus to be changed. The styli for vinyl records were also made out of sapphire or diamond. A specific case is the specific stylus type of Bang & Olufsen's (B&O) moving magnet cartridge MMC 20CL, mostly used in parallel arm B&O turntables in the 4002/6000 series. It uses a sapphire stem on which a diamond tip is fixed by a special adhesive. A stylus tip mass as low as 0.3 milligram is the result and full tracking only requires 1 gram of <b>stylus</b> <b>force,</b> reducing record wear even further. Maximum distortion (2nd harmonic) fell below 0.6%.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the influence of tracking force the signal fidelity in stylus profilometry. To do this, a simple, retrofit variable force actuator has been designed, built and assessed. This consists of a permanent magnet attached to the stylus arm about which is a noncontacting solenoid actuating coil. This simple device readily provides a continuously variable <b>stylus</b> <b>force</b> over the range 0. 01 to 15 mN. Using this, surface finish values on specimens of steel, aluminium, brass and copper have been measured over a range of stylus loads and traverse speeds. Analysis of these traces has been carried out both by evaluation of the surface finish parameters, Rq, Ra, RMS slope and RMS peak curvature and a qualitative analysis using scanning electron microscopy. As might be expected, results indicate that stylus techniques give consistently reproducible values over a wide range of loads and speeds. However, limits are identified outside which erroneous values of surface finish parameters may be obtained or damage incurred if excessive loads or improper tracking speeds are used...|$|R

5|$|Presented in {{traditional}} 2-D animation sprites, the game {{consists of three}} modes to help navigate, {{the map of the}} Dragon World, the area maps, and the battle mode. The world map will be available from the start, and will allow players easy access to each of the areas throughout the game. On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields, forests, caves, and towns on the top screen. The touch screen will display available equipment that can be used while in fields. These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno-Caps which can be bought, given, or found in various spots and or treasure chests. Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts. However, some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts. The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss, their stats and the command select icon presented via the touch screen. The game makes little to no use of the <b>stylus,</b> <b>forcing</b> players to rely on the control pad.|$|R
50|$|On the {{underside}} of the platter a large magnet is placed over the spindle, surrounding the coils and forming the motor drive, thus eliminating loss through power transfer. The SL-1200 utilizes a Frequency Generator Servo Control Quartz Lock system that is claimed to produce the most accurate and consistent speed possible. The system is immune to <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>stylus</b> drag which otherwise cause unwanted speed variances that change the pitch and tempo of the music.|$|R
50|$|A {{diamond stylus}} is moved {{vertically}} {{in contact with}} a sample and then moved laterally across the sample for a specified distance and specified contact force. A profilometer can measure small surface variations in vertical stylus displacement {{as a function of}} position. A typical profilometer can measure small vertical features ranging in height from 10 nanometres to 1 millimetre. The height position of the diamond stylus generates an analog signal which is converted into a digital signal, stored, analyzed, and displayed. The radius of diamond stylus ranges from 20 nanometres to 50 μm, and the horizontal resolution is controlled by the scan speed and data signal sampling rate. The <b>stylus</b> tracking <b>force</b> can range from less than 1 to 50 milligrams.|$|R
40|$|A {{hardness}} tester, especially {{adapted for}} grain, was constructed by modifying a commercial portable soft metal tester {{known as the}} Barcol Impressor. A preloaded <b>stylus</b> is <b>forced</b> into grain sections prepared {{by means of a}} microtome. The displacement of the stylus, measured by a dial micrometer, is used as a hardness index. This has been related to the Vickers diamond pyramid hardness which is a standard metallurgical test. A number of hardness measurements may be made on a single transverse kernel section. The tester may be used for all wheat varieties. Significant variations in hardness within a single wheat kernel section have been demonstrated. While the hardness of a block of lead varied over ±½ hardness lumber, a kernel section of hard winter (Ponca) wheat exhibited hardness numbers ranging from 25 to 40, on the arbitrary scale of this tester...|$|R
40|$|The cytoplasmic surface {{topography}} of purple membranes imaged by the {{atomic force microscope}} depends mainly on the force applied to the <b>stylus.</b> Imaged at <b>forces</b> of 300 pN, individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules reveal two domains. The resulting donut-shaped trimers reversibly transform into structures exhibiting three prominent protrusions when scanned at 100 pN. In parallel, {{the height of the}} protein moiety above the lipid layer increases from 4 A to 6 A. From the known structure of bacteriorhodopsin it appears that this change may be related to a bending of the most prominent cytoplasmic loop...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{direct-drive}} turntables may suffer from vibration {{due to the}} motor, which is less of an issue for belt-drive turntables. However, in recent years, shock-absorbing (less dense) material, placed between the motor and platter, {{has been used to}} cut back on vibrations. The torque on direct-drive turntables is usually much higher than on belt drive models. This means the platter speed is less susceptible to outside <b>forces</b> (<b>stylus,</b> hand). Higher torque also means the platter will accelerate to its proper speed faster so less distortion is heard when the record begins to play.|$|R
40|$|Historically, busbar pull {{tests have}} been used as a measure of metal-silicon {{adhesion}} for silicon solar cells; however, such measurements cannot be easily applied to evaluate finger adhesion and the propensity of metal fingers to peel. Finger adhesion will be increasingly important as the width of fingers decrease and busbars are effectively removed from the cell metallization. In this paper, we correlate metal-plated finger dislodgement measurements, which have been obtained using a stylus-based metallization testing tool, and busbar pull test forces with nanoindentation measurements of the Young's modulus in order to determine key determinants of strong finger adhesion. It is proposed that metal fingers with a higher Young's modulus dislodge at lower <b>stylus</b> impact <b>forces</b> because the energy associated with the impact is less easily dissipated along the fingers and consequently remains more focused on the impact location, causing not only finger dislodgement but more extensive finger peeling as well. It is shown how plating rate, chemistry, grid geometry, and postplating annealing can all contribute to plated metal finger adhesion, therefore necessitating an understanding of these factors for reliable plated metallization...|$|R

Forces are measured at the surgical instruments and fed back into the surgeon’s hands using multi-dimensional haptic <b>styluses.</b> Integration of <b>force</b> feedback with stereo vision, as offered by the system, will improve accuracy, drastically reduce the time needed for operations and tissue trauma, along with a reduction of stress on the surgeon. This {{could lead to a}} wider acceptance of robotic surgery by both, patients and surgeons.

40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{bridging the gap}} between atomic force microscopes (AFMs) and stylus profiling instruments is described. The constant force profiler is capable of subnanometer resolution over a 15 -mum vertical range with a horizontal traverse length of 50 mm. This long traverse length, coupled with the possibilities of utilizing standard radius, diamond measurement <b>styli,</b> make the <b>force</b> profiler more compatible with existing profiling instrument standards. The forces between the specimen and a diamond stylus tipped cantilever spring are sensed as displacements using a capacitance bridge. This displacement signal is then fed through a proportional plus integral controller to a high stability piezoelectric actuator to maintain a constant tip-to-sample force of approximately 100 nN. Much of the sensor head and traverse mechanism is made of Zerodur glass-ceramic to provide the thermal stability needed for long travel measurements. Profiles of a 30 -nm silica step height standard and an 8. 5 -mum step etched on Zerodur are presented...|$|R
40|$|A single-beam {{gradient}} trap {{could potentially}} be used to hold a <b>stylus</b> for scanning <b>force</b> microscopy. With a view to development of this technique, we modeled the optical trap as a harmonic oscillator and therefore characterized it by its force constant. We measured force constants and resonant frequencies for 1 - 4 -mu m-diameter polystyrene spheres in a single-beam gradient trap using measurements of back-scattered light. Force constants were determined with both Gaussian and doughnut laser modes, with powers of 3 and 1 mW, respectively. Typical values for spring constants were measured to be between 10 (- 6) and 4 x 10 (- 6) N/m. The resonant frequencies of trapped particles were measured to be between 1 and 10 kHz, and the rms amplitudes of oscillations were estimated to be around 40 nm. Our results confirm {{that the use of}} the doughnut mode for single-beam trapping is more efficient in the axial direction. (C) 1996 Optical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Haptic {{perception}} {{constitutes an}} important component of our everyday interaction with many products. At the same time, several studies have, in recent years, demonstrated the importance of involving the emotions in the user-product interaction process. The present study was designed to investigate whether haptic interactions can affect, or modulate, people’s responses to standardized emotional stimuli. 36 participants completed a self- assessment test concerning their emotional state utilizing as a pointer either a PHANToM device simulating a viscous force field while they moved the stylus, or else a <b>stylus</b> with no <b>force</b> field. During the presentation of the emotional pictures, various physiological parameters were recorded from participants. The results revealed {{a significant difference in the}} self-reported arousal associated with the pictures but no significant difference in the physiological measures. The behavioural findings are interpreted in terms of an effect of the haptic feedback on participants’ perceived/interpreted emotional arousal. These results suggest that haptic feedback could, in the future, be used to modify participants’ interpretation of their physiological states...|$|R
40|$|Instrumentation {{design and}} {{characterization}} {{and the initial}} results of {{an investigation into the}} frictional behaviour of a diamond stylus at loads in the region 0. 5 – 5 mN are presented. Lapped specimens of mild steel, copper, brass, aluminium and polished silicon were traversed by a stylus-based profilometer that had been modified to allow continuous variation of the tracking force. A high-compliance force actuator was used for this purpose. System testing, by loading up to 6 mN and then relaxing, resulted in permanent deformation of the metal specimens from 80 nm for steel up to 340 nm for aluminium. These values are consistent with other known microhardness results for a blunt punch of approximately 2 μm diameter. Horizontal drag forces were measured by fixing the specimens to a linear spring with its displacement axis parallel to the traverse axis of the <b>stylus.</b> Drag <b>forces</b> during traverse cause submicrometre deflections of the spring platform which are measured by an inductive transducer. The overall precision of the force measurement is approximately 10 μN for a 10 mN range. Typical friction coefficients were found to vary from 0. 07 for silicon to 0. 25 for aluminium. These coefficients vary little with the load and show a slight tendency to decrease with increasing traverse speed. Variations of the drag force about a mean value were observed to be dependent upon the surface finish. Consistency with a simple model implying that the variations should depend on the local surface slope is demonstrated by a strong correlation between the frictional drag and the first derivative of the surface profile...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking <b>force,</b> the <b>stylus</b> arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the <b>stylus</b> side <b>force</b> varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|R
40|$|Products are {{routinely}} being manufactured with features having dimensions below 50 µm, with consequent of increasing demand for micro-coordinate measuring machines (micro-CMMs) that have stylus systems with tip diameters of 10 µm or less. However, current commercially available micro-CMMs {{are unable to}} fulfil this demand reliably. Therefore, with this in mind, {{the development of a}} stylus system with a significantly smaller dimension and the potential to fulfil this demand is reported. After an initial review of {{the current state of the}} art and the projected needs, this thesis examine in detail the design considerations and analytical modelling of stylus systems. A key factors affecting styli as their dimension is reduced down to the micrometre level are identified and discussed. Based on five important groups of theses influence factors, a new comprehensive set of design rules and analytical models is constructed and the relationship among these rules observed. Maintaining a <b>stylus</b> contact <b>force</b> that reliably detect the measured surface at reasonable operation speeds while having a sufficiently slender and strong stylus shaft become an issue of particular importance. Experimental investigation of a set of prototype micro-styli is used both to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design rules and to compare different manufacturing methods that have been proposed elsewhere. The model underlying the design rules are shown to be generally consistent within existing uncertainty, except for anomalies with one of manufacturing process which is a combination process of Wire Electro-Discharge Grinding (WEDG) and micro-electrochemical (ECM) process for manufacturing of stylus shaft. The surface quality of spherical form deviation of stylus tip is also a major factor in the uncertainty in the scale of measurement. Therefore, the final part of this work develops and demonstrate a new measurement technique for spherical form error of the micro-styli with tip diameter below than 10 µm. This methods employed a coherence scanning interferometry, together with new rotational referencing manipulation system and new technique of data fusion. Practical testing was conducted to 300 µm diameter sphere, with a typical uncertainty below 30 nm being obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} self-assembled growth of Ag 2 Ga nano-needles on batch {{fabricated}} micro-grippers are reported. The room temperature growth of Ag 2 Ga nano-needles have been recently developed as <b>stylus</b> for Atomic <b>Force</b> Microscopy (AFM). Integration of such nano-needles onto batch fabricated micro-grippers can potentially {{lead to the}} development of nano-grippers for nano-manipulation of materials, measurement of electrical properties of nanostructures and finally measurement of electrochemical properties of cells. We explored the growth process of nano-needles on batch fabricated microgrippers. Micro-grippers were first batch fabricated using carbon nanotube/SU 8 process at the University of Louisville 2 ̆ 7 s clean room facility. Following the gripper fabrication, 20 nm chromium and 100 nm silver were selectively deposited onto the arms of the grippers using shadow masking techniques. Each silver coated arm was selectively dipped onto liquid gallium and retracted for the formation of Ag 2 Ga eutectic nano-needles at room temperature in ambient environment. The length and diameter of nano-needles can be controlled by the thickness of silver and volume of gallium liquid. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) characterization revealed nano-needles of 100 - 120 nm in diameter and 7 - 15 µm long on each gripper. Following the nano-needle growth on the grippers, the grippers were packaged onto a ceramic chip carrier and wire bonded. Following wire bonding, 100 nm of parylene was coated everywhere besides the surface of gripper/needles to enable electrical insulation in liquid environments, and then the tips of nano-needles are exposed. I-V measurements revealed an open circuit resistance of 120 Giga-ohms showing the versatility of the grippers integrated with the needles as electrodes for measurement of electrical properties of nano-materials and in liquids. Preliminary measurements on a small carbon nanotube film when brought into contact with the needle revealed six to eight orders of magnitude change in the resistance showing that these needles are highly sensitive for electrical property measurement on nano-materials. Finally, the needles were tested inside phosphate buffered saline and performed linear sweep voltammetry to investigate reduction-oxidation reactions {{on the surface of the}} nano-needle...|$|R
