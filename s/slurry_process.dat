5000|$|Most powder {{coatings}} have a particle {{size in the}} range of 2 to 50 μ (Microns), a softening temperature Tg around 80 °C, a melting temperature around 150 °C, and are cured at around 200 °C. for minimum 10 minutes to 15 minutes (exact temperatures and times may depend on the thickness of the item being coated). [...] For such {{powder coatings}}, film build-ups of greater than 50 μ (Microns) may be required to obtain an acceptably smooth film. The surface texture which is considered desirable or acceptable depends on the end product. Many manufacturers actually prefer to have a certain degree of orange peel since it helps to hide metal defects that have occurred during manufacture, and the resulting coating is less prone to showing fingerprints.There are very specialized operations where powder coatings of less than 30 micrometres or with a Tg below 40 °C are used in order to produce smooth thin films. One variation of the dry powder coating process, the Powder <b>Slurry</b> <b>process,</b> combines the advantages of powder coatings and liquid coatings by dispersing very fine powders of 1-5 micrometre particle size into water, which then allows very smooth, low film thickness coatings to be produced.|$|E

Good fluidization characteristics are obtained in this reactor for certain combinations of stirring and vibration parameters. Channeling can be suppressed by stirring in the bed with equidistant flat blades whereas agglomerates are destroyed by vibration of the gas distributor. Also the complex sorption, diffusion and reaction behaviour of ethylene oxide in semi-dry starch was investigated. Reaction rate equations were obtained for all four parallel reactions involved: the catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydroxyethylation of starch and the catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydrolysis of ethylene oxide. By combining all results, a pressure-controlled stirred vibrating fluidized bed reactor could be designed for the gas-solid hydroxyethylation of potato starch. This process was optimized and compared to the classical <b>slurry</b> <b>process.</b> In our novel reactor the reaction time can be reduced at least by a factor of 10 relative to the <b>slurry</b> <b>process</b> whereas the selectivity is also higher.

40|$|Semi-solid casting was {{developed}} in the early 1970 ’s and involves the use of a partially solidified metal slurry. This method of casting has become a popular alternative for production of automobile components. Semi-solid casting is mainly directed towards the light metals aluminium and magnesium {{as an alternative to the}} high pressure die casting process. The semi-solid casting route mainly considered in this thesis is rheocasting. The new Rapid Slurry Forming (RSF) technology, a vital part of the RheoMetal TM process, has been used exclusively throughout the experiments reported in this thesis. The new technology is based on an enthalpy exchange between two alloy systems to produce the partially solidified metal slurry. In this thesis a range of <b>slurry</b> <b>process</b> parameters have been studied with the aim of revealing their microstructural consequences on slurry formation and the mechanisms thereof. Parameters were established for (1) production of commercial components and (2) for production of billets used for horizontal reheating purposes. Experimental work showed that <b>slurry</b> <b>process</b> parameters had a significant influence on slurry formation for the aluminium and magnesium alloys tested. The most strongly affected microstructure feature was the final slurry grain size. Slurry formation with the RSF technology occurs by local massive nucleation due to rapid cooling of the melt during processing whilst uniform temperatures are provided by forced convection. Components produced by rheocasting contained significantly reduced porosity as compared to those components made by high pressure die casting. The microstructures obtained in the reheated RSF billets for thixocasting were found to be more favourable than those obtained in commercially available billets. Methods used for evaluation include mechanical testing, microstructure analysis, cooling curve analysis, chemical analysis and X-ray analysis...|$|E
40|$|Cationic starch ethers {{prepared}} by the chemical reaction of starch with a quaternary ammonium reagent are commercially important derivatives. Cationic potato starch derivatives were produced under pilot-scale conditions, employing four different principles. Wet cationisation {{was carried out by}} the slurry and paste processes, in which the cationic reagent and catalyst are added to the starch. Besides being {{prepared by}} these more commonly used processes, cationic starches were also produced by dry cationisation and by adding the cationic reagent during extrusion of starch. The cationic reagent used was 2, 3 epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. Derivatives with three graded degrees of substitution (DS) between 0. 03 and 0. 12 were prepared by each process. The physical properties of the derivatives were analysed by the following methods: polarised light microscopy, X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solubility and swelling behaviour, and High-Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (HPSEC-MALLS). The degree of substitution was determined by high resolution C- 13 -NMR spectroscopy after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The properties of the cationic starch derivatives were highly dependent on the derivatisation method. The granular structure of the starch was not visibly affected by the <b>slurry</b> <b>process.</b> Products from the semi-dry reaction showed some granular damage, which was particularly evident after suspension of the granules in water. In the paste and extrusion processes, the starch granules were completely destroyed. Swelling temperatures and enthalpies can be determined only for starch derivatives that still retain a granular structure. As a result, samples from the paste and extrusion reactions exhibited no swelling endotherm in DSC. The samples from the <b>slurry</b> <b>process</b> showed a shift in the swelling temperature range towards lower temperature and a decrease in swelling enthalpy both as compared to native potato starch and also with increasing DS. Similar behaviour was found for the samples from the semi-dry process. The swelling temperature region was comparable to that of the slurry samples for the same DS but the swelling enthalpy was distinctly lower, indicating that the granular structure of the starch was altered far more by the semi-dry than the <b>slurry</b> <b>process.</b> Swelling in excess water and solubility were affected primarily by the cationisation process, while the influence of DS was of minor importance. The extrusion products had pronounced cold-water solubility, the semi-dry products showed increasing told-water solubility with increasing DS, the paste products were highly swollen in cold water and the slurry products were insoluble in cold water. All products were soluble in hot water but the state of dissolution was different. The molar mass distributions of the samples were determined after dissolution by pressure cooking. The different derivatisation methods resulted in characteristic molar mass distributions. The average molar mass decreased in the order slurry, semi-dry-, paste and extrusion process...|$|E

Hydrogen and other flammable gases are generated in the aqueous phase by radiolytic and chemical reactions.

Slurries become increasingly susceptible to degassing as the bubble concentration increases. This susceptibility {{and the process of}} ebullitive bubble enlargement are described here. When disturbed, the fluid undergoes localized flow around neighboring bubbles which are dragged together and coalesce, producing an enlarged bubble. For the conditions considered in this work, bubble size increase is enough to displace the weight required to overcome the fluid shear strength and yield the surroundings. The buoyant bubble ascends and accumulates others within a zone of influence, enlarging by a few orders of magnitude.
