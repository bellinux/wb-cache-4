5|$|About a {{week before}} the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a {{photograph}} of a dress she planned to wear to the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as white with gold lace, while others <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E
5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an {{obstacle}} to a Soviet takeover of Poland. Consequently, {{over the course of the}} war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.|$|E

60|$|Now Jonas {{approved}} it very much, but {{told him that}} he had better smooth it a little more with his knife before <b>sawing</b> <b>it</b> off. Rollo did so; and then he carried it back to the horse, and <b>sawed</b> <b>it</b> off at the right distance, and it made an excellent wedge. The edges, {{at the head of the}} wedge, were left somewhat rough by the saw. These, however, he trimmed off with his knife, and then carried the wedge to Jonas.|$|R

5|$|Octopussy had {{its premiere}} on 6 June 1983, {{four months before}} the October release of Never Say Never Again. From its budget of $27.5million, Octopussy took $183.7million at the box office, a figure which <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> surpass the takings of its Connery-led rival, which took $160million.|$|E
5|$|The other middleweight bout of {{the night}} saw Costas Philippou {{defeating}} Riki Fukuda by unanimous decision. Philippou successfully defended all of Fukuda's takedown attempts and landed the more solid strikes. The judges <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> 30–27, 30–27 and 29–28 for Philippou.|$|E
5|$|A CSS Merrimac did {{actually}} exist. She was {{a paddle}} wheel steamer {{named for the}} victor (as most Southerners <b>saw</b> <b>it)</b> at Hampton Roads. She was used for running the blockade until she was captured and taken into Federal service, still named Merrimac. Her name was a spelling variant of the river, namesake of USS Merrimack. Both spellings are still in use around the Hampton Roads area.|$|E

5000|$|Classical mudiao is {{begun by}} {{selecting}} a whole block of wood, <b>sawing</b> <b>it</b> into a regular shape, {{such as a}} square flat board, then using edged carving tools to sculpt pictures either in bas-relief or in three-dimensions.|$|R
5|$|Although Alcuin had scorn for Æthelhard for fleeing Canterbury, {{the papacy}} <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> differently. Pope Leo III praised Æthelhard for fleeing {{and refusing to}} submit to Eadberht, whom Leo {{compared}} to the later Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. There are indications, though, that the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while Æthelhard was in exile.|$|E
5|$|And to Think That I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E
5|$|But as Hohoff <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird.|$|E

5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, as he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Void was {{produced}} under Fidélité Films, with 70% {{of the budget}} invested by Wild Bunch. French co-producers included Noé's company Les Cinémas de la Zone and the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie. It received pre-sales investment from Canal+ and funding from Eurimages. Additional co-production support was provided by Essential Filmproduktion of Germany and BIM Distribuzione of Italy. The total budget was 12.38 million euro. In retrospect, Noé called Irréversible a bank robbery, a film made in order to finance Enter the Void. He also <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a helpful technical exercise.|$|E
60|$|Ah Fe, {{without looking}} at <b>it,</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> was nearly empty. Ah Fe, without {{examining}} the apartment, <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> was scantily furnished. Ah Fe, without removing his eyes from blank vacancy, saw that both Mrs. Tretherick and Carry were poorly dressed. Yet it is my duty to state that Ah Fe's long fingers closed promptly and firmly over the half-dollar which Mrs. Tretherick extended to him.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1969, Miller {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} with a New York Times reporter what it was that drew her to photography. Her response was that it was [...] "a matter of getting out on a damn limb and <b>sawing</b> <b>it</b> off behind you." ...|$|R

5|$|Even {{though all}} {{military}} activities ceased by 6 August 1933, exaggerated stories of atrocities {{committed by the}} Assyrians at Dirabun and the persistent anti-Christian propaganda and rumours insisted that the Christians were planning to blow bridges up and to poison drinking water in major Iraqi cities. According to some historians, the agitation against the Assyrians was also encouraged by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's Arab nationalist government, which <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a distraction to the continuous Shiite revolt {{in the southern part}} of the country.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected {{through a combination of}} blood testing, X-rays, and tissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.|$|E
5|$|For this thirteenth season, Seven {{chose to}} move Blue Heelers from its Wednesday-night, primetime timeslot, {{which it had}} {{occupied}} for 10 years, to the lower-rated Saturday-night timeslot, which also <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> up against popular British police programme The Bill; this move was slammed by cast member John Wood. Ratings for this season were generally low; no episode ranked in OzTAM's top 20 programme list for the week.|$|E
50|$|Sandalwood is {{expensive}} {{compared to other}} types of woods, therefore, to maximize profit, sandalwood is harvested by removing the entire tree instead of <b>sawing</b> <b>it</b> down at the trunk close to ground level. This way wood from the stump and root, which possess high levels of sandalwood oil, can also be processed and sold.|$|R
60|$|This led me {{to think}} of Dobbs, when, {{suddenly}} a face flashed by my carriage window.

5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given {{the dominance of}} the British Royal Navy and the impossibility, as he <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a refuge for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|Hall {{initially}} {{sought to}} appeal to the State Council of the LCL. Although the body had no binding authority over the parliamentary caucus, which chose the leader, Hall and his followers <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an opportunity for a media victory. The motion went narrowly against Hall, but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for the conservatives.|$|E
