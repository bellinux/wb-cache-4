500|$|Yar's {{death in}} the episode was after Crosby had asked to be let out of her contract, and rumors had {{circulated}} of her departure. She later described her time spent on Star Trek: The Next Generation as [...] "miserable", and it was well known {{at the time that}} she was unhappy with the way her role had been developed. She later said that if she'd had more scenes written for her similar to the one she shared with Worf {{at the start of the}} episode then she wouldn't have wanted to leave the show. Yar's memorial scene was filmed twice, the first was with Crosby reciting the lines while looking straight ahead, which was the director's preferred choice. However a version with her looking towards each of the other characters in turn was ultimately used. Scanlan later said [...] "Don't ask me how <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> they'd be standing". Marina Sirtis's tears in the scene were real, as she was cued by Crosby standing off camera. [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] was not the last episode in the first season in which Denise Crosby appeared. [...] "" [...] was subsequently filmed after this episode, but was aired earlier in the run. In fact, toward the end of [...] "Symbiosis" [...] you can see Crosby waving goodbye to the fans (it is the scene where Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay). Crosby would also later return to the Yar role in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the two part series finale [...] "" [...] and as Yar's half-Romulan daughter Sela in several episodes. Guest stars in [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] included Walker Boone as Leland T. Lynch, Brad Zerbst as a nurse and Raymond Forchion as Ben Prieto. Even though this episode marked the death of Yar, Crosby would be credited for the remaining three first season episodes.|$|E
