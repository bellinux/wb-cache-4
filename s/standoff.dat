5|$|In Cairo, a <b>standoff</b> {{took place}} {{in front of the}} Egyptian Museum {{in the early morning hours}} with rocks and petrol bombs {{reportedly}} flying. Large-caliber shots were reportedly fired in the air by the army to keep opposing factions at bay. There was a heavy police presence at the museum following the <b>standoff.</b> Anti-government protesters banged on metal railings while rocks were thrown at them.|$|E

5|$|The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic {{training}} for the U.S. Army. Michael Fortier, McVeigh's accomplice, was his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <b>standoff</b> with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge {{as well as the}} Waco siege—a 1993 51-day <b>standoff</b> between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight (it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch Davidians fired the first shot) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the <b>standoff,</b> and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building {{as a response to the}} raids.|$|E
50|$|K&T wiring was {{commonly}} insulated {{with cotton}} cloth and soft rubber, {{in addition to}} the porcelain <b>standoffs.</b> Although the actual wire covering may have degraded over the decades, the porcelain <b>standoffs</b> have a nearly unlimited lifespan and will keep any bare wires safely insulated. Today, porcelain <b>standoffs</b> are still commonly used with bare-wire electric fencing for livestock, and such porcelain <b>standoffs</b> carry far higher voltage surges without risk of shorting to ground.|$|R

5|$|Washington reorganized {{the army}} {{during the long}} <b>standoff</b> in Boston and forced the British to {{withdraw}} by putting artillery on Dorchester Heights overlooking the city. The British evacuated Boston in March 1776 and Washington moved his army to New York City.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the <b>standoff</b> remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival {{officers}} without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E
5|$|Following the incident, the {{government}} offered dialogue with opposition and ordered army {{to withdraw from}} Pearl Roundabout. On 19 February, army troops were replaced by riot police. Hundreds of protesters moved to the site from different locations. A <b>standoff</b> between protesters and riot police was created, until the latter suddenly moved away. Thousands of protesters re-occupied the site following police withdrawal.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of the charge relative to its target is critical for optimum penetration for two reasons. If the charge is detonated too close {{there is not enough}} time for the jet to fully develop. But the jet disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under two meters. At such <b>standoffs,</b> it breaks into particles which tend to tumble and drift off the axis of penetration, so that the successive particles tend to widen rather than deepen the hole. At very long <b>standoffs,</b> velocity is lost to air drag, further degrading penetration.|$|R
5|$|On 2 August 1990 Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month U.S. President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support, to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multinational force in a <b>standoff</b> with Iraq.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, the Yugoslav Navy renewed its {{blockade}} {{of the main}} ports of Croatia. This move followed months of <b>standoff</b> for JNA positions in Dalmatia and elsewhere {{now known as the}} Battle of the barracks. It also coincided with the end of Operation Coast-91, in which the JNA failed to occupy the coastline in an attempt to cut off Dalmatia's access to the rest of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{strike was}} {{characterized}} by firefights and use of dynamite, and ended after a <b>standoff</b> between the Colorado state militia and a private force working for owners of the mines. In the years after the strike, the WFM's popularity and power increased significantly through the region.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe started 2000 {{looking to}} add a third {{individual}} event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach Manfred Thiesmann accusing him of using steroids. Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when a <b>standoff</b> over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample {{due to lack of}} containers. After the <b>standoff</b> was resolved, Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5s from his world short course record in the 200m freestyle. Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level. On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by Speedo.|$|E

5|$|A less {{contentious}} <b>standoff</b> {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat <b>standoff</b> attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Diego López de Salcedo sailed from Santo Domingo {{with two}} ships, {{carrying}} {{a large number}} of soldiers, as well as provisions and clothing he intended to sell to the colonists. Contrary winds delayed López de Salcedo off Jamaica for a month; he eventually disembarked in Trujillo on 26 October 1526, after a lengthy <b>standoff</b> with Saavedra that almost came to violence. At last Saavedra was convinced that López de Salcedo had been authorised directly by the crown, and allowed him to come ashore.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the LITENING {{targeting}} pod was fitted, {{which increased}} {{the effectiveness of}} the aircraft in the attack of ground targets with a variety of <b>standoff</b> weapons, using laser guidance, a high-resolution forward-looking infrared sensor (FLIR), and a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery. LITENING pods have been fitted {{to a wide variety of}} other US aircraft, such as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} PC/104 {{form factor}} is somewhat {{smaller than a}} desktop PC motherboard at 3.550 xx 3.775 in. Unlike other popular computer form factors such as ATX, which rely on a motherboard or backplane, PC/104 boards are stacked {{on top of each}} other like building blocks. The PC/104 specification defines four mounting holes at the corners of each module, which allow the boards to be fastened to each other using <b>standoffs.</b> The stackable bus connectors and use of <b>standoffs</b> provides a more rugged mounting than slot boards found in desktop PCs. The compact board size further contributes to the ruggedness of the form factor by reducing the possibility of PCB flexing under shock and vibration.|$|R
5|$|In November 1959, {{to improve}} the aircraft's combat {{capabilities}} in the changing strategic environment, SAC initiated the Big Four modification program (also known as Modification 1000) for all operational B-52s except early B models. The program was completed by 1963. The four modifications were the ability to launch AGM-28 Hound Dog <b>standoff</b> nuclear missiles and ADM-20 Quail decoys, an advanced electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, and upgrades to perform the all-weather, low-altitude (below 500feet or 150m) interdiction mission {{in the face of}} advancing Soviet missile-based air defenses.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to a range of}} free-fall nuclear bombs, later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for <b>standoff</b> nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel; it had been intended for the American Skybolt missile to be introduced; however, development of Skybolt was cancelled. Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight, as well in advance of the mission. It was reported that, with intensive work, a B.2 missile carrier could revert to carrying free-fall nuclear weapons or conventional munitions within 30 hours.|$|E
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange {{tries to}} {{convince}} them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican <b>standoff.</b> All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
50|$|<b>Standoffs</b> {{between the}} President and Congress or between {{political}} parties, elections, and more urgent legislative matters complicate the budget process, frequently making the continuing resolution {{a common occurrence}} in American government.

50|$|During the Cold War, {{the superpowers}} sought to avoid open {{conflict}} between their respective forces, as both sides recognized {{that such a}} clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic <b>standoffs.</b>|$|R
