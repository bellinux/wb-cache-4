40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{domestic}} trade in livestock, intra-communal trade across the European Union (EU) {{is subject to}} costly, additional <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures.</b> Short-distance transportation just across a border requires more measures than long-distance domestic transportation, while {{the need for such}} additional cross-border measures can be questioned. This study examined the prospects for cost reductions from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to trade within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (GER); that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The study constructed a deterministic spread-sheet cost model to calculate the costs of both routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> (standard measures that apply to both domestic and cross-border transport) and additional cross-border measures (extra measures that only apply to cross-border transport) as applied in 2010. This model determined costs by stakeholder, region and livestock sector, and studied the prospects for cost reduction by calculating the costs after the relaxation of additional cross-border measures. The selection criteria for relaxing these measures were (1) a low expected added value on preventing contagious livestock diseases, (2) no expected additional veterinary risks in case of relaxation of measures and (3) reasonable cost-saving possibilities. The total cost of routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> and additional cross-border measures for the cross-border region was € 22. 1 million, 58 % (€ 12. 7 million) of which came from additional cross-border measures. Two-thirds of this € 12. 7 million resulted from the trade in slaughter animals. The main cost items were veterinary checks on animals (twice in the case of slaughter animals), export certification and control of export documentation. Four additional cross-border measures met the selection criteria for relaxation. The relaxation of these measures could save € 8. 2 million (€ 5. 0 million for NL and € 3. 2 million for GER) annually. Farmers would experience the greatest savings (99 %), and most savings resulted from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to poultry (48 %), mainly slaughter broilers (GER), and pigs (48 %), mainly slaughter pigs (NL). In particular, the trade in slaughter animals (dead-end hosts) is subject to <b>measures,</b> such as <b>veterinary</b> checks {{on both sides of the}} border that might not contribute to preventing contagious livestock diseases. Therefore, this study concludes that there are several possibilities for reducing the costs of additional cross-border measures in both countries...|$|R

The cattle were chosen as the reference species of livestock because it was the largest category of livestock kept in the stable and pasture. The research was carried out {{in the form of a}} structured questionnaire, which was sent to the individual respondents after this was agreed by phone. It should answer the question whether the emergency housing of cattle in the emergency planning zone of Temelín Nuclear Power Station is sufficiently secured. The results show that emergency housing is not the priority of farmers, because only 55 % of the respondents sent back completed questionnaires. Most of them, i. e. 64 %, bred cattle in stable and grazing, 27 % in stable only and 9 % were exclusively grazing. In addition to grazing, preserved fodder (silage, haylage, hay) are mainly used for feeding and water from underground sources and from a water supply network for watering where all these sources can be protected against radioactive fallout. It was also found that electricity was used for watering. Upon its failure, except for two cases, no emergency power supply were available. Electric fences around the pastures were not equipped with emergency power supply, except for two respondents. Alarm Plan of <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Measures</b> (within the frame of Temelín Nuclear Power Plant's external emergency plan) requires feeding and watering for 3 days during the absence of the cattlemen.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} for increased cross-border cooperation for border regions with a reasonable or large cross-border reliance on production and consumption of livestock commodities. The extended cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL), North Rhine Westphalia (NRW), and Lower Saxony (NDS) is a particular example in this respect. Despite the EU single market, both in peace time (i. e. without outbreaks of highly contagious livestock diseases like Classical Swine Fever) and crisis (i. e. during such outbreaks) situations, trade barriers for livestock and livestock commodities among Member States exist or are further established, resulting in (major) economic consequences. In this paper, a general framework including all critical factors, (inter) relations and (im) possibilities associated with the challenges of cross-border collaboration is presented. Furthermore, difficulties in disease control harmonization and collaboration due to current borders, as well as possibilities for future cross-border cooperation, are discussed for the cross-border region NL-NRW-NDS. To reduce the financial-economic impact of the borders, this study suggests applying <b>veterinary</b> routine <b>measures</b> more efficiently, harmonizing current <b>veterinary</b> control <b>measures</b> as well as adding economic instruments to current <b>veterinary</b> control <b>measures.</b> Moreover, a futureoriented approach should be used, which should include an analysis of changes in (contact) structure of the livestock sector in the coming ten years.

40|$|Introduction: In {{the early}} 1930 s when Tehran Veterinary College – {{the first modern}} Iranian {{veterinary}} school – was established, the existence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in Persian cattle had already been reported by French scientists. Small-scale test-and-slaughter control plans have been employed since then by private and State veterinarians, mostly concentrated in cattle farms of {{the capital city of}} Tehran and its suburbs. It was in the 1960 s when these discrete operations were scaled up and turned into the present-day national scheme. Materials and Methods: Since 2000, in addition to the traditional bacterial culture, genotyping (e. g., RFLP, spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing) has been employed on a relatively large number of Mycobacterium bovis isolates from across Iran. The present work concentrates on RFLP findings using two markers of PGRS and DR. Altogether, 17 RFLP patterns (identified mutually by either of the two markers) have been found in Iran. Results and discussion: The pattern representing the M. bovis BCG strain, so-called “BCG-like”, is the commonest type being found almost everywhere in the country. Some of the remaining patterns, however, seem to have been geographically isolated over time. What is the current trend in the population of M. bovis in Iran? Are the localization of strains or expansion of them being observed? How extensive is the impact of <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> in this context?

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} gains {{and the main}} challenges for increased cross-border collaboration in the control of highly contagious livestock diseases in regions with cross-border reliance on production and consumption of livestock commodities. The aim of this intensification of cross-border collaboration is to retain the economic advantages of cross-border trade in livestock and livestock commodities while maintaining a low risk of highly contagious livestock diseases. From these two foci, possibilities for future policy making with respect to highly contagious livestock diseases are discussed: peacetime cross-border cooperation to improve the cost-effectiveness of routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> and crisis time cross-border harmonization of current disease control strategies. A general disease management framework was {{used to describe the}} way in which these two fields are related to and affect the epidemiological system and, consequently, how they impact the stakeholders. In addition to this framework, the importance of a good understanding of influencing factors, that is, the production structure of livestock, was stressed because these factors are important determinants of the frequency and magnitude of highly contagious livestock diseases and their economic impact. The use of the suggested integrated approach was illustrated for the extended cross-border region of the Netherlands and Germany, that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony.

40|$|Milk, in our {{territory}} {{frequently used}} cow?s milk, {{is very important}} nutrient. Its importance consists in the contents of valuable proteins, easily digestible milk fat, lactose, vitamins and minerals. The quality of raw cow?s milk is characterised by many indicators, for example total number of microorganisms, number of somatic cells, content of basic constituents (fat, protein, lactose, non-fat solids), freezing point or occurrence of undesirable foreign and inhibitory substances. Residuals of inhibitory substances (RIL) {{are one of the}} main criteria of raw milk hygienic quality, where they can appear for example due to prevention and treatment of mastitis. The risk of occurrence and spread of bacterial resistance, disruption of intestinal microflora, allergic reactions and RIL toxic effects, both in human and veterinary medicine, belong among the biggest risks of RIL presence in food and raw materials of animal origin, including milk. Inhibitory substances have an inhibiting effect on development and activity of microorganisms and in particular in milk industry they affect the activity of dairy cultures causing significant production problems. Their presence in milk causes problems when producing cheese, during fermentation of yoghurts and other fermentation during milk processing. Prevention of RIL occurrence depends especially on adherence to basic breeding and <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> when using drugs and medicines, on technology discipline in primary production and regular and strict control of RIL contents in milk from the primary production up to processing when various screening detection methods are used.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To (1) {{review the}} {{development}} and medical applications of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions with particular emphasis on its physiochemical properties; (2) critically appraise the available evidence in human and veterinary medicine, and (3) evaluate the potential risks and benefits associated with their use in critically ill small animals. DATA SOURCES: Human and veterinary original research articles, scientific reviews, and textbook sources from 1950 to the present. HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: HES solutions have been used extensively in people for over 30 years and ever since its introduction {{there has been a}} great deal of debate over its safety and efficacy. Recently, results of seminal trials and meta-analyses showing increased risks related to kidney dysfunction and mortality in septic and critically ill patients, have led to the restriction of HES use in these patient populations by European regulatory authorities. Although the initial ban on the use of HES in Europe has been eased, proof regarding the benefits and safety profile of HES in trauma and surgical patient populations has been requested by these same European regulatory authorities. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: The veterinary literature is limited mostly to experimental studies and clinical investigations with small populations of patients with short-term end points and there is insufficient evidence to generate recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there are no consensus recommendations regarding the use of HES in veterinary medicine. Veterinarians and institutions affected by the HES restrictions have had to critically reassess the risks and benefits related to HES usage based on the available information and sometimes adapt their procedures and policies based on their reassessment. Meanwhile, large, prospective, randomized veterinary studies evaluating HES use are needed to achieve relevant levels of evidence to enable formulation of <b>specific</b> <b>veterinary</b> guidelines...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is research-based development, implementation and evaluation of a game-based learning concept {{to be used in}} the veterinary education. Herd visits and animal contact are essential for the development of veterinary competences and skills during education. Yet veterinary students have little occasion to reach/attain a proper level of confidence in their own skills/abilities, as they have limited “training-facilities” (Kneebone & Baillie, 2008). One possible solution mightbe to provide a safe, virtual environment (game-based) where students could practise interdisciplinary clinical skills in an easily-accessible, interactive setting. A playable demo using Classical Swine Fever in a pig herd as an example has been produced for this purpose. In order totailor the game concept to the <b>specific</b> <b>veterinary</b> learning environment and to ensure compliance with both learning objectives and the actual learning processes/procedures of the veterinary students, the project contains both a developmental aspect (game development) and an exploration of the academic (scholastic) and profession (practice) oriented learning context. The initial phase of the project was a preliminary exploration of the actual learning context, providing an important starting point for the upcoming phase in which I will concentrate on research-based development, implementation and evaluation of a game-based virtual environment in this course context. In the academic (scholastic) and profession (practice) oriented learning context of a veterinary course in Herd Health Management (Pig module),ethnographic studies have been conducted by using multiple data collection methods; participant observation, spontaneous dialogues and interviews (Borgnakke, 1996; Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007).

40|$|Background: Bluetongue (BT) is a {{vector-borne disease}} of {{ruminants}} caused by bluetongue virus that is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). In 2006, {{the introduction of}} BTV serotype 8 (BTV- 8) caused a severe epidemic in Western and Central Europe. The principal effective <b>veterinary</b> <b>measure</b> in response to BT {{was believed to be}} vaccination accompanied by other measures such as movement restrictions and surveillance. As the number of vaccine doses available {{at the start of the}} vaccination campaign was rather uncertain, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and the Dutch agricultural industry wanted to evaluate several different vaccination strategies. This study aimed to rank eight vaccination strategies based on their efficiency (i. e. net costs in relation to prevented losses or benefits) for controlling the bluetongue virus serotype 8 epidemic in 2008 Methodology/Principal Findings: An economic model was developed that included the Dutch professional cattle, sheep and goat sectors together with the hobby farms. Strategies were evaluated based on the least cost - highest benefit frontier, the benefit-cost ratio and the total net returns. Strategy F, where all adult sheep at professional farms in the Netherlands would be vaccinated was very efficient at lowest costs, whereas strategy D, where additional to all adult sheep at professional farms also all adult cattle in the four Northern provinces would be vaccinated, was also very efficient but at a little higher costs. Strategy C, where all adult sheep and cattle at professional farms in the whole of the Netherlands would be vaccinated was also efficient but again at higher costs.

However, only five of the papers retrieved in this comprehensive search provide evidence relating to evaluation of the assessment method itself. There is a need for more research on assessment of clinical competence in veterinary medical education. Key words: clinical competence, assessment, evidence, veterinary education, revie...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{slaughter}} of pregnant cattle and {{the fate of}} the foetuses are relatively new subjects in the field of animal welfare. The Scientific Committee on <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Measures</b> relating to Public Health (SCVPH), however, does not believe this topic to be a critical issue because of the hitherto supposed rare occurrence of this practice. Some previous studies though, contradict this assessment, emphasising its relevance to animal welfare. With regard to the heterogeneous study design of previous investigations, the objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the current situation concerning the {{slaughter of}} pregnant cattle in different German abattoirs. Additionally, the prevalence was assessed semi-quantitatively on the basis of a cross-sectional, voluntary and anonymous survey that was conducted amongst senior veterinary students of the University of Leipzig from 2010 until 2013. Results: Of 255 evaluable questionnaires, 157 (63. 6 %) mention the slaughter of pregnant cattle, corresponding to 76. 9 % of all visited abattoirs. Slaughter of pregnant cattle is reported often (> 10 % of females) in 6 (3. 8 %), frequently (1 – 10 % of females) in 56 (35. 7 %), and rarely (< 1 % of females) in 95 (60. 5 %) of all cases (n = 157) respectively. About 50 % of these animals were reported to be in the second or third stage of gestation. 15 (10. 6 %) of 142 questionnaires providing information about the foetus, state that the foetus showed visible vital signs after the death of the mother, but in one case the foetus was euthanized subsequently. Conclusions: The results show that the slaughter of pregnant cattle is a common and widespread practice in German abattoirs. The SCVPH’s assumption that pregnant cattle are only slaughtered in rare exceptional cases can no longer be maintained. The high proportion of foetuses in the second and third gestational stage must also be considered. In this context the implementation of suitable studies and detailed analysis of the current situation is indispensable to ensure the high standards in animal welfare in Germany and Europe...|$|R
