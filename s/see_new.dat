It marked the first New Zealand visit of a prime minister since Howard visited in 2007. To conclude her two-day visit to New Zealand, Gillard travelled to Wellington on 16 February, where {{she became the first}} foreign dignitary to address the New Zealand Parliament in its history. In her speech, Gillard reflected on the countries' close ties to one another, their shared defence history, and efforts to increase economic cooperation. Her second visit to New Zealand, coincided with the September 2011 gathering of the Pacific Islands Forum, held in Auckland, of which both Australia and New Zealand are members. Gillard made her final trip to New Zealand on 9 February 2013; visiting Queenstown, she and Prime Minister Key announced a deal on asylum seekers, which would <b>see</b> <b>New</b> Zealand accept 150 refugees annually from Australia, starting in 2014.|$|E

25|$|The country {{remained}} an enthusiastic {{supporter of the}} Empire, enlisting 124,211 men and sending 100,444 to fight in World War I (<b>see</b> <b>New</b> Zealand Expeditionary Force).

25|$|Prince Grigory Gagarin, who {{had served}} in Constantinople and the Caucasus as a diplomat, became the most {{influential}} supporter of the Byzantine style – through his published studies of vernacular Caucasian and Greek heritage {{as well as through}} his service to empress Maria Alexandrovna and grand duchess Maria Nikolayevna (Alexander II's sister and president of the Imperial Academy of Arts).

25|$|In a {{dramatic}} case of situational irony, {{a room at}} the Salon d'Automne was dedicated to Picasso in 1944. During the crucial years of Cubism, between 1909 and 1914, the dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler forbade Braque and Picasso from exhibiting at both the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants. He thought the salons were places of humor and ribaldry, of jokes, laughter and ridicule. Fearing that Cubism would not be taken seriously in such public exhibitions where thousands of spectators would assemble to <b>see</b> <b>new</b> creations, he signed exclusivity contracts with his artists, ensuring that their works could only be shown (and sold) in the privacy of his own gallery.|$|E

25|$|By 1995, {{the airline}} {{expanded}} the fleet to six Airbus A300s and eight Airbus A310s {{and built the}} network up to cover 37 destinations in 30 countries. In 1996, the airline received its first Boeing 777–200 aircraft, and was followed shortly thereafter by six Boeing 777-200ERs. The arrival of the 777s allowed Emirates to continue its Singapore service onward to Melbourne commencing in 1996 which would become a very profitable route for Emirates and would <b>see</b> <b>new</b> destinations added in Australia. In 1998, Emirates Sky Cargo was launched. Although the Emirates had always provided a cargo service using capacity within its passenger aircraft, this was now expanded with an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance lease with Atlas Air, initially for a single Boeing 747–200 freighter.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1664, the Duke of York {{gave the}} part of his new {{possessions}} between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret in exchange for settlement of a debt. The territory was named after the Island of Jersey, Carteret's ancestral home. The other section of New Jersey was sold to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who was a close friend of the Duke. As a result, Carteret and Berkeley became the two English Lords Proprietors of New Jersey. The Province of New Jersey was created, but the border was not finalized until 1765 (<b>see</b> <b>New</b> York-New Jersey Line War). In 1667, territories between the Byram River and Connecticut River were split off to become the western half of Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Some recordings, such as {{books for}} the blind, were pressed at rpm. Prestige Records {{released}} jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance {{of the system and}} weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the rpm records. Subsequently, the rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to <b>see</b> <b>new</b> turntable models with a 16rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.|$|E
