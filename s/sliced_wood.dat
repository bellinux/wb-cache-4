40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Date Palm Technology Company Limited, Shambat, Khartoum State. To evaluate performance of three types of evaporative cooling pads for greenhouses (celdek pads, straw pads and <b>sliced</b> <b>wood</b> pads), as compared to the conditions outside the greenhouses (control), for pads. Performance evaluation includes environmental parameters (temperature and relative humidity at 8 am, 1 pm and 6 pm) and crop parameters (length and stem diameter, leaves number and width, fruit length and diameter, fruit weight and dry matter and yield). The results obtained for the temperature at 8 am showed that {{there was no significant difference}} (0. 05) inside the greenhouses, while a high significant difference between the conditions inside and outside of the greenhouses was found. Significant differences were found at 1 pm and 6 pm between all treatments as compared to the conditions outside the greenhouses, and the results obtained for relative humidity showed high significant differences at 8 am and 1 pm inside the greenhouses and between inside and outside the greenhouse, respectively, while there was no significant difference at 6 pm inside the greenhouses and between inside and outside the greenhouses. On the other hand, the results obtained for crop parameters showed that there were significant differences between all parameters inside the greenhouses and outside the greenhouses; however, the greenhouses with <b>sliced</b> <b>wood</b> pads gave the highest yield and the greenhouses with straw pads gave the least and conditions outside gave the lowest. This study indicated that the <b>sliced</b> <b>wood</b> pads are better than the other evaporative cooling pads...|$|E
30|$|To examine pH {{changes of}} damaged wood disks by color changes, 3 kinds of acid-based {{indicators}} were used: bromocresol green (BCG) with pH range of 3.8 – 5.4 and color change from yellow to bluish green, bromophenol blue (BPB) with pH range of 3.0 – 4.6 and color change from yellow to purple, and methyl red (MR) with pH range of 4.4 – 6.2 and color change from red to yellow. BCG (0.04  g), BPB (0.1  g), and MR (0.2  g) were diluted with each 20  ml ethanol, and volume {{was made up}} to 100  ml with distilled water, respectively.

30|$|This {{study focused}} on the in situ tensile elastic moduli of the {{individual}} component polymers with a 3 D assembly mode in the cell walls using the wood specimen with different MFAs. To prepare <b>wood</b> <b>slices</b> consisting of lignin with a 3 D assembly mode in the cell walls, cellulose and hemicellulose were removed from Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) <b>wood</b> <b>slices</b> using the method of Terashima and Yoshida [10] to obtain methylated periodate lignin <b>slices.</b> To prepare <b>wood</b> <b>slices</b> consisting of polysaccharide with a 3 D assembly mode in the cell walls, lignin was removed using the method of Maekawa and Koshijima [15] to obtain holocellulose slices. Then, the longitudinal elastic moduli of these slices were measured, and the obtained results were discussed {{in relation to the}} elastic moduli of the isolated wood polymers that had been reported by previous authors. We thus aimed to understand how the individual component polymers and their 3 D assembly mode optimize the mechanical performance of the wood cell wall.|$|R

40|$|Nootkatone, one of over 300 {{components}} of vetiver oil, is a mildly pungent sesquiterpene ketone with a distinctive grapefruit flavor, {{largely responsible for}} vetiver oil unique aroma. As part of our research on natural products efficacy against Formosan subterranean termite, previous experiments suggested that vetiver oil {{and some of its}} components acted as a repellant and toxicant to this pest. In order to better understand how nootkatone affects the behavior and physiology of these termites. Treatments consisted in: Sand treated with nootkatone and both slices of non-treated wood; Non-treated sand and both slices of nootkatone-treated wood; Non-treated sand, one <b>slice</b> of nootkatone-treated <b>wood</b> and one <b>slice</b> of non-treated wood; Control with non-treated sand and both <b>slices</b> of non-treated <b>wood.</b> Daily observations on the number of feeding termites on each <b>wood</b> <b>slice,</b> evaluations of tunneling behavior, weekly measurements of food consumption, variation in the number of different species of symbiont protozoa present over time and termite survival were recorded. Our results showed that exposure to nootkatone disrupt normal termite behavior, significantly affecting feeding ability and survival. Effects on the protozoa suggest that nootkatone may also act directly as a toxicant. For its negative effects on termite physiology and behavior, nootkatone may represent a promising natural alternative for termite control...|$|R

40|$|Grapevine {{nurseries}} soak cuttings {{in water}} during propagation {{to compensate for}} dehydration and promote root initiation. However, trunk disease pathogens have been isolated from soaking water, indicating cross contamination. Cuttings of Vitis vinifera cv. Sunmuscat and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris rootstock cv. 140 Ruggeri were immersed in sterilized, deionised water for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 h. The soaking water was cultured (25 °C for 3 days) on non-specific and specific media for fungi and bacteria. The base of each cutting was debarked and trimmed and three 3 mm thick, contiguous, transverse <b>slices</b> of <b>wood</b> cultured at 25 °C for 3 days. The soaking water for both cultivars became contaminated with microorganisms within the first hour. Numbers of fungi isolated from the <b>wood</b> <b>slices</b> soaked for one hour were significantly greater than those from non-soaked cuttings. The number of bacterial colonies growing from the <b>wood</b> <b>slices</b> increased after soaking for 2 - 4 h in Sunmuscat. In a second experiment Shiraz cuttings were soaked for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. The soaking water became contaminated within the first hour but only the bacterial count increased significantly over time. Microorganisms also established on the container surfaces within the first hour although {{there were no significant}} increases over 24 h. These results confirm that soaking cuttings is a potential cause of cross contamination and demonstrate contamination of cuttings occurs after relatively short periods of soaking. Avoiding exposing cuttings to water will reduce the transmission of trunk diseases in propagation. © Firenze University Press.

40|$|The {{potential}} of vetiver oil and nootkatone as wood treatments against Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki was examined by assessing {{the effects on}} termite tunneling, feeding activity andsurvival, and the consequences on the symbiont protozoa responsible for wood digestion. Comparisons were made with non-treated wood (control), wood treated with the borate compound Tim-Bor 1 (a commonly used lumber preservative) and absence of a food source (starved termites), using choice andno-choice tests. All <b>wood</b> <b>slices</b> were prepared {{at the same time}} using a 10 g liter 1 solution of each substance and were tested in four different sessions over one year to investigate longevity of the effects. Termites had to tunnel through sand to exploit the food sources, consisting of two <b>wood</b> <b>slices,</b> placed {{on opposite sides of the}} experimental enclosure. No-choice tests showed that in the presence of vetiver oil or nootkatone, tunneling activity was always the lowest; wood consumption, termite survival andflagellate numbers and species distribution were significantly different from the control and similar to the results obtained for starved termites and with Tim-Bor–treated wood. Nootkatone negatively affected termites for 12 months and was longer lasting than vetiver oil. In choice tests, when vetiver oil or nootkatone were present, termites exhibited a significant preference for non-treated wood. Our results confirmed both the toxicity and absence of repellency of Tim-Bor 1. Vetiver oil and especially nootkatone affected Formosan subterranean termites and their protozoa, acting as arrestants, repellents and feeding deterrents, and represent a promising natural alternative for the control of this invasive pest...|$|R
40|$|Under drought conditions, the xylem {{of trees}} that conducts {{ascending}} sap produces ultrasonic emissions whose exact origin is not clear. We {{introduce a new}} method to record simultaneously both acoustic events and optical observation of the xylem conduits within <b>slices</b> of <b>wood</b> that were embedded in a transparent material setting a hydric stress. In this article, we resolved the rapid development of all cavitation bubbles and demonstrated that each ultrasound emission {{was linked to the}} nucleation of one single bubble, whose acoustic energy is an increasing function {{of the size of the}} conduit where nucleation occurred and also of the hydric stress. We modelled these observations by the fact that water columns in conduits store elastic energy and release it into acoustic waves when they are broken by cavitation bubbles. Water columns are thus elastic, and not rigid, ‘wires of water’ set under tension by hydric stresses. Cavitation bubbles are at the origin of an embolism, whose development was followed in our experiments. Such an embolism of sap circulation can result in a fatal condition for living trees. These findings provide new insights for the non-destructive monitoring of embolisms within trees, and suggest a new approach to study porous media under hydric stress...|$|R
