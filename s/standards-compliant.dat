5|$|CSS parsing: A {{number of}} illegal CSS {{statements}} {{are present in}} Acid2 to test error handling. <b>Standards-compliant</b> browsers are expected to handle these errors as the CSS specification directs. This helps ensure cross-browser compatibility by making all browsers treat CSS with {{the same level of}} strictness, so that what works in one browser should not cause errors in another.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{introduces}} a new default web browser, Microsoft Edge. It features a new <b>standards-compliant</b> rendering engine forked from Trident, annotation tools, and offers integration with other Microsoft platforms present within Windows 10. Internet Explorer 11 is maintained on Windows 10 for compatibility purposes, but is deprecated {{in favor of}} Edge and {{will no longer be}} actively developed.|$|E

25|$|Although Internet Explorer 7 is more {{compliant}} {{than previous}} versions, {{according to all}} figures it remains the least <b>standards-compliant</b> compared to other major browsers of the period. It does not pass the Acid2 or the Acid3 tests, two test cases designed by the Web Standards Project to verify CSS compliance.|$|E
25|$|Discs with DRM schemes are not <b>standards-compliant</b> Compact Discs (CDs) but {{are rather}} CD-ROM media. Therefore, they all lack the CD {{logotype}} found on discs which follow the standard (known as Red Book). These CDs cannot {{be played on}} all CD players or personal computers. Personal computers running Microsoft Windows sometimes even crash when attempting to play the CDs.|$|E
25|$|CD-Text is an {{extension}} of the Red Book specification for audio CD that allows for storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a <b>standards-compliant</b> audio CD. The information is stored either in the lead-in area of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available, or in the subcode channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} these differences, JavaScript authors can attempt to write <b>standards-compliant</b> code that will also be {{executed}} correctly by most browsers; failing that, they can write code that checks {{for the presence of}} certain browser features and behaves differently if they are not available. In some cases, two browsers may both implement a feature but with different behavior, and authors may find it practical to detect what browser is running and change their script's behavior to match. Programmers may also use libraries or toolkits that take browser differences into account.|$|E
25|$|Version 5.0, {{launched}} on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with Windows 98 Second Edition and bundled with Microsoft Office 2000, {{was a significant}} release that supported bi-directional text, ruby characters, XML, XSLT {{and the ability to}} save web pages in MHTML format. There was enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The first release of Windows 98 in 1998 had included IE4. However, Internet Explorer5 incorrectly includes the padding and borders within a specified width or height; this results in a narrower or shorter rendering of a box. The bug was fixed in Internet Explorer 6 when running in <b>standards-compliant</b> mode.|$|E
25|$|The SD70ACe-T4 is the Tier 4 {{emissions}} <b>standards-compliant</b> {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The first locomotive was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3â€“4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup are bigger power throughout the broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve Tier 4 {{without the use of}} urea after treatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled Fuel Injection System that increases safety and provides simplified maintenance works.|$|E
25|$|The {{code that}} would become WebKit began in 1998 as the KDE HTML (KHTML) layout engine and KDE JavaScript (KJS) engine. The WebKit project was begun within Apple by Don Melton on June 25, 2001 as a fork of KHTML and KJS. Melton {{explained}} {{in an e-mail to}} KDE developers that KHTML and KJS allowed easier development than other available technologies by virtue of being small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed and <b>standards-compliant.</b> KHTML and KJS were ported to OS X {{with the help of an}} adapter library and renamed WebCore and JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore was announced in an e-mail to a KDE mailing list in June 2002, alongside the first release of Apple's changes. WebCore was announced at the Macworld Expo in January 2003 by Apple CEO Steve Jobs with the release of the Safari web browser. JavaScriptCore was first included with Mac OS X v10.2 as a private framework which Apple used in their Sherlock application, while WebCore debuted with the first beta of Safari. Mac OS X v10.3 was the first major release of Apple's operating system to bundle WebKit, although it had already been bundled with a minor release of 10.2.|$|E
2500|$|Internet Explorer has {{introduced}} {{an array of}} proprietary extensions {{to many of the}} standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM. [...] This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in <b>standards-compliant</b> web browsers and {{has introduced}} the need for a [...] "quirks mode" [...] to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.|$|E

QWERTY and QWERTZ adaptations are available for the physical keyboards used by major Amazigh (Berber) communities around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Special {{effort has}} been made to build {{accessibility}} features into digital projection systems (see digital cinema). Through SMPTE, standards now exist that dictate how open and closed captions, as well as hearing-impaired and visually impaired narrative audio, are packaged {{with the rest of the}} digital movie. This eliminates the proprietary caption distributions required for film, and the associated royalties. SMPTE has also standardized the communication of closed caption content between the digital cinema server and 3rd-party closed caption systems (the CSP/RPL protocol). As a result, new, competitive closed caption systems for digital cinema are now emerging that will work with any <b>standards-compliant</b> digital cinema server. These newer closed caption devices include cupholder-mounted electronic displays and wireless glasses which display caption text in front of the wearer's eyes. [...] Bridge devices are also available to enable the use of Rear Window systems. As of mid-2010, the remaining challenge to the wide introduction of accessibility in digital cinema is the industry-wide transition to SMPTE DCP, the standardized packaging method for very high quality, secure distribution of digital movies.|$|E
