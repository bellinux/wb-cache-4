The proposed system is generic enough to allow the migration {{of any kind of}} stream: <b>socket,</b> <b>pipe,</b> char devices. Communicating processes using IP or Unix sockets are transparently migrated with our mechanisms and they can still efficiently communicate after migration. The designed communication system is implemented as part of Kerrighed, a single system image operating system for a cluster based on Linux. Preliminary performance results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Grid Workflows are {{emerging}} as practical programming models for solving large e-scientific {{problems on the}} Grid. However, it is typically assumed that the workflow components either read or write data to conventional files, which are copied from one execution stage to another, or they are tightly coupled using IPC libraries such as MPI or distributed streaming. More flexible communication {{can be achieved by}} overloading conventional READ and WRITE operations with advanced IO mechanisms such as sockets, streams and pipes, as is done in the GriddLeS environment. Such flexibility allows the pipelining of temporally dependent components, or in contrast, delaying of tightly coupled computations based on the current resource availability and network connectivity. However, it is also harder to schedule the workflow, because the communication mode may not be decided until run time. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling model that leverages such communication flexibility and allows us to generate dynamic runtime schedules. The scheduler in this case, not only allocates components to distributed Grid resources, but also specifies the inter-component communication mechanism (<b>socket,</b> <b>pipe</b> etc.) The current model is implemented as a dynamic workflow scheduling tool called GridRod, which harnesses Nimrod/G's [1] Grid services and GriddLeS [2] web services...|$|E

40|$|As {{the size}} of {{clusters}} increases, failures are becoming increasingly frequent. Applications must become fault tolerant {{if they are to}} run for extended periods of time. We present DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing), the first user-level distributed checkpointing package not dependent on a specific message passing library. This contrasts with existing approaches either specific to libraries such as MPI or requiring kernel modification. DMTCP provides fault tolerance through checkpointing. DMTCP transparently checkpoints general cluster computations consisting of many nodes, processes, and threads. DMTCP automatically accounts for TCP/IP sockets, UNIX domain <b>sockets,</b> <b>pipes,</b> ptys (pseudo-terminals), signal handlers, ordinary file descriptors, shared file descriptors, and other operating system artifacts. We demonstrate checkpointing and restart of applications communicating through MPICH 2, OpenMPI, and sockets directly. These applications were written with a variety of languages including Fortran, C, C++, and Python. Results show that checkpoint time remains nearly constant as the number of nodes increases. ...|$|R

A series tests on rock bolts and bolts embedded in tension <b>socketed</b> <b>pipe</b> pile foundation have been taken to describe decoupling mechanism, interface shear strength distribution and fixed length requirement. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the pile end block effect plays a significant role in enhancing the reinforcement effect so that the shear strength takes a multi-section composite distribution with the change of soil characteristics, embedded length of pile and grout medium. It is also shown from the tests that the bond length with 6 m in moderate weathered rock provides enough uplift resistance so as to serve theoretic and practical basis for construction.

40|$|DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing) is a {{transparent}} user-level checkpointing package for distributed applications. Checkpointing and restart is demonstrated {{for a wide}} range of over 20 well known applications, including MATLAB, Python, TightVNC, MPICH 2, OpenMPI, and runCMS. RunCMS runs as a 680 MB image in memory that includes 540 dynamic libraries, and is used for the CMS experiment of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. DMTCP transparently checkpoints general cluster computations consisting of many nodes, processes, and threads; as well as typical desktop applications. On 128 distributed cores (32 nodes), checkpoint and restart times are typically 2 seconds, with negligible run-time overhead. Typical checkpoint times are reduced to 0. 2 seconds when using forked checkpointing. Experimental results show that checkpoint time remains nearly constant as the number of nodes increases on a medium-size cluster. DMTCP automatically accounts for fork, exec, ssh, mutexes/semaphores, TCP/IP sockets, UNIX domain <b>sockets,</b> <b>pipes,</b> ptys (pseudo-terminals), terminal modes, ownership of controlling terminals, signal handlers, open file descriptors, shared open file descriptors, I/O (including the readline library), shared memory (via mmap), parent-child process relationships, pid virtualization, and other operating system artifacts. By emphasizing an unprivileged, user-space approach, compatibility is maintained across Linux kernels from 2. 6. 9 through the current 2. 6. 28. Since DMTCP is unprivileged and does not require special kernel modules or kernel patches, DMTCP can be incorporated and distributed as a checkpoint-restart module within some larger package. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic taint {{analysis}} (DTA) {{has been}} heavily used by security researchers for various tasks, including detecting unknown exploits, analyzing malware, preventing information leaks, and many more. Recently, {{it has been}} also utilized to track data across processes and hosts {{to shed light on}} the interaction of distributed components, but also for security purposes. This paper presents Taint-Exchange, a generic crossprocess and cross-host taint tracking framework. Our goal is to provide researchers with a valuable tool for rapidly developing prototypes that utilize cross-host taint tracking. Taint-Exchange builds on the libdft open source data flow tracking framework for processes, so unlike previous work it does not require extensive maintenance and setup. It intercepts I/O related system calls to transparently multiplex fine-grained taint information into existing communication channels, like <b>sockets</b> and <b>pipes.</b> We evaluate Taint-Exchange using the popular lmbench suite, and show that it incurs only moderate overhead. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of Project JXTA {{is to provide}} a {{peer-to-peer}} application framework based on a standard set of generic peer-to-peer protocols, independent of any particular platform or language. In spite of its recent popularity, the performance characteristics of the communication layers of JXTA are not well understood, though there is a general sentiment of inadequate performance. This paper examines the performance of the three JXTA communication layers: the JXTA <b>sockets,</b> JXTA <b>pipe</b> service and JXTA endpoint service. Round-trip time benchmarks are performed to evaluate the bandwidth and latency of each of the communication layers over both a Fast-Ethernet and a Myrinet network using the Java implementation of the JXTA protocols. The results show that, although the JXTA communications exhibit high latency, the Java binding of JXTA is able to reach the throughput of Java sockets. Very interesting results were obtained for benchmarks performed on high-performance Myrinet networks, where two out of the three JXTA communication layers were still able to achieve throughputs in excess of 1 Gb/s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVibration fatigue {{of small}} branch pipes usually induces weld toe cracks. Some cracks will cause advertently {{shutdown}} of the Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Moreover, {{to judge the}} vibration fatigue failure is the bottle neck in structure health monitoring of the small branch pipes in NPPs. In order to solve this problem, a <b>socket</b> weld <b>pipe</b> was simplified as the cantilever beam model, and the stress intensity factor (SIF) was calculated by the ABAQUS software and ZENCRACK software in this paper. The effects of crack depth, circumferential crack size and working load on SIF were discussed. The analysis {{results show that the}} SIF for outer surface circumferential crack distributes as an upside down “U” alphabet. And the maximum value of SIF is at the deepest point of the crack and is a linear increasing function of external load P. Basing on the plane strain fracture criterion, critical crack sizes bearing different external loads were calculated. With the increasing of loads, the critical crack size decreases. These critical values can be applied as the benchmark for evaluating the vibration fatigue failure in the structure health monitoring of small branch pipes in NPPs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Virtualization {{environment}} provides VMs {{which are}} isolated from each other. This isolation helps co-resident VMs use original transport protocols like UDP and TCP for information exchange. Using original protocols {{does not take}} advantage of being on the same host of VMs because of unnecessarily overheads. Running VMs are processes on physical host so that inter-VM communication should be inter-process communication to assure the profit of their exchange speed. It is very important to conduct new researches to find out the best solution to improving performance of inter-VM communication. Nowadays, there are many up-to-date mechanisms to solve this problem. However, most of related papers do not provide a general view for developers in term of choosing suitable mechanisms for a specific application with a specific group of data sizes nor any applications with any data sizes when they implement inter-VM communication. This article is focusing on analyzing and comparing main mechanisms of three approaches, which are being considered most now: Shared Memory, Unix Domain <b>Socket</b> and <b>Pipes.</b> The three inter-process communication tools: Unix Domain Socket (UDS), Shared Memory and Pipes are also implemented by authors for analysis and comparison purpose.

40|$|A Linux cluster with Gigabit Ethernet {{interconnect}} is a {{local and}} accessible resource for solving scientific problems, including finite-element simulations. As generalpurpose protocol stacks are not designed for parallel computing, the delivered throughput and latency may be significantly below that suggested by the hardware specification of the interconnect.

The evaluation is {{not only in terms}} of short message latency and throughput but in terms of the efficiency of the solution, that is the throughput per computation overhead. There are a number of findings, such as the relative efficiency of TIPC with Open MPI; confirmation of the advantage of GAMMA with MPI; the weaker performance of the single system image software under test; and the enhancement from adding application-level load-balancing to the system-level load-balancing available in some communication harnesses. ...|$|R

5000|$|What is the {{difference}} between an [...] "aggregate" [...] and other kinds of [...] "modified versions"?An [...] "aggregate" [...] consists of a number of separate programs, distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media. The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program's individual license would grant them.Where's the line between two separate programs, and one program with two parts? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are definitely combined in one program. If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means combining them into one program.By contrast, <b>pipes,</b> <b>sockets</b> and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program.|$|R
40|$|Ductile iron (DI) pipes {{have been}} used for the {{conveyance}} of drinking water in drinking water distribution systems over the past several decades. It has been estimated that almost half of all new water mains installed in North America are DI pipes. Although DI pipe itself is resistant to chemical permeation, the polymeric gaskets that join and seal the pipe segments are reported to be susceptible to permeation by organic contaminants. Pipe-drum, diffusion cell experiments, and numerical simulations were conducted in this research to obtain a faster mean to evaluate possible permeations through DI gaskets. Of the five types of gasket materials tested using the gravimetric sorption test, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) had the highest sorption of gasoline, while fluoroelastomer rubber (FKM) exhibited very low sorption of gasoline. The sorption test results suggested that the least to most resistance to permeation of premium gasoline for the five gasket materials were EPDM, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), chloroprene rubber (CR; neoprene), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), and FKM. A typical gasket was found to be made of two portions, the heel and the bulb, of the same polymer but different formulation. Gravimetric sorption tests suggested that the heel portion of all gaskets may be more resistant to permeation than the bulb making it the limiting step for permeation of organic compounds in gasoline. Pipe-drum experiments showed that SBR gasket had the highest permeation rates of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), followed by CR, EPDM, and NBR. With regards to threats to drinking water under water stagnation conditions in the pipe, the 5 μg/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) for benzene will likely be exceeded during an 8 -hour stagnation period for SBR gaskets in contact with free-product premium gasoline. NBR gaskets were found to be sufficiently resistant to permeation by benzene or other BTEX compounds in gasoline and the benzene concentration is unlikely to exceed EPA MCLs. Assessment based on data from the pipe-drum experiments suggested that when there is flow of water in the pipe, benzene and other BTEX compounds in gasoline will not exceed EPA MCLs. A diffusion cell device was developed to obtain diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds for various gasket materials under controlled conditions. Using curve fitting of the permeation data by numerical modeling, the diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds through SBR and NBR gasket materials was found to range from 10 - 7 to 10 - 8 cm 2 /s. The steady-state permeation rates were found to correlate in a linear relationship with thickness while the diffusion coefficients were found to be invariable to the thickness of the polymer tested (2 mm to 5 mm). The diffusion cell provided a rapid, inexpensive, and relatively well-controlled means to study permeation of polymeric gasket materials for DI pipes and the data obtained were used to model benzene permeation of the pipe-drum experiments. The permeation of benzene through a 4 -inch SBR gasket of a pipe joint was modeled using Multiphysics diffusion module. The simulations showed that the heel portions as well as part of the bulb portions of a gasket were likely to be in contact with the contaminants. Model simulation predicted that a 4 -inch SBR gasket under hydrostatic pressure would permeate more organic chemicals than a pipe without hydrostatic pressure, posing greater risk to organic chemical permeations. Increase in the length/size of the bulb portion of a 4 -inch SBR gasket by compression or swelling from 10 % to 30 %, reduced the permeated mass of benzene by about 29 % to 71 % within 150 days of exposure to gasoline. In summary, SBR and NBR gaskets are compatible with any level of gasoline contamination in groundwater. NBR gasket is the most effective choice when a gasket material resistant to gasoline is desired. Diffusion cell experiments in combination with numerical simulations can be used in evaluating possible BTEX permeations effectively. Gasket exposure area and its orientation in the <b>socket</b> after <b>pipe</b> joint assembly are likely to affect permeation path and permeated mass of contaminants. Results from this study {{can be used as a}} basis for crisis management for DI pipes exposed to gasoline and for development of a better gasket to improve the reliability of infrastructure of development of water distribution system...|$|R
