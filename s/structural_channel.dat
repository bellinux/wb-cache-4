40|$|Materials with apatite crystal {{structure}} provide a {{great potential for}} incorporating the long-lived radioactive iodine isotope (129 I) {{in the form of}} iodide (I-) from nuclear waste streams. Because of its durability and potentially high iodine content, the apatite waste form can reduce iodine release rate and minimize the waste volume. Crystal structure and composition of apatite was investigated for iodide incorporation into the channel of the structure using Artificial Neural Network. A total of 86 experimentally determined apatite {{crystal structure}}s of different compositions were compiled from literature, and 46 of them were used to train the networks and 42 were used to test the performance of the trained networks. The results show that the performances of the networks are satisfactory for predictions of unit cell parameters a and c and channel size of the structure. The trained and tested networks were then used to predict unknown compositions of apatite that incorporates iodide. With a crystal chemistry consideration, chemical compositions that lead to matching the size of the <b>structural</b> <b>channel</b> to the size of iodide were then predicted to be able to incorporate iodide in the <b>structural</b> <b>channel.</b> The calculations suggest that combinations of A site cations of Ag+, K+, Sr 2 +, Pb 2 +, Ba 2 +, and Cs+, and X site cations, mostly formed tetrahedron, of Mn 5 +, As 5 +, Cr 5 +, V 5 +, Mo 5 +, Si 4 +, Ge 4 +, and Re 7 + are possible apatite compositions that are able to incorporate iodide. The charge balance of different apatite compositions can be achieved by multiple substitutions at a single site or coupled substitutions at both A and X sites. The results give important clues for designing experiments to synthesize new apatite compositions and also provide a fundamental understanding how iodide is incorporated in the apatite structure. This understanding can provide important insights for apatite waste forms design by optimizing the chemical composition and synthesis procedure...|$|E
40|$|We {{identify}} a blind {{spot in the}} early Theory of Mind processing of conditional sentences that describe a protagonist's potential action, and its predictable consequences.

Accordingly, reading should be disrupted when a protagonist avoids an action with desirable consequences, but reading should not be disrupted when a protagonist takes an action with undesirable consequences.

40|$|Si NMR spin-lattice {{relaxation}} times have been measured {{for the two}} 2 : 1 layered phyllosilicates, sepiolite and rectorite. In sepiolite, it is shown that water contained within the <b>structural</b> <b>channel</b> provides a Si-H dipolar contribution to Si {{spin-lattice relaxation}}. In rectorite, hydrated interlayer paramagnetic cations provide very efficient relaxation either via spin diffusion or, more likely, via direct electron-nuclear relaxation facilitated by relatively high cation mobility. Of {{the two types of}} tetrahedral sheet in rectorite, the one further removed from the paramagnetic ions exhibits a relaxation time approximately 15 times longer than that for the closer sheet. Removal of the paramagnetic cations by exchange causes a significant increase in spin-lattice relaxation times for both types of silicate sheets. However, a smaller relaxation time difference still exists through a Si-H dipolar contribution to one type of sheet from the interlayer water. This contribution disappears when the interlayer water is removed by heating. The presence of considerable contributions from these mechanisms to Si spin-lattice relaxations in solid silicates will clearly be beneficial where the use of Si-H cross-polarization is either impossible or undesirable and where long relaxation times, typical of rigid solids, would otherwise be expected...|$|E

40|$|The {{deterministic}} {{approach to}} the analysis of river channel instability has not proved to be a com-pletely useful basis for geographic predictions of channel behavior. Economic estimates for benefits of <b>structural</b> <b>channel</b> control projects commonly account for flood inundation, but in arid and semiarid regions these estimates are incomplete because they fail to take into account destructive channel migra-tion and erosion. As a solution, a method whereby historical records of channel locations are reduced to spatially defined probabilistic functions allows calculation of the probability that given parcels of near-channel terrain will be destroyed by erosion. The probability of erosion for any given parcel over a given period of time is directly proportional to the sizes of the annual floods during the period and inversely proportional to two distance measures: distance upstream and distance laterally to the channel. In a test of the probabilistic geographic method using data on the locations of Rillito Creek, Arizona, from 1871 to 1978, erosion probability maps accurately characterized the locations of observed changes. In a 50 -year simulated period, erosion ultimately produced economic losses that were 5 times greater than potential inundation losses.

40|$|Collateral {{markets have}} become {{increasingly}} important as demand for collateral assets has increased in recent years, driven by changing market practices and an evolving regulatory landscape. This report explores whether and how the design of central banks' operational frameworks influences private collateral markets, including collateral availability, pricing, related market practices, and market performance under stress. It studies these issues by reviewing available information {{from a range of}} sources, including central bank case studies as well as surveys and interviews with private sector participants in collateral markets. Central banks influence markets for collateral through either the supply of assets available for use as collateral (a scarcity channel), the pledgeability of assets in private transactions (a <b>structural</b> <b>channel),</b> or both. They therefore have a variety of design choices at their disposal to influence collateral markets as well as to fine-tune the effects of their operations on these markets. While central bank operating frameworks are not usually the most important factor influencing collateral markets, the evidence presented in this report indicates that the influence of central banks may at times be significant, in particular during crisis times. This highlights the importance of carefully monitoring the effects of central bank operations on collateral markets, as well as the need for central banks to examine their operational frameworks to ensure preparedness for any future crisis response...|$|E

Due to its high computational efficiency, our model can predict the full current-voltage characteristics of a channel within minutes, based on the experimental 3 D structure of the channel or its computational model structure. Compared with other methods, such as Brownian dynamics, which currently needs {{a few weeks of}} the computational time, or even much more demanding molecular dynamics modeling, 3 D-PNP is the only available method for a function-based evaluation of very numerous tentative <b>structural</b> <b>channel</b> models. Flow model tests of our algorithm and its optimal parametrization are provided for five native channels whose experimental structures are available in the protein data bank (PDB) in an open conductive state, and whose experimental current-voltage characteristics have been published. The channels represent very different geometric and structural properties, which makes it the widest test to date of the accuracy of 3 D-PNP on real channels. We test whether the channel conductance, rectification, and charge selectivity obtained from the flow model, could be sufficiently sensitive to single-point mutations, related to unsignificant changes in the channel structure. Our results show that the classical 3 D-PNP model, under proper parametrization, is able to achieve a qualitative agreement with experimental data for a majority of the tested characteristics and channels, including channels with narrow and irregular conductivity pores. We propose that although the standard PNP model cannot provide insight into complex physical phenomena due to its intrinsic limitations, its semiquantitative agreement is achievable for rectification and selectivity at a level sufficient for the bioinformatical purpose of selecting the best structural models with a great advantage of a very short computational time...|$|E

This asymmetry seems to be related to a relaxation process involving ferrous ions and water molecules in the <b>structural</b> <b>channels,</b> as suggested by Price et al. (1976). Surprisingly, the spectrum at 500 K also shows a broad, but symmetrical, doublet, with a clear splitting of the lines indicating the presence of at least two Fe 2 + components.

A meaningful fit of the room-temperature spectrum, as well as an explanation for the temperature dependence of the Mossbauer spectra, are discussed.

A team of consulting engineers and ecological scientists provided analysis and design services for habitat enhancements for the affected river resources. The existing watercourses {{affected by the}} highway project have been highly altered by previous urban development activity, which has degraded the habitat function of these streams. Therefore, the design focused on creation of a naturalized channel for each affected watercourse reach, with habitat features that replicate and, if possible, improve upon the functions observed in the current watercourses. Design objectives included consideration of channel conveyance capacity and stability, channel improvements compatible with highway alignment and structural design, and provision of structural habitat features and other in-stream and riparian enhancements. The design project involved the application of “natural channel design” techniques and traditional hydraulic engineering and structural design approaches. The design addressed critical elements, such as channel reaches, that no longer have functional floodplains, potential scour at bridge structures, and removal of obstructions to fish passage at existing structures. One of the major features influencing design was {{the presence of a}} remnant dam spillway. The design process involved analysis of geo-morphological characteristics and habitat features of existing river reaches. Relocated river segments incorporate appropriate pool-riffle sequence, substrate conditions, and other habitat structural elements. Riprap grade control structures were integrated into the habitat enhancements. Design also provided for introduction of riparian vegetation; culvert replacements and extensions incorporating fish passage features; and replacement of an existing inadequate fish-way structure previously constructed in a partially breached dam.

40|$|Summary. Several cordierites from pegmatites {{were found}} by {{emission}} spectro-scopy to contain as nluch as 0. 7 wt. % of BeO. Structural crystallographic considera-tions {{suggest that the}} beryl molecule, Be 3 Al~Si 6 Ols, may have appreciable solubility {{in the structure of}} cordierite. Some hydrothermal experiments carried out on this assumption i dicated about he same amount of BeO substitution i the magmatic temperature ange as is shown by the pegmatite cordierites. The natural BeO-bearing cordierites have distinctive infra-red absorption properties, which are reproduced in the synthetic solid solutions. I T is shown in the present study that some cordierites from pegmatites contain considerable amounts of BeO. This phenomenon, although it has not been reported previously, is not surprising in view of the close structural relation between cordierite, orthorhombic (Mg, Fe) 2 AlaSi 5 Ols, and beryl, hexagonal B%A 12 Si 6 Ols (Gossner, 1928; Bragg, 1930). Both structures are characterized by six-membered rings of tetrahedrally co-ordinated cations enclosing a large <b>structural</b> <b>channel,</b> which is the probable location of the varying amounts of loosely held water that almost all natural cordierite contains (Smith and Schreyer, 1962). At least one of the six ring cations in cordierite is A 1 a+, which fact probably gives rise to the departure from hexagonal symmetry in cor-dierite (Schreyer and Schairer, 1961). A recent structural determination reveals that the six-membered ring is probably made of 4 SiO~- tetra-hedra and 2 AlOe- tetrahedra (G. V. Gibbs, to be published). Varying amounts of disorder among silicon and aluminum atoms in a TgOls frame-work of tetrahedra can give rise to a symmetry variation that culmi-nates in a truly hexagonal structure in the case of complete disordering. Hydrothermally s nthesized Mg-eordierites and those synthesized in air below 1300 ~ C from glass are hexagonal. A natural hexagonal cordierite found in altered shale adjacent o a burning coal seam has been called indialite (Miyashiro et al., 1955).

40|$|Cordierite is a {{relatively}} widespread mineral, having a peculiar ability to trap H 2 O and CO 2 up to very high pressure and temperature. This is a unique property for a rock forming silicate, and has {{a significant role in}} the mineralogical equilibria in HT and UHT metamorphism (Harley and Thompson, 2004). In this work, great attention was paid to the study of the diffusion mechanisms of carbon dioxide inside these channel-like structures. Considering that carbon dioxide is probably one of the major responsible for long-term climate change on Earth (IPCC, 2005), the ability of these minerals to entrap CO 2 could provide insights for future research for the permanent CO 2 storage in minerals. The aim of this Thesis was to investigate the diffusion of CO 2 across cordierite, and address possible implications from both a geological and a technological point of view. The work was completed by the parallel study of beryl, which is structurally correlated to cordierite. The text is divided into four major sections: 1) In the first section (Chapter 1 and 2) I introduce the issues related to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of H 2 O and CO 2 in cordierite by means of Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (hereafter FTIR). In detail I show the crystal-chemical and spectroscopic study of chemically different samples, from an almost Mg-cordierite end-member to its Fe-analogue sekaninaite. Additionally I will discuss the calibration of the molar absorption coefficient ε, an indispensable coefficient for quantitative measurement in FTIR micro-spectroscopy. Both these chapters have been published in first-rank mineralogical and petrological journals and are thus reported here as they are published. 2) In the second section (Chapter 3 and 4) I’ll focus in mechanism of outward CO 2 diffusion: to this purpose, oriented single-crystal cordierite slabs were heated by using a heating-stage under the FTIR microscope and investigated using in situ FTIR μ-spectroscopy. Part of this study was done using a synchrotron-light source (SR-FTIR) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and attain higher spatial resolution in the data. In this section I studied in particular the absorbance variation at constant temperature as a function of time, and evaluated the kinetic and diffusion parameters for CO 2 expulsion from the matrix. 3) In the third section (Chapter 5) I discuss the mechanism of inward diffusion of CO 2 within the <b>structural</b> <b>channel</b> of cordierite and beryl under different pressure, temperature and time conditions. The experimental work was done using a piston cylinder apparatus. In this section I’ll make extensive use of high resolution single-crystal FTIR Focal Planar Array (FTIR-FPA) imaging to characterize possible inhomogeneity in the CO 2 /H 2 O across the samples, and identify the possible pathways for CO 2 diffusion. As it will be shown, the spectroscopic imaging was also necessary to locate the analytical spots for CO 2 measurements in the sample. 4) The last part (Chapter 6, 7 and 8) covers additional features observed during the work. In particular, chapter 6 deals with a multidisciplinary study of a peculiar diffusion pattern of CO 2 across an hourglass zoned beryl. This chapter relates on advances in techniques such as Time Of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) chemical imaging, polarized light FPA imaging and High Resolution SR-FTIR mapping.

40|$|Cement-based materials, such as {{concrete}} or mortars, {{are usually}} considered materials with low technological level. Although {{they are the}} most employed human made materials in the world, others such as wood, plastics, metals and even stones are usually more valued in the everyday life: probably the fact that cement is cheap, readily available, common, and has been employed successfully for centuries, contributes to its low technology perception. However, this vision is far from the reality: the cement paste is a complex multicomponent and heterogeneous composite system, with different structural features at different length scales. The mechanism in which the clinker in contact with water becomes a hardened paste comprises hundreds of chemical reactions and physical processes. Understanding the molecular details of cement hydration processes is of fundamental importance due to the technological and economical impact of these materials. Several aspects need to be considered, and a realistic approach should be limited to a few specific features. Many efforts have been devoted over the last 40 years to develop mathematical models for understanding and predicting highly complex cement hydration kinetics, microstructure development and the implications of these for the changing physical-chemical properties of cement paste and concrete. An accurate hydration simulation approach would enable scientists and engineers not only to predict the performance of concrete, but also to design new cementitious materials. Despite significant effort and progress, the ability to perform such a complete simulation has not yet been developed, mainly because cement hydration {{is one of the more}} complex phenomena in engineering/materials science. The main objective of this PhD thesis is to analyse the influence of superplasticizers on the microevolution of cement suspensions during early hydration based of Molecular Dynamics (MD) approaches. To this purpose we implemented a MD protocol for the study of the behavior of polycarboxylate-ether-based superplasticizers (PCEs) in the presence of selected cement surfaces, tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) and tricalcium silicate (C 3 S), water molecules and calcium hydroxide. The final goal of the project, which was carried in collaboration with the group of Prof. G. Artioli - Università degli Studi di Padova, Dipartimento di Geoscienze, was to clarify structure-properties relationships, in order to design new products with enhanced properties. In fact, the rheology of cement pastes can be controlled by the use of superplasticizers that, by adsorbing on the surfaces of cement particles, enhance their workability. The protocol was made up of the following steps: i) building of the cement surfaces, ii) parameterization of force field, iii) setting of the simulation and evaluation of physical observables. Some methodological knowledges acquired were employed on side-applications, for example the evaluation of electrostatic interactions of other organic molecules, in particular partial charges of amino acids (AA) and nonstandard amino acids (Non-AA), present in the human Connexin protein. To be precise, following the earlier approach of Bayly et al [Bayly 1993], we obtained the charge set by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of Non-AA calculated using ab-initio methods. This effort was carried out in collaboration with the group of F. Mammano - Università degli Studi di Padova, Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia [Zonta 2014]. Finally, in a joint effort with Dott. ssa L. Orian, Dott. M. Torsello and P. Calligari, of my research group, simulate complete simulation was carried out of the Connexin 26 hemichannel (Cx 26) behaviour in the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and Ca 2 +. The contribution to this joint project described in this thesis, was aimed to i) the analysis of the structure of the channel and ii) the preservation of salt bridges between Glu 47, Arg 75 and gamma-Glu 47, Arg 75 in the presence/asbsence of Ca 2 +. Lastly, preliminary results based on a collaboration with Stazione Sperimentale del Vetro (SSV) of Murano (Ve) for the project: "Computational methods for the modeling of equilibrium properties of glassy materials", is presented. The goal of this work was the elaboration, optimization and validation of a model of the type of ideal solutions for the thermodynamic properties of glasses and the inclusion in integrated software platforms. This work is organised as follows. In chapter 1, a brief overview is presented of the atomistic simulation methods used during the Thesis, because several levels of theory were selected depending on their capabilities to solve punctual problems: ab initio, Molecular Mechanics, and Molecular Dynamics. In chapter 2, an introduction to cement chemistry and the necessary basis is given in order to follow the results and discussions of the systems presented in this Thesis. It covers a description of clinker phases, superplasticizers, the hydration process, the cement paste structure and computational methods applied in cement research. In chapter 3, the results of four MD simulations are discussed for a system consisting of PCE-(23 - 7 - 1), a comb-shaped polymer unit model superplasticizer of methyl-polyethylene glycole methacrylate and methacrylic acids (seven back bone units, one side-chain unit and twenty three polyethylene-oxide units in the side chain), the C 3 A and C 3 S surfaces, explicit molecules of water, Ca 2 + and OH- ions (pore solution) : from the MD trajectories were calculated conformational properties.

The crystal structure belongs {{to the group of}} single-layer silicates and is based on silicate sheets parallel to (110). A single layer contains secondary (Q 2) and tertiary (Q 3) silicate tetrahedra in the ratio 1 : 2 and is build up from six-, eight- and twelve-membered rings. The linkage between neighboring layers is achieved by two crystallographically independent Y 3 + cations, which are coordinated by six oxygen ligands in form of distorted octahedra. Charge compensation is accomplished by incorporation of additional F− anions and K+ cations in the <b>structural</b> <b>channels,</b> forming anion-centred [F 2 K 7] groups. Apart from one K+ and one Y 3 + cation (each with site symmetry - 1), the 30 crystallographically independent atoms reside on general positions...|$|R
40|$|Irradiations with swift heavy ions {{have been}} {{performed}} using different crystalline target materials and various pressure and irradiation conditions. Changes in the crystal lattice, e. g. the production of point defects and amorphisation, have been characterised by Raman spectroscopy. The cordierite lattice is very resistant against radiation-induced damage, while the amount of volatile phases in the <b>structural</b> <b>channels</b> is significantly changed. Furthermore, a direct conversion from CO 2 to CO could be evidenced. Irradiations along the different crystallographic axes did not yield sytematic differences regarding the monitored parameters. In contrast to cordierite, apatite is substantially more sensitive to radiation damage. With increasing fluence, the overall amount of amorphisation increases. However, even for the highest fluences, complete amorphisation could not be achieved. Irradiations along the different crystallographic axes show larger amounts of damage for samples irradiated parallel (0001). The application of external pressure during irradiation stabilises the lattice and can prevent amorphisation. The suitability of large-volume Paris-Edinburgh presses for in-situ irradiation with swift heavy ions could be proven...|$|R
40|$|Palygorskite is {{fibrous clay}} {{in which the}} {{structural}} tetrahedral and octahedral layers are organized {{in a way that}} <b>structural</b> <b>channels</b> are formed, leading to high surface area. However, impurities inside the channels and aggregated ones considerably reduce the available area. In order to increase the surface area, an activation treatment can be considered useful. The goal of this work is the activation of palygorskite from Guadalupe, Piauí, via sulfuric acid treatment using a two-level factorial design. The influence of three parameters (solution molarity, temperature and time) on BET surface area was determined. Moreover, samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The largest surface area (282 m 2 /g) without considerable changes in clay structure and morphology was found in a sample treated with 5 M H 2 SO 4 at 70 °C for 1 h. The main parameters that favored the improvement of the surface area were the solution’s molarity, temperature and their interaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{microscopic}} {{model for the}} dominant carbonate for phosphate substitution in fluorapatite. A well-crystallized sedimentary fluorapatite sample containing ~ 2. 3 ± 0. 8 wt% of carbonate was investigated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 13 C and 19 F magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR). About 75 % of carbonate groups replace the phosphate group (“B-site"), whereas a lesser contribution from carbonate groups located in the <b>structural</b> <b>channels</b> (“A-site”) is observed. Beside the dominant 19 F NMR signal of channel ions at ~- 102 ppm, an additional signal corresponding to ~ 8 % of fluoride ions is observed at- 88 ppm. 19 F double quantum-single quantum (DQ-hal- 00823261, version 1 - 28 May 2013 SQ) MAS NMR and 13 C { 19 F} frequency-selective Rotational Echo DOuble Resonance (REDOR) experiments evidence that this additional signal corresponds to isolated fluoride ions in the apatite structure, located in close proximity of substituted carbonate groups. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow us to propose a composite carbonatefluoride tetrahedron defect model accounting for these experimental observations. The plana...|$|R

Magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that Fe 1 -xMgxSb 2 O 4 (x = 0. 25, 0. 50) are canted antiferromagnets whilst Fe 0. 25 Mg 0. 75 Sb 2 O 4 is paramagnetic. The magnetic ordering temperatures decrease as the Mg 2 + concentration increases. The materials form oxygen-excess phases when heated in oxygen-rich atmospheres at temperatures of ~ 350 C. 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy {{shows that the}} oxidation process involves the oxidation of Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +. Powder neutron diffraction confirms {{the location of the}} excess oxygen within the <b>structural</b> <b>channels</b> and reveals a change in magnetic order at low temperatures from A-type (magnetic moments along { 100 }) for Fe 1 -xMgxSb 2 O 4 to C-type (magnetic moments along [001]) for the oxidised materials.

40|$|The aim of {{this test}} study was to achieve an in-situ {{strengthening}} technique to retrofit the deteriorated tall steel structures using carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP). A total of 20 <b>structural</b> steel <b>channel</b> sections with various retrofitting configurations were tested to arrive at an optimal strengthening technique to improve the buckling mode of failure of <b>structural</b> steel <b>channel</b> section under flexural loading. An approach of transforming the open cross section to closed cross section was used to increase the torsional resistance of channel sections. The various parameters such as type of CFRP fabric, wrapping configuration (skin and closed wrap) and number of CFRP layers were also included in this study. The {{results indicate that the}} closed wrapped configuration with an additional (final) layer of bi-directional CFRP fabric provides the higher strength and stiffness compared to control and skin wrapped specimen due to the confinement of hoop directional fibers. This study also proves that the lateral torsional buckling (LTB) mode of failure of open cross section specimens can be improved by appropriate CFRP strengthening techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{positive}} relationship between SES and health is well documented but limited evidence exists regarding the effect of an exogenous manipulation of SES on health. This article estimates the effect of promotions on heart disease using data on British civil servants from the Whitehall II study. Differences in promotion rates across departments and cohorts generate plausibly exogenous vari-ation in promotion opportunities. The results suggest that promotions may reduce the probability of developing heart disease by 2. 6 – 12. 8 percentage points over a 15 -year period. These estimates appear robust and are several times larger than cross-sectional estimates. A long-standing debate exists regarding the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health. The positive cross-sectional correlation between SES and health is well established (Marmot, 2003). Nevertheless, two surveys of the literature by econom-ists document the difficulty in measuring the causal effect of SES on health as defined by Rubin (1974) and summarise the empirical evidence as inconclusive (Smith, 1999; Deaton, 2003). Some research suggests that lagged SES predicts future health out-comes (Adda et al., 2003) {{and a large number}} of studies examine the <b>structural</b> <b>channels</b> through which the observed health gradient may operate (Marmot et al. ...|$|R
