40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{how and why}} welfare policies {{focusing on}} empowerment as users' self-management create dilemmas in medically assisted drug treatment in Denmark. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, the article points to two sets of dilemmas {{by focusing on the}} relationship between legal and institutional setups and staff and user possibilities for agency. The first dilemma concerns how to provide user self-management and individualized services and the actual possibilities of effectuating this in welfare institutions imbued by limited resources, manpower, and local rules. The second, how to create a balance between notions of user self-management and legal demands of control regarding <b>substitution</b> <b>medicine.</b> The article analyzes empowerment as a policy arguing that implementation of policy - also called policy in practice - is integral to policy studies, rather than a domain that is separate from policy making.

40|$|Although {{several major}} {{progresses}} {{have been introduced}} {{in the field of}} bone regenerative medicine during the years, current therapies, such as bone grafts, still have many limitations. Moreover, and {{in spite of the fact}} that material science technology has resulted in clear improvements in the field of bone <b>substitution</b> <b>medicine,</b> no adequate bone substitute has been developed and hence large bone defects/injuries still represent a major challenge for orthopaedic and reconstructive surgeons. It is in this context that TE has been emerging as a valid approach to the current therapies for bone regeneration/substitution. In contrast to classic biomaterial approach, TE is based on the understanding of tissue formation and regeneration, and aims to induce new functional tissues, rather than just to implant new spare parts. The present review pretends to give an exhaustive overview on all components needed for making bone tissue engineering a successful therapy. It begins by giving the reader a brief background on bone biology, followed by an exhaustive description of all the relevant components on bone TE, going from materials to scaffolds and from cells to tissue engineering strategies, that will lead to engineered bone.

40|$|During {{the past}} century, and {{particularly}} in the past three decades, the application of conventional materials technology has resulted in clear advances in <b>substitution</b> <b>medicine.</b> For example, the development of artificialhips and knees have brought enormous benefits to patients. However, there are still no materials available that can adequately replace or aid the regeneration of functional tissues such as bones or large bone segments. In an increasingly aging population, malfunction or loss of tissue from injury or disease has led to reduced quality of life for many patients at significant socio-economic cost. There is thus demand for the development of new therapies through a multidisciplinary, biology driven approach in which biological tissues are engineered using both materials and bio-technologies. Tissue engineering has created a new field of application for biodegradable polymers, paving the way for the development of new classes of biomaterials from synthetic or natural origin and for the design of new materials formats for hybrid tissues. A general overview is provided of the main applications of biodegradable polymers in medicine, with particular emphasis on tissue engineering. The approaches available to tissue engineers and the requirements scaffold materials must fulfil to promote adequate interaction with cells and tissues are described; predictable trends and future developments are discussed. Processing routes for biodegradable polymeric scaffolds are also considered, presenting examples of three-dimensional materials fabricated by different methodologies...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{community}} pharmacists’ knowledge, attitude, perception and current practices towards generic <b>medicines</b> <b>substitution</b> in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} between February and March 2016 in the Makkah region, Saudi Arabia. A 25 -item, structured, validated, pilot-tested and self-completed questionnaire was used to achieve study objectives. A 4 -step systematic sampling technique was used to recruit community pharmacists. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. Results: Of 128 community pharmacists approached, 121 {{participated in the study}} (response rate = 95 %). Majority of the participants (n = 108; 89. 3 %) had graduated from Egypt, were working as staff pharmacists (n = 85; 70 %) and had BPharm degree (97; 80. 2 %). Only 26 (22 %) of the participants correctly answered all knowledge questions accurately. No statistically significant difference in total knowledge score was observed across different sociodemographic characteristics of participants (all P > 0. 05). Two-thirds of the respondents (83; 68. 2 %) supported the use of generic <b>substitution.</b> <b>Medicines</b> cost and patients’ request were the most commonly cited reasons for performing generic substitution. Country of graduation (P = 0. 01) and number of years of practicing in Saudi Arabia (P = 0. 02) was associated with the pharmacists’ support towards generic substitution. Conclusion: The community pharmacists had clear knowledge deficits about generic <b>medicines</b> and their <b>substitution</b> which may partly explain low consumption of generic medicines in Saudi Arabia.

40|$|Objectives This study {{evaluated}} Australian community pharmacists' rate {{of generic}} <b>medicine</b> <b>substitution,</b> patient acceptance of generic substitution and cost-savings achieved for patients from substitution. Method A national stratified sample of 500 Australian pharmacies was {{randomly selected from}} different geographical areas. The data of the first 25 original PBS prescription items dispensed on one working day eligible for generic substitution were collected from each pharmacy. Results Responses were received from 82 pharmacies with {{a response rate of}} 16. 4 %. The pharmacists recommended generics for 96. 4 % (1461 / 1515) of the prescription items which were eligible for substitution. The generic substitution recommendation rate in urban (98. 7 %) and rural areas (98. 0 %) was significantly higher than remote areas (91. 6 %). Conversely, patients' acceptance in remote areas (84. 5 %) was significantly higher than rural (78. 6 %) and urban areas (73. 2 %). Patients with chronic diseases demonstrated significantly lower acceptability (72. 4 %) than patients with acute conditions (81. 6 %).

40|$|As {{there is}} general {{disagreement}} about the way generic medicines should be commercialized, two retailing policies are analyzed, taking into account their effects on the welfare of patients, government, pharmacies and physicians. In the first policy scenario, pharmacies are allowed to substitute generic medicines for branded ones, while in the second, substitution is forbidden. In both cases a pharmacies association is allowed to have {{a share in the}} production of generic medicines. The model predicts that under some conditions patients may prefer substitution by pharmacies but when doctors’ decisions are binding, they are never “excessively bad”.

Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study involving {{the entire population of}} Malaysian community pharmacies (nÂ =Â  1419) was undertaken using a self-completed anonymous mail questionnaire. Results A total of 219 responses were received for a response rate of 15. 4 %. Majority of the respondents (93. 6 %) agreed that pharmacists should have generic substitution rights. Almost all pharmacists (96. 8 %) viewed Poison Class C (pharmacist only medicine) as most suitable class of controlled <b>medicines</b> for <b>substitution.</b> About half (51. 6 %) of the pharmacists preferred a policy which allowed substitution on any prescription. The pharmacists prefer to consult the physician when substituting narrow therapeutic index medicines (88. 1 %) and prescription only medicines (51. 3 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} (1) what is the patients' attitude towards and (2) preferences to use generic medicines in Bulgaria and (3) which are the main factors influencing their opinion. METHODS: Using pseudo-randomization we select a sample of 225 participants, men and women from general population, patients in community pharmacies. For our survey we used a standardized self-questionnaire of ten points. The influence of sex, age, education, medical history, knowledge of generic drugs and experience with generic <b>substitution</b> and <b>medicines</b> was examined through Chi-square tests. RESULTS: The results show that 74 % of the participants seemed not to be informed on generic drugs and 26 % received valuable and relevant information from their general practitioner or pharmacist. 94 % believed that generic medicines are inferior to brand medicines on quality, safety and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The main reason for almost all the participants (94 %) to prefer original medicines, over generics is the insufficient information, they have. The core factors forming patients' opinion and expectations for generic drugs are medical professionals' recommendation and previous experience. The main advantages of the generics according to the participants in the study are the lower price and better accessibility. The results raise the issue of the awareness and level knowledge about generic medicines and the rational drug use in the general population...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practice}} (GP) fundholders contained prescribing {{costs by}} restricting {{the rise in}} volume of prescribing and by increasing generic prescribing. It is uncertain whether they used more sophisticated approaches to medicine choice in attempts to contain costs. AIM: To examine whether fundholding practices have adopted medicine-specific strategies to contain prescribing costs [...] i. e. switching to less expensive but equally effective medicines or resisting the uptake of newer more expensive medicines [...] by examination of the prescribing of ulcer-healing and antidepressant medicines in the period before and after practices became fundholders. METHOD: Comparison of prescribing data of 52 fundholding practices before fundholding and after fundholding with that of matched non-fundholding practices. Measures examined were prescribing costs (net ingredient cost in each therapeutic area per ASTRO-pu); prescribing volume (defined daily doses per ASTRO-pu); the proportion of all ulcer-healing medicines prescribed as cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, and as proton pump inhibitors; {{and the proportion of}} all antidepressant medicines prescribed as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. RESULTS: In comparison with non-fundholding practices, fundholders increasingly prescribed less expensive medicines (cimetidine and nizatidine) within the class of histamine 2 receptor antagonists. However, fundholders adopted proton pump inhibitors or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors {{at the same rate as}} non-fundholders. CONCLUSION: Fundholders have used therapeutic <b>substitution</b> with <b>medicines</b> of equal effectiveness to contain prescribing costs. There is no evidence that fundholders have been slower than non-fundholders to use newer, more expensive medicines...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. The South African {{healthcare}} {{industry has}} undergone numerous changes {{over the last}} two decades in both the public and private sectors. These changes have influenced the regulatory landscape of both sectors with the aim of improving accessibility to healthcare services and providers, and making healthcare more affordable for the South African public. The South African government introduced the Medical Schemes Act No. 131 of 1998, in response to issues faced in the medical scheme industry. The act allowed for a board of trustees to regulate medical schemes in their governance (McIntyre, Thiede, Nkosi, Mutyambizi, Castilo-Riquelme, Gilson, Erasmus & Goudge, 2007). The main aim was to ensure medical schemes were able to maintain solvency levels and maintain benefits offered to beneficiaries. The pharmaceutical industry saw legislative changes governing the pricing of <b>medicines,</b> generic <b>substitution</b> of <b>medicines</b> and open ownership of pharmacies. The researcher aimed to provide the medical scheme industry with valuable insight into the challenges experienced by pharmacists, when processing and submitting claims for medical scheme members and their beneficiaries. The intention was to enable the medical scheme industry to improve service quality and efficiency in provider relationships, and customer relationships. The research consisted of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A focus group interview consisted of the initial phase, producing qualitative data. The researcher utilised the qualitative data to construct an online questionnaire, which he then sent out through email, to a larger group of retail pharmacists in KwaZulu-Natal. The majority of retail pharmacists who participated in the research had a limited knowledge of all medical schemes and the different options available in South Africa. The majority of pharmacists in both groups were of the opinion that the redesigning and simplification of computer programmes, utilised for submitting prescriptions, would improve efficiency in service delivery. The research further found that the dissemination of information, on a variety of topics, from medical schemes to their members and service providers, should improve to increase efficiency in service delivery and foster better relationships...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} survey was to assess awareness of and attitudes to biosimilars amongst physicians (medical specialists and General Practitioners (GPs)) and community pharmacists in Ireland. Physicians were invited to complete an online questionnaire during April and May 2016. Community pharmacists received a postal questionnaire in August 2015. Responses from 102 medical specialists, 253 GPs and 125 community pharmacists were analysed. The majority of medical specialists (85 %) and pharmacists (77 %) claimed to be either very familiar or familiar with the term biosimilar, whereas many GPs (60 %) were unable to define or {{had never heard of}} the term. One in five (21 %) healthcare professionals responded that biosimilars were the same as generic medicines.

The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the different stages of MAP from the RNs’ perspective. Methods. A qualitative descriptive research design, with a purposive sample involving thematic interviews of 20 RNs and questions to them in a paper form, was conducted in two medical units.

Besides patient-interviews I have examined textual material intended for patients, a folder for general practitioners, parts of a report (no. 1444) on medicine subsidies and the correct utilization of medicine, and parts of the Danish Medicines Boards guidance on review of medicine. Despite of the administrative and economic discourse used in the written material, and in the way patients perceive the communication at the pharmacy, actual effect is more important than pricing for the group of patients that I have interviewed. They are skeptical when faced with a communication, where individuality is not articulated. Furthermore a strong competition or commodity discourse could be identified among patients, which might be a reason for their strong wish to use only the original medical product. In line with the theories of Erving Goffman the patients made secondary adaption such as resignation, irony, acquisition of OTC medicine, changing of dose and choosing to pay for themselves.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{suitability}} and potential cost savings, {{from both the}} hospital and community perspective, of prescribed oral liquid <b>medicine</b> <b>substitution</b> with acceptable solid forms for children over 2 years. METHOD: Oral liquid medicines dispensed from a paediatric hospital (UK) in 1 week were assessed by screening for existence of the solid form alternative and evaluating the acceptability of the available solid form, firstly related to the prescribed dose and secondly to acceptable size depending on the child's age. Costs were calculated based on providing treatment for 28 days or prescribed duration for short term treatments. RESULTS: Over 90 % (440 / 476) of liquid formulations were available as a marketed solid form. Considering dosage acceptability (maximum of 10 % deviation from prescribed dosage or 0 % for narrow therapeutic range drugs, maximum tablet divisions into quarters) 80 % of liquids could be substituted with a solid form. The main limitation for liquid substitution would be solid form size. However, two-thirds of prescribed liquids could have been substituted with a suitable solid form for dosage and size, with estimated savings being of 5 K and 8 K in 1 week, respectively based on hospital and community costs, corresponding to a projected annual saving of 238 K and 410 K (single institution). CONCLUSION: Whilst not all children over 2 years {{will be able to}} swallow tablets, drug cost savings if oral liquid formulations were substituted with suitable solid dosage forms would be considerable.

40|$|Introduction: Currently, {{there is}} a lot of {{discussion}} about whether generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with the same active moiety but from different manufacturers can take place safely. Many AEDs are considered to have a narrow therapeutic index, and the consequences of an epileptic attack are severe, in a physical, psychological and social respect. Therefore, {{there is a}}mple ground to look critically at generic <b>substitution</b> of anti-epileptic <b>medicines.</b> In this context, the Dutch regulatory agency evaluated the exposureof generic AEDs and the occurrence of epilepsy related events. Methods: Reports received by the Dutch Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb were screened for issues related to generic substitution of AEDs. Public literature dealing with generic substitution of AEDs was reviewed and checked for potential pharmacological issues related to generic substitution of AEDs. Finally, the exposures upon changing between different topiramate and gabapentin generics was evaluated based on internal bioequivalence data. Results: In only 26 of in total 2, 103 reports in the Lareb database mentioning an AED as the suspected drug, a possible relationship was indicated with the substitution from a branded AED to a generic one. However, these data should be treated with care, since underreporting is a well-known phenomenon. The majority of publications on generic substitution of AEDs concerned potential instead of actual cases, with many publications based on surveys regarding prescribers' overall experience with switching. Potential issues raised in these publications relate to bioequivalence requirements, use of healthy volunteers instead of patients, variability in exposure, problems with medicine supply, and costs of adverse events. Overall, with very few exceptions, no differences in exposure upon generic substitution of AEDs were actually reported. Generic-generic substitution was also indicated as a potential problem. However, our investigations on topiramate and gabapentin generic-generic substitution indicated that this does not result in significant differences in exposure. Estimated ratios of AUC and Cmax upon substituting generics ranged from 94. 1 - 113. 1 % and 91. 2 - 103. 1 % for topiramate and from 95. 6 - 114. 9 % and 92. 5 111. 5 % for gabapentin, respectively. Conclusion: Overall, no evidence was found for a causal pharmacological relationship between switching to or between generic AEDs and the occurrence of epilepsy-related adverse events. Based on the strict requirements on generics, pharmacological differences between innovator and generic AEDs are considered unlikely, and have indeed hardly been reported. Alternative explanations for increased susceptibility to seizures with generic AEDs may be envisioned, like e. g., new or withdrawn co-medication, compliance, frequent switching, and differences in shape and colour of generics...|$|R
