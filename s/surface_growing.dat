Abstract. – In recent years {{there has been}} a growing interest in the statistical properties of <b>surfaces</b> <b>growing</b> under deposition of material. Yet it is clear that a theory describing the evolution of a surface should at the same time describe the properties of the bulk buried underneath. Clearly, the structure of the bulk is relevant for many practical purposes, such as the transport of electric current in devices, transport of fluids in geological formations and stress transmission in granular systems. The present paper demonstrates explicitly how models describing deposition can provide us with information on the structure of the bulk. Comparison of an analytic model with a simulation of a discrete growth model reveals an interesting long range tail in the density-density correlation in the direction of deposition. The study of the statistical properties of <b>surfaces</b> <b>growing</b> under the deposition of material has attracted many researchers over the last two decades.

40|$|Abstract. Usually, {{theories}} of surface growth {{are based on}} the study of global processes without taking into account the local behaviour of atoms. In this work we present two simulations making use of a parallel computing library. These two simulations are based on a simple model that allows us to simulate the <b>surface</b> <b>growing</b> process of a certain mate-rial. The first one is a quasi-static model whereas the second recreates the atomic interaction considering the free atoms in continuous movement along the surface. Both simulations make use of local principles of ther-modynamic for atomic deposition, relaxation and diffusion of a growing surface. The obtained results agree with those that use global theories and with experimental results of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). 1 Introduction to the Physical Model Surface growth of materials is a very well studied topic from the theoretica...|$|E
