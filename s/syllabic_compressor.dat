40|$|The {{effect of}} syllabic {{compression}} on speech intelligibility is rarely positive {{and in those}} cases that positive effects have been found, the same positive results could in general be obtained by frequency shaping of the frequency response curve. We programmed a <b>syllabic</b> <b>compressor</b> on a digital processor; the compressor differed from a conventional <b>syllabic</b> <b>compressor</b> by incorporating a delay in the signal path to suppress overshoots and thus minimize transient distortion. Furthermore, the time constants were short: attack time of 5 msec and release time of 15 msec. The compressor was only active in the high-frequency band. An essentially linear signal was added to deliver the low-frequency speech components. The processing resulted in a frequency response that mirrored the hearing loss near threshold and became much flatter for higher level input signals. Speech intelligibility scores for nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant words embedded in carrier phrases were determined for hearing-impaired persons with sloping audiograms and discrimination losses for speech. Results showed little additional effect of frequency shaping to the existing improved speech score for compressed speech. Optimum results were found for a compression ratio 2 with lower speech scores for linear amplification and for compression ratio 8. We next determined the effect of providing high-frequency emphasis to the speech signal and/or to the compression control signal {{to compensate for the}} upward spread of masking. The frequency response at the root-mean-square level was adjusted according to the half-gain rule. The positive effects of moderate compression could be found again; the high-frequency emphasis, however, was positive for the vowels but made consonant recognition poorer.

40|$|Speech {{perception}} was tested through a broad-band <b>syllabic</b> <b>compressor</b> with four different static input-output configurations. All other {{parameters of the}} compressor were held constant. The compressor was implemented digitally and incorporated a delay to reduce overshoot. We studied four different input-output configurations, including a linear reference condition. Normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects participated in the experiments testing perception of meaningful sentences as well as nonsense CVCs in carrier phrases. The speech materials were presented in quiet and in noise. The results from the CVCs were analyzed quantitatively in terms of scores and qualitatively in terms of phoneme confusions. Differences in speech perception due to the different input-output configurations were small. The input-output configuration with the highest amplification of low amplitude sounds yielded the best results. Detailed analysis of the results included a correlational analysis {{with a number of}} auditory functions characterizing the ears tested. The pure-tone audiogram provided parameters of auditory sensitivity: average audiometric loss and audiometric slope. Psychophysical tests provided parameters of temporal resolution and frequency selectivity: the temporal resolution factor, temporal gap detection, and auditory filter shape. The correlational analysis showed that the subjects with better temporal acuity obtained better result...|$|E

The {{identification of}} consonants in /a/-C-/a/ nonsense syllables, using a fourteen-alternative forced-choice procedure, was examined in 4 profoundly hearing-impaired children under five conditions: audition alone using hearing aids in free-field (A), vision alone (V), auditory-visual using hearing aids in free-field (AV 1), auditory-visual with linear amplification (AV 2), and auditory-visual with syllabic compression (AV 3). In the AV 2 and AV 3 conditions, acoustic signals were binaurally presented by magnetic or acoustic coupling to the subjects' hearing aids. The <b>syllabic</b> <b>compressor</b> had a compression ratio of 10 : 1, and attack and release times were 1. 2 ms and 60 ms. The confusion matrices {{were subjected to}} two analysis methods: hierarchical clustering and information transmission analysis using articulatory features. The same general conclusions were drawn {{on the basis of}} results obtained from either analysis method. The results indicated better performance in the V condition than in the A condition. In the three AV conditions, the subjects predominately combined the acoustic parameter of voicing with the visual signal. No consistent differences were recorded across the three AV conditions. Syllabic compression did not, therefore, appear to have a significant influence on AV perception for these children. A high degree of subject variability was recorded for the A and three AV conditions, but not for the V condition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Multichannel <b>syllabic</b> <b>compressors</b> {{have not}} yet shown clear {{advantages}} for speech perception. New multichannel syllabic nonlinear processors are designed and evaluated in this study to test whether they enhance speech perception scores. DESIGN: Nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant words have been processed in real time with two syllabic nonlinear methods in nine different frequency channels: 1) 30 dB of speech information is mapped into the residual dynamic range (DR) of the subjects with hearing impairment using either compression or expansion; 2) speech levels above the rms level are compressed with a ratio of 3 : 1, and input levels below the rms level are mapped into the reduced DR of the subjects. The overall frequency spectrum of speech is tilted with more high-frequency output for this condition. The two syllabic nonlinear processors were compared with two linear reference systems (one of them with the same spectral tilt as the second nonlinear condition) for seven hearing-impaired subjects. RESULTS: On average, the syllabic nonlinear processors show scores similar {{to one of the}} linear systems. The linear reference with tilt has, on average, 3 % higher scores, mainly due to improved vowel identification. CONCLUSIONS: No negative effects were shown on average for the syllabic nonlinear processors, but no positive effects were demonstrated either. Tilting of the overall speech spectrum was advantageou...|$|R
