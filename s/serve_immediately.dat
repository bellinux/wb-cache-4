60|$|The request {{may have}} {{surprised}} Washington, considering the spirited enterprise {{that was on}} foot; but Gates, as has before been observed, had a disinclination to <b>serve</b> <b>immediately</b> under the commander-in-chief; like Lee, he had a disparaging opinion of him, or rather an impatience of his supremacy. He had, moreover, an ulterior object in view. Having been disappointed and chagrined in finding himself subordinate to General Schuyler in the Northern campaign, he was now intent on making interest {{among the members of}} Congress for an independent command. Washington urged that on his way to Philadelphia he would at least stop {{for a day or two}} at Bristol to concert a plan of operations with Reed and Cadwalader, and adjust any little questions of etiquette and command that might arise between the continental colonels who had gone thither with Lee's troops and the volunteer officers stationed there. He does not appear to have complied even with this request. According to Wilkinson's account, he took quarters at Newtown, and set out thence for Baltimore on the 24th of December, the very day before that of the intended coup de main. The projected attack upon the Hessian posts was to be threefold: 1st. Washington was to cross the Delaware with a considerable force, at McKonkey's Ferry (now Taylorsville), about nine miles above Trenton, and march down upon that place, where Rahl's cantonment comprised a brigade of fifteen hundred Hessians, a troop of British light-horse, and a number of chasseurs. 2d. General Ewing, with a body of Pennsylvania militia, was to cross at a ferry about a mile below Trenton; secure the bridge over the Assunpink creek, a stream flowing along the south side of the town, and cut off any retreat of the enemy in that direction. 3d. General Putnam, with the troops occupied in fortifying Philadelphia, and those under General Cadwalader, was to cross below Burlington and attack the lower posts under Count Donop. The several divisions were to cross the Delaware at night, so as to be ready for simultaneous action by five o'clock in the morning.|$|E

5000|$|Pat Cash criticized Federer's 'lengthy break' {{after the}} 4th set {{due to a}} medical time-out, accusing him of [...] "legal" [...] {{cheating}} and criticized the tournament for allowing Federer to do so. In response, Federer said that Cash was unfair and exaggerating in his criticism, elaborating that his quad and groin began to hurt through {{the second and third}} sets respectively and finally warranted a medical time-out {{after the end of the}} fourth set. Further defending his integrity, Federer said that he was the last guy to take a medical time-out, much less abuse it, citing his 20-year career of having not called a medical time-out prior to the 2017 Australian Open. When asked in the post-match conference for his thoughts, Nadal was indifferent, [...] "having no opinion and didn't know what was going on". Nadal himself had taken a brief break in which he went to the dressing room and returned to court in fresh clothes. As precedence, Nadal also took a timeout in the 2014 final against Stan Wawrinka when he was behind, and came back to play better and win the third set in that final following the break. Nadal's uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, also believed that Federer's medical time out was not called to secure an advantage from stopping the match's rhythm and pace. In fact, Nadal broke Federer's <b>serve</b> <b>immediately</b> after the timeout.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s, the {{denomination}} added {{a significant number}} of congregations outside the South when several UPCUSA churches in Ohio and Pennsylvania joined. This move was precipitated by a case regarding an ordination candidate, Wynn Kenyon, denied by the Pittsburgh Presbytery because he refused to support women's ordination (a decision upheld by the UPCUSA General Assembly). The seceder churches formed the Ascension Presbytery, officially organised on July 29, 1975. That year, a minister of that presbytery described its history as follows: The constituents of the Presbytery of the Ascension were almost exclusively members, in one way or another, of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA). ...Walter Kenyon was an honors graduate of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. ... Mr. Kenyon ... stated that he could not in good conscience participate in the ordination of a woman. He said that it was his understanding of Scripture that prevented such involvement, but {{went on to say that}} he would not stand in the way of such an ordination, if such was the desire of a church which he would happen to <b>serve.</b> <b>Immediately</b> there arose much dissent, and such dissent grew until the overwhelming majority of the church endorsed the judicial verdict which banned Kenyon and all future Kenyons from the pulpits of the UPCUSA. Furthermore, there was both explicit and implicit action which was taken against those men already ordained.The Rev. Arthur C. Broadwick (and the Union United Presbyterian Church USA of Pittsburgh) and the Rev. Carl W. Bogue, Jr. (and the Allenside UPCUSA of Akron, OH) were already involved in litigations which involved this issue. ... When the Permanent Judicial Commission of the UPCUSA ruled that Mr. Kenyon could not be ordained it effectively elevated this doctrine concerning social relationships to the place of being a major doctrine of the church. ...Such action by the Permanent Judicial Commission led to a crisis for all of those pastors and elders who held to the traditional views on this question and who were now considered heretics. Accordingly, to uphold the peace, unity and purity of the church, most of the men who made up the membership of the charter presbytery peaceably withdrew from the UPCUSA. ...A fitting conclusion to this description of the genesis of the Presbytery of the Ascension is the mention of the Presbytery’s new affiliation, the Presbyterian Church in America. In the Fall of 1974, men who were affected by the drift of the Kenyon Case, sent four representatives, from an informal committee which was considering alternatives to the UPCUSA (i.e., in case that body should make a ruling against Mr. Kenyon which would affect the church as a whole), to the second General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in America (which became the Presbyterian Church in America). These four pastors were the Rev. A.C. Broadwick, the Rev. K.E. Perrin, the Rev. R.E. Knodel, Jr., and the Rev. W.L. Thompson, on behalf of the larger concerned group, seeking a historically Reformed body which was also evangelical and mission minded. While this small entourage went to Macon, Georgia with many suspicions and questions, they returned overjoyed that there was an option such as the Presbyterian Church in America.Adopted from Reformationanglicanism.blogspot July 29, 1975 A.D. Ascension Presbytery (PCA) Officially Formed [...] For example, seceders from Union UPCUSA formed Providence Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh under the leadership of Rev. Broadwick.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the first}} major of 2015 Williams opened her {{campaign}} for a 6th Australian Open title against Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium. The world No. 1 was dominant in taking the first set without dropping a game in 21 minutes. A tighter second set followed giving the American her 15th first round win at the tournament in as many tries. In the second round Williams came up against former world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva, a rematch of the 2010 Wimbledon final. Williams fell behind and then responded by rattling off ten consecutive games to win in two sets and advance to the final 32. Serena was also scheduled to play doubles with her sister Venus, drawing Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova in the first round; however, the pair pulled out without giving an official reason before the doubles tournament began and were replaced by an alternate team. In the third round Williams came up against Ukrainian counter-puncher Elina Svitolina and after overcoming a slow start, which saw her drop the first set, she fought back to take the match in three sets, hitting 45 winners to her opponent's 27. The trend of sluggish starts continued in the fourth round where Williams came up against her conqueror from the previous year's French Open, Garbiñe Muguruza. As in their previous meeting the young Spaniard took the opening set from a flat-footed Williams. The pair exchanged breaks {{early in the second}} set but the world No. 1 raised her level to earn the decisive break in the eighth game and take set two. After a difficult opening service game in the third set, in which Williams saved six break points, the American blasted a total of 15 winners to take the third set and the match. [...] "Growing up I wasn't the richest, but I had a rich family in spirit and support, and standing here with 19 championships is something I never thought would happen. I went on the courts with just a ball, a racquet and a hope. That's all I had. So all you guys who want to do something or be something, just never give up. You never know what can happen or who you can inspire. I'm just so honored." [...] Williams during her winner's speech after defeating Maria Sharapova to win her 6th Australian Open. At the quarterfinal stage Williams earned her most comfortable victory of the tournament against the previous year's surprise finalist Dominika Cibulková. The top seed hit 15 aces and dropped just four games en route to setting up a final four meeting with her sister's conqueror Madison Keys. Williams had never failed to win the title in Melbourne once making it to the semifinal stage; however, she was broken in the first game and struggled to get into her Fed Cup teammate's service games. Williams eventually broke back in sixth game and won the set in a tiebreak. The world No. 1 coasted in set two and closed out the match on her ninth match point. With passage in to her 23rd Grand Slam final Williams secured she would maintain the number 1 ranking. In the final she came up against her long-time rival and world No. 2 Maria Sharapova to whom she had not lost to in 15 consecutive meetings. Williams began the match aggressively and broke Sharapova's <b>serve</b> <b>immediately.</b> The match continued with serve until the pair traded breaks in the seventh and eighth games, then the world No. 1 broke to love to take the first set from the 2008 champion. The second set was more tightly contested with both women creating break point opportunities but ultimately going with serve to a tiebreaker. Sharapova saved two championship points on her own serve, but Williams' won on her third championship point for her 19th major title. Williams ended the match with 38 winners, including 18 aces and only 25 unforced errors to Sharapova's 21 winners, including 5 aces and 15 unforced errors. With this win Williams broke her tie with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for second most Grand Slam singles titles in the Open Era and put herself only three major wins behind Steffi Graf's 22.|$|E

40|$|The {{world is}} {{presently}} mired in an energy crisis that challenges {{our ability to}} maintain standards {{of living in the}} North and raise them in the South. With accelerating demand for fossil fuels and relatively stagnant supplies, the fundamental bases of our transportation, energy, and agricultural systems are being questioned. Biofuels provide a more feasible technology than other renewables that could <b>serve</b> <b>immediately</b> to substitute for petroleum products in transportation. However, biofuels have been much reviled as leading to increased food prices and being environmental unfriendly. This article examines the case of Brazil. As a pioneer of biofuel use, Brazil is a key case for studying the possibilities, trade-offs, costs and benefits, of ethanol as an alternative to petroleum. Brazil has had an active program for over 30 years and is the world leader both in terms of technology and usage of ethanol. With relatively low economies of scale, a number of developing countries could successfully adopt the Brazilian system, reducing their dear dependence on petroleum. The evolution of the Brazilian ethanol system and its parameters are therefore of paramount interest to those interested in energy policy around the world. Biofuels Ethanol Brazil...|$|E
40|$|We {{were sitting}} around visiting after rehearsing a few numbers for an {{upcoming}} community variety show—four pastors: one United Methodist, one Free Methodist, one Baptist (North American) and myself, an ELCA Lutheran. Being deep {{in the study of}} the missional church, I suggested that the ministerial association ought to think about some sort of unified mission in the community of Wessington Springs where we <b>serve.</b> <b>Immediately</b> the United Methodist pastor shared with us his idea for holding a Saturday-night worship in the park during the summer months. We seemed to agree that none of our churches would probably be able to pull off something like that on our own, but maybe together we might be able to make it work. The prospect intrigued me. Ecumenical/community worship services are nothing new for this town of 1000 (there are at least four per year), but to hold a regular weekly service throughout the summer? That was a new one! The idea also provoked a number of questions for me. Two (or rather, two sets) in particular form the basis of this paper. First, what is it about worship that would make it the first thing pastors would think about when looking for a mission opportunity? Secondly, while I had been thinking of researching missional worship, i. e., how might a “missional church ” worship that would be different from one that is not, I began to wonder: what would an ecumenical “missional worship service ” look like? What sort of 2 liturgy would we use? How “liturgical ” might we get? And what about Hol...|$|E
