50|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>cladding</b> is a {{thin layer}} of real or {{simulated}} stone applied to a building or other structure made of a material other than <b>stone.</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>cladding</b> is sometimes applied to concrete and steel buildings as part of their original architectural design.|$|R

Like much of Belgravia, Wilton Crescent is characterised by grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly on {{the southern part of the}} crescent. The houses to the north of the crescent are <b>stone</b> <b>clad,</b> and five stories high, and were refaced between 1908 and 1912. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies.|$|R
50|$|Fixer masons {{specialize}} in the fixing of stones onto buildings, using lifting tackle, and traditional lime mortars and grouts. Sometimes modern cements, mastics and epoxy resins are used, usually on specialist {{applications such as}} <b>stone</b> <b>cladding.</b> Metal fixings, from simple dowels and cramps to specialised single application fixings, are also used. The precise tolerances necessary make this a highly skilled job.|$|R
