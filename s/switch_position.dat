The following day, the Nennigberg-Wies area was wrested from the German army, but heavy counterattacks followed and Butzdorf, Berg, and most of Nennig changed hands several times before being finally secured. On 20 January, an unsuccessful battalion attack against Orscholz, eastern terminus of the <b>switch</b> <b>position,</b> cost the division most of two companies. In early February, the division, with troop in tow, took the woods of Campholz and later Sinz.|$|E
25|$|A switch selects the Trigger Source. It {{can be an}} {{external}} input, one of the vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the AC line (mains) frequency. Another switch enables or disables Auto trigger mode, or selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return <b>switch</b> <b>position</b> or a pushbutton arms single sweeps.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical vehicle {{switching}} minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it {{also increases}} the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new <b>switch</b> <b>position,</b> and then wait for the in-vehicle switch's locking mechanism to be verified. If the vehicle switching is faulty, that vehicle {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the next switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed vehicle would be affected.|$|E

500|$|After {{abandoning the}} Thermopylae area, the British rearguard withdrew to an improvised <b>switch</b> <b>position</b> south of Thebes, where they erected a last {{obstacle}} {{in front of}} Athens. [...] The motorcycle battalion of the 2nd Panzer Division, which had crossed to the island of Euboea to seize the port of Chalcis and had subsequently returned to the mainland, was given the mission of outflanking the British rearguard. [...] The motorcycle troops encountered only slight resistance and {{on the morning of}} 27 April 1941, the first Germans entered Athens, followed by armoured cars, tanks and infantry. They captured intact large quantities of petroleum, oil and lubricants [...] ("POL"), several thousand tons of ammunition, ten trucks loaded with sugar and ten truckloads of other rations in addition to various other equipment, weapons and medical supplies. [...] The people of Athens had been expecting the Germans for several days and confined themselves to their homes with their windows shut.

2500|$|Often the {{observed}} signal is offset by a steady component, {{and only the}} changes are of interest. A switch (AC position) connects a capacitor in series with the input that passes only the changes (provided {{that they are not}} too slow -- [...] "slow" [...] would mean visible). However, when the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the input is connected directly (DC <b>switch</b> <b>position).</b> Most oscilloscopes offer the DC input option. For convenience, to see where zero volts input currently shows on the screen, many oscilloscopes have a third <b>switch</b> <b>position</b> (GND) that disconnects the input and grounds it. Often, in this case, the user centers the trace with the Vertical Position control.|$|E

2500|$|Analog meter {{movements}} are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters. Many analog multimeters feature a range <b>switch</b> <b>position</b> marked [...] "off" [...] {{to protect the}} meter movement during transportation which places placing a low resistance across the meter movement, resulting in dynamic braking. Meter movements as separate components may be protected {{in the same manner}} by connecting a shorting or jumper wire between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a shunt across the winding such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the low resistance of the shunt.|$|E
