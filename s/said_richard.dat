500|$|The West Wing episodes {{were written}} close to {{production}} {{and at the}} time of the September 11 attacks Sorkin was writing on episode six of the season ("Gone Quiet"), which originally was to air on Halloween (October 31). The events caused consternation in the writing staff, and the episode had to be entirely rewritten. [...] "I was kind of paralyzed," [...] said Sorkin, [...] "I didn't know what to write". Because of the attacks, air dates were postponed and the already finished [...] "On the Day Before" [...] became the Halloween episode instead. Nevertheless, the episode took on greater relevance to actual, international events than the writers had intended. On August 9, after the actors had just done a cold reading of the episode, they were informed about the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing, a Jerusalem suicide bombing in which an American was killed. The close similarity to an event in the script came as a shock to the actors. [...] "It was mind-blowing," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Richard</b> Schiff (Toby).|$|E

500|$|Goldenheart {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, {{some of whom}} hailed Richard as one of {{the best}} new acts in pop and R At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on nine reviews. Alex Macpherson of The Guardian gave it five stars and called it [...] "dazzling and imperious" [...] because of how Richard's [...] "array of sonic weapons matches her epic, elemental vision. Jason Gubbels from Spin praised her eclectic music and versatile singing, which he credited for [...] "springing finely placed surprises on listeners lulled into reverie, navigating tricky spots just effortlessly enough to mask her mastery". Writing for NPR, Ann Powers found it altogether contemplative, joyful, and mythological. Jonathan Bogart of The Atlantic wrote that, with her Tolkien-inspired lyrics, Richard [...] "remains true to the oldest and most important standards of R, which, more than any other musical genre, charts the uncountable intricacies of the human heart." [...] Grantland critic Steven Hyden felt that the album blurs R conventions like Frank Ocean's Channel Orange (2012) and Janelle Monáe's The ArchAndroid (2010), while Laurie Tuffrey from The Quietus <b>said</b> <b>Richard</b> distinguishes herself from her R contemporaries with her exceptional creativity.|$|E

2500|$|Obliquely confronting more {{conservative}} American Jewish community's Commentary Magazine, which caused {{some members of}} the Editorial Board, including Elie Wiesel, to resign, the magazine introduced itself with prominent ads placed in leading intellectual papers and journals declaring a new voice for the Jewish Left. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel's legacy of [...] "prophetic" [...] Jewish activism has been honored and analyzed from the first issue onward. Some writers who have contributed recently to the magazine include Michael Bader, Noam Chomsky, Shaul Magid (a contributing editor), Benny Morris, Or N.

2500|$|Those {{who argue}} for Ivins' innocence {{claim that the}} anthrax used in the attacks was too {{sophisticated}} to be produced by a lone researcher without relevant training. [...] "In my opinion, there are maybe four or five people {{in the whole country}} who might be able to make this stuff, and I'm one of them," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Richard</b> O. Spertzel, former deputy commander of USAMRIID. [...] "And even with a good lab and staff to help run it, it might take me a year {{to come up with a}} product as good." [...] The spores in the Daschle letter were 1.5 to 3 micrometres across, many times smaller than the finest known grade of anthrax produced by either the US or Soviet bioweapons programs. An electron microscope, which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be needed to verify that the target spore size had been consistently achieved. The presence of the anti-clumping additive silicon in the anthrax samples also suggests a high degree of sophistication as specialists working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were unable to duplicate this property despite 56 attempts.|$|E
