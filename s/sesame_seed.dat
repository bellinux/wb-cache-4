5|$|Dragon's Egg is a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} find a simple {{assessment}} method for <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> we investigated the relation among the taste components and taste and shape scores of 20 types of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> Free sugars and free amino acids were determined by HPLC and total sugars using a spectrophotometer. Sensory evaluations were carried out to examine the quality of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> roasted under the same conditions. The shape scores of these <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> were calculated to measure their weight and size. A positive correlation was observed between all sugar contents and the contents of total free sugars or free amino acids. In white <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> a particularly high correlation was observed between the contents of total free amino acids and fructose or glucose. Further, a sensory evaluation showed that the taste of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> differed according to their color; hence, we analyzed this data for each color. A positive correlation was observed between the overall evaluation scores and umami amino acids contents of black <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> {{as well as between}} the sweetness scores and all sugar contents of white <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> Positive correlations were found between the 100 -grain weight, circumferential length, and long- or short-grain diameter of the seeds. Further, it was found that all sugar contents and long-grain diameter correlated very closely in white <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Diabetes {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} which is usually seen in modern societies. Due to the increased risk of the disease and its related complications, in addition to the harmless properties of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> this research was aimed to study the effect of consuming <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> on some biochemical factors in type 2 diabetic patients. Materials & Methods: This clinical trial has been carried out on 60 type 2 diabetic patients who were randomly divided into two groups of 30 <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (case) and 30 non <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (control). The case group was given 60 grams <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> per day for 2 months and the control group did not receive any <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> The patient information was collected by questionnaire. The fasting blood serum of patients at the beginning and the end of the testing were collected and the biochemical factors of this study were measured in laboratory. For the data analysis, two independent samples t-test and paired t-test were used. Results: In this study, the mean ± SD (Standard Deviation) of the patients’ ages in the two groups, <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (case) and non <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (control), was 72 / 5 ± 40 / 52 and 11 / 6 ± 00 / 56 years, respectively. The results showed that fasting blood glucose, HbA 1 C, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (Low-density Lipoprotein), ALT (Alanine Transaminase) and ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) were statistically decreased after the consumption of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: According to the results, and by considering the <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> harmless effects, it can be suggested that probably this plant is useful as a complementary therapy for treatment and prevention of diabetes disorders...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} culinary {{method of}} this dish {{begins with the}} preparation of flour, peanut oil, egg, sugar, malt sugar, <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> and baking soda. With {{the exception of the}} <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> everything else is mixed together, and the resulting dough is cut into pieces. The <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> are boiled in water and each small piece of dough is rolled in the <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> The end result is then fried on a skillet. The chef must lift the frying pan off the stove and put it back on depending on the situation. The resulting opening crack is where the literal name in Chinese comes from, as it resembles a happy smiling mouth.|$|R
