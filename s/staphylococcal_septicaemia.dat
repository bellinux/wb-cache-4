5|$|The {{remainder}} of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in Finchley. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> The two then spent a short time {{under the care of}} an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.|$|E
40|$|We report {{two cases}} of {{osteomyelitis}} secondary to <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia,</b> presenting with large sterile effusions in adjacent joints. In {{both cases the}} clinical features were suggestive of septic arthritis. Multiple joints were involved in each patient. Initial radiographs showed no abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} severe {{hypoglycaemia}} complicating <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia</b> is reported. No recog-nized cause of hypoglycaemia was detected during lIffe or at autopsy. This case {{adds to the}} existing evidence that through several possible mechanisms septicae-mia can give life-threatening hypoglycaemia.

40|$|Acute {{renal failure}} {{developed}} in a diabetic with <b>staphylococcal</b> arthritis and <b>septicaemia</b> {{in the absence of}} endocarditis. Renal biopsy showed proliferative glomerulonephritis and there was evidence of alternative pathway of complement activation. Renal function recovered following haemodialysis for 2 months. The association of glomerulonephritis with staphylococcal infection is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Ninety one {{neonates}} received 108 {{courses of}} intravenous ceftazidime (25 mg/kg, 12 hourly) over a study period of 15 months. Fourteen had clinically and bacteriologically proved infections. Only {{one of these}} had resistant organisms. Four (two with group B beta haemolytic streptococcal infections, one with Escherichia coli meningitis, and one with <b>Staphylococcal</b> aureus <b>septicaemia)</b> failed to respond despite adequate treatment. Bacteriological eradication or clinical improvement, or both, were obtained in the remaining nine. Routine biochemical and haematological values were monitored {{and there were no}} side effects. High serum ceftazidime concentrations, well exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration for most common neonatal pathogens were obtained and maintained throughout treatment. Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid was excellent in eight of the nine cases studied. Ceftazidime has a theoretical role as a broad spectrum antibiotic suitable for neonatal use with no evident side effects. In this study, however, it was only appropriate for Gram negative infections, and was ineffective against Gram positive organisms. Ceftazidime cannot therefore be recommended as monotherapy before the results of bacteriological culture are known...|$|R
40|$|Infective {{endocarditis}} can {{be complicated}} {{by the development of}} intra-cardiac shunts. A case of endocarditis secondary to <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia</b> is reported where various conduction defects preceded the development of a fistula from the aortic root to the right atrium. Before emergency surgery there was marked worsening of heart failure with the appearance of a new loud murmur throughout diastole...|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type I), developed severe, life-threatening hyperkalaemia, the first following treatment with spironolactone, the second during treatment for <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia</b> when glucose-induced hyperkalaemia occurred. Investigations demonstrated co-existing hyporeininaemic hypoaldosteronism. Prompt {{recognition of this}} combined hormone-deficiency syndrome led to appropriate treatment and recovery. The biochemical features and clinical importance of hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia</b> due to permanent (14) and temporary (10) endocardial pacemakers were reviewed. With permanent pacemakers local inflammation was usually {{present and the}} onset of septicaemia rapid. If patients were treated with high dose intravenous flucloxacillin combined with removal, recovery was usual. In {{patients with}} retained endocardial tips (6) we eradicated infection with medical treatment alone in four cases. We would advocate antistaphylococcal prophylaxis for patients undergoing revision {{in the presence of}} local inflammation and high dose intravenous flucloxacillin plus a second anti-staphylococcal antibiotic (e. g. gentamicin) in patients with septicaemia and a pacemaker in situ...|$|E
40|$|Levin et al., 1971). Although {{the most}} {{frequently}} encountered organism is Staph. aureus (Foster, 1965), skeletal muscle in temperate climates seems to be resistant to bacterial colonization even in the pre-sence of an overwhelming staphyloccal septicaemia. Faber et al. (1960), found no skeletal muscle ab-scesses on post-mortem examination of 201 cases of fatal <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> Miyake (1904) showed that intravenous injection of sublethal doses of Staph. aureus into rabbits would only produce muscle abscesses if the muscle was first traumatized. Ashken and Cotton (1963), presented supporting evidence for their hypothesis that muscle 'haema-tomas', produced by repetitive minor trauma {{in the presence of}} sub-clinical scurvy, may become infecte...|$|E
40|$|The {{case reports}} of 186 {{intravenous}} drug abusers admitted over a three year period were studied. Nineteen had proven <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> Echocardiography showed tricuspid vegetations in seven and aortic vegetations in two. Eighteen out of 19 had systolic murmurs, {{but only the}} two patients with aortic vegetations had diastolic murmurs. The chest x ray showed opacities in 10 patients (all those with tricuspid vegetations plus three with normal echocardiograms). Four patients died during follow up, including both those with aortic vegetations; both mitral and tricuspid vegetations were found at necropsy in the other two. All remaining patients were alive at one year. The presence of tricuspid vegetations in intravenous drug abusers is associated with opacities on chest x ray, but carries a good short term prognosis. But these results suggest a poor outcome when left sided endocarditis is present in intravenous drug abusers...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{implement}} {{and monitor}} {{the effectiveness of}} a strategy to curb unnecessary use of vancomycin and teicoplanin for inpatients in a teaching hospital/tertiary referral centre where 33 % of S. aureus isolates (72 % from ICU patients) were methicillin resistant. METHODS: A sample of 182 vancomycin/teicoplanin inpatient prescriptions surveyed, revealed that only 31 (17 %) conformed with Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. Following education (ward-rounds, bulletins) on appropriate CDC based guidelines for prescribing glycopeptides directed at relevant clinicians, 'Immediate Concurrent Feedback' (ICF) was gradually deployed throughout the hospital. This entailed review of respective inpatient records on the next working day. If the indication was deemed not to conform with our guidelines, the prescriber was issued a memo (copied to the supervising doctor). Each memo detailed the 'errant' incident, listed appropriate indications and explicitly advised desisting from such prescribing and suggested alternative therapy if necessary. Corresponding glycopeptide usage data for our hospital and others in Hong Kong were retrieved and analysed as were samples of records of our inpatients with <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (pre and during ICF). RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, during 2 years of ICF, inpatient prescribing of vancomycin and teicoplanin deemed to conform increased to 71 % (773 / 1086); difference 54 % (P < 0. 0001, 95 % CIs 47 - 62 %). Corresponding average monthly usage (DDDs/ 1000 admissions) decreased from 76 (pre-ICF) to 45; mean difference 31 (P < 0. 0001, 95 % CIs 24, 38). Mortality from staphylococcal bacteraemia remained unchanged. No comparable changes in glycopeptide usage ensued in comparator hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: ICF can be used safely to curb irrational overuse of vancomycin and teicoplanin in a hospital with high methicillin resistant S. aureus infection rates. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
