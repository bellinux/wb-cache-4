500|$|The critics {{seem to be}} full {{of praise}} for your style and ability to draw word {{pictures}} but the decent ones always regret that you should use such great gifts in perpetuating the lives and habits of so degraded a strata of humanity.... It is a doubtful honor to produce one of the filthiest books of the year.... What is the matter? Have you ceased to be interested in nobility, honor and fineness in life?.... <b>Surely</b> <b>you</b> have other words in your vocabulary than [...] "damn" [...] and [...] "bitch"—Every page fills me with a sick loathing.|$|E

2500|$|While Xerxes was {{overseeing}} the battle from his throne, {{which was at}} the foot of Mount Aigaleo, he observed the incident and he and the others who were present thought that Artemisia had attacked and sunk a Greek ship. One of the men who was next to Xerxes said to him: [...] "Master, see Artemisia, how well she is fighting, and how she sank even now a ship of the enemy" [...] and Xerxes then responded: [...] "My men have become women; and my women, men.". None of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived to be able to accuse her otherwise. According to Polyaenus, when Xerxes saw her sink the ship, he said: [...] "O Zeus, <b>surely</b> <b>you</b> have formed women out of man's materials, and men out of woman's.".|$|E

2500|$|He did not pardon former Marshal Antonescu, who {{was sentenced}} to death [...] "for {{betrayal}} of the Romanian people for the benefit of Nazi Germany, for the economic and political subjugation of Romania to Germany, for cooperation with the Iron Guard, for murdering his political opponents, for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace". Nor did King Michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as Iuliu Maniu and the Bratianus, victims of communist political trials, as the Constitution prevented him from doing so without the counter-signature of communist Justice Minister Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu (who himself was later eliminated by Gheorghiu-Dej's opposing communist faction). The memoirs of King Michael's aunt Princess Ileana quoted Emil Bodnăraș — her alleged lover, Romania's communist minister of defence, and a Soviet spy—as saying: [...] "Well, if the King decides not to sign the death warrant, I promise that we will uphold his point of view." [...] Princess Ileana was sceptical: [...] "You know quite well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document. If he does, it will be laid at your door, and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame. <b>Surely</b> <b>you</b> do not wish this additional handicap at this moment!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Be reasonable, Allan," [...] he said. [...] "How can {{you marry}} Marie {{when there is}} no prédicant to marry <b>you?</b> <b>Surely,</b> if <b>you</b> love her so much, you would not pour mud upon her name, even in this wilderness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'How do you know?' I cried. Then, as {{she looked}} at me strangely, I added hastily, 'You haven't been {{receiving}} any more unearthly messages, have <b>you?</b> <b>Surely,</b> Miriam, <b>you</b> are not so foolish as to really believe in that!' ...|$|R
