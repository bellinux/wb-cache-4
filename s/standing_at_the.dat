5|$|Excelsior Apartments, 33 Dowling Street (cnr. of Dowling and Princes Sts) (Category II). <b>Standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{heart of}} Dunedin's 19th century Central Business District, the Excelsior Apartments are an 1888 {{structure}} originally {{built as a}} tavern and hotel. The building was designed by Robert Forrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{was acquired}} by the National Trust in the 1930s. It is floodlit on special occasions with new lights installed in 2015. In 1985, the Wellington Rotary Club donated the cannon currently <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the Monument.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, three doctors {{involved}} in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged {{the expansion of}} the inquest to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario.

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> opposite end of the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Congress in Guatemala City, Guatemala on January 26, 1991, the {{qualification}} rounds for {{the inaugural}} CONCACAF Gold Cup was decided upon. Since Costa Rica {{were given a}} bye into the competition due to its first place <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which {{also served as a}} qualification phase for the FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy in 1990, they weren't required to participate in the preliminary stages. However, the final qualification round of the Central American zone had two bids: the United States and Costa Rica. Costa Rica won the bid and was named by CONCACAF and UNCAF as the host nation of the inaugural UNCAF Nations Cup tournament on February 19, 1991.|$|E

5|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} England on September 22, the U.S. won 3–0. All three goals were scored within 12 minutes. The U.S. faced Brazil in the {{semifinal}} {{in what would}} become a controversial and game-changing match for the team. Coach Greg Ryan decided to bench starting goalkeeper, Hope Solo, and instead started Brianna Scurry, a veteran goalkeeper who had started in three World Cups and two Olympics, but who had started very few matches since the 2004 Olympics. The U.S. was defeated 4–0 by Brazil. The loss relegated them to a final match against Norway, which they won 4–1, to secure third place <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tournament. Lloyd started {{three of the five}} games in which she played at the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within the cemetery. A larger rectangular structure with an east-west alignment, identified from postholes left in the ground, stood on the east side. It has been interpreted as a chapel or shrine. A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a mortuary chapel was located close by in the central area of the cemetery. An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the cemetery was laid out. All of these buildings would have stood on the crest of a ridge, and would have been especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Umaga. Both men {{performed}} {{a variety of}} wrestling maneuvers, including a DDT from Triple H onto Umaga, and a Samoan drop from Umaga onto Triple H. Umaga attacked Triple H's ribs throughout the match, but Triple H gained an advantage when Umaga missed a hip attack. Umaga attempted to splash Triple H, who was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> turnbuckle, but Triple H moved and Umaga crashed into the ring post. Triple H then performed a Pedigree for the pinfall, thereby retaining his championship.|$|E

5|$|The Holborn rail crash {{occurred}} on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency train stop system because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed to stop in time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver failing to control his train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{water tower}} from 1895 was {{designed}} by Christian Hjerrild Clausen who had been inspired by Nuremberg's medieval Nassauer Haus. <b>Standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of a cliff, it commands excellent views {{of the city and}} the harbour from its platform which is open to the public. The imposing old Courthouse Building on the central square with its tall tower and stepped gables has recently been fully renovated. A bronze equestrian statue of Christian IX, the founder of Esbjerg, stands at the centre of the square.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, the Kop {{had been}} {{redesigned}} and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all <b>standing.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, the Kop {{was the biggest}} football stand in the country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; they scored 90 goals during the 1928–29 season, striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident. He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson. The club's fortunes did not improve under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at West Ham United, yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7–2 at Anfield.|$|E
5|$|In Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{joined the}} service of the tax {{supervisor}} of the local provinces, Abu'l-Abbas al-Bistam. He soon followed his new master to Egypt, and after al-Bistam's death in June 910 he continued serving the latter's son. Eventually, he gained the attention of the local governor, Takin al-Khazari, who sent him to govern the lands beyond the Jordan River, with his seat at Amman. In 918, he rescued a hajj caravan, among {{which was one of the}} ladies-in-waiting of al-Muqtadir's mother, from Bedouin raiders, thereby improving his <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid court. Two years later, Ibn Tughj gained an influential patron when he briefly served under the powerful Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, when he came to help defend Egypt from a Fatimid invasion. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj commanded the finest troops of the Egyptian army. The two men evidently established a rapport, and remained in contact thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered. The remains of the structure included the foundations and fragments of roof tiles, which most likely, covered the rooms and were found on the surface. The source of the roof tiles is the port of Marseilles, France, and most were stamped with the heart-shaped emblem of the Roux Frères roof-tile factory. The roof tiles indicate that the building was erected {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century CE. Several other roof tiles were stamped with a swan symbol, these were probably imported in a later phase of the building’s existence, at the beginning of the twentieth century, for the purpose of repair. According to Micah Linn of Mishmar HaEmek, the building was no longer <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time when the kibbuz was founded and therefore, it is estimated to have been in use for only several decades.|$|E
