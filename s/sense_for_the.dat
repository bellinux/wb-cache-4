5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} of radiation physics for plant ecophy-siological studies are outlined {{with an emphasis}} on choosing appropriate sensors for speci®c purposes such as for studies of photosynthesis, UV-B damage or canopy energy balance. Remote sensing, both from the ground and from aircraft or satellites, is increasingly being used as a tool <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study of plant canopies. Therefore, relevant terminology and applications are discussed, including the use of remote <b>sensing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> determination of canopy structural properties and the use of thermal remote <b>sensing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> measurement of canopy temperature, for example, in energy balance studies...|$|R

Uneconomical patriotism simply did not make quite an appeal. Thus, it came to pass that the Moro pirates faded from Mindoro's history.

25|$|Bimodules {{are also}} {{important}} for the von Neumann group algebra M of a discrete group Γ. Indeed, if V is any unitary representation of Γ, then, regarding Γ as the diagonal subgroup of Γ × Γ, the corresponding induced representation on l2 (Γ, V) is naturally a bimodule for two commuting copies of M. Important representation theoretic properties of Γ can be formulated entirely in terms of bimodules and therefore make <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> von Neumann algebra itself. For example, Connes and Jones gave a definition of an analogue of Kazhdan's Property T for von Neumann algebras in this way.|$|E
25|$|Stiglitz {{complains}} bitterly {{that the}} IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow {{in order to}} qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.|$|E

Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no <b>sense.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E
