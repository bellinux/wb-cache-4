He lived in the open, camping on the bridge, commanding all the after deck and the only approach to the pump. He lived! Some of the others lived too--concealed, anxious, coming out one by one from their hiding-places at the seductive sound of a shot. And he was not selfish. They shared, but only three of them all were alive when a whaler, returning from her cruising ground, nearly ran over the water-logged hull of the Borgmester Dahl, which, it seems, in the end had in some way sprung a leak in both her holds, but being loaded with deals could not sink.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{technique}} using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) {{was developed}} for selecting the optimal <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> for use in dual-wavelength sorting machines commonly found in food processing plants. A variation of a nearest-neighbor classification scheme selected the two optimal <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> given NIR spectra {{from both sides of}} an object. The optimal bands were determined for two cases: when both sides contain the defect of interest (AND logic), or when the defect appears on a single side (OR logic). A commercially available sorting machine was used to compare the sorting accuracy using the <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> determined with this technique to the accuracy using bands recommended by the manufacturer. The product stream tested was the removal of “small inshell ” (small nuts with the shell intact) and shell halves from the stream of nuts with no shells (“kernels”). Results for the selected <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> averaged 1. 20 % false negative (fn) for small inshell and 1. 80 % fn for half shells with 0. 15 % false positive (fp) vs. 1. 70 %, 2. 40 %, and 0. 70 %, respectively, using the <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> recommended by the manufacturer. Optimal <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> were also determined and reported for a variety of other defects and unwanted materials commonly sorted in the pistachio processing plant, including adhering hull, stained, sticks, mold, insect damage and/or webbing, and black spots. Given the success of this technique in pistachio sorting experiments, it is believed that it could be applied to any commodity sorted using commercially available, dual-wavelength, NIR sorting devices...|$|R

3000|$|The second {{method is}} based on the {{selection}} of <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> exhibiting a - 5 / 3 slope in a frequency domain delimited by 0.1 and 40  Hz (arbitrarily) from spectra calculated from time series chunks 50  s in length. The width of the <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> is a constant 0.699 decade, e.g., log 10 (5  Hz)–log 10 (1  Hz), and 39 overlapping bands are used. For each of these <b>bands,</b> the <b>spectral</b> slope s is estimated from the calculation of the variances in two spectral “sub-bands” of identical relative logarithmic width. An inertial subrange is inferred when s = - [...] 5 / 3 ± 0.25 for at least 3 consecutive <b>spectral</b> <b>bands.</b> The numerical thresholds were chosen in order to fit, as far as possible, the results that would have been obtained from visual inspection of the spectra. In some cases, the criteria may appear too loose or too restrictive, but it appears to be efficient for rejecting most <b>spectral</b> <b>bands</b> affected by instrumental noise and contaminations. A more thorough description of the method and results is in preparation.|$|R
