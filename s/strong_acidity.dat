SBA- 15 with periodic mesostructure and short mesochannels could be synthesized at pH 2. 5 - 3. 0 within weak acidity range, {{and the surface}} areas, pore diameters and pore volumes reached up to ca. 1000 m(2) /g, 8. 8 nm and 2. 0 cm(3) /g, respectively, which {{were significantly higher than}} those of the conventional SBA- 15 synthesized under <b>strong</b> <b>acidities.</b> Mesoporous silica with wormhole structure and abundant textural porosity was formed at pH approximately 3. 5. The increased hydrophobic volume of the copolymer micelles at elevated pH values was responsible for the enlargement of mesoporosity in the products. The materials synthesized under weak acidities showed lower hexagonal ordering in comparison to the general SBA- 15 synthesized under <b>strong</b> <b>acidities</b> because the decreased hydronium ion concentration induced relatively weaker assembly forces during the synthesis. Nonetheless, the short mesochannels and large pore diameter in the products might be beneficial to some applications in which fast diffusion of molecules is required.

25|$|Malic acid can {{be further}} reduced during the {{winemaking}} process through malolactic fermentation or MLF. In this process, bacteria convert the stronger malic acid into the softer lactic acid; formally, malic acid is polyprotic (contributes multiple protons, here two), while lactic acid is monoprotic (contributes one proton), and thus has only half the effect on acidity (pH); also, the first acidity constant (pKa) of malic acid (3.4 at room temperature) {{is lower than the}} (single) acidity constant of lactic acid (3.86 at room temperature), indicating <b>stronger</b> <b>acidity.</b> Thus after MLF, wine has a higher pH (less acidic), and a different mouthfeel.|$|R
2500|$|Although many {{different}} peroxyacids {{are used for}} the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, {{some of the more}} common oxidants include meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) and trifluoroperacetic acid (TFPAA). The general trend is that higher reactivity is correlated with lower pKa (i.e.: <b>stronger</b> <b>acidity)</b> of the corresponding carboxylic acid (or alcohol {{in the case of the}} peroxides). [...] Therefore, the reactivity trend shows TFPAA > 4-nitroperbenzoic acid > mCPBA and performic acid > peracetic acid > hydrogen peroxide > tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The peroxides are much less reactive than the peroxyacids. The use of hydrogen peroxide even requires a catalyst. In addition, using organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide tends to generate more side-reactivity due to their promiscuity.|$|R

5000|$|Grignolino (...) {{is a red}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety {{commonly}} grown in the Piedmont region.

The abundance of pips, or seeds, contribute to the strong, bitter tannins associated with the wine. Modern winemaker try to avoid the excess tannins with gentle and slow pressings. Grignolino has two Denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) that produce wine from it - Asti and Monferrato Casale.|$|E

While the grapes are relatively low in alcohol at around 11-12% ABV, they do have a significant amount of tannins due to the abundance of pips, or seeds.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{synthesis}} {{route for}} a MCM- 41 structure with Y zeolite seeds colloidal has been developed.

40|$|Direct {{conversion}} of raw biomass materials to fine chemicals {{is of great}} significance from both economic and ecological perspectives. In this paper, we report that a Keggin-type vanadium-substituted phosphomolybdic acid catalyst, namely H 4 PVMo 11 O 40, is capable of converting various biomass-derived substrates to formic acid and acetic acid with high selectivity in a water medium and oxygen atmosphere. Under optimized reaction conditions, H 4 PVMo 11 O 40 gave an exceptionally high yield of formic acid (67. 8 %) from cellulose, far exceeding the values achieved in previous catalytic systems.

50|$|The {{bedrock of}} the park {{consists}} of Precambrian to Ordovician period quartzite and slate, plus Devonian period granite. All of these rocks, especially quartzite, have a high silica content and provide scanty amounts of nutrients to the soils that develop on them. The slate, however, is fine-grained and produces a loamy soil which yields its nutrients more quickly than the stony sandy loams and loamy sands found over the coarse-grained rocks. Most of the slaty loams occur around Kejimkujik Lake. Deep outwash sands and gravels form a band west of the lake. Elsewhere the soil landscape {{is dominated by the}} cobbly, often shallow granite or quartzite material. Podzols underlie most well-drained areas. Gleysols and peat bogs dominate where drainage is poor. The park receives acid rain, and its soils have few available acid-buffering minerals, so <b>strong</b> <b>acidity</b> is the rule for soils and waters—even large bodies of water such as Kejimkujik Lake.|$|E
50|$|This is a savoury, juicy apple with <b>strong</b> <b>acidity</b> at first, {{which then}} mellows as the fruit matures during September, but the flesh softens soon thereafter.

The fruit cannot sustain modern supermarket handling, and so they are now only grown in gardens and for direct sale to consumers. Nonetheless, James Grieve is considered a good apple because it is exceptionally tasty, it produces fruit every year, it is disease-resistant, and it is a good pollenizer for other apples.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{uses for the}} boron-based {{carborane}} acid. The first {{is that it can}} add an octane kick to gasoline through a process called hydrocarbon cracking. Hydrocarbon cracking involves the reaction between acids and hydrocarbons from oil. This reaction increases the octane levels of gasoline by breaking the oil molecular into octane. The second usage of carborane acids is that it can help make vitamins digestible due to its <b>strong</b> <b>acidity.</b> The acid {{plays an important role in}} digestion by activating digestive enzymes that ingest the protein, sugar or fat. Because of its stability and unreactivity, it will flood a solution with protons, allowing molecules to be frozen at crucial intermediate points. Carborane acids also play a key role in the manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs and petroleum products by delivering very clean acidity without ferocity. A potential future application of carborane acid is the prospect of achieving [...] "the holy grail of superacid chemistry," [...] which is the protonation of the inert noble gas xenon. Professor Reed wants to focus his further explorations of carborane acid's potential in this direction because [...] "Xe has never been done before" [...] and being able to react with such an inert molecule will have important implications for future use and new discoveries in inorganic chemistry.|$|E
