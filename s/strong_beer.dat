5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} <b>strong</b> <b>beer,</b> and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.|$|E
25|$|On November 2, 1798, Vermont {{passed a}} law which began restricting sales of <b>strong</b> <b>beer,</b> ale, and cider. This law was {{eventually}} overturned on November 10, 1814. However, the temperance movement remained very strong in Vermont.|$|E
2500|$|Barley wine is a {{style of}} <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> from the English brewing tradition. [...] Another {{alcoholic}} drink known by the same name, enjoyed in the 18th century, [...] was prepared by boiling barley in water, then mixing the barley water with white wine and other ingredients, such as borage, lemon and sugar. In the 19th century, a different barley wine was made prepared from recipes of ancient Greek origin.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{trend is}} toward {{consumers}} increasingly choosing <b>stronger</b> <b>beer</b> than the 3.5% abv brands, generally {{referred to as}} folköl (people's beer) sold at grocery stores.

2500|$|His {{academic}} achievements were {{complemented by}} setting {{a new world}} record for beer drinking; he downed [...] – equivalent to a yard of ale – from a sconce pot in 11seconds {{as part of a}} college penalty. In his memoirs, Hawke suggested that this single feat may have contributed to his political success more than any other, by endearing him to an electorate with a <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> culture.|$|E
2500|$|In 1844, a law {{was passed}} which set brewing license fees and {{appointed}} county commissioners to approve each license. [...] In 1846, a provision {{was passed by the}} legislature to allow a [...] "local option" [...] to whether grant or deny these licenses. This meant the citizens of the towns could vote on whether to allow or disallow these establishments. In 1850, town selectmen became authorized to approve business license to sell small beer or cider, but not <b>strong</b> <b>beer.</b> In 1852, several more laws were passed which started Vermont's prohibition era. In 1853, the legislature passed the Vermont Prevention of Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors for the Purpose of Drinking law.|$|E
2500|$|Iceland's {{signature}} {{alcoholic beverage}} is brennivín (literally [...] "burnt [...] wine"), {{which is similar}} in flavouring to the akvavit variant of Scandinavian brännvin. It {{is a type of}} schnapps made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either caraway seeds or angelica. Its potency has earned it the nickname svarti dauði ("Black Death"). Modern distilleries on Iceland produce vodka (Reyka), gin (Ísafold), moss schnapps (Fjallagrasa), and a birch-flavoured schnapps and liqueur (Foss Distillery’s Birkir and Björk). Martin Miller blends Icelandic water with its England-distilled gin on the island. <b>Strong</b> <b>beer</b> was banned until 1989, so bjórlíki, a mixture of legal, low-alcohol pilsner beer and vodka, became popular. Several strong beers are now made by Icelandic breweries.|$|E

500|$|The {{strength}} of beers has climbed during the later {{years of the}} 20th century. Vetter 33, a 10.5% abv (33 degrees Plato, hence Vetter [...] "33") doppelbock, was listed in the 1994 Guinness Book of World Records as the <b>strongest</b> <b>beer</b> at that time, though Samichlaus, by the Swiss brewer Hürlimann, had also been listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest at 14% abv. Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. Samuel Adams reached 20% abv with Millennium, and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with Utopias. The <b>strongest</b> <b>beer</b> brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer.

2500|$|The use of hops {{spread to}} the Netherlands and then to England. In 15th century England, an unhopped beer would have been known as an ale, while the use of hops {{would make it a}} beer. Hopped beer was {{imported}} to England from the Netherlands as early as 1400 in Winchester, and hops were being planted on the island by 1428. The popularity of hops was at first mixed—the Brewers Company of London {{went so far as to}} state [...] "no hops, herbs, or other like thing be put into any ale or liquore wherof ale shall be made—but only liquor (water), malt, and yeast." [...] However, by the 16th century, ale had come to refer to any <b>strong</b> <b>beer,</b> and all ales and beers were hopped, giving rise to the verse noted by the antiquary John Aubrey: ...|$|E

25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is what happens after the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left to condition. Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or pasteurised or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. Finings are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state it is like a bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the <b>beer</b> itself: unopened, <b>stronger</b> <b>beers</b> can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. <b>Stronger</b> <b>beers</b> may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very <b>strong</b> <b>beers</b> in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|R
