2500|$|Mazda later {{abandoned}} the Wankel {{in most of}} their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only, producing the RX-7 until August 2002. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1991 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from {{the periphery of the}} rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, better airflow, and further power gains. Some early Wankel engines had also side exhaust ports, the concept being abandoned because of carbon buildup in ports and the sides of the rotor. The Renesis engine solved the problem by using a keystone scraper <b>side</b> <b>seal,</b> and approached the thermal distortion difficulties by adding some parts made of ceramics. The Renesis is capable of [...] with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 1.3L displacement. However, this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards. Mazda ended production of their Wankel engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the improved Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a Wankel-powered vehicle. [...] The company is continuing development of the next generation of Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R with a new rear wheel drive sports car model announced in October 2015 although with no launch date given.

25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and <b>side</b> <b>seals.</b> At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. <b>Side</b> <b>sealing</b> used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each <b>side</b> (six <b>side</b> <b>seals</b> in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, the roll compaction {{is part of}} the dry granulation process, densifying fine powders into ribbons that will be later milled to produce granules with good flowability for subsequent die compaction process. Roll compactors are constructed with a sealing system, limiting the loss of powder from the <b>sides.</b> However, the <b>sealing</b> system may result in unwanted non-uniformity of the ribbon's properties. In this work, a 3 D Finite Elements Method (FEM) modeling is used to analyze the roll compaction process and the effect of sealing system designs on the compacted ribbon's density distribution. A density dependent Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) constitutive model for microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH- 101) was calibrated and implemented in Abaqus/Explicit. Two different FEM models were investigated, one with a fixed <b>side</b> <b>sealing</b> called cheek plates and another where the <b>side</b> <b>sealing</b> is integrated with the bottom roll called rimmed-roll. Both numerical and experimental results clearly show the non-uniform roll pressure and density distribution for the cheek plates assembly, whereas the rimmed-roll shows an overall more uniformly distributed resultant pressure and density distribution. These results demonstrate the capability of FEM modeling to provide insight and help achieving {{a better understanding of the}} roll compaction process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Series 1 (2004-2008) RX-8 Renesis {{commonly}} {{suffer from}} engine failures between 80,000 and 120,000 miles due to premature apex seal wear from {{the lack of}} a center/middle oil injector which gets its oil from the oil metering pump. The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil pickup tube flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience <b>side</b> <b>seal</b> failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well. Most of the issues can be circumvented by using a higher viscosity oil and adding 2 cycle oil to the gas.Flooding can occur in the RX-8 as in previous generations of rotary engine cars.|$|E

40|$|The Legacy {{engine is}} a {{completely}} new design, transitional diesel engine, replacing the reciprocating engine with a rotary engine. The Legacy engine offers significant advances over conventional internal combustion engines in 1) power to weight ratio; 2) multiple fuel acceptance; 3) fuel economy; and 4) environmental compliance. These advances are achieved {{through a combination of}} innovative design geometry, rotary motion, aspiration simplicity, and manufacturing/part simplicity. The key technical challenge to the Legacy engineâs commercialization, and the focus of this project, was the development of a viable roton tip seal. The PST concept for the roton tip seal was developed into a manufacturable design. The design was evaluated using a custom designed and fabricated seal test fixture and further refined. This design was incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 A prototype and tested for achievable compression pressure. The Decision Point at the end of Phase 1 of the project (described below) was to further optimize the existing tip seal design. Enhancements to the tip seal design were incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below. Compression pressures adequate for compression ignition of diesel fuel were achieved, although not consistently in all combustion volumes. The variation in compression pressures was characterized versus design features. As the roton tip seal performance was improved, results pointed toward inadequate performance of the housing side seals. Enhancement of the housing <b>side</b> <b>seal</b> system was accomplished using a custom designed <b>side</b> <b>seal</b> test fixture. The design enhancements developed with the test fixture were also incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the turbocharger {{development of a}} restricted 430 cm 3 odd firing two cylinder engine. The downsized test engine used for development was specifically designed and configured for Formula SAE, SAE’s student Formula race-car competition. A well recognised problem in turbocharging Formula SAE engines arises from the rules, which dictate that the throttle and air intake restrictor must be on the suction side of the compressor. As a consequence of upstream throttling, oil from the compressor <b>side</b> <b>seal</b> assembly is drawn into the inlet manifold. The development process used to solve the oil consumption issue for a Garrett GT- 12 turbocharger is outlined, together with cooling and control issues. The development methodology used to achieve high pressure ratio turbocharging is discussed, along with exhaust manifold development and operating limitations. This includes experimental and modeling results for both pulse and constant pressure type turbocharging. The engine completed extensive static and transient testing with no turbocharger issues after initial development.

40|$|The geomechanical {{effects of}} past {{hydrocarbon}} production and subsequent CO 2 injection in depleted gas reservoirs were evaluated {{as a part}} of several recently accomplished feasibility studies of CO 2 storage in the Netherlands. The objectives of geomechanical studies were to assess the mechanical integrity of a reservoir-seal system, i. e. the containment, and the induced ground movement, aseismic and seismic. Geomechanical numerical models of the candidate sites make it possible to investigate and quantify production- and injection-induced stress changes in and around the reservoir. Numerical models reveal, as illustrated by a case study presented, that the <b>side</b> <b>seal</b> and the boundary faults at the edges of reservoir compartments represent weak spots where production-induced mechanical damage and fault re-activation will first occur. Possible permeability enhancement resulting from local seal damage and fault slip can provide the initial pathways for CO 2 penetration into the seals enhancing fluid-rock chemical interactions. The long-term effects of chemical reactions on the strength of a sample of representative anhydrite caprock indicate that the strength is reduced by one quarter after 50, 000 years of exposure to CO 2. © 2011 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association...|$|E

40|$|Rotary engines offer {{higher power}} density, fewer parts and lower {{vibrations}} than conventional reciprocating piston engines. However, rotary engines {{are more difficult}} to seal because of the rotor shape which leads to higher gas leakage and oil consumption resulting in lower efficiency and higher emissions. In order to address this problem, this thesis presents a set of multiscale models to assess rotary engine performances by estimating gas leakage, oil consumption, wear and friction. An oil seal multiscale model is developed to estimate internal oil consumption guided by oil transport visualization experiments carried using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. A finite element beam model is used to predict the clearance between the oil seals and the side housing for each crank angle in the cycle. From seal-housing clearance, oil transport through the oil seals is calculated using a control volume approach. The main mechanism leading to internal oil consumption is outward scraping of the oil seals due to a lack in conformability of the seals to the distorted side housing, especially next to the intake and exhaust ports. A set of multiscale models are developed for the performance of the apex and side seals. The models are formulated to couple gas flow to the dynamics and deformation of the seals while accurately describing the interfaces between the seals and their profile and groove. The models are used to predict apex and <b>side</b> <b>seal</b> behavior and understand the mechanisms leading to gas leakage. The main leakage mechanisms identified are leakage through (1) the corner seal clearance, (2) the spark plug holes, (3) the flanks of the seals at high speed, and (4) the side piece corner for the apex seals and at the ends of the side seals. The apex seal model shows good agreement with experiments, especially for the pressure in the apex seal groove. It is the first time such comprehensive models are developed for rotary engines and they will be valuable tools to help design more efficient and environment-friendly rotary engines. by Mathieu Picard.
