40|$|Solid propellants, <b>sand-asphalt</b> {{concrete}} and hard plastics showed rate sensitive mechanical behavior which, in addition, indicated that these materials {{have a permanent}} memory of the strain (or loading) path by which their present state was attained. A constitutive equation was formulated in general three dimensional tensorial form by means of irreversible thermodynamics. By using a very simple analytical form, it was shown that the mechanical behavior of solid propellants and <b>sand-asphalt</b> concrete can be readily described...|$|E
40|$|Frequent {{measurements}} of skid resistance {{were made on}} 20 pavements in common use in Kentucky. Tests were conducted from November 1969 through 1973. Principal analysis involved relating changes in skid resistance to {{day of the year}} and relating skid resistance to temperature at the time of test, to average antecedent temperatures, and to average rainfall. Seasonal variations exhibited an annual sinusoidal cycle. The changes in <b>sand-asphalt</b> and bituminous concrete surfaces under higher volumes of traffic were about 12 skid numbers. The changes in portland cement concrete and bituminous concrete under lower volumes of traffic were about 5 skid numbers. The lowest skid numbers (SN's) occurred in early to mid-August for portland cement concrete and <b>sand-asphalt</b> pavements and in late August to early September for bituminous concrete. Correlations between changes in SN and temperature were best for ambient air temperature averaged over 4 - and 8 -week periods prior to date of test. However, correlations between changes in SN and temperature were not as good as correlations between SN and day of the year. On the other hand, combining traffic volumes in the form of deviations from yearly average daily traffic with temperature yielded correlations with SN's which were as good as correlations between SN's and the day of the year. It was concluded that skid resistance measurements in Kentucky should be conducted between the first of July and the middle of November to be assured of detecting significant differences in SN. However, frequent testing of reference sections is recommended to define more specifically each year the beginning and ending date of the testing season. Burchett and Rizenberg...|$|E
40|$|The main {{components}} of the flexible pavements are asphalt and aggregates. But {{in most of the}} places in India there is shortage of the good quality aggregates (especially coarse aggregates), at the same time beach sand is available in plenty in many regions. Due to relative abundance of beach sand, the studies on the utilities of the beach sand in paving mixes are worth taking up. But beach <b>Sand-Asphalt</b> mix alone is not suitable for pavement construction, because of its low stability and high air voids. In the present study, Sand-Fly ash-Asphalt-Sulphur (S-F-A-S) mixes are being made in different proportions and tested for their properties. Fatigue strength, stability, water sensitivity, stiffness modulus and dynamic modulus tests are carried out at standard test conditions and the results are analyzed for drawing conclusions. This study investigates the potential use of abundant ingredients, which may replace the ones which are scarce in nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} Maxwell-type constitutive {{relation with}} two arbitrary material functions for viscoelastoplastic multi-modulus materials is studied analytically in uniaxial isothermic case {{to reveal the}} model abilities and applicability scope and to develop techniques of its identification, tuning and fitting. The constitutive equation is aimed at adequate modeling of the rheological phenomena set which is typical for reonomic materials exhibiting non-linear hereditary properties, strong strain rate sensitivity, secondary creep, yielding at constant stress, tension compression asymmetry and such temperature effects as increase of material compliance, strain rate sensitivity and rates of dissipation, relaxation, creep and plastic strain accumulation with temperature growth. The model is applicable for simulation of mechanical behaviour of various polymers, their solutions and melts, solid propellants, <b>sand-asphalt</b> concretes, composite materials, titanium and aluminum alloys, ceramics at high temperature and so on. To describe the influence of temperature on material mechanical behavior (under isothermic conditions), two scalar material parameters of the model (viscosity coefficient and “modulus of elasticity”) are considered as a functions of temperature level. The general restrictions on their properties which are necessary and sufficient for adequate qualitative description of the basic thermomechanical phenomena related to typical temperature influence on creep and relaxation curves, creep recovery curves, creep curves under step-wise loading and quasi-static stress-strain curves of viscoelastoplastic materials are obtained. The restrictions are derived using systematic analytical study of general qualitative features of the theoretic creep and relaxation curves, creep curves under step-wise loading, long-term strength curves and stress-strain curves at constant strain or stress rates generated by the constitutive equation (under minimal restrictions on material functions) and their comparison to typical test curves of stable viscoelastoplastic materials. It is proved that the viscosity coefficient and the “modulus of elasticity” of the model and their ratio (i. e. relaxation time of the associated linear Maxwell model) should be decreasing functions of temperature. This requirements are proved to provide an adequate qualitative simulation of a dozen basic phenomena expressing an increase of material compliance (a decrease of tangent modulus and yield stress, in particular), strengthening of strain rate sensitivity and acceleration of dissipation, relaxation, creep and plastic strain accumulation with temperature growth...|$|E
