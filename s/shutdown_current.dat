Using pyroelectric poly(vinylidene 1, 1 -difluoride) detectors that simultaneously measure transretinal voltage and retinal temperature change, four heat effects assignable to known biochemical cycles in rods have been found.

40|$|Many {{cities across}} the country have {{experienced}} extreme water problems. The City of Portland has issued several water boiling advisories due to E. coli contamination. Additionally, there has been incidents of serious contaminants like lead leaching in water systems (Flint, Michigan). The Portland Water Bureau does not use a water treatment plant due to the quality of our water sources; a chlorination plant is used to chlorinate the water from the Bull Run Watershed (our main water source). Not having a water treatment plant makes Oregon more prone to a prolonged absence of potable water should the supply be contaminated. Up until three months ago, Portland had open reservoirs that exposed clean and treated water to the open-air environment, which allowed for recontamination. Despite those now being closed and not in use, Portland’s water system still has various gaps where water can be contaminated. Portland’s water usage peaks during the summer and tapers off just before kids go back to school. As a result of that decline in usage, a lot of water sits in pipes just waiting to be pumped to homes. The weather is still quite warm all the way through mid-September and possibly well into October. As a result the unused water sitting in pipes heats up with the weather and serves as a breeding ground for a plethora of bacteria and contaminants that pose putative short and long term health risks to the citizens of Portland. The city is equipped to detect E. coli and other contaminants—although not as quickly as we (the Water Bureau and the citizens) would hope.

An excavation effort revealed that a circumferential crack, approximately 0. 0025 cm in width, extended around {{the bottom half of}} the delay line. In addition, other evidence of what appeared to be microcracking and pitting that originated at random nucleated sites around the pipe were also found. Results of destructive analysis and nondestructive testing allowed Los Alamos staff to conclude that the direct cause for the main crack and other pitting resulted from stress-assisted, microbial-induced corrosion of the stainless steel primary piping. The results also indicated that microbial action from bacteria that are normally present in earth can be extremely harmful to stainless- steel piping under certain conditions.

Several stages of analogue then digital processing, largely performed in FPGAs, refine these signals via configurable and flexible algorithms into identified physics objects, for example electron, tau or jet candidates. The complete processing chain is performed in a pipelined system at the LHC bunch-crossing frequency, and with a fixed latency of about 1 us.

During the test, some electrical contact breakdowns at the anode current collector caused sudden <b>current</b> <b>shutdowns</b> and start-up events. In spite of this, the cell performance remains unchanged. After a period of 325 h, the cell temperature and the current density was raised to 873 °C and 500 mA cm - 2, and the cell power output at 0. 5 V was ∼ 600 mW cm - 2. Several partial reoxidation events due to disturbance in fuel supply occurred, but no apparent degradation was observed. On the contrary, a small increase in the cell output power of about 4 %/ 1, 000 h after 654 h under current load was obtained. The excellent cell aging behavior is discussed in connection to cell configuration.

40|$|After the <b>current</b> <b>shutdown,</b> the LHC {{is about}} to resume {{operation}} for a new data-taking period, when it will operate with increased luminosity, event rate and center of mass energy. The new conditions will impose more demanding constraints on the ATLAS online trigger reconstruction and selection system. To cope with such increased constraints, the ATLAS High-Level Trigger, placed after a first hardware-based Level~ 1 trigger, has been redesigned by merging two previously separated software-based processing levels. In the new joint processing level, the algorithms run in the same computing nodes, thus sharing resources, minimizing the data transfer from the detector buffers and increasing the algorithm flexibility. The jet trigger software selects events containing high transverse momentum hadronic jets. It needs optimal jet energy resolution to help rejecting an overwhelming background while retaining good efficiency for interesting jets. In particular, this requires the CPU-intensive reconstruction of tridimensional energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeter {{to be used as}} the basic input to the jet finding algorithms. To allow this costly reconstruction step, a partial detector readout scheme was developed, that effectively suppresses the low activity regions of the calorimeter and significantly reduces the needed resources. In this paper we describe the overall jet trigger software and its physics performance. We then focus on detailed studies of the algorithm timing and the performance impact of the full and partial calorimeter readout schemes. We conclude with an outlook of the jet trigger plans for the next LHC data-taking period.

40|$|Grain-size {{records of}} the terrigenous and {{calcareous}} silt fraction, preservation of planktic foraminifera, and benthic foraminiferal stable-isotope data (delta 13 C, delta 18 O values of C. wuellerstorfi) at ODP Site 927 on the Ceará Rise (5 ° 27. 7 'N, 44 ° 28. 8 'W), are used to reconstruct variations {{in the history of}} bottom current strength, ventilation, and carbonate corrosiveness of deep waters during the time interval from 0. 8 to 0. 3 Ma. Glacial periods are characterized by generally smaller mean sizes of the terrigenous sortable silt fraction (mean(SS)), lower delta 13 C values, and poorer preservation of planktic foraminifera compared to interglacials. This indicates lower bottom current speeds, larger nutrient contents and more corrosive deep water. By contrast, larger mean(SS) sizes, higher delta 13 C values, and well preserved planktic foraminifera indicate strong circulation and a well ventilated deep-water mass during interglacials. The observed changes are most likely related to the weakening and strengthening of circulation of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW). Cross-spectral analysis between the mean(SS) and benthic delta 18 O records reveals that minima in mean(SS) occur about 7. 6 k. y. after the maximum in ice volume. This indicates a considerable lag time between ice-shield induced changes in LNADW production and subsequent changes in the velocity of LNADW flow in the western equatorial Atlantic. Striking changes in bottom current speed occur regularly during glacial to interglacial transitions. Extremely fine mean(SS) minima point to an almost complete <b>shutdown</b> of bottom <b>current</b> vigor in response to a cessation of LNADW production caused by an enhanced melt water release during the initial phases of deglaciation. However, each of the fine minima extremes is followed by a rapid shift to very high mean(SS) values that indicate strong bottom currents, and hence, vigorous LNADW flow during the early interglacials. After the onset of glacial Stage 12, generally poorer carbonate preservation and higher variability is registered. This coincides with a global decrease in carbonate preservation during the mid-Brunhes (mid-Brunhes dissolution event). Detailed grain-size analysis of the calcareous fine fraction (< 63 µm) revealed a considerable reduction of particles in the fraction from 7 to 63 µm during periods of enhanced dissolution. This indicates a preferential dissolution of larger planktic foraminiferal fragments which leads to an enrichment of coccoliths in the calcareous fine fraction...|$|R
