50|$|An engineer's vice, {{also known}} as a {{metalworking}} vice or machinist's vice, is used to clamp metal instead of wood. It is used to hold metal when filing or cutting. It is sometimes made of cast steel or malleable cast iron, but most are made of cast iron. However, most heavy duty vices are 55,000 psi cast steel or 65,000 psi ductile iron. Some vices have a cast iron body but a steel channel bar. Cast iron is popular because it is typically 30 ksi grey iron which is rigid, strong and inexpensive. The jaws are often separate and replaceable, usually engraved with serrated or diamond teeth. <b>Soft</b> <b>jaw</b> covers made of aluminum, copper, wood (for woodworking) or plastic may be used to protect delicate work. The jaw opening of an engineer's vice is almost always {{the same size as the}} jaw width, if not bigger.|$|E

50|$|Many chucks have {{removable}} jaws (often the {{top part}} is removable leaving the base or 'master jaw' assembled with the scroll), {{which allows the}} user to replace them with new jaws, specialized <b>jaws,</b> or <b>soft</b> <b>jaws.</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>jaws</b> are made of soft materials such as soft (unhardened) metal, plastic, or wood. They can be machined as needed for particular setups. The typical interface between the master jaw and the removable jaw is a matching pair of serrated surfaces, which, once clamped by the mounting screws, cannot allow relative slipping between the two parts.|$|R
50|$|Two-jaw chucks are {{available}} {{and can be used}} with <b>soft</b> <b>jaws</b> (typically an aluminium alloy) that can be machined to conform to a particular workpiece. It is a short conceptual leap from these to faceplates holding custom fixtures, wherein the part is located against fixed stops and held there with toggle clamps or toe clamps.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} of speech {{is a highly}} complex motor task that involves approximately 100 orofacial, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and respiratory muscles. Precise and expeditious timing of these muscles {{is essential for the}} {{production of}} temporally complex speech sounds, which are characterized by transitions as short as 10 ms between frequency bands and an average speaking rate of approximately 15 sounds per second. Speech production requires airflow from the lungs (respiration) to be phonated through the vocal folds of the larynx (phonation) and resonated in the vocal cavities shaped by the <b>jaw,</b> <b>soft</b> palate, lips, tongue and other articulators (articulation).|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancers have {{potential}} for lymphatic and hematogenous metastases.

However, the incidence of recurrence, both local and distant, remains significant.

Metastases to the oral region are uncommon and may occur in the oral <b>soft</b> tissues or <b>jaw</b> bones. The prognosis in such patients is usually very poor.

40|$|As {{a result}} of complex clinical, {{immunologic}} and biochemical investigations of 48 patients peculiarities of development of inflammatory com¬plications, local osteoporosis and destruction of bone tissue after performed dental intraosseous implantantion were first revealed. It was shown that multiple surgical traumas of <b>soft</b> tissues of <b>jaws</b> and bone tissue of alveolar processes with putting 4 or more implants simultaneously may lead to reducing biocidity of mucosa of jaw tissues; this promotes lesion of oral cavity hygiene and development of inflammatory process in zone of periimplant. It is set that massive accumulation of soft coat and dental calculus {{in the area of}} implant, superconstruction and marked deficit of sIgA production of oral mucosa promote development of periimplant mucositis in remote post-operative period. A sharp production of secretory ІL - 1 β is a risk factor in formation of general-destructive process in a periimplant zone, development of dental periimplant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Tumors can {{metastasize}} to {{the oral}} cavity and affect the <b>jaws,</b> <b>soft</b> tissue and salivary glands. Oral cavity metastases are considered rare and represent approximately 1 % of all oral malignancies. Because of their rarity and atypical clinical and radiographic appearance, metastatic lesions {{are considered a}} diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this report is to present a rare case of a metastatic breast carcinoma mimicking a periodontal abscess in the mandible. Case presentation A 55 -year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our clinic for evaluation of bisphosphonate-induced jaw osteonecrosis. She had undergone modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection for invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. Her clinical examination showed diffuse swelling and a periodontal pocket of 6 mm exhibiting suppuration in the posterior right mandible. Moreover, paresthesia of the lower right lip and chin was noted. There were no significant radiographic findings other than alveolar bone loss due to her periodontal disease. Although the lesion resembled a periodontal abscess, metastatic carcinoma of the breast was suspected {{on the basis of}} the patient's medical history. The area was biopsied, and histological analysis confirmed the final diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma. Conclusion The general dentist or dental specialist should maintain a high level of suspicion while evaluating patients with a history of cancer. Paresthesias of the lower lip and the chin should be considered ominous signs of metastatic disease. This case highlights the importance of the value of a detailed medical history and thorough clinical examination for the early detection of metastatic tumors in the oral cavity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sound lies at {{the very}} center of speech communication. A sound wave is both the end product of the speech {{production}} mechanism and the primary source of raw material used by the listener to recover the speaker's message. Because of the central role played by sound in speech communication, it is important to have a good understanding of how sound is produced, modified, and measured. The purpose of this chapter will be to review some basic principles underlying the physics of sound, with a particular focus on two ideas that play an especially important role in both speech and hearing: the concept of the spectrum and acoustic filtering. The speech production mechanism is a kind of assembly line that operates by generating some relatively simple sounds consisting of various combinations of buzzes, hisses, and pops, and then filtering those sounds by making a number of fine adjustments to the tongue, lips, <b>jaw,</b> <b>soft</b> palate, and other articulators. We will also see that a crucial step at the receiving end occurs when the ear breaks this complex sound into its individual frequency components in much the same way that a prism breaks white light into components of different optical frequencies. Before getting into these ideas it is first necessary to cover the basic principles of vibration and sound propagation. Sound and Vibration A sound wave is an air pressure disturbance that results from vibration. The vibration can come from a tuning fork, a guitar string, the column of air in an organ pipe, the head (or rim) of a snare drum, steam escaping from...|$|R
