40|$|Ringing {{recoveries}} of European <b>Stonechats</b> Saxicola torquata increased {{more than}} tenfold to 1162 since the last in-depth analysis in 1965. This paper presents a new overview over all recoveries and detailed analyses of <b>Stonechats</b> ringed during the breeding season in Britain, Benelux countries, and Germany. <b>Stonechats</b> showed stronger migratory tendencies than previously thought. Birds of known origin {{from all parts of}} Europe were recorded in north African winter quarters. Local overwintering was only observed in Britain, France, Spain, and Italy. Benelux <b>Stonechats</b> were fully migratory, just as their German conspecifics. British <b>Stonechats</b> were partially migrant; according to conservative estimates almost half (42. 1 %) of the British <b>Stonechats</b> migrated. Instead of segregating into residents and migrants they travelled over a continuous range of distances. Some reached north African winter ranges but median routes were shorter than those of Benelux and German <b>Stonechats.</b> Surprisingly, natal dispersal and post-fledging movements were longer in British partial migrants than in continental obligate migrants. These movements tended to be biased in migration directions. Sexes and age classes showed identical migratory behaviour, an unusual observation among individually migrating birds. Furthermore, migration of <b>Stonechats</b> did not change consistently over the last decades, counter to predictions. In conclusion, European <b>Stonechats</b> are predominantly migratory but partial migration and summer movements seem to be surprisingly plastic...|$|R

40|$|The {{physiological}} response to variation in air temperature (T-a) can provide insights into how animals are adapted to different environments. I measured metabolic rate, total evaporative water loss (TEWL) and body temperature (T-b) {{as a function}} of T. in <b>stonechats</b> from equatorial Kenya, temperate central Europe and continental Kazakhstan, environments where <b>stonechats</b> have evolved different life histories. All birds were raised and kept under identical captive conditions to highlight genetically based differences and to exclude phenotypic plasticity as explanatory factor. The slope relating metabolic rate to Ta was steepest in Kazakh <b>stonechats</b> and lowest for birds from Kenya, indicating that, counterintuitively, the tropical <b>stonechats</b> were best insulated. Taking into account variation in Tb in response to Ta, the lower critical temperature for the three populations fell between 32. 0 and 34. 9 degrees C, values higher than previously assumed. Whole organism BMR did not differ among populations, but because body mass was significantly higher in the Kenyan <b>stonechats,</b> their mass-specific BMR was lower compared with conspecifics from higher latitude. Whole organism or mass-specific TEWL did not differ among populations. Possibly, Kenyan birds are better insulated to compensate for their limited capacity to elevate metabolic rate.

40|$|Background: Testosterone {{facilitates}} physiological, morphological, {{and behavioral}} changes required for breeding in male vertebrates. However, testosterone concentrations and {{the link between}} its seasonal changes and those in reproductive behaviors vary greatly among species. To better understand the impact of tropical and temperate environments and life history factors on this variation, we have compared testosterone, territorial behavior and song performance across sequential stages of the breeding season in males of 16 closely related taxa of East African tropical and West European temperate <b>stonechats</b> (Saxicola spp), which all breed during a short breeding season, but differ in migratory behavior, seasonal territory-acquisition and pace of life. Results: We found that generally, the profiles of testosterone and territorial behavior were similar across latitudes. African <b>stonechats</b> with a slow pace of life had equally high peak testosterone concentrations and responded as aggressively to an intruder as European <b>stonechats</b> with a fast pace of life. However, song performance {{at the beginning of}} the breeding season was lower in African than in European <b>stonechats.</b> The differences in song performance were not associated with variation in testosterone levels between tropical and temperate <b>stonechats.</b> Conclusions: The results suggest a very similar role for testosterone as a mediator of high intensity territorial aggression during the fertile period of females in tropical and temperate <b>stonechats,</b> which all are highly seasonal, locally synchronous breeders. A potential explanation may be high risk of extra-pair copulations which has been associated with synchronous breeding. Interestingly, an association was not consistent for song performance. Our data suggest that song performance can be disassociated from peak testosterone levels depending on its role in breeding behavior. Despite similar testosterone levels, European males, which early in the breeding season acquire territories and mates, showed greater song performance than African <b>stonechats,</b> which maintain year-round territories and pair-bonds. Taken together, our study comparing related taxa of old world songbirds suggests that short breeding seasons may be a major selective force for high peak testosterone levels during breeding regardless of latitude and pace of life, but that particular behaviors, in our case song, can be uncoupled from peak testosterone levels...|$|R
40|$|Background: Latitudinal {{variation}} in avian life histories falls along a slow-fast pace of life continuum: tropical species produce small clutches, {{but have a}} high survival probability, while in temperate species the opposite pattern is found. This study investigated whether differential investment into reproduction and survival of tropical and temperate species is paralleled by differences in the secretion of the vertebrate hormone corticosterone (CORT). Depending on circulating concentrations, CORT can both act as a metabolic (low to medium levels) and a stress hormone (high levels) and, thereby, influence reproductive decisions. Baseline and stress-induced CORT was measured across sequential stages of the breeding season in males and females of closely related taxa of <b>stonechats</b> (Saxicola spp) from a wide distribution area. We compared <b>stonechats</b> from 13 sites, representing Canary Islands, European temperate and East African tropical areas. <b>Stonechats</b> are highly seasonal breeders at all these sites, but vary between tropical and temperate regions with regard to reproductive investment and presumably also survival. Results: In accordance with life-history theory, during parental stages, post-capture (baseline) CORT was overall lower in tropical than in temperate <b>stonechats.</b> However, during mating stages, tropical males had elevated post-capture (baseline) CORT concentrations, which {{did not differ from}} those of temperate males. Female and male mates of a pair showed correlated levels of post-capture CORT when sampled after simulated territorial intrusions. In contrast to the hypothesis that species with low reproduction and high annual survival should be more risk-sensitive, tropical <b>stonechats</b> had lower stress-induced CORT concentrations than temperate <b>stonechats.</b> We also found relatively high post-capture (baseline) and stress-induced CORT concentrations, in slow-paced Canary Islands <b>stonechats.</b> Conclusions: Our data support and refine the view that baseline CORT facilitates energetically demanding activities in males and females and reflects investment into reproduction. Low parental workload was associated with lower post-capture (baseline) CORT as expected for a slow pace of life in tropical species. On a finer resolution, however, this tropical-temperate contrast did not generally hold. Post-capture (baseline) CORT was higher during mating stages in particular in tropical males, possibly to support the energetic needs of mate-guarding. Counter to predictions based on life history theory, our data do not confirm the hypothesis that long-lived tropical populations have higher stress-induced CORT concentrations than short-lived temperate populations. Instead, in the predator-rich tropical environments of African <b>stonechats,</b> a dampened stress response during parental stages may increase survival probabilities of young. Overall our data further support an association between life history and baseline CORT, but challenge the role of stress-induced CORT as a mediator of tropical-temperate {{variation in}} life history...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{findings}} in non-migratory birds have reopened {{questions about the}} interpretation and seasonal organization of Zugunruhe. I address the relationship between Zugunruhe and migration by comparing underlying circannual patterns in captive populations of migratory and non-migratory <b>stonechats.</b> Zugunruhe was highly variable and lacked clear periodicity, indicating its sensitivity to external cues. Patterns of Zugunruhe were similar in African residents, European short-distance migrants, and Siberian long-distance migrants, revealing no major difference in circannual organization. Moult was regulated independently of Zugunruhe and timed more rigidly, particularly in <b>stonechats</b> from equatorial Africa. The persistent and variable circannual patterns of Zugunruhe suggest that non-migratory and migratory <b>stonechats</b> have similar underlying programs but have modified the expression of actual migration.

6000|$|The willow wren {{is one of}} the commonest and {{undoubtedly}} the most generally diffused of the British songsters. A summer visitor, one of the earliest to arrive, usually appearing on the South Coast in the last week in March; a little later he may be met with in very nearly every wood, thicket, hedge, common, marsh, orchard, and large garden throughout the kingdom--it is hard to say, writes Seebohm, where he is not found. Wherever there are green perching-places, and small caterpillars, flies and aphides to feed upon, there you will see and hear the willow wren. He is a sweet and constant singer from the date of his arrival until about the middle of June, when he becomes silent for a season, resuming his song in July, and continuing it throughout August and even into September. This late summer singing is, however, fitful and weak and less joyous in character than in the spring. But in spite of his abundance and universality, and the charm of his little melody, he is not familiarly known to the people generally, as they know the robin redbreast, pied wagtail, dunnock, redstart, wheatear, and <b>stonechat.</b> The name we call him by is a very old one; it was first used in English by Ray, in his translation of Willughby's Ornithology, about three centuries ago; but it still remains a book-name unknown to the rustic. Nor has this common little bird any widely known vernacular name. If by chance you find a country-man who knows the bird, and has a name for it, this will be one which is applied indiscriminately to two, three, or four species. The willow wren, in fact, is one of those little birds that are [...] "seen rather than distinguished," [...] on account of its small size, modest colouring, and its close resemblance to other species of warblers; also on account of the quiet, gentle character of its song, which is little noticed {{in the spring and summer}} concert of loud, familiar voices.|$|E

40|$|Testosterone mediates {{reproductive}} behaviours in male vertebrates. For example, {{breeding season}} territoriality depends on testosterone in {{many species of}} birds and in some, territorial interactions feed back on testosterone concentrations. However, {{the degree to which}} territorial behaviour and testosterone are associated differs even between species with seemingly similar life histories, especially between species that also defend territories outside the breeding season. Here, we investigate the link between territorial behaviour and testosterone in European <b>stonechats.</b> Previous studies found that territorial aggression in <b>stonechats</b> depends on testosterone in a breeding, but not in a non-breeding context. We investigated whether <b>stonechats</b> show a rise in testosterone during simulated territorial intrusions (STI) during the breeding season. Post-capture testosterone concentrations of males caught after an STI were not higher than those of males caught in a control situation regardless of breeding stage. However, most of the males {{would have been able to}} mount a testosterone response because the same individuals that did not increase testosterone during the STI showed a substantial increase in testosterone after injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH-induced and post-capture testosterone concentrations were positively correlated and both decreased with successive breeding stages. Further, territory owners with a short latency to attack the decoy expressed higher post-capture testosterone concentrations than males with a longer latency to attack the decoy. Thus, there is no evidence for behavioural feedback on testosterone concentrations during male-male interactions in <b>stonechats.</b> In combination with previous studies our data suggest that testosterone functions as an on/off switch of high intensity territorial aggression during the breeding season in <b>stonechats.</b> The among-species variation in the androgen control of territorial behaviour may be only partly a result of environmental differences. Instead, potential differences in how territoriality evolved in different species may have influenced whether and how a reproductive hormone such as testosterone was co-opted into the mechanistic control of territorial behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Studies of Zugunruhe – the ‘migratory restlessness’ {{behaviour}} of captive birds – {{have been}} integral {{to our understanding}} of animal migration, revealing an inherited propensity to migrate and an endogenous timing and navigation system. However, differences between Zugunruhe in captivity and migration in the wild call for more data, in particular on variation within and among taxa with diverse migration strategies. Here, we characterise Zugunruhe in a long-term dataset of activity profiles from <b>stonechats</b> (genus Saxicola) with diverse migratory phenotypes (976 migration periods from 414 birds), using a flexible and consistent quantitative approach based on changepoint analysis. For east African, Austrian, Irish, and Siberian <b>stonechats</b> and hybrids, we report key inter-population differences in the occurrence, timing, and intensity of Zugunruhe. In line with expectations, we found the highest Zugunruhe intensity in the longest-distance migrants, more variable patterns in short-distance migrants, and intermediate characteristics of hybrids relative to their parental groups. Inter-population differences imply high evolutionary lability of Zugunruhe timing within a robustly structured annual cycle. However, counter to theory, Irish partial migrants showed no segregation between migrant and resident individuals, and previously reported nocturnal restlessness was confirmed for resident African <b>stonechats.</b> Further features of nocturnal restlessness that did not align with migratory behaviour of <b>stonechats</b> were juvenile nocturnal restlessness even prior to postjuvenile moult, and protandry in spring, although <b>stonechats</b> winter in heterosexual pairs. Importantly, Zugunruhe of all populations declined with age, and the intensity of an individual bird's Zugunruhe was correlated with activity levels during other parts of the annual cycle. Our results confirm endogenous, population-specific migration programmes but also reveal apparent discrepancies between Zugunruhe and migration in the wild. We thus highlight both the continued potential of Zugunruhe study and the need for circumspect interpretation when using migratory restlessness to make inferences about migration in the wild. © 2017 The Author...|$|R
6000|$|The {{cases in}} the present class, though {{occurring}} in various groups, are not numerous; yet it seems {{the most natural thing}} that the young should at first somewhat resemble the adults of the same sex, and gradually become more and more like them. The adult male blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) has a black head, that of the female being reddish-brown; and I am informed by Mr. Blyth, that the young of both sexes can be distinguished by this character even as nestlings. In the family of thrushes an unusual number of similar cases have been noticed; thus, the male blackbird (Turdus merula) can be distinguished in the nest from the female. The two sexes of the mocking bird (Turdus polyglottus, Linn.) differ very little from each other, yet the males can easily be distinguished {{at a very early age}} from the females by showing more pure white. (46. Audubon, 'Ornith. Biography,' vol. i. p. 113.) The males of a forest-thrush and of a rock- thrush (Orocetes erythrogastra and Petrocincla cyanea) have much of their plumage of a fine blue, whilst the females are brown; and the nestling males of both species have their main wing and tail-feathers edged with blue whilst those of the female are edged with brown. (47. Mr. C.A. Wright, in 'Ibis,' vol. vi. 1864, p. 65. Jerdon, 'Birds of India,' vol. i. p. 515. See also on the blackbird, Blyth in Charlesworth's 'Magazine of Natural History,' vol. i. 1837, p. 113.) In the young blackbird the wing- feathers assume their mature character and become black after the others; on the other hand, in the two species just named the wing-feathers become blue before the others. The most probable view with reference to the {{cases in the}} present class is that the males, differently from what occurs in Class I., have transmitted their colours to their male offspring at an earlier age than that at which they were first acquired; for, if the males had varied whilst quite young, their characters would probably have been transmitted to both sexes. (48. The following additional cases may be mentioned; the young males of Tanagra rubra can be distinguished from the young females (Audubon, 'Ornith. Biography,' vol. iv. p. 392), and so it is within the nestlings of a blue nuthatch, Dendrophila frontalis of India (Jerdon, 'Birds of India,' vol. i. p. 389). Mr. Blyth also informs me that the sexes of the <b>stonechat,</b> Saxicola rubicola, are distinguishable at a very early age. Mr. Salvin gives ('Proc. Zoolog.

60|$|After {{the middle}} of June the common began to attract me more and more. It was so {{extensive}} that, standing on its border, just beyond the last straggling cottages and orchards, the further side was seen only as a line of blue trees, indistinct in the distance. As I grew to know it better, adding each day to my list from its varied bird life, the woods and waterside were visited less and less frequently, and after the bird-scaring noises began in the village, its wildness and quiet became increasingly grateful. The silence of nature was broken only by bird sounds, and the most frequent sound {{was that of the}} yellow bunting, as, perched motionless on the summit of a gorse bush, his yellow head conspicuous at a considerable distance, he emitted his thin monotonous chant at regular intervals, like a painted toy-bird that sings by machinery. There, too, sedentary as an owl in the daytime, the corn bunting was common, discharging his brief song at intervals--a sound as of shattering glass. The whinchat was rarely seen, but I constantly met the small, prettily coloured <b>stonechat</b> flitting from bush to bush, following me, and never ceasing his low, querulous tacking chirp, anxious for the safety of his nest. Nightingales, blackcaps and white-throats also nested there, and were louder and more emphatic in their protests when approached. There were several grasshopper-warblers on the common, all, very curiously as it seemed to me, clustered at one spot, so that one could ramble over miles of ground without hearing their singular note; but on approaching the place they inhabited one gradually became conscious of a mysterious trilling buzz or whirr, low at first and growing louder and more stridulous, until the hidden singers were left behind, when by degrees it sank lower and lower again, and ceased to be audible at a distance of about one hundred yards from the points where it had sounded loudest. The birds hid in clumps of furze and bramble so near together that the area covered by the buzzing sound measured about two hundred yards across. This most singular sound (for a warbler to make) is certainly not ventriloquial, although if one comes to it with the sense of hearing disorganized by town noises or unpractised, one is at a loss to determine the exact spot it comes from, or even to know from which side it comes. While emitting its prolonged sound the bird is so absorbed in its own performance that it is not easily alarmed, and will sometimes continue singing with a human listener standing within four or five yards of it. When one is near the bird, and listens, standing motionless, the effect on the nerves of hearing is very remarkable, considering the smallness of the sound, which, without being unpleasant, is somewhat similar to that produced by the vibration of the brake of a train; it is not powerful enough to jar the nerves, but appears to pervade the entire system. Lying still, with eyes closed, and three or four of these birds singing near, so that their strains overlap and leave no silent intervals, the listener can imagine that the sound originates within himself; that the numberless fine cords of his nervous network tremble responsively to it.|$|E

40|$|To {{anticipate}} seasonal change, organisms schedule {{their annual}} activities by using calendrical cues like photoperiod. The use of cues must be fitted to local conditions because schedules differ between species and habitats. In {{complete absence of}} temporal information, many species show persistent circannual cycles that are synchronised, but not driven, by photoperiod. The contribution of circannual rhythms to timing under natural photoperiodic conditions is still unclear. In a suite of experiments, we examined timing in two closely related songbirds (Siberian and European <b>stonechats)</b> that inhabit similar latitudes but differ in seasonal behaviour. Under a more continental climate, Siberian <b>stonechats</b> breed later, moult faster and migrate further than European <b>stonechats.</b> We tested hypotheses for seasonal timing mechanisms by comparing the birds under constant and naturally changing daylengths. The taxa retained characteristic reproductive and moult schedules and hybrids behaved roughly intermediately. Based on their distinct circannual cycles, we expected European and Siberian <b>stonechats</b> to differ in photoperiodic responses {{at a given time}} of year. We found that the taxa responded, as predicted, in opposite ways to photoperiodic simulations as experienced on different migration routes. The findings indicate that circannual rhythms reflect geographically distinct periodic changes in seasonal disposition and cue-response mechanisms. Under natural daylengths, the phase relationship of the underlying circannual rhythm to the external year determines the action of photoperiod. Circannual rhythms are widespread among long-lived species. Accordingly, responses to environmental change, range expansion and novel migration patterns may depend on the particulars of a species' underlying circannual programming...|$|R
50|$|The Madagascan <b>stonechat</b> has {{generally}} been considered a subspecies of African <b>stonechat</b> (as Saxicola torquatus sibilla), but recent genetic evidence has shown that it is distinct, {{more closely related to}} Reunion <b>stonechat</b> than it is to African <b>stonechat,</b> on which basis it is now accepted as a distinct species.|$|E
50|$|The Madagascan <b>stonechat</b> or Madagascar <b>stonechat</b> (Saxicola sibilla) is {{a species}} of <b>stonechat,</b> endemic to Madagascar. It is a small bird, closely similar to the African <b>stonechat</b> in both plumage and behaviour, but {{distinguished}} from it by the more extensive black on the throat and minimal orange-red on the upper breast of the males.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a member}} of the common <b>stonechat</b> superspecies, but it is distinct, {{together}} with its closest relative the Madagascan <b>stonechat</b> S. sibilla being insular derivatives of the African <b>stonechat.</b> Its ancestors probably diverged from the sub-Saharan African lineage as it spread across the continent some 2-2.5 mya during the Late Pliocene.|$|E
50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} seen flying along the cliffs. Some <b>stonechats</b> and meadow pipits gather on the meadow, while rock pipits move along {{the base of the}} cliffs. House martins make mud nests under the {{overhangs}} of the chalk cliffs.|$|R
50|$|Saxicola (Latin: saxum, rock + incola, {{dwelling}} in), the <b>stonechats</b> or chats, is a genus of 15 {{species of}} small passerine birds {{restricted to the}} Old World. They are insectivores occurring in open scrubland and grassland with scattered small shrubs.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a large breeding colony of Barau's petrels (3000-5000 breeding pairs) as well as populations of Réunion bulbuls, Mascarene white-eyes, Réunion olive white-eyes and Réunion <b>stonechats.</b>|$|R
