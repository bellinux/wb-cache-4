5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
5|$|While still a three-year-old, he was {{exported}} to England {{where he was}} registered in the General Stud Book. He was imported by Richard Croker, {{at a cost of}} about 8000 guineas. Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring to be registered in the General Stud Book, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not have happened had he been imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's prohibition on registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not have been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, {{the founders}} of Codemasters, David and Richard Darling, were at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and were {{impressed}} with {{the popularity of the}} Nintendo Entertainment System in the USA. They wanted to develop games for the system, but did not have a licence from Nintendo. In October 1989, programmer Andrew Graham developed a prototype, California Buggy Boys, which was showcased with multiple consoles networked. The prototype featured buggies similar to those in Power Drift, and the intention was to develop <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be popular in the United States. Codemasters then obtained a licensing deal with Galoob, who wanted them to develop a game based on their Micro Machines toys. California Buggy Boys was used as a base, and Galoob sent toys to Codemasters, who wanted a good selection for the game.|$|E
5|$|Robertson's stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79–9 overall record {{during his}} three varsity seasons, {{including}} two Final Four appearances. However, a championship eluded Robertson, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> become a repeated occurrence in his professional career. When Robertson left college {{he was the}} all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970. It {{is interesting to note}} that Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university's greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961, 1962, and just missed a third title in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not have been feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E

5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{were indeed}} {{fooled by the}} Ottoman subterfuge and were taken by {{surprise}} at {{the arrival of the}} Ottoman fleet at Crete on 23 June 1645. Despite the efforts of the recently appointed provveditore generale, Andrea Corner, the Venetian defenses were still in a bad state. The island's fortifications were substantial, but they had been long neglected, and much effort was put into repairing them. Anxious about Ottoman preparations, the Republic reinforced Crete in late 1644 with 2,500 troops and provisions, and began arming its fleet, while assistance was promised in the event of war by the Pope and Tuscany. However, the local Greek population was not well-disposed towards the Venetians, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> prove to be of critical importance. Not only were the Ottomans thus able to quickly establish control over the countryside, but in later years, when the Ottoman forces in the island were practically cut off from seaborne supplies, only the local produce, provided by the Greek population, sustained them.|$|E

25|$|A {{committed}} Eurosceptic, Duncan Smith {{became a}} constant {{thorn in the}} side of Prime Minister John Major's government of 1992 to 1997, opposing Major's pro-European agenda at the time (<b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> often be raised during his own subsequent leadership when he called for the party to unite behind him).|$|E
25|$|The laws on {{quarantine}} {{will also}} need to be clarified as the regulations for the Apollo program were rescinded.

25|$|A similar product, Toronto Index Participation Shares, started {{trading on}} the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) in 1990.
