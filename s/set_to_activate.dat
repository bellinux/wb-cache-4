500|$|In some diver {{training}} courses for {{these types of}} diving, divers are taught to plan and monitor {{what is called the}} oxygen clock of their dives. This is a notional alarm clock, which ticks more quickly at increased oxygen pressure and is <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> at the maximum single exposure limit recommended in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Diving Manual. For the following partial pressures of oxygen the limits are: 45 minutes at , 120 minutes at , 150 minutes at , 180 minutes at [...] and 210 minutes at , but it is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur. Many nitrox-capable dive computers calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives. The aim is to avoid activating the alarm by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas or by reducing the time spent breathing gas of greater oxygen partial pressure. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases with the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas and the depth of the dive, the diver obtains more time on the oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth, by breathing a less oxygen-rich gas, or by shortening the duration of exposure to oxygen-rich gases.|$|E

40|$|Workflow {{modelling}} languages {{allow for}} the specification of executable business processes. They, however, do typically not provide any guidance for the adaptation of workflow models, i. e. they do not offer any methods or tools explaining and highlighting which adaptations of the models are feasible and which are not. Therefore, an approach to identify so-called configurable elements of a workflow modelling language and to add configuration opportunities to workflow models is presented in this paper. Configurable elements are {{the elements of a}} workflow model that can be modified such that the behavior represented by the model is restricted. More precisely, a configurable element can be either <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>activated,</b> <b>to</b> blocked, or to hidden. To ensure that such configurations lead only to desirable models, our approach allows for imposing so-called requirements on the model’s configuration. They have to be fulfilled by any configuration, and limit therefore the freedom of configuration choices. The identification of configurable elements within the workflow modelling language of YAWL and the derivation of the new “configurable YAWL ” language provide a concrete example for a rather generic approach. A transformation of configured models into lawful YAWL models demonstrates its applicability...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} using electroencephalograms (EEGs) to rapidly detect the intent to open one’s hand in individuals with complete hand paralysis following a subcortical ischemic stroke. If detectable, this motor planning activity {{could be used in}} real time to trigger a motorized hand exoskeleton or an electrical stimulation device that opens/closes the hand. While EEG-triggered movement-assist devices could restore function, they may also promote recovery by reinforcing the use of remaining cortical circuits. EEGs were recorded while participants were cued to either relax or attempt to extend their fingers. Linear discriminant analysis was used to detect onset of finger extension from the EEGs in a leave-one-trial-out cross-validation process. In each testing trial, the classifier was applied in pseudo real time starting from an initial hand-relaxed phase, through movement planning, and into the initial attempted finger extension phase (finger extension phase estimated from typical time-to-movement-onset measured in the unaffected hand). The classifiers detected attempted finger-extension at a significantly higher rate during both motor planning and early attempted execution compared to rest. To reduce inappropriate triggering of a movement-assist device during rest, the classification threshold could be adjusted to require more certainty about one’s intent to move before triggering a device. Additionally, a device could be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> only after multiple time samples in a row were classified as finger extension events. These options resulted in some sessions with no false triggers while the person was resting, but moderate-to-high true trigger rates during attempted movements...|$|E

40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks, {{determining the}} <b>set</b> of locations <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> sensors, {{such that the}} amount of information received is maximised, is an important task. With the model driven approach to sensor networks, a considerable amount of research has been conducted into the sensor selection problem, whereby informative locations <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> sensors are determined through the use of Gaussian Processes. Current approaches to sensor selection, however, do not take bandwidth constraints into consideration. When bandwidth is limited, the amount of time required to realise a given set of communication requests, in terms of rout- ing and scheduling, must be accounted for. Traditionally, in wireless sensor networks, sensor selection, routing, and scheduling are considered separately. These three processes, however, are highly coupled and the overall utility of the data collection process, in terms of the amount of information it produces, can be improved by integrating them. In this paper, we present two approaches to combining routing, scheduling, and sensor selection such that they inform each other so as to improve the performance of the network in the bandwidth limited case...|$|R

Second, the negativity ratings did not differ in both conditions, suggesting that art framing does not erase, diminish, or convert the negative affect vis-a`-vis the disgusting stimulus features. Third, {{there was no difference in}} terms of the intensity of the experience—a result that contradicts the position that aesthetic emotions are less intense than ordinary emotions.

40|$|Abstract — We propose new {{algorithms}} {{to achieve}} k-coverage in dense sensor networks. In such networks, covering sensor locations approximates covering the whole area. However, {{it has been}} shown before that selecting the minimum <b>set</b> of sensors <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> from an already deployed set of sensors is NP-hard. We propose an efficient approximation algorithm which achieves a solution of size within a logarithmic factor of the optimal. We prove that our algorithm is correct and analyze its complexity. We implement our algorithm and compare it against two others in the literature. Our results show that the logarithmic factor is only a worst-case upper bound and the solution size is close to the optimal in most cases. A key feature of our algorithm is that it can be implemented in a distributed manner with local information and low message complexity. We design and implement a fully distributed version of our algorithm. Our distributed algorithm does not require that sensors know their locations. Comparison with two other distributed algorithms in the literature indicates that our algorithm: (i) converges much faster than the others, (ii) activates near-optimal number of sensors, and (iii) significantly prolongs (almost doubles) the network lifetime because it consumes much less energy than the other algorithms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} {{tracking}} an object moving randomly through a network of wireless sensors. Our objective is to devise strategies for scheduling the sensors to optimize the tradeoff between tracking performance and energy consumption. We cast the scheduling problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the control actions correspond <b>to</b> the <b>set</b> of sensors <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> at each time step. Using a bottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with increasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the different sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the sensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping sensing range such that the tracking error, and hence {{the actions of the}} different sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein the target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous spaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models due to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces. Hence, we devise approximate solution techniques, and in some cases derive lower bounds on the optimal tradeoff curves. The generated scheduling policies, albeit suboptimal, often provide close-to-optimal energy-tracking tradeoffs...|$|R
