40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel microdosimetric model for metallic nanomaterial-parti- cles (MENAP) -induced cytotoxicity. The {{focus is on}} the engineered insoluble MENAP which represent a significant breakthrough in the design and development of new products for consumers, industry, and medicine. Increased production is rapidly occurring and may cause currently unrecognized health effects (e. g., nervous system dysfunction, heart disease, cancer); thus, dose-response models for MENAP-induced biological effects are needed to facilitate health risk assessment. The stochastic threshold microdose (STM) model presented introduces novel stochastic microdose metrics for use in constructing dose- response relationships for the frequency of specific cellular (e. g., cell killing, mutations, neoplastic transformation) or subcellular (e. g., mitochondria dysfunction) effects. A key metric is the exposure-time-dependent, <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> (MENAP count) for a given critical target (e. g., mitochondria, nucleus). Exceeding a stochastic threshold <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> triggers cell death. For critical targets in the cytoplasm, the autophagic mode of death is triggered. For the nuclear target, the apoptotic mode of death is triggered. Overall cell survival is evaluated for the indicated competing modes of death when both apply. The STM model can be applied to cytotoxicity data using Bayesian methods implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} feature of the Protocol concluded in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 is the differentiation of the climate targets of the industrialized countries. A more systematic approach to burden sharing than that leading to the Kyoto Protocol could help negotiating targets after 2012, and when including developing countries {{in the group of}} countries with climate targets at a later stage. The article discusses a number of concepts of equity, examines three <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> sharing rules and formulae, and presents cost calculations on the burden sharing rules. The three formulae that are explored have some ability to adapt to national circumstances, but none of them creates a burden sharing arrangement that completely equalizes the national income losses as percentage of GDP across the OECD. Nonetheless, the results show that burden sharing rules can be useful tools and provide some, but not all, of the guiding framework for climate policy negotiations...|$|E

Although a few vitiligo-specific quality of life instruments exist, there is no <b>specific</b> vitiligo <b>burden</b> tool. We developed and validated a <b>specific</b> vitiligo <b>burden</b> tool according to skin phototype. In total, 301 patients completed 35 items of the Vitiligo Impact Patient scale, of whom 235 were of skin phototype I to III and 66 of phototype IV to VI. The dimensionality of the items was evaluated using factor analyses, with results suggesting three factors in fair- and dark-skinned patients (“Psychological effects on daily life,” “Relationships and Sexuality,” and “Economic Constraints, Care & Management of Disease”). Unidimensionality was confirmed by higher order factor analysis. Cronbach’s α were high—and intradimensional coherences all demonstrated good reliability (α > 0. 8). The final instrument consists of 29 items (19 items common to all patients, 3 specific to fair skin, and 7 to dark skin). The test-retest reliability demonstrated very good reproducibility. The intraclass correlation of each dimension was greater than 0. 90 for each population.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{recapitalization}} of failing banks. A recapitalization is efficient if the social benefits (preserving systemic stability) exceed the cost of recapitalization. In a national setting, the implementation of an optimal policy is relatively straightforward. But in a cross-border setting, one is confronted with possible coordination failure. Using a multicountry model, it is shown that ex post negotiations on burden sharing lead to an underprovision of recapitalizations. Next, we explore different ex ante burden sharing mechanisms to overcome the coordination failure. The first is a general scheme financed collectively by the participating countries (generic burden sharing). The second relates the burden {{to the location of}} the assets of the bank to be recapitalized (<b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> sharing). The working of the two mechanisms is calibrated with data on large cross border banks in Europe. Because the costs and benefits are better aligned in the specific scheme, it is better able to overcome the coordination failure. JEL Codes: E 58, E 60, G 21, G 28. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{rationale}} for bundled payments is to incentivize various providers to collaboratively deliver high-quality {{care at the}} lowest possible cost, but several authors have noted potential downsides of this payment model, both for the patients and the providers. With respect to the former, Bozic et al. [13] noted that bundled payment models simultaneously create the incentive to withhold care, and because of this, {{there is a growing}} awareness that institutions need methods to calculate the <b>specific</b> cost <b>burden</b> of patient factors associated with a particular procedure prior to entering into a bundled payment reimbursement agreement [5]. This is not only imperative for the financial solvency of the institution [5], but it is also necessary to ensure that more complex patients with multiple comorbid conditions receive the care they need. The results of our study, which show the impact of increasing CCI scores on hospital LOS and its financial implications further highlight the importance of quantifying the <b>specific</b> cost <b>burden</b> of patient factors, both to protect the financial interests of the institution and to ensure that funds are allotted {{to meet the needs of}} medically complex patients. In summary, the results of our study suggest that the CCI score may have a role in predicting hospital costs and negotiating reimbursement rates for the treatment of hip fractures, and, based on our results, more research is warranted to evaluate the impact of the CCI score on other costs included in bundled payments.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Caregivers {{of people}} with mental {{illnesses}} often experience {{a wide range of}} burdens. Although many studies have confirmed burdens among family caregivers of mentally ill relatives in general, specific knowledge regarding the concrete everyday hassle and existential sorrows from the caregiverś subjective reasoning perspective is lacking. Furthermore, there is little evidence on the possible different effects of affective disorders and schizophrenia on the quality of burden; this is also true with regard to the role of cultural traditions and lay beliefs. AIMS: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the <b>specific</b> <b>burdens</b> experienced by caregivers of patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted by semi-structured interviews with 45 caregivers of patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. Data were analysed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Eleven encumbering themes resulted from the interviews including incertitude, unawareness, emotional burden, stigma and blame, financial burden, physical burden, restriction in routine, disruption in routine, dissatisfaction with family, relatives, and acquaintances, troubles with patients' adherence to medication, and problems with health services and governmental support. CONCLUSIONS: Caring for a person with mental illness affects caregivers emotionally, financially, physically, and it elicits some restrictions in their routine (daily hassles). Finally, it causes conflicts in family relationships. Despite some differences regarding perceived burden among caregivers of schizophrenia and affective disorders, a common pattern of burden could be identified. Thus, authorities should provide adequate financial, educational, and psychosocial supports for caregivers of mental illnesses...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{deals with}} two related issues: {{first with the}} {{conundrum}} of the Hungarian law on nationality and voting rights; second with instances when nationality acts as a stigma. It has two major propositions. First, the Hungarian law on nationality and elections {{does not lead to}} any reasonable conclusion concerning who constitutes the Hungarian political community, as millions of Hungarian nationals are practically excluded – but an ever increasing crowd of people who have never lived in Hungary but are descendants of nationals of the Hungarian Kingdom (and who are therefore entitled to preferential naturalization and rewarded with voting rights), are. So a clearly ethnic-cultural nationalist discourse has led to the adoption of a system of rules which in essence serves one purpose: the creation of a faithful clientele. Second, nationality in the present form, usually based on ius sanguinis and ius soli is not tenable from the moral- and political-philosophical point of view as it does not differ from a feudal privilege, also determined by accident of birth into a family or in one place. The <b>specific</b> <b>burdens</b> that differentiate nationals from settled foreigners are also reviewed in this paper. The conclusion is that nationality should be reformulated along the lines of Rainer Bauböck and Ayelet Shachar’s thinking; that is, rights entailed in nationality should derive from attachment to a given community, and {{from the fact that the}} decisions of the body politic directly affect the person...|$|R

Objective: Here, considering a COPD smoking patient, the <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> of continuous smoking was estimated, {{as well as}} the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation. Methods: A multi-state Markov model adopting society’s perspective was developed. Simulated cohorts of English COPD patients who are active smokers (all severity stages combined or patients with the same initial severity stage) were compared to identical cohorts of patients who quit smoking at cohort initialization. Life expectancy, quality adjusted lifeyears (QALY), disease-related costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER: £/QALY) were estimated, considering smoking cessation programs with various possible scenarios of success rates and costs. Sensitivity analyses included the variation of model key parameters. Principal Findings: At the horizon of a smoking COPD patient’s remaining lifetime, smoking cessation at cohort intitialization, relapses being allowed as observed in practice, would result in gains (mean) of 1. 27 life-years and 0. 68 QALY, and induce savings of 21824 £/patient in the disease-related costs. The corresponding ICER was 22686 £/QALY. Smoking cessation resulted in 0. 72, 0. 69, 0. 64 and 0. 42 QALY respectively gained per mild, moderate, severe, and very severe COP...|$|E
40|$|Background. Australia, {{like other}} countries, is {{experiencing}} {{an epidemic of}} heart failure (HF). However, {{given the lack of}} national and population-based datasets collating detailed cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality outcomes, quantifying the <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> imposed by HF has been difficult. Methods. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS data) for the year 2000 were used in combination with contemporary, well-validated population-based epidemiologic data to estimate the number of individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic HF related to both preserved (diastolic dysfunction) and impaired left ventricular systolic (dys) function (LVSD) and rates of HF-related hospitalisation. Results. In 2000, we estimate that around 325, 000 Australians (58 % male) had symptomatic HF associated with both LVSD and diastolic dysfunction and an additional 214, 000 with asymptomatic LVSD. 140, 000 (26 %) live in rural and remote regions, distal to specialist health care services. There was an estimated 22, 000 incidents of admissions for congestive heart failure and approximately 100, 000 admissions associated with this syndrome overall. Conclusion. Australia {{is in the midst of}} a HF epidemic that continues to grow. Overall, it probably contributes to over 1. 4 million days of hospitalization at a cost of more than $ 1 billion.

Methods: Based on the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance data for 2003, the number of prescriptions per insured individual (NPI) was calculated for employed and unemployed persons, as well as for different subsets according to the region (Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek), age, gender, and prescribed drug category. Results: During 2003, a total of 1 003 547 drugs were prescribed to 949 746 health-insured persons aged 18 - 69 years. NPI was 32 % higher for unemployed than for employed citizens; it averaged 0. 995 among the employed, and 1. 317 among the unemployed. Differences in NPI (∆NPI) between the employed and the unemployed varied within the subsets; the largest difference was observed in the Zagreb region (ΔNPI[*]=[*] 0. 522), in the 30 - 39 age group (ΔNPI[*]=[*] 0. 563), in men (ΔNPI[*]=[*] 0. 565), and for anxiolytic/antidepressant drugs (ΔNPI[*]=[*] 0. 184).

40|$|Introduction: Uganda {{has limited}} health resources. It is {{important}} to measure the need for imaging in order to set policy and plan for imaging services. Objectives: The first specific objective was to develop and apply four imaging needs indices on a case study basis, in five selected Ugandan hospitals. The indices were: Imaging Load (IL), Imaging <b>Burden</b> (IB), Type <b>Specific</b> Imaging <b>Burden</b> (TSIB), and Disease <b>Specific</b> Imaging <b>Burden</b> (DSIB). The second objective was to explore {{the perceptions of the}} patient, referring clinician, and radiologist regarding the values, meaning, and objective of imaging in patient care. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey employing triangulation methodology, conducted in 5 Ugandan hospitals over a period of 3 years during 2005 - 2008. The subjects were divided into four clusters: Obstetrics and gynecology (obs/gynae), surgery, internal medicine, and pediatrics. For the quantitative component of the study, data from case notes was used to calculate the indices. The qualitative component explored the non-measurable aspects of imaging needs from the clinician′s, radiologist′s, and patient′s perspective. Results: A total of 1961 patient case notes were studied. The IB was 460 per 1000 hospital patients per year. The highest TSIB was for ultrasound at 232 per 1000 hospital patients per year, followed by 191 patients for general X-ray. The majority of the patients interviewed had special desires, expectations, and misconceptions. Conclusions: There is a high IB of 460 per thousand patient populations per year, mainly due to ultrasound. The majority of the patients have perceptions, misconceptions, beliefs, and values which influence the need for imaging. There is a need to address the medical and non-tangible imaging needs of the patient and to counteract imaging-related misconceptions and over-expectations. Public awareness of the value, capabilities, limitations, and adverse effects of various imaging modalities need to be addressed to ensure that the patients make informed imaging choices and readily avail themselves of interventions in situations when imaging is crucial, for example in suspected high-risk pregnancy...|$|R

In addition, it is shown that tax elasticity is lower when solely analyzing investments in production, plant and equipment (PPE).

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Age and smoking are common risk factors for COPD and other illnesses, often leading COPD patients to demonstrate multiple coexisting comorbidities. COPD exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients. Clinical trials investigating the treatment of COPD routinely exclude patients with multiple comorbidities or advanced age. Clinical practice guidelines for a specific disease do not usually address comorbidities in their recommendations. However, the management and the medical intervention in COPD patients with comorbidities need a holistic approach that is not clearly established worldwide. This holistic approach should include the <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> of each comorbidity in the COPD severity classification scale. Further, the pharmacological and nonpharmacological management should also include optimal interventions and risk factor modifications simultaneously for all diseases.

In this review, we focus on the major comorbidities that affect COPD patients.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a system of indicators for alcohol consumption and attributable harm which can be used as an over-time monitoring tool at the country level as well as for comparisons between countries. Design A systematic research in electronic data bases was conducted but most of the information was derived from ongoing international efforts to establish alcohol monitoring and surveillance systems. Setting European Union. Participants Countries. Measurements Exposure to alcohol, mortality, burden of disease. Findings Adult per capita alcohol consumption, prevalence of abstention, and frequency of drinking more than 60 g pure alcohol in one occasion are proposed as a minimal set of alcohol exposure indicators, which can quickly be implemented in all EU countries. With respect to health harm indicators, the best minimal choice which can be implemented quickly in all countries of the EU would be alcohol-attributable years of life lost due to premature death.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of roe deer as a host for Ixodes ticks in central Europe, estimates of total tick burden on roe deer are not available to date. We aimed at providing (1) estimates of life stage and sex specific (larvae, nymphs, males and females, hereafter referred to as tick life stages) total Ixodes burden and (2) equations {{which can be used}} to predict the total life stage burden by counting the life stage on a selected body area. Within a period of 1 ½ years, we conducted whole body counts of ticks from 80 hunter-killed roe deer originating from a beech dominated forest area in central Germany. Averaged over the entire study period (winter 2007 –summer 2009), the mean tick burden per roe deer was 64. 5 (SE ±  10. 6). Nymphs were the most numerous tick life stage per roe deer (23. 9  ±  3. 2), followed by females (21. 4  ±  3. 5), larvae (10. 8  ±  4. 2) and males (8. 4  ±  1. 5). The individual tick burden was highly aggregated (k =  0. 46); levels of aggregation were highest in larvae (k =  0. 08), followed by males (k =  0. 40), females (k =  0. 49) and nymphs (k =  0. 71). To predict total life stage <b>specific</b> <b>burdens</b> based on counts on selected body parts, we provide linear equations. For estimating larvae abundance on the entire roe deer, counts can be restricted to the front legs. Tick counts restricted to the head are sufficient to estimate total nymph burden and counts on the neck are appropriate for estimating adult ticks (females and males). In order to estimate the combined tick burden, tick counts on the head can be used for extrapolation. The presented linear models are highly significant and explain 84. 1, 77. 3, 90. 5, 91. 3, and 65. 3 % (adjusted R 2) of the observed variance, respectively. Thus, these models offer a robust basis for rapid tick abundance assessment. This can be useful for studies aiming at estimating effects of abiotic and biotic factors on tick abundance, modelling tick population dynamics, modelling tick-borne pathogen transmission dynamics or assessing the efficacy of acaricides...|$|R
40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> {{imposed on}} Intensive Care Units (ICUs) during the A/H 1 N 1 {{influenza}} 2009 pandemic has been poorly explored. An on-line screening registry allowed a daily report of ICU beds occupancy rate by flu infected patients (Flu-OR) admitted in French ICUs. METHODS: A prospective inception cohort study with {{results of an}} on-line screening registry designed for daily assessment of ICU burden. RESULTS: Among the 108 centers participating to the French H 1 N 1 research network on mechanical ventilation (REVA) - French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF) registry, 69 ICUs belonging to seven large geographical areas voluntarily participated to a website screening-registry. The aim was to daily assess the ICU beds occupancy rate by influenza-infected and non-infected patients {{for at least three}} weeks. 391 critically ill infected patients were enrolled in the cohort, representing a subset of 35 % of the whole French 2009 pandemic cohort; 73 % were mechanically ventilated, 13 % required extra corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 % died. The global Flu-OR in these ICUs was only 7. 6 %, but it exceeded a predefined 15 % critical threshold in 32 ICUs for a total of 103 weeks. Flu-ORs were significantly higher in University than in non University hospitals. The peak ICU burden was poorly predicted by observations obtained at the level of large geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: The peak Flu-OR during the pandemic significantly exceeded a 15 % critical threshold in almost half of the ICUs, with an uneven distribution with time, geographical areas and between University and non University hospitals. An on-line assessment of Flu-OR via a simple dedicated registry may contribute to better match resources and needs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) link data on disease {{occurrence}} {{to health}} outcomes, {{and they are}} a useful aid in establishing country-specific agendas regarding cancer control. The variables required to compute DALYs are however multiple and not readily available in many countries. We propose a methodology that derives global DALYs and validate variables and DALYs based on data from various cancer registries. Methods We estimated DALYs for four countries (Norway, Bulgaria, India and Uganda) within each category of the human development index (HDI). The following sources (indicators) were used: Globocan 2008 (incidence and mortality), various cancer registries (proportion cured, proportion treated and duration of disease), treatment guidelines (duration of treatment), <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> of disease studies (sequelae and disability weights), alongside expert opinion. We obtained country-specific population estimates and identified resource levels using the HDI, DALYs are computed as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disabilities. Results Using mortality:incidence ratios to estimate country-specific survival, and by applying the human development index we derived country-specific estimates of the proportion cured and the proportion treated. The fit between the estimates and observed data from the cancer registries was relatively good. The final DALY estimates were similar to those computed using observed values in Norway, and in WHO’s earlier global burden of disease study. Marked cross-country differences in the patterns of DALYs by cancer sites were observed. In Norway and Bulgaria, breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer were the main contributors to DALYs, representing 54 % and 45 %, respectively, of the totals. These cancers contributed only 27 % and 18 %, respectively, of total DALYs in India and Uganda. Conclusions Our approach resulted in a series of variables {{that can be used to}} estimate country-specific DALYs, enabling global estimates of DALYs and international comparisons that support priorities in cancer control. </p...|$|E

Age and smoking are common risk factors for COPD and other illnesses, often leading COPD patients to demonstrate multiple coexisting comorbidities. COPD exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients. Clinical trials investigating the treatment of COPD routinely exclude patients with multiple comorbidities or advanced age. Clinical practice guidelines for a specific disease do not usually address comorbidities in their recommendations. However, the management and the medical intervention in COPD patients with comorbidities need a holistic approach that is not clearly established worldwide. This holistic approach should include the <b>specific</b> <b>burden</b> of each comorbidity in the COPD severity classification scale. Further, the pharmacological and nonpharmacological management should also include optimal interventions and risk factor modifications simultaneously for all diseases. All health care specialists in COPD management need to work together with professionals specialized in the management of the other major chronic diseases in order to provide a multidisciplinary approach to COPD patients with multiple diseases. In this review, we focus on the major comorbidities that affect COPD patients. We present an overview of the problems faced, the reasons and risk factors for the most commonly encountered comorbidities, and the burden on health care costs. We also provide a rationale for approaching the therapeutic options of the COPD patient afflicted by comorbidity.

40|$|Rhesus factor {{polymorphism}} {{has been}} an evolutionary enigma since its discovery in 1939. Carriers of the rarer allele should be eliminated by selection against Rhesus positive children born to Rhesus negative mothers. Here I used an ecologic regression study {{to test the hypothesis}} that Rhesus factor polymorphism is stabilized by heterozygote advantage. The study was performed in 65 countries for which the frequencies of RhD phenotypes and <b>specific</b> disease <b>burden</b> data were available. I performed multiple multivariate covariance analysis with five potential confounding variables: GDP, latitude (distance from the equator), humidity, medical care expenditure per capita and frequencies of smokers. The results showed that the burden associated with many diseases correlated with the frequencies of particular Rhesus genotypes in a country and that the direction of the relation was nearly always the opposite for the frequency of Rhesus negative homozygotes and that of Rhesus positive heterozygotes. On the population level, a Rhesus-negativity-associated burden could be compensated for by the heterozygote advantage, but for Rhesus negative subjects this burden represents a serious problem...|$|R

Two major trends are confirmed by both treatment methods: First, there is a northsouth divide, with the northern regions experiencing a far higher risk of crime.

40|$|This Note {{analyzes}} the unique standing problem introduced {{by a particular}} set of Establishment Clause cases: those concerning nontaxpayer–based challenges to alleged “public displays” of religious symbols. This injury–in–fact problem arises {{due to the nature of}} the specific type of harm recognized by the U. S. Supreme Court in the context of religious displays: the public endorsement of religion. Due to this unusually subjective harm, it is unclear how the courts should evaluate this threshold injury–in–fact inquiry. This Note {{analyzes the}} legal conflict arising from the attempt to remain faithful to both the traditional injury–in–fact standing requirements and the endorsement test generally applied to the merits in Establishment Clause challenges. This Note interprets Supreme Court precedent and proposes a tailored, multifactor test, articulating a <b>specific</b> injury–in–fact <b>burden</b> for public display challengers. The proposed test attempts to take into account the entirety of the unique injury. In particular, this test considers the display in context, rather than as a mere “snapshot. ” This standard, while unique, is fully reconcilable with the Court’s current standing jurisprudence and addresses the various policy implications confronted by the lower courts...|$|R
