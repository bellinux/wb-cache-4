50|$|Some torpedoes—like the Russian VA-111 Shkval, Iranian Hoot, and German Unterwasserlaufkörper/ Barracuda—use <b>supercavitation</b> to {{increase}} speed to over 200 kn. Torpedoes that don't use <b>supercavitation,</b> such as the American Mark 48 and British Spearfish, are limited to under 100 kn, though manufacturers and the military don't always release exact figures.|$|E
50|$|Iran {{claimed to}} have {{successfully}} tested its first <b>supercavitation</b> torpedo on 2 April and 3 April 2006. Some sources have speculated {{it is based on}} the Russian VA-111 Shkval <b>supercavitation</b> torpedo, which travels at the same speed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denied supplying Iran with the technology. Iran called this weapon the Hoot (Whale).|$|E

50|$|The torpedo steers using four fins that skim {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} <b>supercavitation</b> gas bubble. To change direction, the fin(s) {{on the inside of}} the desired turn are extended, and the {{opposing}} fins are retracted.|$|E

50|$|A {{prototype}} {{named the}} Ghost, designed for stealth operations by Gregory Sancoff of Juliet Marine Systems, uses <b>supercavitation</b> to propel itself atop two struts with sharpened edges. The vessel rides smoothly in choppy water and has reached speeds of 29 knots.|$|E
50|$|A {{supercavitating}} torpedo is a torpedo {{using the}} effect of <b>supercavitation</b> to create a bubble around the torpedo to move at high velocity under water. The following {{is a list of}} supercavitating torpedoes which have been developed or are in development.|$|E
50|$|The {{supercavitating}} propeller is {{a variant of}} a propeller for propulsion in water, where <b>supercavitation</b> is actively employed to gain increased speed by reducing friction. They are being used for military purposes and for high performance racing boats as well as model racing boats.|$|E
5000|$|Marshall P. Tulin (born 14 March 1926) is an American {{engineer}} {{working in}} hydrodynamics. He is the retired Director, Ocean Engineering Laboratory, University of California, Santa Barbara. His pioneering {{work in the}} 1950s is credited with successful developments {{in the theory of}} <b>supercavitation</b> for naval engineering.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} Iranian {{news agency}} IRNA claims the torpedo was produced and {{developed by the}} Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (...) [...] Most military and industry analysts {{have concluded that the}} Hoot is reverse engineered from the Russian VA-111 Shkval <b>supercavitation</b> torpedo which travels at the same speed.|$|E
5000|$|The Hoot (حوت; Whale) is an Iranian <b>supercavitation</b> torpedo {{claimed to}} travel at {{approximately}} 360 km/h, several {{times faster than}} a conventional torpedo. It was {{claimed to have been}} successfully test-fired from a surface ship against a dummy submarine during the Iranian military exercise [...] "Great Prophet" [...] ) on 2 April 2006 and 3 April 2006. Iran test-fired the torpedo within its territorial waters in the Strait of Hormuz in May 2017.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the shock}} waves formed by {{collapse}} of the voids {{are strong enough to}} cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of fluid dynamics. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in <b>supercavitation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Super{{cavitation}}</b> {{is the use}} of cavitation {{effects to}} create a bubble of steam inside a liquid large enough to encompass an object travelling through the liquid, greatly reducing the skin friction drag on the object and enabling achievement of very high speeds. Current applications are mainly limited to projectiles or very fast supercavitating torpedoes, and some propellers, but in principle the technique could be extended to include entire vehicles. Chinese and the US Navy are reportedly working on supercavitating submarines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon can {{be controlled}} to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, {{as well as in}} material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and <b>supercavitation.</b> The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and <b>supercavitation</b> were published in the book Jets, wakes and cavities [...] followed by Theory of jets of ideal fluid. Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems. Another venue combining the existing exact solutions with approximated and heuristic models was explored in the work Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries [...] that refined the applied calculation techniques based on the principle of cavity expansion independence, theory of pulsations and stability of elongated axisymmetric cavities, etc. and in Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels.|$|E
50|$|The VA-111 is {{launched}} from 533 mm torpedo tubes at 50 kn before its solid-fuel rocket ignites and propels it to speeds of 200 kn. Some {{reports indicate that}} speeds of 250+ knots may be achieved, and that work on a 300 kn version was underway. This high speed is due to <b>supercavitation,</b> whereby a gas bubble, which envelops the torpedo, is created by outward deflection of water by its specially-shaped nose cone {{and the expansion of}} gases from its engine. This minimizes water contact with the torpedo, significantly reducing drag.|$|E
50|$|The British Spearfish torpedo {{designed}} to counter high speed Russian submarines, {{such as the}} Alfa class submarine, is reputed to have a speed in excess of 70 knots (130 km/h or 80 mph). The Russian rocket-powered supercavitating torpedo VA-111 Shkval is reportedly capable of speed in excess of 200 knots (370 km/h or 230 mph). German press reports of an underwater anti-torpedo missile named Barracuda that allegedly reaches 800 km/h. The U.S. Navy has contracted with the General Dynamics Electric Boat Division to support development of the Underwater Express, an undersea transport capable of controllable speeds up to 100 knots (185 km/h) through <b>supercavitation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{supercavitating}} propeller is {{a variant of}} a propeller for propulsion in water, where <b>supercavitation</b> is actively employed to gain increased speed by reducing friction. They are being used for military purposes and for high performance racing boats, as well as model racing boats. The {{supercavitating propeller}} operates submerged with the entire diameter of the blade below the water line. Its blades are wedge-shaped to force cavitation on the whole forward face, starting at the leading edge, {{in order to reduce}} water skin friction. As the cavity collapses well behind the blade, the supercavitating propeller avoids the spalling damage due to cavitation that is a problem with conventional propellers.|$|E
50|$|The great speed {{required}} for <b>supercavitation</b> to {{work can be}} achieved temporarily by a projectile fired under water or by an airborne projectile impacting the water. Rocket propulsion {{can be used for}} sustained operation, with the possibility of tapping high pressure gas to route to the object's nose in order to enhance the cavitation bubble. An example of rocket propulsion is the Russian VA-111 Shkval supercavitating torpedo. In principle, maneuvering may be achieved by various means such as drag fins that project through the bubble into the surrounding liquid (p. 22), by tilting the nose of the object, by injecting gas asymmetrically near the nose in order to distort the geometry of the cavity, by vectoring rocket thrust through gimbaling for a single nozzle, or by differential thrust for multiple nozzles.|$|E
5000|$|The Coandă {{effect is}} also used on the Xplorair to reduce form drag. While cruising, {{compressed}} air is injected as a radial jet at nose and leading edges, orthogonally to the ambient airflow, then covers the whole wetted area. This reduces the form drag, and could even make it negative with enough jet speed. This technique has been tested {{for the first time}} in 1918 by French physicist Constantin Chilowsky on shells, then various authors took over the idea to improve projectiles, including Henri Coandă for his own research on aerodynamics. This is why Aguilar refers to the [...] "Chilowsky effect" [...] rather than [...] "Coandă effect" [...] for this drag reduction scheme. This technique applied in air is similar to the submarine <b>supercavitation</b> technique used in some torpedoes like the VA-111 Shkval.|$|E
5000|$|German {{engineer}} Hanns von Schertel {{worked on}} hydrofoils {{prior to and}} during World War II in Germany. After the war, the Russians captured Schertel's team. As Germany was not authorized to build fast boats, Schertel went to Switzerland, where he established the Supramar company. In 1952, Supramar launched the first commercial hydrofoil, PT10 [...] "Freccia d'Oro" [...] (Golden Arrow), in Lake Maggiore, between Switzerland and Italy. The PT10 is of surface-piercing type, it can carry 32 passengers and travel at 35 kn. In 1968, the Bahraini born banker Hussain Najadi acquired the Supramar AG and expanded its operations into Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Norway and the US. General Dynamics of the United States became its licensee, and the Pentagon awarded its first R&D naval research project {{in the field of}} <b>supercavitation.</b> Hitachi Shipbuilding of Osaka, Japan, was another licensee of Supramar, as well as many leading ship owners and shipyards in the OECD countries.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, DARPA {{announced}} the 'Underwater Express program', {{a research and}} evaluation bid to establish the potential of <b>supercavitation.</b> The program's ultimate goal is {{a new class of}} underwater craft for littoral missions that can transport small groups of Navy personnel or specialized military cargo at speeds up to 100 knots. The contracts were awarded to Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics Electric Boat in late 2006. In 2009, DARPA announced progress via a new class of submarine. [...] The submarine's designer, Electric Boat, is working on a one-quarter scale model for sea trials off the coast of Rhode Island. If the trials are successful, Electric Boat will begin production on a full scale 100-foot submarine. Currently, the Navy's fastest submarine can only travel at 25 to 30 knots while submerged. But if everything goes according to plan, the Underwater Express will speed along at 100 knots, allowing the delivery of men and materiel faster than ever." ...|$|E

40|$|A <b>supercavitation</b> {{propeller}} (SCP) {{that has}} high efficiency under supercavitating condition is expected {{as one of}} the most suitable propulsors for a high-speed vessel. To design a SCP with higher efficiency, a thinner cavity is recommended.

In order to obtain the predicted thrust and high efficiency, it is necessary to let stable cavitation occur from the leading edge as predicted by theory. The authors propose a new cavitator that stimulates cavitation by a thin groove near the leading edge on the backside surface. Through the present comparative tests between propellers with and without the cavitator, it was clarified that the proposed cavitator is effective in stimulating and stabilizing a supercavity, and that it increases the propeller efficiency...|$|E
