25|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) {{are a large}} {{focus of}} the Institute’s research and clinical programs. Autism is typically diagnosed by age three, however the Institute’s research is focused on detecting signs of the disorder even earlier. One of the pioneers of autism research today is Dr. Rebecca Landa, Director of the Center for Autism & Related Disorders at Kennedy Krieger. Landa has discovered that some babies begin to show risk factors for autism as early as 14 months of age. Her work also focuses on developing early intervention models for toddlers with autism that help to improve a child’s <b>social,</b> <b>language,</b> and cognitive skills.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to analyze the ways that three African-American women from one rural {{community}} in the southern U. S. interrogate <b>social</b> <b>languages</b> constructed around teenage pregnancy, which are influential in the construction of public health policies targeting young women said to be “at risk” for this social problem. While the research literature acknowledges that young Black women may be aware of these <b>social</b> <b>languages,</b> my research question asks if and how they construct their identities accordingly. This paper first looks at the ways that teenage motherhood is constructed as a social problem in the research literature—according to particular “social languages. ” I then look at the way that three women position themselves within their community according to various <b>social</b> <b>languages</b> on teen motherhood. In particular, through narrative analysis I look at how the participants refer to these <b>social</b> <b>languages</b> to position themselves as certain kinds of women in their community...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{results show}} that there is often no {{identity}} between the meaning of expressions used by students in expressing their understanding of subject matter and the meaning of those expressions in collectively shared meaning systems, <b>social</b> <b>languages</b> or discourses, and especially not the meaning system represented by the subject matter theory expected to be learned. There is also often a lack of identity of meaning between the same students’ use of the same expressions from one use of an expression to another, in very similar contexts. This lack of identity depends on that the expressions in use form part of more extensive expressions and get their meaning as parts of these wholes. This variation in meaning is very central to the phenomena of teaching and learning. In educational research, problems of meaning {{have to be dealt with}} without assuming identity between meanings used in expressing understanding of subject matter and concepts and meanings in cognitive systems or <b>social</b> <b>languages.</b> There is a need to differentiate between specific meanings expressed in conceptualising subject-matter content and concepts and meanings seen as parts of cognitive systems and <b>social</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R

50|$|From {{early on}} Helsinki slang was {{especially}} {{the language of}} the youth. It could be thought as a <b>social</b> <b>language</b> code, by which the multicultural and multilingual working class youth, a speech community, formed their own sociolect. The initiative for this grew at first from their needs of basic everyday communication, but soon slangi probably came to signify a certain social status as well. Johannes Kauhanen notes on his slang history page that the first speakers of Helsinki slang were probably not the countryside-born agriculturists who moved to work in Helsinki, but their children.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Two themes {{important}} to English language studies form {{the background to}} this chapter. The first is language variety and the sheer plurality and diversity of "Englishes" (e. g. Widdowson 1997). The second is the empirical reality of the "multilingual internet" (Daner and Herring 2007 : 3) {{and the fact that}} many millions of non-native English-speakers are active participants in online cultural affinities within English-dominant contexts. Specifically, we focus here on the idea that proficiency in <b>social</b> <b>languages</b> is central to realizing and enacting shared knowledge, values and expectations for online communication within spaces of popular cultural affinity. Focusing on <b>social</b> <b>languages</b> expands conventional views of what counts as "English" within digital literacy practices. We consider examples from the growing corpus of work that documents in rich detail diverse cases of language in use by non-native language speakers within online social practices...|$|R

50|$|Basil Bernstein {{also studied}} what he named the 'elaborated code' {{explaining}} {{that in this}} type of speech pattern the middle and upper classes use this language style to gain access to education and career advancement. Bonds within this social group are not as well defined and people achieve their social identity largely on the basis of individual disposition and temperament. There is no obvious division of tasks according to sex or age and generally, within this social formation members negotiate and achieve their roles, rather than have them there ready-made in advance. Due to the lack of solidarity the elaborated <b>social</b> <b>language</b> code requires individual intentions and viewpoints to be made explicit as the 'I' has a greater emphasis with this social group than the working class.|$|E
50|$|In Basil Bernstein's theory, the {{restricted}} code {{was an example}} of the speech patterns used by the working class. He stated that this type of code allows strong bonds between group members, who tend to behave largely on the basis of distinctions such as 'male', 'female', 'older', and 'younger'. This social group also uses language in a way that brings unity between people, and members often {{do not need to be}} explicit about meaning, as their shared knowledge and common understanding often bring them together in a way that other <b>social</b> <b>language</b> groups do not experience. The difference with {{the restricted}} code is the emphasis on 'we' as a social group, which fosters greater solidarity than an emphasis on 'I'.|$|E
50|$|Konkani {{was in a}} sorry state, due {{to the use of}} Portuguese as the {{official}} and <b>social</b> <b>language</b> among the Christians, the predominance of Marathi over Konkani among Hindus, and the Konkani Christian-Hindu divide. Seeing this, Vaman Raghunath Varde Valaulikar set about on a mission to unite all Konkanis, Hindus as well as Christians, regardless of caste or religion. He saw this movement not just as a nationalistic movement against Portuguese rule, but also against the pre-eminence of Marathi over Konkani. Almost single-handedly he crusaded, writing a number of works in Konkani. He is regarded as the pioneer of modern Konkani literature and affectionately remembered as Shenoi Goembab. His death anniversary, 9 April, is celebrated as World Konkani Day (Vishwa Konkani Dis).|$|E

50|$|In education, social {{practice}} {{refers to}} the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others. Under social practice, literacy is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda. In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through <b>social</b> <b>language</b> and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and numeracy are complex capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of <b>social,</b> <b>language,</b> {{religious and cultural}} oppressions had led to destructive popular uprisings of the middle of 17th century, which the Polish-Lithuanian state could not recover from. In many territories incorporated into the Russian empire in 1772-1795 after the partitions, the domination of the Polish aristocracy was kept, in the territories incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian empire, the domination of the Polish aristocracy has been added with active planting of German language and culture. During the First World War Austro-Hungarian authorities undertook reprisals against Russia-oriented people of the Eastern Galicia and the Polish left-nationalist movement led by Piłsudski got {{the support of the}} Central Powers for struggle against Russia. In the consequence of the revolution in Russia and the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg empires in the end of World War I Poland regained independence.

5000|$|Two-Way or Dual Language Immersion Bilingual Education. These {{programs}} {{are designed to}} help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language [...] This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade. The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas & Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area. This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as <b>social</b> <b>language</b> can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987).|$|E
