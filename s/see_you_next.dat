2500|$|During 2008, Aeon {{started to}} work on the next studio album. In January 2009, the band toured in Europe with Hate Eternal, Misery Index and <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Next</b> Tuesday. In September, Carlberg {{departed}} and was replaced by Victor Brandt of Satyricon. The members commented Carlberg's departure: [...] "Being on tour in a not-so-known death metal band like Aeon often means really tough conditions and bad economy. We totally understand that not everyone can put up with this way of life." [...] The band subsequently recorded its third studio album, Path of Fire, at Empire Studio in Östersund, Sweden. Nilsson and Dlimi recorded also the bass, because Brandt did not have enough time to learn the songs. The album was mixed the following month at Mana Recording Studios in St, Petersburg, Florida by Erik Rutan. In January 2010, Brandt departed and was replaced by Marcus Edvardsson of Souldrainer and Sanctification.|$|E
