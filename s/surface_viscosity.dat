50|$|Foam hydrodynamics {{as well as}} many of the {{variables}} that affect on the success of foaming have limited understanding. This complicates using mathematical calculations to predict protein recovery by foaming. However some trends have been determined; high recovery rates have been linked to high concentrations of protein in the initial solution, high gas flow rates, and high feed flow rates. Enrichment is also known to increase when foaming is performed using shallow pools. Using pools with low heights allows for only a small amount of protein to adsorb from the solution {{to the surface of the}} bubbles in the foam resulting in lower <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity.</b> This leads to coalescence of the unstable foam higher up in the column causing an increase in the bubble size and an increase in the reflux of the protein in the foam. However, an increased velocity of the gas being pumped into the system has been shown to lead to a decrease in the enrichment ratio. Since these calculations are difficult to predict, bench and then pilot scale experiments are often performed in order to determine if foaming is a viable technique for extraction on an industrial scale.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> on the Marangoni-Bénard Instabilities (MBI) when heating from top, layers of aqueous solutions of long chain alcohols (C 7 - Cl 0 - C 12). These solutions have surface tension variations with temperature which presents a minimum. We worked at temperature for which the temperature coefficient of surface tension is positive. The linear stability analysis performed leads to the definition of. a modified critical Marangoni number in which the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> appears. We have measured the surface tension and the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> of these solutions. By heating from the top, we observed Marangoni Bénard convection in heptanol and decanol. For the dodecanol solution, no convection has been detected due to <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> effect. For increasing values of the imposed heat flux at the lower plate, at the onset of convection, we observed an abrupt decrease of the resulting temperature difference. This is explained by the existence of an inverse bifurcation at the critical point. This demonstrates the important role played by the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> in the Marangoni-Bénard instability problem. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Foam and {{emulsion}} stability {{has long}} been believed to correlate with the <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> of the surfactant used to stabilize them. Many subtleties arise in interpreting <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> measurements, however, and correlations do not necessarily indicate causation. Using a sensitive technique designed to excite purely surface shear deformations, we make the most sensitive and precise measurements to date of the <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> {{of a variety of}} soluble surfactants, focusing on SDS in particular. Our measurements reveal the <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> of SDS to be below the sensitivity limit of our technique, giving an upper bound of order 0. 01 μN·s/m. This conflicts directly with almost all previous studies,which reported values up to 103 - 104 times higher. Multiple control and complementary measurements confirm this result, including direct visualization of monolayer deformation, for SDS and a wide variety of soluble polymeric, ionic, and nonionic surfactants of high- and low-foaming character. No soluble, small-molecule surfactant was found to have a measurable <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity,</b> which seriously undermines most support for any correlation between foam stability and surface shear rheology of soluble surfactants...|$|R

40|$|A fluid {{mechanics}} problem relevant to foam fractionation processes is analysed. Specifically the fluid flow field transporting surfactant from foam Plateau borders (fed with surfactant-rich material) towards comparatively surfactant-lean foam films is considered. The {{extent to which}} this surfactant mass transfer is limited by surface viscous effects is studied. Previous work (Vitasari et al., 2015) made assumptions about the likely flow field along the Plateau border surface. These assumptions suggested that ‘high’ <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> (measured by a suitable dimensionless parameter) led to strong suppression of the rate of surfactant mass transfer from Plateau border to film, whereas ‘low’ <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> did not suppress this mass transfer rate in any significant way. More detailed fluid mechanical calculations which are carried out here corroborate the aforementioned assumptions in the ‘high’ <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> regime. However the calculations suggest that in the ‘low’ <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> regime, {{in contrast to the}} findings from the previous assumptions, moderate reductions in the rate of surfactant mass transfer are also possible. Counterintuitively these moderate reductions in mass transfer rate potentially have more negative impact on fractionation processes than the aforementioned strong suppression. This is because they tend to arise under conditions for which the efficiency of the fractionation system is particularly sensitive to any reduction whatsoever in the surfactant mass transfer rate...|$|E

40|$|When a fluid {{interface}} with surfactants is at rest, the interfacial stress is isotropic (as {{given by the}} equilibrium interfacial tension), and is described by the equation of state which relates the surface tension to the surfactant surface concentration. When surfactants are subjected to shear and dilatational flows, flow induced interaction of the surfactants; can create interfacial stresses apart from the equilibrium surface tension. The simplest relationship between surface strain rate and surface stress is the Boussinesq-Scriven constitutive equation completely characterized by three coefficients: equilibrium interfacial tension, <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity,</b> and <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>viscosity</b> Equilibrium interfacial tension and <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> measurements are very well established. On the other hand, <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>viscosity</b> measurements are difficult because a flow which change the surface area also changes the surfactant surface concentration creating changes in the equilibrium interfacial tension that must be also taken into account. <b>Surface</b> dilatational <b>viscosity</b> measurements of existing techniques differ by five orders of magnitude and use spatially damped surface waves and rapidly expanding bubbles. In this presentation we introduce a new technique for measuring the <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>viscosity</b> by contracting an aqueous pendant drop attached to a needle tip and having and insoluble surfactant monolayer at the air-water interface. The isotropic total tension on the surface consists of the equilibrium surface tension and the tension due to the dilation. Compression rates are undertaken slow enough so that bulk hydrodynamic stresses are small compared to the surface tension force. Under these conditions we show that the total tension is uniform along the surface and that the Young-Laplace equation governs the drop shape with the equilibrium surface tension replaced by the constant surface isotropic stress. We illustrate this technique using DPPC as the insoluble surfacant monolayer and measured for it a <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>viscosity</b> in the LE phase that is 20 surface poise...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{so-called}} ‘forced drainage’ {{has been extensively}} used to characterise the steady one-dimensional drainage of gas–liquid foams. In this paper, it is shown that the liquid drainage rate is approximately independent of <b>surface</b> dilational <b>viscosity</b> and <b>surface</b> tension (insofar as it creates capillary suction). However, liquid drainage rate is dependent on <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> and Marangoni stresses. For transient foam drainage, an independence upon <b>surface</b> dilational <b>viscosity</b> is not demonstrated. Previously reported forced drainage data have been described in a dimensionally consistent form so that different studies can be directly compared with one another, and this has revealed two curious anomalies in the data, {{some of which may}} be due to previously reported, but generally overlooked, multi-dimensional effects in forced drainage experiment...|$|R

40|$|Surfactant {{transport}} onto a {{foam film}} {{in the presence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> has been simulated as a model for processes occurring during foam fractionation with reflux. A boundary condition is specified determining the velocity {{at the end of the}} film where it joins up with a Plateau border containing surfactant rich reflux material. The evolutions of surface velocity and surfactant surface concentration on the film are computed numerically using a finite difference method coupled with the material point method. Results are analysed both for low and high surface viscosities. Evolution is comparatively rapid when <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> is low, but the larger the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> becomes, the slower the surface flow, and the lower the surfactant surface concentration on the film at any given time. For a large <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity,</b> the surface concentration of surfactant is maintained nearly uniform except at positions near the Plateau border where the velocity and surfactant concentration fields need to adjust to satisfy the boundary condition at the end of the film. The boundary condition imposed at the end of the film implies also that a drier foam (i. e. smaller radius of curvature of the Plateau border) leads to less surfactant transport onto the films. Moreover, the shorter the film length is, also the shorter the characteristic time for surfactant transport onto the film surface. Thinner films however give longer characteristic times for surfactant transport...|$|E
