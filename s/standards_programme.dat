40|$|Objectives: We {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Gold <b>Standard</b> <b>Programme</b> (a comprehensive smoking cessation intervention commonly used in Denmark) with other face-to-face smoking cessation programmes in Denmark after implementation in real life, and we identified factors associated with successful quitting. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: A total of 423 smoking cessation clinics from different settings reported data from 2001 to 2013. Participants: In total, 82 515 patients were registered. Smokers ≥ 15 years old and attending a programme with planned follow-up were included. Smokers who did not want further contact, who intentionally were not followed up or who lacked information about the intervention they received were excluded. A total of 46 287 smokers were included. Interventions: Various real-life smoking cessation interventions were identified and compared: The Gold <b>Standard</b> <b>Programme,</b> Come & Quit, crash courses, health promotion counselling (brief intervention) and other interventions. Main outcome: Self-reported continuous abstinence for 6 months. Results: Overall, 33 % (11 184) were continuously abstinent after 6 months; this value was 24 % when non-respondents were considered smokers. The follow-up rate was 74 %. Women were less likely to remain abstinent, OR 0. 83 (CI 0. 79 to 0. 87). Short interventions were more effective among men. After adjusting for confounders, the Gold <b>Standard</b> <b>Programme</b> was the only intervention with significant results across sex, increasing the odds of abstinence by 69 % for men and 31 % for women. In particular, compliance, and to a lesser degree, mild smoking, older age and not being disadvantaged were associated with positive outcomes for both sexes. Compliance increased the odds of abstinence more than 3. 5 -fold. Conclusions: Over time, Danish smoking cessation interventions have been effective in real life. Compliance is the main predictor of successful quitting. Interestingly, short programmes seem to have relatively strong effects among men, but the absolute numbers are very small. Only the comprehensive Gold <b>Standard</b> <b>Programme</b> works across sexes...|$|R

40|$|UK {{accounting}} practice differs from International Accounting Standards (IASs) {{particularly with regard}} to amortisation of goodwill, provision for deferred taxation and the accounting treatment of pension costs. Under the core <b>standards</b> <b>programme</b> of the IASC the IASs have emerged closer to US practice. This paper evaluates the profit of those UK companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1988 and 1994, spanning a period which saw the establishment of the ASB and the implementation of the IASC's comparability project. An increasing gap was found between the reported profit under UK accounting principles and that restated under US GAAP. The difference lay most frequently in accounting for goodwill, provision for deferred tax, and the accounting treatment of pension costs, with accounting for goodwill showing a particularly significant impact in 1994. Notwithstanding the introduction of FRS 10, an overall impression of increasing disharmony could continue to cause reconciliations to be required of UK companies seeking full listing on a US stock exchange, with consequent disadvantage relative to companies in other European countries seeking international capital in the US...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{development}} of the first genetically engineered (GE) plants and animals for agriculture almost 25 years ago (Hammer et al. 1985; Vaeck et al. 1987), there has been a debate amongst and between scientists, regulators, and activists opposed to the introduction and use of such plants and animals in agriculture. It seems that the debate often focuses on GE as a technique that is used in isolation, rather than one tool in the realm of selective breeding that is used in conjunction with other approaches such as nutritional management, veterinary care, and animal management to solve problems. The ongoing debate has shaped international policy, resulted in numerous reviews (e. g. Wall et al. 2009), reports (e. g. FAO/ WHO Expert Consultation 2004; Royal Society 2001; NRC 2002, 2004), and regulations by national and international bodies (FAO/WHO Food <b>standards</b> <b>programme</b> codex alimentarius commission 2008; FDA-CVM 2009), and delayed the introduction of GE animals into agriculture.

40|$|In 1996, {{the first}} European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) minimum <b>standards</b> <b>programme</b> in {{nephrology}} was published. Since then, medical practice in an expanded European Union (EU) has evolved significantly. These changes have prompted the UEMS Nephrology Section to update and review the programme on harmonization of nephrology {{training in the}} EU. Although direc-tives of the EU indicate that a specialist from one EU member state must be recognized in all EU member states, the current practical implications of these directives are limited due to the impor-tant existing differences in the EU member states ’ training programmes. Although not exhaus-tive, the present document aims to profile a minimum common framework of nephrology training in the EU for both trainers and higher-specialty trainees. The nephrology programme addresses several topics, among them enrolment requirements, duration and organization of the training and {{a detailed description of}} the knowledge, competences, practical skills and attitudes necessary to become a specialist in nephrology.

40|$|The European Commission {{has long}} been {{concerned}} over the extensive disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in form 20 -F. As the IASC moves towards completing its core <b>standards</b> <b>programme</b> {{to the satisfaction of}} IOSCO, the debate has centred around the likelihood of its acceptance by the SEC. This paper examines aspects of the reconciliations to US GAAP, provided by UK registrant companies, and proposes an approach of selective disclosure focusing on material items. We find that goodwill was the dominant adjustment prior to the implementation of FRS 10. When goodwill is excluded there were on average 4. 9 adjustments to net income and 5. 8 adjustments to shareholders' equity per company reporting. Defining materiality as 10 % or more of the reported US net income or shareholders' equity and disregarding immaterial items reduces these to an average of only 1. 6 adjustments to the income statement and 0. 6 adjustments to shareholders' equity per company. We find that the majority of adjusting items in the reconciliations are not material, adding weight to arguments opposed to the reconciliation requirements. We consider the possibility of a more focused disclosure requirement for foreign companies reporting to the SEC. ...|$|E
40|$|Medical doctors {{constitute}} a profession which embraces trust from and accountability to society. This responsibility extends to all medical educational institutions. Social accountability of medical education means a willingness {{and ability to}} adjust to the needs of patients and health care systems both nationally and globally. But it also implies a responsibility to {{contribute to the development of}} medicine and society through fostering competence for research and improvement. Accreditation is a process by which a statutory body evaluates and recognises an educational institution and/or its programme with respect to meeting approved criteria. It is a means for quality assurance, but also a strong power to reinforce the need for improvement and reforms. It must be performed through internationally recognised and transparent standards and should foremost promote quality development. The social accountability of medical education must be included in all accreditation processes at all levels. The global <b>standards</b> <b>programme</b> by World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) provides tools for national or regional accreditation but also guidance for reforms and quality improvement. The standards are used worldwide and have been adopted to local needs in most parts of the world. They are framed to specify attainment at two levels: basic standards or minimum requirements and standards for quality development. The concept of social accountability is embedded in all parts of the WFME standards documents. In 2011, a revision of the standards for undergraduate education has been instituted. Strengthening of aspects on social accountability of medical education will be a particular concern...|$|E
