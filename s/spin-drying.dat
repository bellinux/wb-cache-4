40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to lower benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) {{contents}} in sesame seed oil (SSO) during manufacture by using a self-designed apparatus, to determine its optimal conditions, and to analyze antioxidants in SSO which might be related to BaP content reduction. Washing and <b>spin-drying</b> steps reduce exogenous BaP contamination, and the reduced moisture in seeds lowered BaP content in final SSO. A ventilation system in the roasting step inhibits BaP formation and reabsorption, followed by a controlled compression step. The optimal condition, a single washing cycle with 2 -min <b>spin-drying,</b> 1350 -rpm ventilation, and a single compression cycle, reduced the BaP content in SSO to 2. 93 μg/kg, where the raw seeds had been spiked with 10 -μg/kg BaP. Total phenolic contents showed a reversal pattern to the distribution of BaP contents. Sesamol and sesamolin were quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector, and it was suggested that sesamol which is a strong antioxidant might have prevented BaP formation during the roasting step. This study enabled the commercial production of low-BaP SSO, and the data could be used in further investigations of the BaP content reduction mechanism with quantitative chemical analysis of the SSO composition...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spin-dry</b> effectiveness: Front-loaders (and European {{horizontal}} axis top loaders) offer much higher maximum spin speeds {{of up to}} 2000 RPM, although home machines tend {{to be in the}} 1000 to 1400 RPM range, while top-loaders (with agitators) do not exceed 1140 RPM. High-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate (instead of an agitator) can spin up to 1100 RPM, as their center of gravity is lower. Higher spin speeds, along with the diameter of the drum, determine the g-force, and a higher g-force removes more residual water, making clothes dry faster.

40|$|Auto-{{balancing}} or {{active control}} balancing can be efficient solutions for high speed rotors with changing out-of-balance loads like washing machines in <b>spin-drying</b> mode. In the LoWash EU project, Vibratec {{is in charge}} to design, to build and to validate a balancing system for reducing the vibrations at high <b>spin-drying</b> speeds. The system is based on two trolleys rolling in a ring linked to the drum. The trolley shape allows a ring cross section optimization and they are equipped with a mechanism for escaping the disadvantage encountered at low speeds by similar devices. Analytical and multi-body models are first made for understanding the mechanisms, highlighting the driving parameters and drawing the final design of a first prototype which is inserted in a washing machine drum. Different tests are carried out for different initial unbalances and different rotation speeds: the residual unbalance is measured {{by means of a}} set of accelerometers mounted on the tub, while the mobile masses behaviour is observed by means of a large aperture swift camera. The test results highlight the auto-balancer high efficiency but also the sensitivity to geometrical defects which should be corrected in the next systems. According the theory, the balancing is efficient when the rotation frequency is significantly greater than the hanging frequencies. The multi-body model relevance is also demonstrated.

The vibration of the washing machine is mainly due to the unbalanced mass of clothes distributed in the washing drum.

This analysis includes processes such as centrifugation and drying and physical effects due to membrane fragment steric interactions, finite size, elasticity, and thermal fluctuations.

The predictions of a smectic A model agree quantitatively with the measured spatial dependence of the fluctuations in layer orientation in a multilamellar arrays. A new technique, {{based in part on}} this analysis, for the preparation of well-oriented multilamellar arrays of natural and artificial membranes, isopotential <b>spin-dry</b> centrifugation, is described.

50|$|A {{recently}} developed OPV {{system based on}} tetrabenzoporphryin (BP) and either 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is explained in detail as follows. In this study, the precursor to BP (1,4:8,11:15,18:22,25-tetraethano-29H,31H-tetrabenzob,g,l,qporphyrin (CP) solution is applied as the starting film, and was thermally annealed which caused the CP to convert into BP. The BP:fullerene layer serves as the undoped layer within the device. For surface measurements, the undoped layer is rinsed with {{a few drops of}} chloroform and <b>spin-dried</b> until the BP network is exposed at the donor/acceptor interface. For bulk heterojunction characterization, an additional fullerene solution is spin-coated onto the undoped layer, a thin layer of lithium fluoride is then deposited followed by either an aluminum or gold cathode which is thermally annealed to the device. The thin layer of lithium fluoride is deposited to help prevent the oxidation of the device. Controlling the thickness of these layers plays {{a significant role in the}} generation of the efficiency of the PV cells. Typically, the thickness of the active layers is usually smaller than 100 nm to produce photocurrents. This dependence on layer thickness is due to the probability that an electron is able to travel distances on the order of exciton diffusion length within the applied electric field. It should be noted that many of the organic semiconductors used in the PV devices are sensitive to water and oxygen. This is due to the likelihood of photo-oxidation which can occur when exposed to these conditions. While the top metal contact can prevent some of this, many studies are either performed in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, or under ultra-high vacuum (UHV).|$|R
40|$|AbstractLong-term {{storage of}} {{desiccated}} nucleated mammalian cells {{at ambient temperature}} may be accomplished in a stable glassy state, which {{can be achieved by}} removal of water from the biological sample in the presence of glass-forming agents including trehalose. The stability of the glass may be compromised due to a nonuniform distribution of residual water and trehalose within and around the desiccated cells. Thus, quantification of water and trehalose contents at the single-cell level is critical for predicting the glass formation and stability for dry storage. Using Raman microspectroscopy, we estimated the trehalose and residual water contents in the microenvironment of spin-dried cells. Individual cells with or without intracellular trehalose were embedded in a solid thin layer of extracellular trehalose after <b>spin-drying.</b> We found strong evidence suggesting that the residual water was bound at a 2 : 1 water/trehalose molar ratio in both the extracellular and intracellular milieus. Other than the water associated with trehalose, we did not find any more residual water in the spin-dried sample, intra- or extracellularly. The extracellular trehalose film exhibited characteristics of an amorphous state with a glass transition temperature of ∼ 22 °C. The intracellular milieu also dried to levels suitable for glass formation at room temperature. These findings demonstrate a method for quantification of water and trehalose in desiccated specimens using confocal Raman microspectroscopy. This approach has broad use in desiccation studies to carefully investigate the relationship of water and trehalose content and distribution with the tolerance to drying in mammalian cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{washing machine}} {{is a well}} known home {{appliance}} which is used at least weekly, in some cases daily, by almost every family. The importance of the task the machine performs combined with the variety of available machines has made competition between manufacturers harder and harder. Among the strongest drive forces {{in the field of}} washing machine development are the capacity increase together with reduction of energy consumption. Since the first machines with <b>spin-drying</b> ability the washing machine has had a reputation of being noisy and causing vibrations. A soft suspension improves the vibration isolation and reduces the vibration output, but the severity of the vibration problem can be increased with the bigger tub volume that a machine with higher capacity demands. As the same outer standard dimensions of the machine housing must be preserved, a stiffer suspension might be needed to keep the tub from hitting the housing at when passing the critical spin speed. Hence there are conflicting criterias to be dealt with. This paper focuses on several aspects of vibration dynamics in washing machines: the capacity maximization through the study of tub movement, the vibration output from the machine to the surroundings, and the “walking” tendency of the system. A computational model of a washing machine with bottom mount suspension has been built in Adams/View from MSC. Software, based on production drawings. Experimental data was used for validation of mathematical and computational models of functional components of the system {{as well as for the}} model of the complete washing machine. The models of the functional components have been parameterized and are used for suspension optimization in a computer cluster. Three objective functions related to kinematics and dynamics of washing machines have been defined and a numerical algorithm has been created to solve Pareto optimization problems. The algorithm is a genetic algorithm built around Matlab’s subroutine “gamultiobj. m” and executed on an in-house developed computer cluster with possibility of parallel computing of Adams/View models. The results are presented as optimized parameter values of suspension functional components, in this case bushings with respective Pareto fronts. The focus has been set on delivering couplings between parameter values and performance trade-offs in terms of objective functions to facilitate parameter tuning. The obtained optimization results have successively been used in the development of a novel washing machine which will go into production after the summer 2010...|$|E
30|$|A two-step deep {{reactive}} {{ion etching}} (DRIE) was performed to achieve a microreactor chip containing a picoinjector based on a 1 D nanochannel. The first step of DRIE was conducted to fabricate the 1 D nanochannel junction for liquid delivery. Then, the second step of DRIE was conducted to form microchannels for the chemical reaction. Conventional photolithography and photoresist stripping processes were employed to construct channels with the desired depth. A silicon (Si) wafer was cleaned in H 2 SO 4 :H 2 O 2 solution (volume ratio of 10 : 1) at 120 °C for 10 min, followed by deionized water (DI) for 4 cycles, then HF:H 2 O solution (1 : 50) at 22 °C for 1 min and DI water for 4 cycles, and finally <b>spin-dried</b> in hot N 2 gas for 15 min. Then, the Si wafer was processed by hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) coating and positive photoresist HPR 504 spin-coated at 4, 000 rpm for 30 s. The wafer was soft-baked on a hot plate at 110 °C for 60 s before exposing to UV via the Mask Aligner (SUSS Microtec MA 6 - 2, Garching Germany) for 5 s. The photoresist was developed using FHD- 5 for 60 s and post-baked on a hot plate at 120 °C for 60 s. The micropatterns were successfully defined at this stage. The Si wafer was then etched by a DRIE machine (Surface Technology Systems, Newport, UK) and followed by photoresist stripping in PS 210 Photoresist Asher (PVA Tepla AG, Kirchheim, Germany) for 25 min. After constructing the microchannels, 10 nm of thermal oxide was grown using a diffusion furnace to form silica on the channel wall.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGramicidin A was {{studied by}} {{continuous}} wave {{electron spin resonance}} (CW-ESR) and by double-quantum coherence electron spin resonance (DQC-ESR) in several lipid membranes (using samples that were macroscopically aligned by isopotential <b>spin-dry</b> ultracentrifugation) and vesicles. As a reporter group, the nitroxide spin-label was attached at the C-terminus yielding the spin-labeled product (GAsl). ESR spectra of aligned membranes containing GAsl show strong orientation dependence. In DPPC and DSPC membranes at room temperature the spectral shape is consistent with high ordering, which, {{in conjunction with the}} observed high polarity of the environment of the nitroxide, is interpreted in terms of the nitroxide moiety being close to the membrane surface. In contrast, spectra of GAsl in DMPC membranes indicate deeper embedding and tilt of the NO group. The GAsl spectrum in the DPPC membrane at 35 °C (the gel to Pβ phase transition) exhibits sharp changes, and above this temperature becomes similar to that of DMPC. The dipolar spectrum from DQC-ESR clearly indicates the presence of pairs in DMPC membranes. This is not the case for DPPC, rapidly frozen from the gel phase; however, there are hints of aggregation. The interspin distance in the pairs is 30. 9 Å, in good agreement with estimates for the head-to-head GAsl dimer (the channel-forming conformation), which matches the hydrophobic thickness of the DMPC bilayer. Both DPPC and DSPC, apparently as a result of hydrophobic mismatch between the dimer length and bilayer thickness, do not favor the channel formation in the gel phase. In the Pβ and Lα phases of DPPC (above 35 °C) the channel dimer forms, as evidenced by the DQC-ESR dipolar spectrum after rapid freezing. It is associated with a lateral expansion of lipid molecules and a concomitant decrease in bilayer thickness, which reduces the hydrophobic mismatch. A comparison with studies of dimer formation by other physical techniques indicates the desirability of using low concentrations of GA (∼ 0. 4 – 1 mol %) accessible to the ESR methods employed in the study, since this yields non-interacting dimer channels...|$|R
40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} (ESR) {{studies have}} been performed on spin-labeled model membranes aligned using the isopotential <b>spin-dry</b> ultracentrifugation (ISDU) method of Clark and Rothschild. This method relies on sedimentation of the membrane fragments onto a gravitational isopotential surface with simultaneous evaporation of the solvent in a vacuum ultracentrifuge to promote alignment. The degree of alignment obtainable using ISDU, as monitored by ESR measurements of molecular ordering for both lipid (16 -PC) and cholestane spin labels (CSL), in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) model membranes compares favorably with that obtainable by pressure-annealing. The much gentler conditions under which membranes may be aligned by ISDU greatly extends the range of macroscopically aligned membrane samples that may be investigated by ESR. We report the first ESR study of an integral membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin (BR) in well-aligned multilayers. We have also examined ISDU-aligned DPPC multilayers incorporating a short peptide gramicidin A' (GA), with higher water content than previously studied. 0. 24 mol% BR/DPPC membranes with CSL probe show two distinct components, primarily in the gel phase, which {{can be attributed to}} bulk and boundary regions of the bilayer. The boundary regions show sharply decreased molecular ordering and spectral effects comparable to those observed from 2 mol% GA/DPPC membranes. The boundary regions for both BR and GA also exhibit increased fluidity as monitored by the rotational diffusion rates. The high water content of the GA/DPPC membranes reduces the disordering effect as evidenced by the reduced populations of the disordered components. The ESR spectra obtained slightly below the main phase transition of DPPC from both the peptide- and protein-containing membranes reveals a new component with increased ordering of the lipids associated with the peptide or protein. This increase coincides with a broad endothermic peak in the DSC, suggesting a disaggregation of both the peptide and the protein before the main phase transition of the lipid. Detailed simulations of the multicomponent ESR spectra have been performed by the latest nonlinear least-squares methods, which have helped to clarify the spectral interpretations. It is found that the simulations of ESR spectra from CSL in the gel phase for all the lipid membranes studied could be significantly improved by utilizing a model with CSL molecules existing as both hydrogen-bonded to the bilayer interface and non-hydrogen-bonded within the bilayer...|$|R
40|$|The {{circular}} dichroism (CD) of {{cytochrome oxidase}} in solution indicates {{the presence of}} both alpha-helix (approximately 37 %) and B-sheet (approximately 18 %). In oriented films generated by the isopotential <b>spin-dry</b> method, the CD measured normal to the film shows a marked decrease in the negative bands at 222 and 208 nm, and a decrease and red shift in the positive band near 195 nm, relative to solution spectra. These features are characteristic of alpha-helices oriented with their helix axes along the direction of light propagation. A quantitative estimate of the orientation, based on {{the ratio of the}} rotational strengths of the 208 -nm band in the film and in solution, leads to an average angle between the helix axis and the normal to the film, phi alpha of approximately 39 degrees. A method for analyzing infrared (IR) linear dichroism is developed that can be applied to proteins with comparable amounts of alpha-helix and beta-sheet. From analysis of the amide I band, phi alpha is found to lie between 20 and 36 degrees, depending on the angle that the amide I transition moment forms with the helix axis. A survey of the literature on the amide I transition moment direction indicates that a value of approximately 27 degrees is appropriate for standard alpha-helical systems, such as those in cytochrome oxidase. A larger value, near 40 degrees, is reasonable for systems that have distorted alpha-helices, as evidenced by amide I frequencies above 1, 660 cm- 1, as is the case of bacteriorhodopsin. This conclusion supports phi alpha approximately 36 degrees from IR linear dichroism, in agreement with the CD results. Linear dichroism in the amide I and amide II region indicates that the beta-sheet in cytochrome oxidase is oriented with the carbonyl groups nearly parallel to the plane of the membrane and the chain direction inclined at approximately 40 degrees to the normal. Comparison of these results with tentative identification of transmembrane helices from sequence data suggests that either some of the transmembrane helices are inclined at an unexpectedly large angle to the normal, or the number of such helices has been overestimated. Some putative transmembrane helices may be beta-strands spanning the membrane...|$|R
