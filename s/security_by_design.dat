40|$|Abstract. The {{proliferation}} {{and growth of}} modern computer networks have made network management infrastructures {{an integral part of}} the administration process. Nevertheless, most of these do not have the notion of <b>security</b> assimilated <b>by</b> <b>design.</b> Thus, existing network equipment cannot be managed securely without additional hardware or software security modules.

This means that security requirements and privacy concerns are considered and analyzed {{from the very beginning}} of any system design. For a reliable and robust system architecture and specification we recommend a four-step approach: (1) Decompose the system and identify the assets on the basis of the multilateral security concept, i. e., taking all participants of an eHealth scenario as potential attackers into account; (2) evaluate threats based on STRIDE for a holistic and systematic modelling of threats; (3) define use case-specific security requirements and privacy concerns as well as their relevance; and (4) mitigate threats by deciding what countermeasures should be implemented.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the existence of}} a financial intermediary based on its advantage over firms in designing low market risk debt securities and high market risk equity securities when markets are incomplete. The firm’s ob-jective in the model is to choose a financial structure in order to maximize the value of its securities. Investors are either risk-neutral or risk-averse and require a premium for market risk. When markets are complete, the value of a firm’s securities is independent of how they are structured or sold. When markets are incomplete, firms can increase the total value of their <b>securities</b> <b>by</b> choosing the optimal mix of debt and equity, as shown by Allen and Gale (1988).

40|$|Both {{academia and}} {{industry}} advocate the <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>design</b> principle {{to stress the}} importance of dealing with security from the earliest stages in software development. Nevertheless, designers often have to resort to their own knowledge and experience to pro-actively identify and mitigate potential security problems. Moreover, research shows that correctly applying security solutions is a much more significant challenge for designers, rather than finding an adequate solution. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} techniques that ensure a correct application of a security design solution. The contribution of this paper is a model in which the security-relevant aspects of a design can be precisely expressed in an integrated manner, enabling thorough reasoning about these aspects. We illustrate this model with a sizeable model of a banking system and show how the precise semantics of this model enables the tool-supported construction of proofs about the correctness of the applied design solutions. Our proposal thus enables designers to obtain stronger guarantees, ensuring the correctness of their solutions. The presented model can serve as the foundation for <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>design,</b> in time enabling automated security verification throughout the software development cycle. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|While {{traditional}} {{network security}} {{policies have been}} enforced by manual configuration of individual network components such as router ACLs, firewalls, NATs and VLANs, emerging enterprise network designs and products support global policies declared over high level abstractions [2, 1, 14, 13].

Our policy language, FSL, expresses basic network access controls, directionality in communication establishment (similar to NAT), network isolation (similar to VLANs), communication paths, and rate limits. FSL supports modular construction, distributed authorship, and efficient implementation. We have implemented FSL as the primary policy language for NOX, a network-wide control platform, and have deployed it within an operational network for over 10 months. We describe how supporting complex policy objectives and meeting the demanding performance requirements of network-wide policy enforcement have influenced the FSL language design and implementation. ...|$|R
40|$|A "security by design" method {{achieves}} robustness against programming {{errors and}} malicious attacks. A <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>design</b> method must be simple to understand. It must be simple to implement, {{and also to}} simple to verify. It must enable the developer to create assurance evidence coherent with the design decisions. MILS is a <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>design</b> method. In short, application of the MILS approach starts with partitioning the system under design into isolated compartments. System resources, e. g. CPUs, CPU time, memory, IO devices, files, are assigned to compartments. After that the communication channels between compartments are defined {{with respect to the}} required API (e. g. POSIX, ARINC, AUTOSAR). Communication and resource sharing between security domains have to be explicit, i. e. everything is forbidden what is not explicitly allowed. In parallel threat modeling is executed, i. e. define system assets to be protected, threat agents and possible malicious actions, system objectives to fight the threats. MILS provides a way to execute mixed-critical applications of different pedigrees on one system. The system as a whole still can be certified to the highest security and safety assurance levels. This makes the approach extremely interesting for modern complex systems, e. g. in a car infotainment system: Android applications can run on the same platform as AUTOSAR applications that communicate with the engine. Until ca. 2000 the MILS concept was mainly used in the US military. Now the commercial interest has picked up. We explain a MILS Architectural Template that simplifies to set up MILS systems. We finish with applications of the MILS concepts across automotive and avionics...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasingly}} pervasive role of software in society, security {{is becoming an}} important quality concern, emphasizing <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>design,</b> but it requires intensive specialization. Security in families of systems is even harder, as diverse variants of security solutions must be considered, with even different security goals per product. Furthermore, security is not a static object but a moving target, adding variability. For this, an approach to systematically address security concerns in software product lines is needed. It should consider security separate from other variability dimensions. The main challenges to realize this are: (i) expressing security and its variability, (ii) selecting the right solution, (iii) properly instantiating a solution, and (iv) verifying and validating it. In this paper, we present our research agenda towards addressing the aforementioned challenges. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{benchmarks}} {{that focus}} on performance or reliability evaluations, a benchmark for computer security must neces-sarily include sensitive code and data. Because these artifacts could damage systems or reveal personally identifiable infor-mation about the users affected by cyber attacks, publicly dis-seminating such a benchmark raises several scientific, ethical and legal challenges. We propose the Worldwide Intelligence Network Environment (WINE), a security-benchmarking ap-proach based on rigorous experimental methods. WINE in-cludes representative field data, collected worldwide from 240, 000 sensors, for new empirical studies, and it will enable the validation of research on all the phases in the lifecycle of security threats.

40|$|Application-level {{security}} {{has become an}} issue in recent years; for example, errors, discrepancies and omissions in the specification of access control constraints of security-sensitive software components are recognized as an important source for security vulnerabilities. We propose to formally specify access control assumptions or constraints of a program module and enforce them at run-time. We call such specifications access control contracts. To realize access control contracts, we extended the JML language, a formal interface specification language for Java, and developed a prototype support tool that translates access control contracts to runtime checks. The access control contract reduces the vulnerability that a security-sensitive module be exploited to compromise the overall security of a software system. It also facilitates practicing the principle of 2 ̆ 2 <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>design</b> 2 ̆ 2 by providing both a practical programming tool and a foundation for formally reasoning about security properties of program modules...|$|E
40|$|Policy-based {{management}} (PBM) is an adaptable {{security policy}} mechanism in information systems (IS) that confirm only authorised users can access resources. A few decades ago, the traditional PBM {{has focused on}} closed systems, where enforcement mechanisms are trusted by system administrators who define access control policies. Most of current work on the PBM systems focuses on designing a centralised policy decision point (PDP), the component that evaluates an access request against a policy and reports the decision back, which can have performance and resilience drawbacks. Performance and resilience are a major concern for applications in military, health and national security domains where the performance is desirable to increase situational awareness through collaboration and to decrease {{the length of the}} decision making cycle. The centralised PDP also represents a single point of failure. In case of the failure of the centralised PDP, all resources in the system may cease to function. The efficient distribution of enforcement mechanisms is therefore key in building large scale policy managed distributed systems. Moving from the traditional PBM systems to dynamic PBM systems supports dynamic adaptability of behaviour by changing policy without recoding or stopping the system. The SANTA history-based dynamic PBM system has a formal underpinning in Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) allowing for formal analysis and verification to take place. The main aim of the research to automatically distribute enforcement mechanisms in the distributed system in order to provide resilience against network failure whilst preserving efficiency of policy decision making. The policy formalisation is based on SANTA policy model to provide a high level of assurance. The contribution of this work addresses the challenge of performance, manageability and <b>security,</b> <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> a Decentralised PBM framework and a corresponding Distributed Enforcements Architecture (DENAR). The ability of enforcing static and dynamic security policies in DENAR is the prime research issue, which balances the desire to distribute systems for flexibility whilst maintaining sufficient security over operations. Our research developed mechanisms to improve the efficiency of the enforcement of security policy mechanisms and their resilience against network failures in distributed information systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is {{an examination of}} a possible link between emotional disturbance and reading disability {{in a group of}} one hundred teenagers enrolled in a special education Agency. A s part of the research, a set of curricular strategies aimed at reducing the emotional disturbance and remedying the reading disability were examined in terms of their effect on the lives of ten of the teenagers from the sample. This research was based in the naturalistic paradigm, taking care to respect the multiple realities and values which exerted their influence in shaping the policies, interactions and outcomes at the site. An important aspect of this research, fully consonant with the naturalistic paradigm, was its emergent design. The inquiry was initiated {{as a result of the}} working hypotheses formed by the candidate during his many years of sustained involvement on the site. A review of the literature served to confirm some of these hypotheses. The data, collected over a six-year period and consisting of archival material, test results and interviews with the main stakeholders at the site, served to shed further light on the question of the possible link between emotional disturbance and reading disability. The case studies of the teenagers from the sample emerged as a result of focusing on the impact of a set of specifically designed curricular strategies which were aimed at modifying their emotional disturbance and remedying their reading disability. An important insight gained from this inquiry is that emotional disturbance and reading disability are two facets of the same problem, namely, the deprivation of the fundamental human need for emotional security. T w o significant inferences drawn from this insight are that: (a) emotionally disturbed and reading disabled children can be helped only when measures are taken to ensure that their basic human need for emotional security is satisfied; and, (b) an educational institution can facilitate the satisfaction of a child 2 ̆ 7 s need for emotional <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> curricular strategies which serve to repair and maintain the key relationships in that child 2 ̆ 7 s life...|$|R
