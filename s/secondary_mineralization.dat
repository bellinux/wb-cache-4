40|$|The deep subseafloor {{crust is}} one of the few great frontiers of unknown biology on Earth and, still today, the notion of the deep {{biosphere}} is commonly based on the fossil record. Interpretation of palaeobiological information is thus central in the exploration of this hidden biosphere and, for each new discovery, criteria used to establish biogenicity are challenged and need careful consideration. In this paper networks of fossilized filamentous structures are for the first time described in open fractures of subseafloor basalts collected at the Emperor Seamounts, Pacific Ocean. These structures have been investigated with optical microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, X-ray powder diffraction as well as synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy, and interpreted as fossilized fungal mycelia. Morphological features such as hyphae, yeastlike growth and sclerotia were observed. The fossilized fungi are mineralized by montmorillonite, a process that probably began while the fungi were alive. It seems plausible that the fungi produced mucilaginous polysaccharides and/or extracellular polymeric substances that attracted minerals or clay particles, resulting in complete fossilization by montmorillonite. The findings are in agreement with previous observations of fossilized fungi in subseafloor basalts and establish fungi as regular inhabitants of such settings.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy's Albany Research Center is {{investigating}} mineral carbonation {{as a method}} of sequestering CO 2 from coal-fired-power plants. Magnesium-silicate minerals such as serpentine [Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4] and olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4) react with CO 2 to produce magnesite (MgCO 3), and the calcium-silicate mineral, wollastonite (CaSiO 3), reacts to form calcite (CaCO 3). It is possible to carry out these reactions either ex situ (above ground in a traditional chemical processing plant) or in situ (storage underground and subsequent reaction with the host rock to trap CO 2 as carbonate minerals). For ex situ mineral carbonation to be economically attractive, the reaction must proceed quickly to near completion. The reaction rate is accelerated by raising the activity of CO 2 in solution, heat (but not too much), reducing the particle size, high-intensity grinding to disrupt the crystal structure, and, in the case of serpentine, heat-treatment to remove the chemically bound water. All of these carry energy/economic penalties. An economic study illustrates the impact of mineral availability and process parameters on the cost of ex situ carbon sequestration. In situ carbonation offers economic advantages over ex situ processes, because no chemical plant is required. Knowledge gained from the ex situ work was applied to long-term experiments designed to simulate in situ CO 2 storage conditions. The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG), a multi-layered basaltic lava formation, has potentially favorable mineralogy (up to 25 % combined concentration of Ca, Fe 2 +, and Mg cations) for storage of CO 2. However, more information about the interaction of CO 2 with aquifers and the host rock is needed.

Thus, we study the effect of humic acid (HA) co-precipitation on Fh reduction and secondary mineral formation by the dissimilatory Fe(III) -reducing bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN 32. Despite similar crystal structure for all co-precipitates investigated, resembling 2 -line Fh, the presence of co-precipitated HA resulted in lower specific surface areas. In terms of reactivity, co-precipitated HA resulted in slower Fh bioreduction rates at low C/Fe ratios (i. e., C/Fe ≤ 0. 8), while high C/Fe ratios (i. e., C/Fe ≥ 1. 8) enhanced the extent of bioreduction compared to pure Fh. The co-precipitated HA also altered the <b>secondary</b> Fe <b>mineralization</b> pathway by inhibiting goethite formation, reducing the amount of magnetite formation, and increasing the formation of a green rust-like phase.

The Koongarra uranium deposit in the Alligator Rivers region of Australia is one of the best-studied natural analogue sites.

Magmatic and hydrothermal zircons were distinguished in albitized banded rhyolitic metatuffites (BRM) and in albitite on the basis of petrographical associations, mineralogical character and REE signature. Direct crystallization from zircon-saturated fluids is proposed for the formation of hydrothermal zircons in albitized BRM. In albitite, some zircons present dissolution-reprecipitation textures, probably related to a high fluid/rock ratio during alteration. Petrographical observations and geochemical data are inconsistent with a Zr contribution from hydrothermal fluids, but reflect the release of Zr stock from the pristine BRM (Zr> 300 ppm) during sodic metasomatism. Secondary ion mass spectometry (SISM) U-Pb analysis provides Ediacaran (569 ± 8 Ma) and Late Ordovician ages (449 ± 8 Ma) for magmatic and hydrothermal zircons respectively. Additionally, the hydrothermal zircon REE signatures, in particular the Ce and Eu anomalies, suggest that hydrothermal zircons grew in the presence of a hot, reduce hydrothermal fluid, and during mixing between this fluid and a cold, oxidized hydrothermal fluid.

Multiple S, Fe, and Ni isotope analyses were applied to test these competing models. Massive ores at Shangani Mine show mass-dependent fractionation of sulfur isotopes consistent with a mantle sulfur source, whereas S-isotope systematics of net-textured ore and disseminated ore in talcose serpentinite indicates mixing of magmatic and sedimentary sulfur sources, potentially via post-magmatic hydrothermal processes. A restricted range of strongly mass-independent Δ 33 S values in ore samples from Trojan Mine likely reflects high-temperature assimilation of sulfur from supracrustal rocks and later superimposed low-temperature hydrothermal remobilization. Iron isotope values for most Ni-bearing sulfides show a narrow range suggesting that, in contrast to sulfur, nearly all of iron was derived from an igneous source. Negative Ni isotope values also agree with derivation of Ni from ultramafic melt and a significant high-temperature fractionation of Ni isotopes. Fe isotope values of some samples from Shangani Mine are more fractionated than expected to occur in high-temperature magmatic systems, further suggesting that hydrothermal processes were involved in either low-grade ore formation (liberation of Ni from olivine by sulfur-bearing hydrothermal fluids) or remobilization of existing sulfides potentially inducing <b>secondary</b> Ni-sulfide <b>mineralization...</b>|$|R

At the Koongarra site <b>secondary</b> uranium <b>mineralization</b> and dispersed uranium, is present from the surface down to the base of weathering, some 25 meters deep. In the Koongarra uranium deposit, the transport processes have {{been going on for a}} few (1 - 3) million years, and during this period many climatological, hydrological and geological changes have taken place. Field data show that three layers can be distinguished in the Koongarra area: i) a top layer which is fully weathered, ii) an intermediate layer which is partially weathered (the transition zone) and iii) a lower layer which is unweathered. The groundwater velocities are largest in the transition zone which has been moving downward as the weathering process proceeds. The transport of uranium in the transition zone is simulated with the finite element code METROPOL. It has been adapted to account for the movement of the transition zone and to describe the dissolution of uranium in the orebody by a non-equilibrium relation. In the simulations a qualitatively reasonable agreement between calculated and measured soluble uranium concentration in the present transition zone is achieved. In this study was shown that over large timescales geologic processes may have a large impact on the transport of radionuclides; over large timescales, the movement of the transition zone will have a large impact on the uranium concentration distribution.

40|$|Iron (hydr) oxides {{not only}} serve as potent sorbents and {{repositories}} for nutrients and contaminants but {{also provide a}} terminal electron acceptor for microbial respiration. The microbial reduction of Fe (hydr) oxides and the subsequent secondary solid-phase transformations will, therefore, have a profound influence on the biogeochemical cycling of Fe as well as associated metals. Here we elucidate the pathways and mechanisms of <b>secondary</b> <b>mineralization</b> during dissimilatory iron reduction by a common iron-reducing bacterium, Shewanella putrefaciens (strain CN 32), of 2 -line ferrihydrite under advective flow conditions. <b>Secondary</b> <b>mineralization</b> of ferrihydrite occurs via a coupled, biotic-abiotic pathway primarily resulting {{in the production of}} magnetite and goethite with minor amounts of green rust. Operating mineralization pathways are driven by competing abiotic reactions of bacterially generated ferrous iron with the ferrihydrite surface. Subsequent to the initial sorption of ferrous iron on ferrihydrite, goethite (via dissolution/reprecipitation) and/or magnetite (via solid-state conversion) precipitation ensues resulting in the spatial coupling of both goethite and magnetite with the ferrihydrite surface. The distribution of goethite and magnetite within the column is dictated, in large part, by flow-induced ferrous Fe profiles. While goethite precipitation occurs over a large Fe(II) concentration range, magnetite accumulation is only observed at concentrations exceeding 0. 3 mmol/L (equivalent to 0. 5 mmol Fe[II]/g ferrihydrite) following 16 d of reaction. Consequently, transportregulated ferrous Fe profiles result in a progression of magnetite levels downgradient within the column. Declining microbial reduction over time results in lower Fe(II) concentrations and a subsequent shift in magnetite precipitation mechanisms from nucleation to crystal growth. While the initial precipitation rate of goethite exceeds that of magnetite, continued growth is inhibited by magnetite formation, potentially a result of lower Fe(III) activity. Conversely, the presence of lower initial Fe(II) concentrations followed by higher concentrations promotes goethite accumulation and inhibits magnetite precipitation even when Fe(II) concentrations later increase, thus revealing the importance of both the rate of Fe(II) generation and flow-induced Fe(II) profiles. As such, the operating <b>secondary</b> <b>mineralization</b> pathways following reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite at a given pH are governed principally by flow-regulated Fe(II) concentration, which drives mineral precipitation kinetics and selection of competing mineral pathways...|$|E

40|$|Rats Nest Cave is a Provincial Historic Site whose {{mandate is}} to present its natural history to the public. In {{addition}} to a suite of interpretive messages, and relevant to this conference’s topic, we have addressed diverse climate change over the geological history of the cave. We start with the cave-hosting rock and the fossils it contains, to its origin along a thrust fault, ending with its enlargement and <b>secondary</b> <b>mineralization</b> during the Quaternary glaciations (the latter having been dated by radiometric methods). We have undertaken a program of speleothem remediation which, visible to the public, serves to reinforce the conservation and sustainability message emphasizing the importance of caves to society...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing, as {{a direct}} adjunct to field, lithologic and {{structural}} mapping, and more recently, GIS have {{played an important role}} in the study of mineralized areas. A review on the application of remote sensing in mineral resource mapping is attempted here. It involves understanding the application of remote sensing in lithologic, structural and alteration mapping. Remote sensing becomes an important tool for locating mineral deposits, in its own right, when the primary and <b>secondary</b> processes of <b>mineralization</b> result in the formation of spectral anomalies. Reconnaissance lithologic mapping is usually the first step of mineral resource mapping. This is complimented with structural mapping, as mineral deposits usually occur along or adjacent to geologic structures, and alteration mapping, as mineral deposits are commonly associated with hydrothermal alteration of the surrounding rocks. In addition to these, understanding the use of hyperspectral remote sensing is crucial as hyperspectral data can help identify and thematically map regions of exploration interest by using the distinct absorption features of most minerals. Finally coming to the exploration stage, GIS forms the perfect tool in integrating and analyzing various georeferenced geoscience data in selecting the best sites of mineral deposits or rather good candidates for further exploration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Caledonian fold belt of East Greenland {{contains}} calc-alkaline granite (sensu lato) intrusions with ages {{ranging from}} c. 2000 Ma to c. 350 Ma. The Protero-zoic granites have low U contents and the pre-Devonian Caledonian granites contents of U {{corresponding to the}} clarke value for U in granites. Some aspects of the geochemistry of U are discussed using U-K/Rb, U-Sr, U-Zr, and U-Th diagrams. <b>Secondary</b> enrichment and <b>mineralization</b> ccurs in fractured and hydrothermally altered granites and rhyolites ituated in or near a major NNE fault zone. The U is associated with iron oxides or hydrocarbons. It is suggested {{that the source of}} the mineralization was Devonian acid magma, which also acted as a heat source for circulating hydrothermal fluids. T HE content and distribution ofU in granites from the Caledonides of Scotland, Ireland, and the eastern United States of America have recently been studied in relation to the geochemistry and tectonic setting of the granites, and to the occur-rence of U mineralization (e. g. Simpson et al., 1979; Rogers et al., 1978). This paper presents the results of preliminary studies of granites of the East Greenland Caledonian fold belt, which {{can be viewed as a}} northwards continuation f the Britis...|$|R
40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{degradation of}} indigo carmine (IC) dye {{in the presence}} of titanium dioxide under different conditions was reported. Several factors which interfere with the photodegradation efficiency as catalyst concentration, pH, initial concentration of dye, presence of inorganic anions, temperature, and the addition of hydrogen peroxide were studied under artificial irradiation with a 125 [*]W mercury vapor lamp. Additionally, the catalyst supported on glass spheres was used for the photocatalytic degradation of the dye present in several types of waters in a CPC solar pilot plant. The photocatalytic products, carboxylic acids, and SO 42 - and NH 4 + were followed during IC mineralization. Formate, acetate, and oxalate were detected in real MWWTP <b>secondary</b> effluent. The <b>mineralization</b> efficiency was of 42 and 21 % using in suspension and supported TiO 2, respectively. In order to evaluate biological effects, Eisenia andrei earthworms were used as a model organism. No significant difference (P> 0. 05) of weight was observed in the earthworm submitted to different concentrations of IC and its photoproducts. The photocatalytic degradation of IC on TiO 2 supported on glass spheres suffered strong influence of the water matrix; nevertheless the method has the enormous advantage that it eliminates the need for the final catalyst removal step, reducing therefore the cost of treatment...|$|R
