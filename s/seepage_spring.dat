Over 300 specimens were collected from a permanent <b>seepage</b> <b>spring</b> on repeated visits between May 2011 and May 2013. The type locality is located {{in the foothills of the}} Zemplínske vrchy mountains in the East Slovakian Lowland (NE part of Pannonian Lowland) - small, low and isolated hills formed during Neogene volcanic activity. Volcanic rocks draw together fragments of massives of Palaezoic and Mesozoic age as same as Neogene sediments. The new species can be classified as stygophile, living in the shallow subterranean habitat. The species has small subequal gnathopods, sexually dimorphic uropod III, sexually non-dimorphic uropod I in juveniles, dimorphic uropod 1 in adults. They are extremely different in the post-reproductive stage, when they have 2 - 4 dorsal spines (arranged in a transverse row) on the telson and supporting dorsal spines...|$|E

40|$|Seepage streams within "flood overflow" {{channels}} are important microhabitats within braided rivers. They are important foraging zones for wading birds and {{may contribute to}} the ability of the invertebrate community to recover from disturbance. Production of dominant invertebrates was estimated along a three kilometre study reach of the Rakaia River for various channel types ranging from seepage stream microhabitats within secondary channels to the largest braids in the central river bed. The <b>seepage</b> and <b>spring</b> stream microhabitats received varying exposure to elevated summer flows, freshes, and were inundated by flows of greater than approximately 200 cumecs. Four quadrats were randomly located within 10 metre sampling transects in riffles of <b>seepage</b> and <b>spring</b> stream microhabitat in addition to minor and major braids. Riffles were sampled at six week intervals from October 1997 to August 1998, with no riffle sampled more than once. Production was estimated using the size frequency method. Seepage stream microhabitats were the most productive sites examined. Production was estimated to be 10. 3 g DW m-² yr-¹ for a perennial seepage stream, 3. 2 g m-² yr-¹ for a baseflow seepage stream, 1. 0 g DW m-² yr-¹ for a baseflow spring stream, and 0. 5 g DW m-² yr-¹ and 0. 6 g DW m-² yr-¹ respectively for the minor and major braids. The two types of seepage stream had significantly greater production than the minor and major braids. Invertebrate production is likely to be affected by gradients of disturbance, temperature, algal abundance, and organic matter retention. Frequent and unpredictable flooding probably restricts production in the minor and major braids but helps maintain structure of <b>seepage</b> and <b>spring</b> stream microhabitat in secondary "flood overflow" channels...|$|R

Systematic surveillance of wet-season and dry-season habitats was conducted during 1990 and 1991. Sampling along transects of the Coatan River {{was employed to}} quantify habitat availability and population densities of larvae {{during the dry season}}. During the wet season, larvae were most abundant in temporary habitats, such as <b>seepage</b> <b>springs,</b> rain pools, and pools in stream and river margins. The temporary habitats disappeared during the dry season, which occurred concurrent with incrasing densities of larvae in dry-season habitats within transects along the Coatan River. The great abundance of the dry-season riverine habitats, viz., small pools with filamentous algae, resulted in peak densities of host-seeking adult populations in villages associated with the river. During both seasons, there were significant associations between the presence and abundance of larvae and habitats containing filamentous algae, and secondarily with selected aquatic and semiaquatic plants. There was a significant correlation between mean numbers of larvae per habitat and mean numbers of breeding sites in the transects. Overall, An. pseudopunctipennis larvae were very abundant during the dry season and relatively uncommon during the wet season...|$|R

40|$|A {{groundwater}} {{model of}} Cache Valley was created using MODFLOW. Steady-state calibration {{of the model}} demonstrated that recharge to the lower confined aquifer may occur along {{the margin of the}} valley that borders the Wellsville Mountains and the Bear River Range. Steady-state calibration also showed that discharge from the unconfined aquifer may occur along the eastern and western margins of the valley in both the Utah and the Idaho portions of the valley. Two simulations were run with increased pumping of 3 5 cubic feet per second (1 cubic meter per second) from the principal aquifer. The first simulation was run with the average annual precipitation value of 1. 2 feet per year (0. 36 meters per year), while the second was run with a less than average annual precipitation value of 1 foot per year (0. 3 meters per year). The first simulation produced very little change within the unconfined aquifer. The discharge from the groundwater system through <b>springs,</b> <b>seepage</b> to streams, evapotranspiration, and general head boundaries remained unchanged with the increase in discharge through pumping. This indicates that the two continuous, confining layers that blanket the valley may serve as a barrier to groundwater flow between the unconfined and lower confined aquifer. The increased pumping within the principal aquifer did not stimulate increased recharge along the western margin of the valley. This indicates that true steady-state conditions were not achieved in {{the amount of time that}} the model had indicated. During the second simulation, decreased recharge to the groundwater system through infiltration of precipitation caused a decrease in discharge from the groundwater system through <b>seepage</b> to streams, <b>springs,</b> evapotranspiration, and general head boundaries.

As with the first simulation, this indicates that true steady-state conditions were not achieved in the amount of time that the model had indicated.

40|$|Problem setting : Sloped {{aquifers}} on elevated plateaus {{may respond}} hydrodynamically different than subhorizontal aquifer systems. Although {{they are often}} rather thin, they may be very important for local agriculture development in highlands. Controlled by gravity driven flow, the sloped aquifers become nearly completely dewatered in the dry season by downstream outflow and are refilled during the successive rainy season. This makes them extremely sensitive to weather conditions and climate variations. As the groundwater stored in these shallow, sloped watertable aquifers is the only water resource available in the dry season, their importance for local economic-social development is evident. Therefore a profound understanding of their functioning and responses to climate stresses is essential for a better management or for conceiving development strategies. In this paper, {{the example of a}} shallow water table aquifer in the May Zeg Zeg basin near Hagere Selam town is given as a representative case of a local sloped aquifer. Field measurements and observations have helped understanding the functioning of the aquifer and a groundwater model has been implemented that reproduces the monthly variation in water availability during a 12 year period. Methodology : Piezometric measurements in observation wells during the start of a rainy season have allowed to follow the refilling of this shallow watertable aquifer after the dry season. Piezometric measurements and field observations were integrated into a hydrodynamic system analysis to give a synthetic scheme of the functioning of the aquifer and to identify the main mechanisms that control the outflow of the groundwater and lead to the dewatering in the dry season. Runoff after rain events was estimated with the SCS-CN method. Based on meteorological data, groundwater recharge is estimated using a soil moisture water balance. Calculations with monthly and daily meteorological data were done and compared. A transient flow hydrodynamic groundwater flow model of the May Zeg Zeg basin has been made to reconstruct the yearly filling/dewatering cycle during a 12 year period (1995 - 2007) using the calculated aquifer recharge rates as an input boundary condition. Time evolution of the different discharge components and piezometric levels were obtained. Results and discussion : The results of the soil moisture balance model calculations show that the time resolution of the meteorological input parameters has a large impact on the obtained recharge rates. Using daily values instead of the often applied monthly totals, yields up to 30 % higher recharge rates. The difference is larger in dry years. The hydrodynamical system analysis shows than the main discharge mechanisms that lead to dewatering include <b>seepage</b> outflow, <b>spring</b> discharge, discharge through fracture zones and percolation to underlying layers.

40|$|The Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat {{has been}} in {{eruption}} since 1995. Before then, a number of hot springs and fumaroles high on the volcanic edifice attested {{to the presence of}} hydrothermal circulation systems. All of these features were buried beneath thick deposits of volcanic ash {{during the early years of}} the eruption. However, examination of low-lying sites in the vicinity of the abandoned town of Plymouth has revealed the persistence of a zone of hot (≤ 64  °C) groundwater discharge in a narrow valley that opens onto the northern beaches of the town. This small valley has not been significantly affected by ash deposition, with any airfall deposits having been subsequently washed downstream during periods of rain. The <b>seepages</b> and small <b>springs</b> in this zone all emit Na–Cl groundwaters, which appear from the concentrations of major ions and B and Li to be hydrothermally altered seawaters that have undergone extensive rock–water interaction at depth. Taken together with previously published volcanological observations, the persistence of this hydrothermal system throughout the sustained eruption period suggests that a robust hydrothermal circulation system exists at depths of several hundred metres in an area that closely adjoins the still-inhabited half of the island. Comparison with similar volcanogenic hydrothermal systems in the Caribbean and elsewhere suggests that there is significant potential for development of high-enthalpy geothermal energy resources in this vicinity. Using a portable well-head generating unit, a single successful borehole in this area could reasonably be expected to yield up to 5 MW of electrical power. This output significantly exceeds the current peak electricity demand on the island (c. [*] 3. 5 MW). In concept, it would be possible to exploit any excess capacity to operate an electrolysis plant to produce hydrogen for use in vehicles on the island. Establishing energy self-sufficiency would be a major step towards the economic and social regeneration of this devastated island, with the further possibility of increasing prosperity in the future through export of surplus energy to nearby non-volcanic islands...|$|R
40|$|A {{groundwater}} mound (or pressure mound) {{is defined as}} a volume of fluid dominated by viscous flow contained within a sediment volume where the dominant fluid flow is by Knudsen Diffusion. High permeability self-sealing {{groundwater mound}}s can be created as part of a sustainable urban drainage scheme (SUDS) using infiltration devices. This study considers how they form, and models their expansion and growth as a function of infiltration device recharge. The mounds grow through lateral macropore propagation within a Dupuit envelope. Excess pressure relief is through propagating vertical surge shafts. These surge shafts can, when they intersect the ground surface result, in high volume overland flow. The study considers that the creation of self-sealing groundwater mounds in matrix supported (clayey) sediments (intrinsic permeability = 10 – 8 to 10 – 30 m 3 m – 2 s – 1 Pa – 1) is a low cost, sustainable method which can be used to dispose of large volumes of storm runoff (3 / 24 hr storm/infiltration device) and raise groundwater levels. However, the inappropriate location of pressure mounds can result in repeated <b>seepage</b> and ephemeral <b>spring</b> formation associated with substantial volumes of uncontrolled overland flow. The flow rate and flood volume associated with each overland flow event may be substantially larger than the associated recharge to the pressure mound. In some instances, the volume discharged as overland flow in a few hours may exceed the total storm water recharge to the groundwater mound over the previous three weeks. Macropore modeling is used {{within the context of a}} pressure mound poro-elastic fluid expulsion model in order to analyze this phenomena and determine (i) how this phenomena can be used to extract large volumes of stored filtered storm water (at high flow rates) from within a self-sealing high permeability pressure mound and (ii) how self-sealing pressure mounds (created using storm water infiltration) can be used to provide a sustainable low cost source of treated water for agricultural, drinking, and other water abstraction purposes. storm water disposal; infiltration; macropores; natural pipe; water treatment; water supply sources; groundwater mound; overland flow; storm water recycling; SUDS; infiltration device; soakaway; seepage; ephemeral spring; clay clods; modeling; air-water contact; standing water...|$|R

A series of approximately north-northeast-striking faults related to the Basin and Range tectonics are superimposed on the earlier structures within the project area, and are responsible for the final overall geometry and distribution of the pre-existing structural features on the property. Two of these faults, the Pumpernickel Valley fault and Edna Mountain fault, are range-bounding and display numerous characteristics typical of strike-slip fault systems. These characteristics, when combined with geophysical data from Shore (2005), indicate the presence of a pull-apart basin, formed within the releasing bend of the Pumpernickel Valley – Edna Mountain fault system. A substantial body of evidence exists, in the form of available geothermal, geological and geophysical information, to suggest that the property and the pull-apart basin host a structurally controlled, extensive geothermal field. The most evident manifestations of the geothermal activity in the valley are two areas with hot <b>springs,</b> <b>seepages,</b> and wet ground/vegetation anomalies near the Pumpernickel Valley fault, which indicate that the fault focuses the fluid up-flow. There has not been any geothermal production from the Pumpernickel Valley area, but it was the focus of a limited exploration effort by Magma Power Company. In 1974, the company drilled one exploration/temperature gradient borehole east of the Pumpernickel Valley fault and recorded a thermal gradient of 160 oC/km. The 1982 temperature data from five unrelated mineral exploration holes to the north of the Magma well indicated geothermal gradients in a range from 66 to 249 oC/km for wells west of the fault, and ~ 283 oC/km in a well next to the fault. In 2005, Nevada Geothermal Power Company drilled four geothermal gradient wells, PVTG- 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4, and all four encountered geothermal fluids. The holes provided valuable water geochemistry, supporting the geothermometry results obtained from the hot springs and Magma well. The temperature data gathered from all the wells clearly indicates the presence of a major plume of thermal water centered on the Pumpernickel Valley fault, and suggests that the main plume is controlled, at least in part, by flow from this fault system. The temperature data also defines the geothermal resource with gradients > 100 oC/km, which covers an area a minimum of 8 km 2. Structural blocks, down dropped with respect to the Pumpernickel Valley fault, may define an immediate reservoir. The geothermal system almost certainly continues beyond the recently drilled holes and might be open to the east and south, whereas the heat source responsible for the temperatures associated with this plume has not been intersected and must be at a depth greater than 920 meters (depth of the deepest well – Magma well). The geological and structural setting and other characteristics of the Pumpernickel Valley geothermal project area are markedly similar to the portions of the nearby Dixie Valley geothermal field. These similarities include, among others, the numerous, unexposed en echelon faults and large-scale pull-apart structure, which in Dixie Valley may host part of the geothermal field. The Pumpernickel Valley project area, for the majority of which Nevada Geothermal Power Company has geothermal rights, represents a geothermal site with a potential for the discovery of a relatively high temperature reservoir suitable for electric power production. Among locations not previously identified as having high geothermal potential, Pumpernickel Valley has been ranked as one of four sites with the highest potential for electrical power production in Nevada (Shevenell and Garside, 2003). Richards and Blackwell (2002) estimated the total heat loss and the preliminary production capacity for the entire Pumpernickel Valley geothermal system to be at 35 MW. A more conservative estimate, for the hot spring area only, was presented by GeothermEx Inc. (2004), which projected that power generation capacities for the Pumpernickel Valley site are 10 MW- 30 yrs minimum (probablility of > 90 %), and most likely 13 MW- 30 yrs...|$|R
