5|$|In 1521, the Portuguese {{allied with}} Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Migrin ibn Zamil, {{who was killed}} during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they {{depended}} mainly on Sunni Persian governors. The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty of Persia, which gave impetus to Shia Islam. For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadhis of Oman. During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of Bushehr or through immigrant <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> clans. The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as Huwala (literally: those that have changed or moved). In 1753, the Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur invaded Bahrain {{on behalf of the}} Iranian Zand leader Karim Khan Zand and restored direct Iranian rule.|$|E
25|$|In February 2004, the 101st was {{replaced}} in Mosul by {{a portion of}} I Corps headquarters, but operational forces consisted solely of a unit roughly one quarter its size—a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated {{and most of the}} <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait and Iran share close diplomatic, economic, and {{military}} ties, which is {{unusual for a}} <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> state and even more unusual for a U.S. ally. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Kuwaiti Prime Minister then Sabah Al-Sabah (now the Emir of Kuwait) visited Iran and congratulated the Iranian Revolution.|$|E

The milestone came just one day after the execution of Saddam Hussein and just as the Bush Administration was revising its wartime strategy.|$|E
25|$|Al Mayadeen is a pan-Arabist {{satellite}} television channel launched on 11 June 2012 in Lebanon. The channel, claims Gulf-supported media, aims at reducing {{the influence of}} the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya networks, both funded by oil-rich <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> countries in the Persian Gulf. However, it is said to plan to present an alternative to mainstream Arab satellite media, largely dominated by these two channels.|$|E

Albu Nimr was one of the <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> tribes that fiercely opposed the Islamic State. On 17 December 2014, it was reported by Turkish media, that the ISIS had executed at least 150 women from the Albu Nimr tribe in Falluja for refusing to marry ISIS militants.|$|E
25|$|In August 1921, the British {{installed}} Hashemite King Faisal I as {{the client}} {{ruler of the}} British Mandate of Iraq. Faisal had been forced out as the King of Syria by the French. Likewise, British authorities selected <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> elites from the region for appointments to government and ministry offices in Iraq. The British and the Iraqis formalized {{the relationship between the}} two nations with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922. With Faisal's ascension to the throne, the Iraqi Army became the Royal Iraqi Army (RIrA).|$|E
25|$|On 30 January, an {{election}} {{for a government}} to draft a permanent constitution took place. Although some violence and lack of widespread <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> participation marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended {{in order to provide}} election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month. February, March and April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the average 70.|$|E

25|$|According to American {{professor}} Joshua Landis, the Internal Security Forces in mid-2000s altered {{their own}} ethnic/religious composition, {{under the guidance}} of then-Minister of Interior Ghazi Kanaan. This alteration was reportedly carried out {{in order to make the}} national police (subject to the law) reliable to step in dealing with national security issues, thus diminishing the extra-law Syrian intelligence community's role, as part of broader reforms of the same years. The decision reportedly caused criticism by <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> officials. Nevertheless, the police devoted to general duties was poorly equipped: according the United Kingdom Home Office, as of 2009 there were few police checkpoints on main roads or in populated areas.|$|E
25|$|Militarily {{established}} and holding {{control over the}} Umayyad government, many Sunni rulers perceived the Shia as a threat– to both their political and their religious authority. The Sunni rulers under the Umayyads sought to marginalize the Shia minority, and later the Abbasids turned on their Shia allies and imprisoned, persecuted, and killed them. The persecution of the Shia throughout history by Sunni co-religionists has often been characterized by brutal and genocidal acts. Comprising only about 10–15% of the entire Muslim population, the Shia remain a marginalized community to this day in many <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> dominant countries without the rights to practice their religion and organize.|$|E
25|$|The {{immigration}} of Persians to Bahrain {{began when the}} Greek Seleucid kingdom which was ruling Bahrain at the time fell and the Persian Empire successfully invaded Bahrain, but it is often believed that mass immigration started during the 1600s when Abbas I of Persia invaded Bahrain. After settling in Bahrain, some of the Persians were effectively Arabized. They usually settled in areas inhabited by the indigenous Baharna, probably because they share the same Shia Muslim faith, however, some Sunni Persians settled in areas mostly inhabited by <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> immigrants such as Hidd and Galali. In Muharraq, {{they have their own}} neighborhood called Fareej Karimi named after a rich Persian man called Ali Abdulla Karimi.|$|E
50|$|Among Sunni Bahraini citizens, {{there are}} also many {{different}} ethnic groups. Sunni Bahrainis are mainly divided into two main ethnic groups: urban Arabs (al Arab) and Huwala. The urban Arabs are mostly descendants of <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arabs</b> from central Arabia who were (alongside the baharna) traditionally pearl-divers, merchants, sailors, traders and fishermen in the pre-oil era. The Huwala are descendants of Sunni Iranians; {{some of them are}} ethnic Persians, and others are ethnic <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arabs.</b>|$|R

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 10th century, various Islamic sects rose in al-Us̲h̲būna and converted the Hispano-Roman population. These sects were a form of political organization in revolt against the hierarchical system of the Muslim conquerors which institutionalised obstacles to their social mobility. The elite descendants of Muhammad ranked first, then full-blooded Arabs, then Berbers or Moors, and lastly the Arabised Muslims and Hispano-Romans. Several Hispano-Roman leaders emerged, including Ali ibn Ashra and others, who claimed to be prophets or descendants of `Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, regarded by Shias as the first Imam. With their allies in other cities they started civil wars against the <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> troops. The Mozarabs and the Jews were treated even worse, sometimes suffering persecution that, although regrettable in modern eyes, was a pale reflection of what the Catholics would do not only against Muslims and Jews, but even against fellow Christians themselves when they reconquered the land.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 2008 two civilians, {{including}} a child, died when U.S. forces returned fire after {{a roadside bomb}} struck a convoy that included the police chief. On January 19, 2008 a rocket attack killed seven people and wounded 20., On February 15, 2008 at least three {{people were killed and}} 16 wounded in a double suicide bombing.

A few minutes later, another bomber ran towards a group of worshipers and blew himself up as police opened fire. On February 20, 2008 a suicide car bomber killed a woman and a six-year-old girl, and wounded eight, in an attack on an identity cards office.

500|$|On March 13, 2008, it was {{reported}} that the Archbishop's body had been found buried in a shallow grave near Mosul. Officials of the Chaldean Church in Iraq said they had received a call telling them where the body was buried. Reports over the cause of death were contradictory. An official of the morgue in Mosul said the archbishop, who had health problems, including high blood pressure and diabetes, might have died of natural causes. Police at the Mosul morgue said the Archbishop [...] "appeared to have been dead a week and his body bore no bullet wounds". [...] Nineveh Deputy Governor Khasro Goran stated that when relatives and authorities went to the location specified by the kidnappers and found the body, it had [...] "gunshot wounds". The identity of those behind his murder is disputed. Some Assyrians within the community believe Al-Qaida and other <b>Sunni</b> <b>Arab</b> factions were behind the murder. Other Christians in Mosul, including the archbishop’s family, believe that it was the Kurds who ordered his assassination. Kurdish authorities ordered an investigation and subsequently made several arrests, though their reports have failed to convince the family.|$|E
