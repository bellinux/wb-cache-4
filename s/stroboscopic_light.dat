In the coplanar electrode configuration, two pairs of vortex flows are observed to form in a droplet centred on the electrode gap. All experiments are performed in oil as ambient phase and flows in the droplet are analysed using fluorescent beads. At the same time, droplet oscillations induced by AC EWOD are also revealed under <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lighting.</b> These experiments show that vortex location can be controlled by frequency actuation with fair degree of reproducibility.

5000|$|The {{effect is}} most {{commonly}} demonstrated with a device known as Benham's top. It {{can also be}} seen in <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lights</b> when flashes are set at certain critical speeds. Rotating fan blades, particularly aluminum ones, can also demonstrate the effect; as the fan accelerates or decelerates, the colors appear, drift, change and disappear. The stable running speed of the fan does not (normally) produce colors, suggesting that it is not an interference effect with the frequency of the illumination flicker.The effect was noted by Gustav Fechner and Hermann von Helmholtz and propagated to English-speakers through Charles Benham's invention of his top. The perceptual mechanism of Fechner color is not entirely understood. Florence Winger Bagley was one of the early investigators of this phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the flexural strength of direct (Charisma) and indirect (Solidex) composites, {{with or without}} fiber reinforcements (Ribbond), cured with LED or <b>Stroboscopic</b> Xenon <b>Light.</b> MaterialandMethods: Resin bars made with or without fiber reinforcements, with 25 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm were distributed in groups (n= 10) : GDL– Direct Resin/LED; GDX–Direct Resin/Stroboscopic Xenon; GDFL– Direct Resin/Fiber/LED; GDFX– Direct Resin/Fiber/Stroboscopic Xenon; GIL– Indirect Resin/LED; GIX– Indirect Resin/Stroboscopic Xenon; GIFL– Indirect Resin/Fiber/LED; GIFX– Indirect Resin/Fiber/Stroboscopic Xenon. The specimens were connected to a universal test machine and submitted to a compression load (2 kN). Results: The obtained results were submitted to Analysis of Variance tests (p < 0. 01), and Tukey (5 % significance level) tests. The flexural strength of groups that used polyethylene fiber reinforcement (96. 39) was similar (p = 0. 58) to group without fiber reinforcement (92. 47). Direct composites (107. 79) showed higher values of flexural strength than indirect composites (81. 07), and <b>stroboscopic</b> xenon <b>light</b> curing (108. 71) resulted in better flexural strength results than LED (80. 15), for both kinds of composites experimented.

40|$|Approximately 4 % of {{the general}} {{population}} will experience a seizure during their lifetime. Imaging in these "first-ever" seizure patients is in most cases normal, and abnormalities are only present in approximately 15 % of patients as seizures can be provoked by fever, sleep deprivation, <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lights,</b> or drugs. However, an underlying lesion will lower the seizure threshold and thus make a patient more susceptible to experience a seizure. As "first-ever seizures" are a medical emergency, the treatment modality of choice in these cases is an unenhanced CT to exclude acute medical emergencies that may go along with seizures prior to a more extensive workup depending on clinical history and presentation. Imaging abnormalities encountered in patients experiencing their first-ever seizures include (but are not restricted to) virtually all diseases affecting the brain. As such you may find vascular abnormalities (such as microangiopathy, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), sinus thrombosis, hemorrhage, cavernomas, or stroke), tumors (metastases, primary tumors), infections (encephalitis, meningitis, abscess), sequelae of previous head injury, and toxic or metabolic conditions (e. g., PRES) in these patients...|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} {{analytical and}} experimental determination {{is made of}} the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes in the {{longitudinal plane of symmetry}} for a dynamic model of a single-rotor helicopter. The analytical phase is worked out {{on the basis of a}} seven-degree-of-freedom system combining elastic deflections of the rotor blades, rotor shaft, pylon, and fuselage. The calculated coupled frequencies are first compared with calculated uncoupled frequencies to show the general effects of coupling and then with measured coupled frequencies to determine the extent to which the coupled frequencies can be calculated. The coupled mode shapes are also calculated and were observed visually with <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lights</b> during the tests. A comparison of the coupled and uncoupled natural frequencies shows that significant differences exist between these frequencies for some of the modes. Good agreement is obtained between the measured and calculated values for the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results show that the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes can be determined by the analytical procedure presented herein with sufficient accuracy if the mass and stiffness distributions of the various components of the helicopter are known...|$|R

Good performance of the system was verified using dry turbine mockups in which an aerosol spray simulated, in a rough way, the moisture flow in the turbine.

30|$|FE {{sources have}} the {{potential}} for unprecedented temporal modulation. Compared to other one-dimensional nanomaterials, CNTs allow for near ballistic conduction making them ideally suited for such high-speed applications. Pulse X-ray sources are practically beneficial when imaging moving objects. The principle of operation is analogous to <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lighting</b> in optical imaging. Conventional TE X-ray sources are generally not capable of rapid control; they cannot be pulsed much more rapidly than a few tens of milliseconds, without sophisticated gating mechanisms. The means of controlling the beam current in a TE source is by adjusting the filament current and hence temperature, which introduces time delays due to the finite cooling and heating time of the filament. Pulse sources are therefore generally implemented by switching the anode voltage, or by means of mechanically controlled shutters, the latter only allowing for relatively course control over the pulse shape, on period, and mark-to-space ratio, and will inevitably create a trapezoidal pulse. In the case of existing FE and TE sources, the short duration of the pulse must be compensated by increased power levels, resulting in significant engineering design constraints with regards to the resilience of the emitting material; conventional electron emitting materials degrade rapidly when used in such high power applications.|$|R

This is the most common reflex epilepsy in humans; it is characterized by the photoparoxysmal response, which is an abnormal electroencephalographic reaction, and seizures triggered by intermittent light stimulation. Here, by using genetic mapping, sequencing and functional analyses, we report that a mutation in the acceptor site of the second intron of SV 2 A (the gene encoding synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A) is causing photosensitive reflex epilepsy in a unique vertebrate model, the Fepi chicken strain, a spontaneous model where the neurological disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation. This mutation causes an aberrant splicing event and significantly reduces the level of SV 2 A mRNA in homozygous carriers. Levetiracetam, a second generation antiepileptic drug, is known to bind SV 2 A, and SV 2 A knock-out mice develop seizures soon after birth and usually die within three weeks. The Fepi chicken survives to adulthood and responds to levetiracetam, suggesting that the low-level expression of SV 2 A in these animals is sufficient to allow survival, but does not protect against seizures. Thus, the Fepi chicken model shows that the role of the SV 2 A pathway in the brain is conserved between birds and mammals, in spite of a large phylogenetic distance...|$|R
