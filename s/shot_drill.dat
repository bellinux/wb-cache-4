40|$|The use {{of hybrid}} {{structures}} made of CFRP and titanium alloys is growing {{more and more}} in the last years in the aerospace industry due to the high strength to weight ratio. Because of their very different characteristics, the mechanical fastening represent the most effective joining technique for these materials. As a consequence, drilling process {{plays a key role in}} the assembly. The one <b>shot</b> <b>drilling,</b> i. e. the contemporary drilling of the stack of the two materials, seems to be the best option both in terms of time saving and assembly accuracy. Nevertheless, due to the considerable different machinability of fiber reinforced plastics and metallic materials, the one <b>shot</b> <b>drilling</b> is a critical process both for the holes quality and for the tools wear. This research was carried out to study the effectiveness of new generation tools in the drilling of CFRP/Titanium stacks. The tools are made of sintered grains of tungsten carbide (WC) in a binder of cobalt and coated with Diamond like carbon (DLC), and are characterized by a patented geometry; they mainly differ in parent WC grain size and binder percentage. Both the cutting forces and the wear phenomena were accurately investigated and the results were analyzed as a function of number of holes and their quality. The results show a clear increase of the cutting forces with the number of holes for all the used drilling tools. Moreover, abrasive wear phenomena that affect initially the tools coating layer were observed. © 2016 Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{drilling}} of {{composite material}} laminates {{is a widely}} used process and is critical from a structural point of view. It requires particular attention, due to {{the various types of}} damage that can be caused if the process is incorrect. The delamination of the outer plies of the laminate at the exit edge of the hole is a typical defect detected after drilling composite materials. This is related to the thrust force required for drilling, which is connected, other cutting parameters being equal, to the feed rate. High feed rates are associated with high thrust force and, accordingly, the probability that delamination will occur, increases with feed rate and force. In this work a study for developing a new step multifacet drill bit, named SEE, Step Elliptical Elliptical, is presented. Experimental tests showed that the new tool allows a decrease of about 50 % in the maximum thrust force, compared with the one <b>shot</b> <b>drill</b> bit, which is still widely used in the aeronautical field...|$|E

40|$|Multilayer metallic/composite stacks are {{increasingly}} being used in wing and tail plane sections of modern commercial aircraft, with component assembly primarily through mechanical joining, hence the requirement for fixation holes. Currently, the individual material sections (titanium, aluminium and CFRP) are machined independently prior to assembly however; there is growing demand within the industry to produce holes through the stack in a single operation. The research detailed in the thesis involves evaluating the effect of operating parameters, drill geometry, tool materials/coatings and cutting strategy when single <b>shot</b> <b>drilling</b> three-layer Ti/CFRP/Al stacks. Performance was assessed against various process measures including thrust forces/torque, hole accuracy/quality, tool wear/life, burr formation and hole surface integrity (microhardness and microstructure). Statistical design of experiments and associated analysis techniques (main effects plots, ANOVA etc.) were employed to identify the significance of variable factors and preferred operating levels with respect to different responses. Based on the experimental results, a bespoke drill design was formulated, which was validated against current commercially available drills recommended for the drilling of multilayer stacks.

40|$|Ten {{shots were}} fired in drill holes in Mizuho Plateau, East Antarctica for {{explosion}} seismic experiments in 1979 - 1981. The yield charge sizes are {{in a range of}} 10 to 1400 kg. An emperical relationship between the yield charge and the maximum amplitude of generated seismic waves was derived for the <b>shots</b> in <b>drill</b> holes in the snow field, which will aid to design an adequate charge size for future explosion seismic experiments in Antarctica. The maximum amplitudes obtained above were compared with those generated in sea water in Lutzow-Holm Bay, Antarctica and those generated in the rock in the Izu Peninsula, Japan. When the explosives are less than 500 kg, the amplitudes are about 1 / 10 of the amplitudes generated in the sea, and about 1 / 5 of amplitudes generated in the rock. When the charge is large, the difference in amplitude between the shot in the sea and that in the rock is small. The amplitude of the largest shot of 1400 kg is nearly the same as that in the rock. This is because small {{shots were fired}} in shallow drill holes of 5 to 30 m deep where the ice density is about 0. 5 g/(cm) ^ 3 and ice is very porous, whereas the largest shot was fired at a depth of 140 m where the density is greater than 0. 7 g/(cm) ^ 3.

However, about three minutes later, with the Crimson Tide up 48-44, Obasohan and Arthur Edwards, both starters, were called for their fifth fouls and were forced to exit the game, leaving the Tide without its entire starting backcourt.

40|$|In 1979 - 81, ten {{shots were}} fired in drill holes at the Prince Olav Coast and the Mizuho Plateau, Antarctica, for {{explosion}} seismic experiments by JARE- 20, - 21 and - 22. The yield ranged from 10 to 1400 kg. An empirical relationship between yield and maximum amplitude of seismic wave was derived for <b>shots</b> in <b>drill</b> holes in ice sheet. This will help to design an adequate charge size for explosion seismic experiments in Antarctica. The maximum amplitudes obtained are compared with those generated from explosion in sea water in Antarctica and in solid rock in Japan. For yields smaller than 500 kg, the logarithm plots of the amplitudes are in a linear relation with the logarithm of yields, and the amplitudes are about 1 / 5 to 1 / 8 of those generated in solid rock. For the yields larger than 500 kg, the wave amplitudes in the ice sheet become larger than those estimated from the above relationship. The amplitude of the biggest shot of 1. 4 t detonated in the ice sheet is nearly {{the same as that}} in solid rock in Japan. This is because small {{shots were fired}} in shallow drill holes where the ice is very porous, its density is only about 500 kg/m^ 3.
