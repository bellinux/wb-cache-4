Laggy systems are; however, not simply annoying but substantially reduce user productivity. The impact of latency on head referenced display systems, particularly head-mounted systems, is especially disturbing since {{not only can}} it interfere with dynamic registration in augmented reality displays but it also can in some cases indirectly contribute to motion sickness. We will summarize several experiments using standard psychophysical discrimination techniques that suggest what <b>system</b> <b>latencies</b> {{will be required to}} achieve perceptual stability for spatially referenced computer-generated imagery.

5000|$|The precise {{definition}} of latency {{depends on the}} system being observed {{and the nature of}} stimulation. In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used for communications. In reliable two-way communication <b>systems,</b> <b>latency</b> limits the maximum rate that information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is [...] "in-flight" [...] at any one moment. In the field of human-machine interaction, perceptible latency has a strong effect on user satisfaction and usability.|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} any {{critical}} section {{that needs to}} be interrupted. Entry to a critical section restricts concurrent data structure access.

We introduce a framework for describing the control problems for large scale computing systems that expand along two dimensions: {{the scale of the}} target system and the scale of the policy. Using this framework, we present control architectures that span a range from centralized schemes to distributed solutions. We further identify several research challenges related to issues such as target <b>systems</b> <b>latencies</b> and policy decomposition. I...|$|R
50|$|For some <b>systems,</b> <b>latency</b> and {{throughput}} are coupled entities. In TCP/IP, latency {{can also}} directly affect throughput. In TCP connections, the large bandwidth-delay product of high latency connections, combined with relatively small TCP window sizes on many devices, effectively causes the throughput {{of a high}} latency connection to drop sharply with latency. This can be remedied with various techniques, such as increasing the TCP congestion window size, or more drastic solutions, such as packet coalescing, TCP acceleration, and forward error correction, {{all of which are}} commonly used for high latency satellite links.|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 35 {{satellites}} were launched by ORBCOMM Global {{in the mid}} to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket: one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each. These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS. Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost. The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites and received $44.5 million in compensation.|$|E

50|$|The widely {{accepted}} {{explanation of the}} apparent depth is that a reduction in retinal illumination (relative to the fellow eye) yields a corresponding delay in signal transmission, imparting instantaneous spatial disparity in moving objects. This seems to occur because visual <b>system</b> <b>latencies</b> are generally shorter (i.e., the visual system responds more quickly) for bright targets as compared to dim targets. This motion with depth is the visual system's solution to a moving target when a difference in retinal illuminance, and hence a difference in signal latencies, exists between the two eyes.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} helmet mounted display (HMD) systems to {{increase}} effectiveness in operational aircraft {{has been well}} documented over the last several years. Now that advanced aircraft are committed to using HMDs in combat operations, issues associated with their use in simulators must be addressed. A major factor associated with the onset of simulator sickness is <b>system</b> <b>latency.</b> Simulator sickness can be a significant distraction during training and may result in ineffective training, negative training, reduced user acceptance, and a reduction in simulator usage. Innovative solutions to address <b>system</b> <b>latency,</b> as well as many other issues, must be developed so that training can be optimized. The current project developed a number of innovative strategies that effectively mitigate both <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> and image alignment error. The strategies developed include: 1) a customized Kalman predictive filter, 2) a learning neural network, and 3) “Warper Board ” technology. These strategies operate independently yet in concert to continually sample, compare, and adjust their outputs to produce the most accurate prediction of future image placement possible using current available head movement and position data. Experimental results indicate that effective <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> was reduced up to 90 % from the baseline system state. Implications for training systems and improved training will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{guidance}} {{information that is}} available to the UAV operator typically suffers from limitations of data update rate and <b>system</b> <b>latency.</b> Even when using a flight director command display, the manual control task is considerably more difficult compared to piloting a manned aircraft. Results from earlier research into perspective guidance displays show that these displays provide performance benefits and suggest a reduction of {{the negative effects of}} <b>system</b> <b>latency.</b> The current study has shown that in case of limitations of data update rate and <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> the use of a conformal sensor overlay showing a perspective presentation of the trajectory constraints is consistently superior to the flight director command display.

40|$|With a pilots' {{increasing}} use {{of visual}} cue augmentation, much requiring extensive pre-processing, {{there is a need}} to establish criteria for new avionics/display design. The timeliness and synchronization of the augmented cues is vital to ensure the performance quality required for precision mission task elements (MTEs) where augmented cues are the primary source of information to the pilot. Processing delays incurred while transforming sensor-supplied flight information into visual cues are unavoidable. Relationships between maximum control system delays and associated flying qualities levels are documented in MIL-F- 83300 and MIL-F- 8785. While cues representing aircraft status may be just as vital to the pilot as prompt control response for operations in instrument meteorological conditions, presently, there are no specification requirements on avionics <b>system</b> <b>latency.</b> To produce data relating avionics <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> to degradations in flying qualities, the Navy conducted two simulation investigations. During the investigations, flying qualities and performance data were recorded as simulated avionics <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> was varied. Correlated results of the investigation indicates that there is a detrimental impact of latency on flying qualities. Analysis of these results and consideration of key factors influencing their application indicate that: (1) Task performance degrades and pilot workload increases as latency is increased. Inconsistency in task performance increases as latency increases. (2) Latency reduces the probability of achieving Level 1 handling qualities with avionics <b>system</b> <b>latency</b> as low as 70 ms.
