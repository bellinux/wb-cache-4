50|$|A five door two <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> van version, {{named the}} Škoda Praktik, was {{launched}} in March 2007. There was speculation that production would end in 2014, and on 30 April 2015, the last Roomster rolled off the production line in Kvasiny. Decreased demand could be blamed on the Yeti.|$|E
50|$|The slats {{that were}} set shallowly {{into the side}} element {{were not able to}} {{withstand}} abrupt burdens and so are replaced by perforated three-dimensionally bent plywood, shaped to the contours of the body. The panels are inserted between two sidepieces. The edge pieces {{on the front of the}} <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> and the top of the back panel are replaces by glued strips.In 1954, Model No. 56 was accepted for mass production under the name Rex 120.|$|E
5000|$|There was a five door two <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> van {{version of}} the Roomster called the Škoda Praktik (Typ 5J8). Its cargo space is 1605 mm long, 1016 mm wide (minimum), and 900 mm in height - giving a cargo load space of 1900 L, and a payload from 550 to 640 kg. It also {{includes}} a moveable internal load bulked, hidden underfloor storage, anti slip load bay floor covering with six lashing points, and full length roof rails.|$|E
2500|$|Around the perimeter, 1,750 {{columns and}} 216 raking beams {{provides}} the main support. Around the field, 900m of retaining walls stretches 8m high. A total of 1,780 pre-cast concrete <b>seating</b> <b>panels</b> creates the bowl form. There are over [...] of floor space within the stadium structure..|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the house follows a center-hall plan, with a wide central hall decorated with wallpaper that is a reproduction (made in 1900) of older wallpaper found in the house. The two parlor chambers and dining room have mahogany window <b>seats,</b> <b>paneled</b> chimney surrounds, and folding inside window shutters. The dining room and south parlor have wallpaper painted in 1900 by George Porter Fernald.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was given redesigned front <b>seats,</b> door <b>panels,</b> dashboard and controls (including a new steering wheel), and instrument panels.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dark Star" [...] Commander Powell {{was killed}} during {{hyperdrive}} {{as a result}} of an electrical short behind his rear <b>seat</b> <b>panel,</b> but remains onboard ship in a state of cryogenic suspension. The ship's remaining crew consists of Lt. Doolittle (helmsman, and originally second-in-command), Sgt. Pinback (bombardier), Cpl. Boiler (navigator), and Talby (target specialist). The crew members perform their jobs with abject boredom, as the tedium of their tasks over 20 years has driven them [...] "around the bend." [...] They have created distractions for themselves: Doolittle, formerly a surfer from Malibu, California, has constructed a musical bottle organ; Talby spends his time in the ship's observation dome, content to watch the universe go by; Boiler obsessively trims his moustache, enjoys smoking cigars, and shoots targets with the ship's emergency laser rifle in a corridor.|$|E
50|$|Essentially the {{new model}} was a revised and updated version of the 308 GTS, which had survived for eight years without any radical change to the overall shape, albeit with various changes to the 3-litre engine. The 328 model {{presented}} a softening of the wedge profile of its predecessor, with a redesigned nose that had a more rounded shape, which was complemented by similar treatment to the tail valance panel. The revised nose and tail sections featured body colour bumpers integral with the valance panels, which reflected the work done concurrently to present the Mondial 3.2 models, with which they also shared a similar radiator grille and front light assembly layout. Thus all the eight-cylinder cars in the range shared fairly unified front and rear aspects, providing a homogeneous family image. The exhaust air louvres behind the retractable headlight pods on the 308 series disappeared, coupled {{with an increase in}} the size of the front lid radiator exhaust air louvre, which had been introduced on the 308 Quattrovalvole models, whilst a new style and position of exterior door catch was also provided. The interior trim also had a thorough overhaul, with new designs for the <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> upholstery and stitching, revised door panels and pulls, together with more modern switchgear, which complemented the external updating details. Optional equipment available was air conditioning, metallic paint, Pirelli P7 tyres, a leather dashboard, leather headlining to the removable roof panel plus rear window surround, and a rear aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} save weight and reduce {{the impact on the}} environment, the {{aerospace}} industry keeps searching for strong and lightweight materials to reduce fuel consumption. A relatively new manufacturing technique made it possible to print nylon, reinforced with continuous unidirectional carbon fibres on a layer-by-layer basis and praised itself for making materials as strong as Aluminium 6061 -T 6. In this study, several coupons were 3 D printed and tested in tensile, compression and three point bending mode to determine the material properties. When loaded {{in the direction of the}} fibres, the material did not live up to the upper limit of the rule of mixtures for fibre reinforced composites, which is mainly due to the amount of voids in the material. These voids were discovered when studying the micro-structure of the material and were both in between the layers, as well as in the layers themselves. The mechanical tests were performed to validate constructed finite element models, simulated in Abaqus/CAE. The simulation results showed some mismatches with the mechanical test results, which were caused by the assumptions made to simplify the models. Finally, an air plane chair bracket, which has as task to transfer loads from the back <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> to the chair, was modelled, simulated and designed. Major issues in the designing process were the limitations of the printer, such as not being able to choose which exact areas to reinforce in a specific layer. The final design of the chair bracket was manufactured and was tested to see if it could withstand a load of 375 N. The part did not fracture under the load, but a high displacement of the back seat was observed, as well as damage occurring at other locations than the simulations indicated. The study showed that this 3 D printing technique is able to print structural aerospace parts, given that the part is not too complex and that it is loaded in a static nature. More freedom in the design software of the 3 D printer could allow the user to successfully design more complex structural aerospace parts. Since the constructed parts were only tested under static loading, further research has to be conduction into dynamic loading of these parts before it is possible to actually implement these in air planes. <br/...|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Australian stock saddle {{was designed}} for security and comfort in the saddle no matter how harsh the conditions. While having stylistic roots from the English saddle {{in the design of}} the <b>seat,</b> <b>panels,</b> fenders, and stirrups, it has a much deeper seat, higher cantle, and knee pads in the front to create a very secure saddle for riders who ride in rough conditions or spend long hours on a horse.|$|R

50|$|An 1850s Renaissance style trestle {{table was}} {{supplied}} by Crace. Two alabaster models by G Andreoni of Pisa representing the Baptistry and church of Santa Maria della Spina were purchased by Blanche Kay-Shuttleworth in about 1880. An oak dining table with turned legs {{was made in}} 1881 by Gillows of Lancaster and the twist-turned oak dining chairs may also be by them. A carved oak Charles II armchair is one of' a pair made in Yorkshire in 1808 with <b>seat</b> <b>panels</b> in petitpoint floral work. The trestle fire screen has an embroidered panel. The mid-19th-century Feraghan carpet is of the same date, style and manufacture as one shown in N. F. Green's 1884 watercolour.|$|R

50|$|Historically, aircrew {{duties in}} {{military}} aircraft were highly specialised and rigid, because the relevant controls, instruments/displays, and/or weapons were concentrated {{in front of}} particular <b>seats,</b> <b>panels</b> or positions. That included two-seat variants of fighter or attack/strike aircraft (including late 20th century types such as the F-4 Phantom II, A-6 Intruder, F-111, Panavia Tornado, Sukhoi Su-17/20/22 and Su-30). However, more recently developed aircraft with two-member crews such as the F-14 Tomcat, F-15E Strike Eagle and F/A-18F Super Hornet often feature programmable multi-function displays, which allow roles to be more flexible than previous generation aircraft: multiple crew members can be responsible for detecting, targeting and engaging air-to-air or ground targets, communications, datalinks and/or defensive systems. Roles can be customized, based on experience, expertise, workload, tactics, and weapons being employed. Pilots usually retain the responsibility for flying the aircraft in tactical situations. However, bomber aircraft typically retain more rigidly defined and conventional roles.|$|R
