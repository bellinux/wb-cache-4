5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of <b>Spiegeleisen,</b> into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spiegeleisen</b> (literally [...] "mirror-iron", Spiegel—mirror or specular; Eisen—iron) is a {{ferromanganese}} alloy containing approximately 15% manganese {{and small}} quantities of carbon and silicon. <b>Spiegeleisen</b> is sometimes {{also referred to}} as specular pig iron, Spiegel iron, just Spiegel, or Bisalloy.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{material}} is a pig iron with high content of manganese, is called <b>spiegeleisen.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In more {{technical}} uses, {{there are also}} <b>spiegeleisen,</b> an alloy of iron, manganese, and carbon; and stellite, an alloy of cobalt, chromium, tungsten, and carbon.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century <b>spiegeleisen</b> {{was made}} either by mixing iron ores with {{appropriate}} levels of manganese and smelting them directly, or by adding pyrolusite or manganite to previously smelted iron in a cupellation furnace ...|$|E
50|$|The steel {{produced}} comprised {{a mixture}} of different ores {{in an attempt to}} achieve the most useful material. In descending proportional order these were from the Workington, Harrington, West Cumberland, Wigan, Weardale and Forest of Dean areas. <b>Spiegeleisen</b> (an iron-carbon-manganese alloy) was added to the mixture.|$|E
50|$|Mushet's {{solution}} was simple, but elegant; he first burnt off, {{as far as}} possible, all the impurities and carbon, then reintroduced carbon and manganese by adding an exact amount of <b>spiegeleisen.</b> This {{had the effect of}} improving the quality of the finished product, increasing its malleability - its ability to withstand rolling and forging at high temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Spathic {{iron ores}} {{are rich in}} {{manganese}} and have negligible phosphorus. This led to their one major benefit, connected with the Bessemer steel-making process. Although the first demonstrations by Bessemer in 1856 had been successful, later attempts to reproduce this were infamously failures. Work by the metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet discovered {{that the reason for}} this was the nature of the Swedish ores that Bessemer had innocently used, being very low in phosphorus. Using a typical European high-phosphorus ore in Bessemer's converter gave a poor quality steel. To produce high quality steel from a high-phosphorus ore, Mushet realised that he could operate the Bessemer converter for longer, burning off all the steel's impurities including the unwanted phosphorus and the essential carbon, but then re-adding carbon, with manganese, {{in the form of a}} previously obscure ferromanganese ore with no phosphorus, <b>spiegeleisen.</b> This created a sudden demand for <b>spiegeleisen.</b> Although it was not available in sufficient quantity as a mineral, steelworks such as that at Ebbw Vale in South Wales soon learned to make it from the spathic siderite ores. For a few decades, spathic ores were now in demand and this encouraged their mining. In time though, the original 'acidic' liner, made from siliceous sandstone or ganister, of the Bessemer converter was replaced by a 'basic' liner in the developed Gilchrist Thomas process. This removed the phosphorus impurities as slag, produced by chemical reaction with the liner, and no longer required <b>spiegeleisen.</b> From the 1880s demand for the ores fell once again and many of their mines, including those of the Brendon Hills, closed soon after.|$|E
50|$|To {{make the}} steel legally {{it was decided}} to acquire the Bessemer patent rights. Zoheth S. Durfee went to England to acquire the patent rights to the Bessemer process. He was {{unsuccessful}} at this but did observe several European steelmakers and managed to get the rights to Englishman Robert Mushet's patent use of <b>spiegeleisen</b> (manganese-rich pig iron) for better overall quality of steel produced this way. Meanwhile, William F. Durfee (engineer and architect), Robert Mushet, Thomas Clare and John Brown were brought in by Ward to make the procedure necessary to produce Bessemer steel, especially using <b>spiegeleisen.</b> He succeeded in making Bessemer steel at the experimental works of the Kelly Pneumatic Process Company owned by Ward and his investors. The first Bessemer steel made in the United States was at this factory in 1865. In Henry Bessemer's autobiography he writes that the Bessemer process was first experimentally practised in the United States with a 3-ton converter, at the ironworks of Mr. E. B. Ward, at Wyandotte, near Detroit.|$|E
50|$|Mushet {{carried out}} many {{experiments}} with the metal, discovering {{that a small}} amount added during the manufacture of steel rendered it more workable when heated. It was not until 1856, however, that he realised the true potential of this property when his friend Thomas Brown brought him a piece of steel, made using the Bessemer Process, asking if he could improve its poor quality. Mushet carried out experiments on the sample, based on those he had previously carried out with <b>spiegeleisen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} was first discovered by English metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet, who had carried out thousands of {{experiments in the}} Forest of Dean. His method was to first burn off, as far as possible, all the impurities and carbon, then reintroduce carbon and manganese by adding an exact amount of <b>spiegeleisen.</b> This {{had the effect of}} improving the quality of the finished product, increasing its malleability—its ability to withstand rolling and forging at high temperatures and making it more suitable for a vast array of uses.|$|E

50|$|Ferrosilicon {{is used as}} {{a source}} of silicon to reduce metals from their oxides and to deoxidize steel and other ferrous alloys. This {{prevents}} the loss of carbon from the molten steel (so called blocking the heat); ferromanganese, <b>spiegeleisen,</b> silicides of calcium, and many other materials are used for the same purpose. It {{can be used to make}} other ferroalloys. Ferrosilicon is also used for manufacture of silicon, corrosion-resistant and high-temperature resistant ferrous silicon alloys, and silicon steel for electromotors and transformer cores. In the manufacture of cast iron, ferrosilicon is used for inoculation of the iron to accelerate graphitization. In arc welding, ferrosilicon can be found in some electrode coatings.|$|E
50|$|Bessemer {{licensed}} {{the patent}} for his process to five ironmasters, {{but from the}} outset, the companies had great difficulty producing good quality steel. Mr Göran Fredrik Göransson, a Swedish ironmaster, using the purer charcoal pig iron of that country, {{was the first to}} make good steel by the process, but only after many attempts. His results prompted Bessemer to try a purer iron obtained from Cumberland hematite, but even with this he had only limited success because the quantity of carbon was difficult to control. Robert Forester Mushet, had carried out thousands of experiments at Darkhill Ironworks, in the Forest of Dean, and had shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of carbon and manganese, in the form of <b>spiegeleisen.</b> This improved the quality of the finished product and increased its malleability.|$|E
50|$|The blowing of {{air through}} the {{molten pig iron}} {{introduces}} oxygen into the melt which results in oxidation, removing impurities found in the pig iron, such as silicon, manganese, and carbon {{in the form of}} oxides. These oxides either escape as gas or form a solid slag. The refractory lining of the converter also plays a role in the conversion — clay linings are used when there is little phosphorus in the raw material - this is known as the acid Bessemer process. When the phosphorus content is high, dolomite, or sometimes magnesite, linings are used in the alkaline Bessemer limestone process. These are also known as Gilchrist-Thomas converters, after their inventors, Percy Gilchrist and Sidney Gilchrist Thomas. In order to produce steel with desired properties, additives such as <b>spiegeleisen</b> (a ferromanganese alloy), can be added to the molten steel once the impurities have been removed.|$|E
50|$|The metal is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} the oxide with sodium, magnesium, aluminium, or by electrolysis. Pyrolusite is extensively used for the manufacture of <b>spiegeleisen</b> and ferromanganese and of various alloys such as manganese-bronze. As an oxidizing agent it {{is used in the}} preparation of chlorine; indeed, chlorine gas itself was first described by Karl Scheele in 1774 from the reaction products of pyrolusite and hydrochloric acid. Natural pyrolusite has been used in batteries, but high-quality batteries require synthetic products. Pyrolusite is also used to prepare disinfectants (permanganates) and for decolorizing glass. When mixed with molten glass it oxidizes the ferrous iron to ferric iron, and so discharges the green and brown tints (making it classically useful to glassmakers as a decolorizer). As a coloring material, it is used in calico printing and dyeing; for imparting violet, amber, and black colors to glass, pottery, and bricks; and in the manufacture of green and violet paints.|$|E
40|$|Od 1949. - 1953. godine promatrano je 10 slučajeva profesionalnog manganizma u jednoj tvornici manganskih legura, gdje su radnici bili izvrgnuti manganskom dimu i prašini. Uz povremeno prekidanje rada sveukupna je ekspozicija trajala od 18 mjeseci do 12 godina. Klinička slika je odgovarala simptomima laganog parkinsonizma. Kod 2 radnika se intoksikacija manifestirala slikom hemiparkinsonizma: jedan od ta dva bolesnika pokazivao je i »pijetlov hod«. Kod jednog bolesnika nađeni su i simptomi lezije piramidnog puta, a kod drugog opet hemihipeslezija. Česti simptom bili su mišićni grčevi (krampi) i prisilni smijeh, dok je samo jedan bolesnik pokazivao prisilni plač. U krvnoj slici nađena je umjerena leukopenija (4. 200 - 4. 700 leukocita) kod 5 bolesnika. Funkcionalne jetrene probe dale su normalne nalaze. Biopsija jetre izvršena je kod 5 bolesnika. Samo kod jednoga nađeno je jako nakupljanje pigmenta, koji nije pokazivao pozitivnu reakciju na željezo. Kod ostala četiri nalaz je bio normalan. Cerebrospinalni likvor ispitan je kod 8 bolesnika. Kod trojice nalaz je bio normalan. Kod ostalih 5 nađene je jedamput lagana pleocitoza. Pandy-jeva reakcija bila je kod jednoga +, a kod trojice ±; jedamput je sveukupna količina bjelančevina bila umjereno povišena, a kod petorice postojale su manje promjene u koloidnim reakcijama. Pneumoencefalogram je učinjen kod dva bolesnika. Kod jednoga je nalaz bio u granicama normalnih varijacija, a kod drugoga su nađeni znakovi početne difuzne cerebralne atrofije. Eletkroencefalogram je učinjen kod 6 bolesnika. Tek kod jednoga postojala je umjerena difuzna abnormalnost. Kod 7 bolesnika primijenjena je terapija BAL-om prema shemi po Thompsonu, a kod jednoga terapija piridoksinom, ali bez vidljivog efekta. U opsežnom pregledu {{literature}} prikazana su naziranja o ulozi mangana u živoj prirodi, o industrijskoj primjeni mangana, o izvorima industrijskih otrovanja i o toksikologiji i farmakologiji mangana. Istaknuta je uloga dispozicije prema podacima sakupljenim iz literature. Prikazana je simptomatologija manganizma, iznesena su mišljenja o djelovanju mangana na jetru, krvnu sliku, pluća i na ostale organe. Na koncu je spomenuto nekoliko kratkih preporuka za prevenciju industrijskog manganizma. U »Dodatku« su prikazani slučajevi iz vlastite prakse. Ten {{cases of}} occupational manganese poisoning having {{occurred in a}} plant producing manganese alloys (ferromanganese, <b>spiegeleisen,</b> silicomanganese and silicospiegel) are reported. All of these patients were engaged on the same work {{in which they were}} highly exposed to the inhalation of manganese are dust and manganese fumes. The manufacturing method of the plant is briefly described. The total length of exposure to manganese varied between 18 months and 12 years. The most prominent neurological signs corresponded to a mild form of parkinsonian syndrome, in two cases with prevailing unilateral manifestations. The main neurological features were disturbances of gait, present in all cases: patients gave a history of weakness in the legs (and some of them in the arms); the gait was found to be slapping and in one case the so-called »cock-walk« was observed; retropulsin and propulsion, masklike face. increased muscle tone. inconstant tremor of the hands and of extended tongue, disturbances in speech with palialic and slow, monotones voice, and micrographia were often noted. Nearly all patients complained of muscular cramps. Uncontrollable laughter less frequently weeping, were also noticed. Symptoms of the affection of the pyramidal tract were also seen in one patient and hemihypaesthesia in another. In blood picture only a slight leucopenia (4, 2 - 4, 7 WBC) in 5 patients was found. Liver function tests revealed no abnormalities. Liver biopsy performed in 5 cases showed no histological changes; in one of these, however a pigment which did not give positive iron reaction, was discovered in large quantities in liver tissue. Cerebrospinal fluid, examined in 8 cases, gave normal findings in 3 and slight abnormalities in others: globulin reactions were in one case clearly positive and in subsequent three slightly positive; in five patients there were small changes in mastix and collargol reactions. Pneumoencephalography was performed in two cases: there was a normal finding in one and a slight diffuse cerebral atrophy in the other. Six patient were submitted to electroencephalographic examination: one record was of explicity low voltage, another one exhibited an abnormality consisting of bursts of generalised medium voltage slow and fast activity; all older records were normal. Treatment with 2. 3 -dimcrcaplopropanol (B. A. L.) was tried in seven cases following the dosage which Thompson suggested for the treatment of hepatolenticular degeneration. ln another case pyridoxine was also tried. The patients failed to respond to both kinds of therapy. A detailed account is given of occurrence of manganese in the nature and its occurrence and role in plant and animal tissue. Industrial uses of manganese, its alloys and compounds are listed. The industries and technical processes which give or might give rise to occupational manganese poisoning are described. The sources of occupational poisoning reported in literature up lo the present time are reviewed. The importance of a particular disposition towards manganese poisoning as evidenced by numerous examples from literature is emphasized. Opinions are put forward on the toxicity of manganese and its action upon liver, blood, lungs and oilier organs. An analysis of symptoms and a comparison with the clinical feature of manganese poisoning as described by other authors is made. Some control methods for the prevention of further manganese poisoning in the plant are recommended. Case histories of patients are added...|$|E
