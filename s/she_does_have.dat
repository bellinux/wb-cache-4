25|$|The risk {{of stroke}} {{increases}} exponentially from 30 years of age, {{and the cause}} varies by age. Advanced age {{is one of the}} most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of strokes occur in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of strokes occur in those over the age of 65. A person's risk of dying if he or <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a stroke also increases with age. However, stroke can occur at any age, including in childhood.|$|E
25|$|Although {{advice from}} the Prime Minister to the Queen is binding, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> to officially accept or assent in order for it to go into effect. The Governor-General's office source said that no {{decision}} from Elizabeth II had been made yet as to whether Itelali's removal by Telavi would be accepted, and thus, {{at the time of}} dismissing Telavi, Itelali remained the incumbent Governor-General of Tuvalu. It is suspected the Queen deliberately chose to take time before officially accepting the advice in order to allow Itelali to remove Telavi. Once Telavi was removed his pending advice to the Queen becomes moot, and Itelali remained Governor-General.|$|E

500|$|Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network {{was more}} {{critical}} of the character, calling her [...] "a blank slate". She said Akane is [...] "uninteresting and forgettable, and her previous role in the show as the moral compass seems to have waned as well". Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post was more optimistic; he said, [...] "Akane provides a good voice for this, since she’s new to it all and wants to bring nuance to the numbers and the situations, but we see how experience plays out against her at times, but also that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> something to offer with it".|$|E

This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself {{as a man of}} the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, [...] "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat.

While Bush's is a silent presence in a wedding dress {{throughout most of the}} film, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> several lines of dialogue with Peter Richardson in two dream sequences. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced the theme song [...] "Ken", which includes a vocal performance by Bush. The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council, who would later be elected as mayor of London and at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.|$|E

She views herself as [...] "not a typical rock star wife". Their marriage has been {{considered one of the}} most long-lived and stable in the entertainment world. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> to deal with the psychological effects of her husband coming off tour and readjusting to domestic life. After the extended 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour, full of sensory overloads and alternate stage personae for Bono, the couple began a practice of hosting Sunday lunches at home, to establish a sense of regular, ordinary activities. The family became fixtures at Sunday services in Killiney as well, with a bond of Christianity still existing between the couple. She has stated, [...] "I've no desire to be a star," [...] seeing the effect intense public attention has had on both her husband and on Adi Roche.|$|E
500|$|Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, {{little is}} known of her {{personal}} feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> {{a deep sense of}} religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.Shawcross, pp. 194–195 Aside from her official religious role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is personally a member of that church and the national Church of Scotland. She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she spoke about the theological significance of the millennium marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus:To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.Shawcross, pp. 236–237 ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics.

[...] A NME staff reviewer considered the track [...] "absolutely frightening," [...] with Tracy E.

[...] While reviewing 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, Jocelyn Vena of MTV considered the song, along with [...] "Toxic", [...] "old-school jams".

[...] Noting the singles [...] "Goodies," [...] "1, 2 Step," [...] and [...] "Oh" [...] as {{standout}} tracks, Allmusic gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a few treats in store." [...] Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, [...] "The talent is obviously there but if we are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about [...] "the other chicks" [...] then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Caryn Grant {{wrote that}} [...] "the album {{is at its}} strongest when Madonna shoves {{everyone}} {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight. So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
