5|$|Bathhouses are {{designed}} with imagery and music to create <b>surroundings</b> that are arousing to the visitors.|$|E
5|$|Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos – eastern crow: northeastern United States, eastern Canada and <b>surroundings.</b> Largest subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of hygiene {{was created to}} prevent infection or food spoiling by eliminating microbes, especially bacteria, from the <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Harmony Road, the {{suburban}} <b>surroundings</b> quickly transition to agricultural land. The highway curves around {{the south side}} of Bowmanville and travels towards Highway35 and Highway115.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their <b>surroundings,</b> while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Slab {{avalanches}} {{occur in}} snow {{that has been}} deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its <b>surroundings</b> by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, {{a purple}} eight-legged lizard monster with a chameleon-like {{ability to change}} skin color and blend in {{completely}} with his <b>surroundings.</b> He is a snide and preening character who makes himself a rival to Sulley and Mike in scream collection.|$|E
5|$|The Park {{contains}} several well-marked trails {{which allow}} visitors {{to view the}} geology of the canyon and its <b>surroundings,</b> which spans millions of years.|$|E
5|$|The conifer and mixed-forests of {{the park}} and its <b>surroundings</b> provide {{habitats}} for northern saw-whet owl, blue-headed vireo, hermit thrush, dark-eyed junco, and magnolia, pine, yellow-rumped, Blackburnian, and black-throated green warblers. The deciduous forests provide habitats for songbirds, such as scarlet tanager and red-eyed vireo.|$|E
5|$|The {{route and}} <b>surroundings</b> of former Highway36 have largely {{remained}} unaltered since the highway was decommissioned in 1998. Within the City of Kawartha Lakes, {{the road is}} now known as Kawartha Lakes Road36, while within the County of Peterborough, it is known as Peterborough County Road36.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the Street Road intersection, PA 232 passes into Solebury Township and crosses the Pidcock Creek. The road continues through {{a mix of}} farms and woods with some residential areas. As the route approaches Aquetong Road, the <b>surroundings</b> become more forested and the road parallels Dark Hollow Run, briefly passing through farm fields. The road enters the borough of New Hope, where it terminates at a junction with Main Street (PA 32).|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the <b>surroundings</b> of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its <b>surroundings,</b> and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|As a child, {{director}} Pete Docter relocated {{with his}} family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen. While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new <b>surroundings,</b> Docter felt he was judged constantly by peers. While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation. His social anxiety ended by high school.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate <b>surroundings.</b> His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its <b>surroundings.</b> Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beato {{was very}} active while in Japan. In 1865 he {{produced}} a number of dated views of Nagasaki and its <b>surroundings.</b> From 1866 he was often caricatured in Japan Punch, which was founded and edited by Wirgman. In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama, Beato lost his studio and many, perhaps all, of his negatives.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at a {{junction}} with US23/M-50 between Ida and Maybee, M-130 traveled northeasterly along Ida–Maybee Road {{across the}} Raisin River before turning southeast on North Custer Road. M-130 {{ran along the}} northern banks of the river passing through primarily agricultural areas. The rural <b>surroundings</b> dominated much of the route until it began to encroach {{on the outskirts of}} Monroe. The highway terminated at US24 in Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham {{the river}} leaves behind the {{built-up}} area of Newbury and runs in generally rural <b>surroundings.</b> It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Brașov and its <b>surroundings,</b> {{including}} the city's Black Church, were severely affected. According to local chronicles, {{in the village}} of Bod, more than 50 houses and several churches were damaged or destroyed. In Feldioara, a column of water rose several meters into the air from a crack caused by the earthquake. Buildings collapsed in Sibiu, {{including the}} city's Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} {{and they}} use a snowmobile to reach the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable <b>surroundings</b> and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach {{what appears to be}} their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad has happened to their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the <b>surroundings,</b> making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their <b>surroundings.</b> September Morn is typical of his style.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Downtown and its {{immediate}} <b>surroundings</b> consist largely of low-rise masonry buildings (often Federal style and Greek Revival) interspersed with modern highrises, {{notably in the}} Financial District, Government Center, and South Boston. Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science Center, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and New England's two tallest buildings: the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the <b>surroundings</b> and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Filatov {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia, to parents Slava and Yelena. He speaks fluent English {{due in large part}} to his mother—an English teacher who used to give him lessons at home. When he started playing {{professional}} hockey in North America for Syracuse, his mother stayed for several weeks to help him get acclimated to his new <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} {{west to the}} highway's end on Long Island Sound, CR101 follows a mostly east–west {{alignment}} through Sands Point. Along this last stretch, the route passes {{to the south of}} Sands Point County Park and north past Sands Point Golf Club as the <b>surroundings</b> around the route become increasingly forested and undeveloped. At Tibbits Lane, the route turns to the northwest and continues to the road's end at a dead end on the southern shore of Long Island Sound.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. The fungus has been noted to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural <b>surroundings</b> by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those <b>surroundings.</b> For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the <b>surroundings</b> remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers exemplify a {{range of}} anti-predator adaptations, {{enabling}} them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, {{and in some cases}} to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Highway132 {{is a short}} {{connector}} {{highway that}} travels between Dacre and Renfrew, connecting Highway41 with Highway17 via Highway60. The majority of the route travels through the Canadian Shield, {{with the exception of}} the final few kilometres approaching Renfrew, where it descends into the Ottawa Valley. Because of its rugged <b>surroundings,</b> there is relatively little human habitation along the route outside of the communities of Dacre and Shamrock.|$|E
