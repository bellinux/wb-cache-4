Chowder has opened {{up a lot of}} awesome possibilities for me, and creatively I'm feeling more inspired than ever." [...] C.H. Greenblatt also noted that many of the staff signed on to a new project at Disney, which would end up being the Disney Channel animated series Fish Hooks, which Greenblatt worked on as an episode director.
