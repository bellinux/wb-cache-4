Virginia Republican Bob Marshall noted on CNN that [...] "Sodomy is not a civil right", and stated that Thorne-Begland's homosexuality would make it impossible for him to judge cases impartially: [...] "if you have a bar room fight between a homosexual and heterosexual, I'm concerned about possible bias." [...] Republican senate candidate and former senator George Allen expressed disagreement with the vote, stating that judges should be appointed based on judicial qualifications rather than sexual orientation. Stephanie Cutter of US President Barack Obama's re-election campaign described Thorne-Begland as [...] "overly-qualified" [...] for the post, stating [...] "He is a well-known successful prosecutor ... That is how the legislature <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> these decisions. Not based on someone's own sexual orientation." [...] The campaign of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declined to comment.|$|E

500|$|In Morning, a lady {{makes her}} way to church, {{shielding}} herself with her fan from the shocking view of two men pawing at the market girls. The scene is {{the west side of}} the piazza at Covent Garden, indicated by a part of the Palladian portico of Inigo Jones's Church of St Paul visible behind Tom King's Coffee House, a notorious venue celebrated in pamphlets of the time. Henry Fielding mentions the coffee house in both The Covent Garden Tragedy and Pasquin. At the time Hogarth produced this picture, the coffee house was being run by Tom's widow, Moll King, but its reputation had not diminished. Moll opened the doors once those of the taverns had shut, allowing the revellers to continue enjoying themselves from midnight until dawn. The Mansion House with columned portico visible in the centre of the picture, No. 43 King Street, is attributed to architect Thomas Archer (later 1st Baron Archer) and occupied by him at the date of Hogarth's works. It was situated on the north side of the piazza, while the coffee house was on the south side, as depicted in Hogarth's original painting. In the picture, it is early morning and some revellers are ending their evening: a fight has broken out in the coffee house and, in the melée, a wig flies out of the door. [...] Meanwhile, stallholders set out their fruit and vegetables for the day's market. Two children who <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> their way to school have stopped, entranced by the activity of the market, in a direct reference to Swift's A Description of the Morning in which children [...] "lag with satchels in their hands". Above the clock is Father Time and below it the inscription Sic transit gloria mundi. The smoke rising from the chimney of the coffee house connects these portents to the scene below.|$|E

The faction that included Poynter felt strongly that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> formal proposals for research for the Science Advisory Committee to evaluate. The other faction included Abigail Alling, the titular director of research inside the bubble, and who sided with John Allen in blocking that move.

Leigh, meanwhile, closed her modeling agency {{when she was pregnant}} with her third child in 1948. Leigh called Eileen and told them that her 15-years younger sister, Suzy Parker, was making only $25 per hour working as a model for Huntington Hartford. Leigh felt Suzy, although only 16 years old, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> $40 per hour, and told Ford she would join her two-year-old agency only if they took Parker sight-unseen.

2500|$|In 1971, at {{the urging}} of The Cavaliers founder Don Warren and Troopers founder Jim Jones, the Blue Stars, The Cavaliers, Madison Scouts, Santa Clara Vanguard, and the Troopers formed the Midwest Combine. A similar group of Eastern corps, the United Organization of Junior Corps (also known as the [...] "Alliance"), was formed by the 27th Lancers, Garfield Cadets, Boston Crusaders, Blessed Sacrament Golden Knights, and Blue Rock.These actions were taken in {{reaction}} to the rigid, inflexible rules of the American Legion and VFW (the primary rule makers and sponsors of both corps and shows) and the low-to-nonexistent performance fees paid for appearing in the various competitions. The corps felt that not only were they having their creative potential as artistic performing groups stifled, but they were being financially starved. The two groups' members felt that the corps <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> their own rules, operating their own competitions and championships, and keeping the bulk of the monies those shows earned. For the 1971 season, the Combine and the Alliance stuck together, with both groups offering show promoters their five corps as a package. Despite pressure on show sponsors, judges, and other drum corps, the corps were not only booked into a number of shows together, but the Combine found a host for a show of their own, which was a spectacular success despite fears of failure that lasted until a standing-room-only crowd arrived literally at the last moment. In 1972, the ten corps from the Alliance and the Midwest Combine, plus the Anaheim Kingsmen, Argonne Rebels, and De La Salle Oaklands were the founding members of Drum Corps International. The inaugural DCI World Championships were held at Warhawks Stadium on the campus of University of Wisconsin–Whitewater with 39 corps from 15 states and one Canadian province in competition. The Anaheim Kingsmen were crowned the first DCI World Champions on August 18, 1972.|$|E
