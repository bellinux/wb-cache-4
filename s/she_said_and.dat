5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

25|$|Hairdressing takes {{almost two}} hours, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> while {{my hair is}} busy, my mind stays idle. I am afraid that my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser. Hence my {{headache}} afterwards. The Empress {{sat at a table}} which was moved {{to the middle of the}} room and covered with a white cloth. She was shrouded in a white, laced peignoir, her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.|$|E

25|$|She married James Lloyd Crawford, a {{real estate}} salesman, on March 21, 1941, in Tucson, Arizona. According to Donald Bogle, in his book Bright Boulevards, Bold Dreams, McDaniel happily confided to gossip {{columnist}} Hedda Hopper in 1945 that she was pregnant. McDaniel began buying baby clothes {{and set up a}} nursery in her house. Her plans were shattered when she suffered a false pregnancy and fell into a depression. She never had any children. She divorced Crawford in 1945, after {{four and a half years}} of marriage. Crawford had been jealous of her career success, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> once threatened to kill her.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Neil Strauss, {{commenting on}} Love in 1995, noted {{that she had}} [...] "acquired a strange {{distinction}} reserved for Presidents, major felons and celebrity widows: every word <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> wrote became newsworthy. Her postings on the computer bulletin board America Online were repeated word for word in magazines; her arrests, scandals and the drug overdose of the bassist in her band, Hole, made national headlines." [...] Many journalists have labeled her the [...] "Yoko Ono" [...] of Generation X, comparing her relationship to husband Kurt Cobain to that of John Lennon and Ono.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Carina MacKenzie {{wrote of}} the sixth-season episode [...] "Invasion": [...] "By far the best moment in this episode was Robbins' scene with Torres' father, Carlos. Jessica Capshaw has an {{incredible}} ability to take even the most melodramatic of [...] "Grey's" [...] speeches and deliver them with a subtlety and an honesty that makes them come off as sincere instead of overwrought. [...] "I was named for a battleship," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> in the powerful monologue that followed, she calmly and carefully explained that Torres was still the woman Carlos raised.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "working mom", as {{described}} by Paltrow, Elizabeth is the central figure in the detective process. Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Elizabeth was [...] "lucky", as she thought the disease's survivors were being left {{to deal with the}} newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs {{to be used in the}} film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. [...] "I was just another tourist taking pictures", <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> added, [...] "I did feel a little pressure. When Steven Soderbergh gives you a photo assignment, you had better come back with something decent." ...|$|E
500|$|When Will ridicules Sue's fashion sense, Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{give her}} a makeover, recreating Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] video. Guidance {{counsellor}} Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is inspired by Madonna's example, and tells Will that she intends to lose her virginity to him that evening. Santana (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does have sex with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless, and that he truly regretted it, in contrasted with Rachel, who despite not going through with it, claims she did as <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> {{it was no big}} deal.|$|E
500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, how wonderful it is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the first}} of the old women rose up, holding the {{cauldron}} between her two hands, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> 'Pleasure,' <b>and</b> Hanrahan <b>said</b> no word. Then the second old woman rose up with the stone in her hands, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> 'Power'; <b>and</b> the third old woman rose up with the spear in her hand, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> 'Courage'; <b>and</b> the last of the old women rose up having the sword in her hands, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> 'Knowledge.' <b>And</b> everyone, after she had spoken, waited as if for Hanrahan to question her, but he said nothing at all. And then the four old women went out of the door, bringing their tour treasures with them, and as they went out one of them said, 'He has no wish for us'; <b>and</b> another <b>said,</b> 'He is weak, he is weak'; <b>and</b> another <b>said,</b> 'He is afraid'; <b>and</b> the last <b>said,</b> 'His wits are gone from him.' And then they all said 'Echtge, daughter of the Silver Hand, must stay in her sleep. It is a pity, it is a great pity.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Another phrase {{sometimes}} wrongly {{attributed to}} Steinem is, [...] "If men could get pregnant, abortion {{would be a}} sacrament."

500|$|Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene {{were then}} called by Nosanchuk. George Darby {{told the court}} that in his conversations with Lamb the {{defendant}} had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him {{in an interview that}} he treated all people [...] "like bugs" [...] except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: [...] "I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." [...] Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.|$|E
500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. also {{promoted}} the album with {{an appearance on}} the [...] "Late Show with David Letterman", during which she performed [...] "Born Free" [...] with Martin Rev of Suicide playing keyboards, backed {{by a group of}} dancers styled to look like M.I.A. In November 2010 she appeared on the British television show Later... with Jools Holland, performing [...] "Born Free" [...] and [...] "It Takes a Muscle", the latter with members of The Specials. While promoting the album, M.I.A. became involved in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times, who interviewed her in March 2010 and whose resulting article portrayed the singer as pretentious and attention seeking. In response, M.I.A. posted Hirschberg's telephone number on her Twitter page and later uploaded her own audio recording of the interview, highlighting the discrepancies between what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> what was reported. The piece was criticised for its yellow journalism by some, however M.I.A. received varying degrees of support and criticism for the ensuing fallout from the media. Benjamin Boles wrote in Now that, while Hirschberg's piece came across as a [...] "vicious ... character assassination", M.I.A's subsequent actions were [...] "childish" [...] and made her [...] "the laughing stock of the internet". The paper later printed a correction on the story, acknowledging that some quotes had been taken out of context. The incident prompted Boots Riley of the band Street Sweeper Social Club to comment on how artists had access to media that allowed writers to be held accountable and that M.I.A.'s move was [...] "brilliant".|$|E

2500|$|Benjamin {{repeatedly}} interrupted a major {{speech by}} U.S. President Barack Obama regarding United States {{policy in the}} War on Terror at the National Defense University on May 23, 2013. After Benjamin was removed for her actions, Mr. Obama then went off script. [...] "The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to," [...] he said. [...] "Obviously I {{do not agree with}} much of what <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>And</b> obviously she wasn't listening to me and much of what I said. But these are tough issues. And the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{starts with}} a {{traction}} town of London chasing and catching a town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy is in the [...] "Gut" [...] of London when this happens, along {{with the head of}} the Historians, Valentine, and his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook's Citizens, Hester Shaw, tries to kill Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a huge scar on her face and claims Valentine dealt it, before dropping out of London through a chute. Tom tells Valentine everything <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> Valentine promptly pushes him down after her. They recover outside of London, and after an argument start following its tracks to try and catch up.|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 1974, while {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the beauty of the dark-haired girl and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. [...] "This is a sign used by the early Christians," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> then left. Dick called the symbol the [...] "vesicle pisces". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile) which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.|$|E

2500|$|Remington's {{first trial}} began in late December 1950. Roy Cohn, later to become famous as Joseph McCarthy's chief counsel and already a noted anti-communist, joined the prosecution's legal team. [...] "Elizabeth Bentley later {{supplied}} {{a wealth of}} detail about Remington's involvement with her and the espionage conspiracy. Remington's defense {{was that he had}} never handled any classified material, hence could not have given any to Miss Bentley. But she remembered all the facts about the rubber-from-garbage invention. We had searched through the archives and discovered the files on the process. We also found the aircraft schedules, which were set up exactly as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> inter office memos and tables of personnel which proved Remington had access to both these items. We also discovered Remington's application for a naval commission in which he specifically pointed out that he was, in his present position with the Commerce Department, entrusted with secret military information involving airplanes, armaments, radar, and the Manhattan Project (the atomic bomb)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Dutch film {{director}} Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi action film Total Recall (1990), with Arnold Schwarzenegger, {{she played the}} role of [...] Lori Quaid, the seemingly loving wife of Schwarzenegger's character, later revealed to be an agent sent by a corrupt and ruthless governor to monitor him. The film received favorable reviews and made [...] US$$261.2 million worldwide, giving Stone's career a major boost. [...] She appeared in five feature films the following year, through those were smaller-scale productions than that of Total Recall; she appeared alongside Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Perkins and Nathan Lane in the romantic comedy He Said, <b>She</b> <b>Said,</b> <b>and</b> starred in the psychological thriller Scissors, as a sexually repressed woman who becomes trapped in a mysterious apartment. She starred opposite Forest Whitaker in the dramatic thriller Diary of a Hitman, screened at the Deauville Film Festival in September. and next, played a sexually provocative young photojournalist in the little-seen Year of the Gun (1991).

Beyond those four points no ordinary creature can pass. [...] But I will give you a talisman that will help you."
