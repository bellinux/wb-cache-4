50|$|The chronaxie {{values for}} {{mammalian}} ventricles at body temperature range from 0.5 ms (human) to 2.0 to 4.1 ms (dog); {{this is an}} 8.2/1 ratio. It {{has been reported that}} large-diameter myelinated axons havechronaxie times ranging from 50 to 100 µs and 30 to 200 µs, and neuronal cell bodies and dendrites have chronaxie times ranging from 1 to 10 ms or even up to 30 ms. The chronaxietimes of grey matter were reported asbeing 380 +/- 191 ms and 200±700 ms. Interpretations ofchronaxie times are further confounded by additional factors. Thechronaxie times reported for soma and dendrites have been establishedusing intracellular pulses that cannot be readily extrapolated to extra-cellular stimuli. Datareported in the literature use either motor response as the physiologicalthreshold in humans or action potential generation in animals. Theseare largely based on stimulation through a macro-electrode, which inthe case of humans is a 1.5 Â 1.2-mm DBS electrode. Data derived from micro-electrodestimulation and physiological mapping of <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> are scarce.The two stimulation methods may result in significantly differentresults. Few studies have attempted to correlatechronaxie times with sensory perception, although understandingthe neural elements that are involved in a subjective percept, suchas tingling, has important physiological implications.The measurements were taken with different types of electrodes and with stimulators having unknown output impedances. The chronaxie values for human arm sensory nerves rangefrom 0.35 to 1.17 ms, a ratio of 3.3. The values were obtained with insufficient information to establishthe cause of variability. The chronaxie values for human denervated skeletal muscle ranges from 9.5 to 30 ms at body temperature, representing aratio of 3.16. A reduction in chronaxie occurs during reinnervation. The published values for chronaxie have a wide range. If chronaxie is the best descriptor of tissueexcitability in a homogeneous tissue specimen, at a known temperature, it should be determined with a constant-current stimulator providing a rectangular cathodal stimulus waveform.Chronaxie is derived from the strength-duration curve for current and it shows that if the stimulus duration is shorter than chronaxie, more current is required to stimulate,with any type or location of electrodes with a stimulator of any known or unknown output impedance.In addition, the chronaxie value, however determined, identifies the pulse duration for minimum energy. In addition,the charge delivered at chronaxie, however determined, is 2, twice the minimum charge. Therefore, if minimum charge delivery is sought to prolong the life of a battery in an implantedstimulator, a pulse duration of less than the measured chronaxie should be selected; a duration of one-tenth chronaxie providesa charge that is only 10% above the minimum charge.|$|E

Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and PVAG post-operatively from ten patients with neuropathic pain. The LFPs were quantified using spectral and time-frequency analysis, {{the relationship between the}} LFPs and pain relief was quantified with nonlinear correlation analysis. The theta oscillations of both <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and PVAG correlated inversely with pain relief. The high beta oscillations in the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the alpha oscillations in the PVAG correlated positively with pain relief. Moreover, the ratio of high-power duration to low-power duration of theta band activity in the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and PVAG correlated inversely with pain relief. The duration ratio at the high beta band in the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> correlated positively with pain relief. Our results reveal distinct neuronal oscillations at the theta, alpha, and beta frequencies correlating with pain relief by DBS.

40|$|Pain {{perception}} can {{be altered}} by activity in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). The PAG can decrease the incoming nociceptive signals {{at the level of}} the spinal dorsal horn, but it is not clear whether the PAG can also affect the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus,</b> ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial thalamic nuclei, to modulate pain. However, the PAG and the thalamus have direct connections with each other; so we postulated that the PAG may also modulate pain by inhibiting the sensory nuclei in the thalamus, and that these may also reciprocally influence the PAG. Here, by analyzing the local field potentials recorded from the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the PAG in chronic pain patients with deep brain stimulation electrodes, we show that PAG stimulation inhibited the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> with decreasing thalamic delta, theta, alpha and beta power, and <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> stimulation excited the PAG with increasing PAG delta and theta power. We demonstrate that the PAG and the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> interact reciprocally at short latency, which may be related to pain modulation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

30|$|Synchronous {{oscillations}} are {{prevalent in}} many areas of the brain including <b>sensory</b> cortices, <b>thalamus</b> and hippocampus [1]. Recordings of population activity based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the local field potential (LFP) often exhibit strong peaks in the power spectrum at certain characteristic frequencies. For example, in the visual system of mammals, cortical oscillations in the γ frequency band (20 - 70 Hz) are generated with a spatially distributed phase that is modulated by the nature of a visual stimulus. Stimulus-induced phase synchronization of different populations of neurons has been proposed as a potential solution to the binding problem, that is, how various components of a visual image are combined into a single coherently perceived object [2, 3]. An alternative suggestion is that such oscillations provide a mechanism for attentionally gating the flow of neural information [4, 5]. Neuronal oscillations may be generated by intrinsic properties of single cells or may arise through excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions within a local population of cells. Irrespective of the identity of the basic oscillating unit, synchronization can occur via mutual interactions between the oscillators or via entrainment to a common periodic stimulus in the absence of coupling.|$|R
40|$|The {{issues of}} {{temporal}} coding and the temporal organization of activity have aroused {{a great deal}} of interest in <b>sensory</b> systems, cortex, <b>thalamus,</b> and hippocampus. Strangely, despite the important timing roles attributed to the cerebellum, little consideration has been given to the organization of activity within the cerebellar circuitry. In fact, there is evidence of a remarkable temporal patterning of activity in even the earliest cerebellar recordings. The evidence for the existence of high-frequency oscillations in the cerebellar cortex is reviewed and possible mechanisms are discussed; one involves the synchrony of parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells. It is shown how synchronous and oscillatory activity can enable extremely precise timing and also how they can maximize the information storage capacity of the cerebellar cortex...|$|R
40|$|Backgrounds. The periaqueductal grey(PAG) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the descending pain modulation systems, which has been known to inhibit incoming nociceptive signals at the level of the spinal dorsal horn. But pain mechanism involves the brain and the spinal cord to maintain homeostasis, so theoretically pain modulation mechanism should involve both direction: ascending and descending pathways to the brain and spinal cord dorsal horn. However, literature addressing this question is limited. The <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> is the most important brain area receiving sensory signals. Moreover, with the fact that evidence indicates the PAG and the thalamus have functional connections, therefore we wanted to test if there is a functional connection between the PAG and the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> related to pain modulation. Aims. To investigate the functional connectivity between the periaqueductal grey and the sensory nuclei of the thalamus in pain modulation Methods. Three experiments have been conducted. The first experiment is to investigate the effect of PAG DBS on the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus,</b> and vice versa, in chronic neuropathic pain patients. The second experiment is to estimate the change of spectral coherence between the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the PAG during various pain states, when chronic neuropathic pain patients were being peripheral stimulated by ice to evoke pain. The third experiment is to test whether the functional connectivity between the two areas would be affected by general anaesthetics propofol. Results. PAG DBS inhibited the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> with decreasing thalamic delta, theta, alpha and beta power, and <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> DBS excited the PAG with increasing PAG delta and theta power. The PAG and the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> interact reciprocally at short latency, which may be related to pain modulation. The <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the periaqueductal grey also have high gamma coherence which would be inhibited by pain. This high-gamma coherence was increased during propofol induction period which is compatible with the hypothesis that propofol induces loss of consciousness via its GABAergic activity. Conclusions. This thesis suggests that the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the periaqueductal grey have a reciprocal connection. Functionally this connectivity might be related to pain modulation. Also this functional connectivity might represent the fact that the transmission and processing of pain signals is always monitored and modified by central pain modulation systems so that organisms can respond properly to the incoming signals. </p...|$|E

To better understand its efficacy, we performed a meta-analysis of DBS for pain relief. MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) databases were searched using key words deep brain stimulation, <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus,</b> periventricular gray and pain. Inclusion criteria were based on patient characteristics and protocol clarity. Six studies (between 1977 – 1997) fitting the criteria were identified. Stimulation sites included the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter (PVG/PAG), internal capsule (IC), and <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> (ST). The long-term pain alleviation rate was highest with DBS of the PVG/PAG (79 %), or the PVG/PAG plus sensory thalamus/internal capsule (87 %). Stimulation of the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> alone was less effective (58 % long-term success) (p < 0. 05). DBS was more effective for nociceptive than deafferentation pain (63 % vs 47 % long-term success; p < 0. 01). Long-term success was attained in over 80 % of patients with intractable low back pain (failed back surgery) following successful trial stimulation. Trial stimulation was successful in approximately 50 % of those with post-stroke pain, and 58 % of patients permanently implanted achieved ongoing pain relief. Higher rates of success were seen with phantom limb pain and neuropathies. We conclude that DBS is frequently effective when used in well-selected patients. Neuroimaging and neuromodulation technology advances complicate the application of these results to modern practice. Ongoing investigations should shed further light on this complex clinical conundrum...|$|E

The crucial aspect of testing graphesthesia, as with any sensory testing, is to establish that the patient understands the test, hence the test is commenced, in the hemiplegic patient, on the normal, intact hand. This also allows the examiner to establish the patient's numeracy, since semi-numerate patients may have difficulties performing the task.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify areas of brain activation during absence seizures in an awake animal model. METHODS: Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI in the brain was measured by using T 2 *-weighted echo planar imaging at 4. 7 Tesla. BOLD imaging was performed before, during, and after absence seizure induction by using gamma-butyrolactone (GBL; 200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). RESULTS: The corticothalamic circuitry, critical for spike-wave discharge (SWD) formation in absence seizure, showed robust BOLD signal changes after GBL administration, consistent with EEG recordings in the same animals. Predominantly positive BOLD changes occurred in the <b>thalamus.</b> <b>Sensory</b> and parietal cortices showed mixed positive and negative BOLD changes, whereas temporal and motor cortices showed only negative BOLD changes. CONCLUSIONS: With the BOLD fMRI technique, we demonstrated signal changes in brain areas that have been shown, with electrophysiology experiments, to be important for generating and maintaining the SWDs that characterize absence seizures. These results corroborate previous findings from lesion and electrophysiological experiments and show the technical feasibility of noninvasively imaging absence seizures in fully conscious rodents...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in animal models of cocaine addiction is an invaluable tool for investigating the neuroadaptations that lead to this psychiatric disorder. We used blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI in awake rats to identify the neuronal circuits affected by repeated cocaine administration. Rats were given an injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, i. p.) or its vehicle for 7 days, abstained from injections for 1 week, and challenged with an intracerebroventricular cocaine injection during functional imaging. Acute cocaine produced robust positive BOLD responses across well-known monoamine-enriched brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum, <b>sensory</b> cortex, hippocampus, <b>thalamus,</b> and midbrain areas. However, repeated cocaine administration resulted in lower BOLD responses in the prefrontal cortex, agranular insular cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and dorsomedial thalamus, among other brain regions. Reductions in BOLD intensity were not associated with variations in cerebrovascular reactivity between drug naive rats and those repeatedly exposed to cocaine. Therefore, the lower metabolic activation in response to cocaine could reflect a reduced neuronal and/or synaptic activity upon repeated administration...|$|R

Our data refute the idea that the primary <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> acts as a simple, relay nucleus: we find that the auditory thalamic receptive fields obtained in response to song are more complex than the ones found in the midbrain. Moreover, we find that linear tuning diversity and complexity in ovoidalis (Ov) are closer to those found in field L than in MLd. We also find prevalent tuning to intermediate spectral and temporal modulations, a feature that is unique to Ov.

40|$|Neocortex network {{activity}} {{varies from}} a desynchronized or activated state typical of arousal to a synchronized or deactivated state typical of quiescence. Such changes are usually {{attributed to the}} effects of neuromodulators released in the neocortex by nonspecific activating systems originating in basal forebrain and brain stem reticular formation. As a result, the only role attributed to thalamocortical cells projecting to primary sensory areas, such as barrel cortex, is to transmit sensory information. However, thalamocortical cells can undergo significant changes in spontaneous tonic firing as a function of state, although the role of such variations is unknown. Here we show that the tonic firing level of thalamocortical cells, produced by cholinergic and noradrenergic stimulation of the somatosensory thalamus in urethane-anesthetized rats, controls neocortex activation and deactivation. Thus in addition to its well-known role in the relay of <b>sensory</b> information, the <b>thalamus</b> can control the state of neocortex activation, which may complement the established roles in this regard of basal forebrain and brain stem nuclei. Because of the topographical organization of primary thalamocortical pathways, this mechanism provides a means by which area-specific neocortical activation can occur, which may be useful for modality-specific sensory processing or selective attention...|$|R
40|$|A brain {{computer}} interface (BCI) enables {{direct communication}} between a brain {{and a computer}} translating brain activity into computer commands using preprocessing, feature extraction and classification operations. Classification is crucial as it has a substantial effect on the BCI speed and bit rate.

40|$|The main {{impetus for}} a mini-symposium on corticothalamic interrelationships was the recent {{number of studies}} {{highlighting}} {{the role of the}} thalamus in aspects of cognition beyond <b>sensory</b> processing. The <b>thalamus</b> contributes to a range of basic cognitive behaviors that include learning and memory, inhibitory control, decision-making, and the control of visual orienting responses. Its functions are deeply intertwined with those of the better studied cortex, although the principles governing its coordination with the cortex remain opaque, particularly in higher-level aspects of cognition. How should the thalamus be viewed {{in the context of the}} rest of the brain? Although its role extends well beyond relaying of sensory information from the periphery, the main function of many of its subdivisions does appear to be that of a relay station, transmitting neural signals primarily to the cerebral cortex from a number of brain areas. In cognition, its main contribution may thus be to coordinate signals between diverse regions of the telencephalon, including the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. This central coordination is further subject to considerable extrinsic control, for example, inhibition from the basal ganglia, zona incerta, and pretectal regions, and chemical modulation from ascending neurotransmitter systems. What follows is a brief review on the role of the thalamus in aspects of cognition and behavior, focusing on a summary of the topics covered in a mini-symposium held at the Society for Neuroscience meeting, 2014...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarly life stress (ELS) is a {{risk factor}} for {{developing}} functional gastrointestinal disorders, and has been proposed to be related to a central amplification of sensory input and resultant visceral hyperalgesia. We sought to characterize ELS-related changes in functional brain responses during acute noxious visceral stimulation. Neonatal rats (males/females) were exposed to limited bedding (ELS) or standard bedding (controls) on postnatal days 2 – 9. Age 10 – 11 weeks, animals were implanted with venous cannulas and transmitters for abdominal electromyography (EMG). Cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was mapped during colorectal distension (CRD) using [14 C]-iodoantipyrine autoradiography, and analyzed in three-dimensionally reconstructed brains by statistical parametric mapping and functional connectivity. EMG responses to CRD were increased after ELS, with no evidence of a sex difference. ELS rats compared to controls showed a greater significant positive correlation of EMG with amygdalar rCBF. Factorial analysis revealed a significant main effect of ‘ELS’ on functional activation of nodes within the pain pathway (somatosensory, insular, cingulate and prefrontal cortices, locus coeruleus/lateral parabrachial n. [LC/LPB], periaqueductal gray, <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus),</b> {{as well as in the}} amygdala, hippocampus and hypothalamus. In addition, ELS resulted in an increase in the number of significant functional connections (i. e. degree centrality) between regions within the pain circuit, including the amygdala, LC/LPB, insula, anterior ventral cingulate, posterior cingulate (retrosplenium), and stria terminalis, with decreases noted in the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and the hippocampus. Sex differences in rCBF were less broadly expressed, with significant differences noted at the level of the cortex, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, raphe, <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus,</b> and caudate-putamen. ELS showed a sexually dimorphic effect (‘Sex x ELS’ interaction) at the LC/LPB complex, globus pallidus, hypothalamus, raphe, septum, caudate-putamen and cerebellum.

Each participant had previously undergone psychometric evaluation of each of the above areas as part of a routine presurgical neuropsychological assessment. Commensurate measures were employed at a follow-up assessment at least 6 months postsurgery. DBS significantly improved mood, anxiety, and aspects of quality of life. Improvements correlated with reduced pain severity. However, the sample continued to show impairments in most areas when compared against normative data published on nonclinical samples. There was little change in general cognitive functioning, aside from deterioration in spatial working memory. However, improvements in pain severity were associated with less improvement (and even deterioration) on measures of executive cognitive functioning. Improvements in emotional well-being also were correlated with changes in cognition.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in the computational intelligence (CI) community is to develop nature-inspired algorithms that can efficiently solve real-world problems such as the prediction of space weather phenomena. An early example {{in this context is}} taking inspiration from the biological neurons in the mammal’s nervous system and developing an artificial neuron. This work laid the foundation for artificial neural networks (ANNs) that aim to mimic the connections between neurons in the mammal’s nervous system and to develop an artificial model of the brain. ANNs are well-known CI models that have shown high generalization capability when solving real-world problems, e. g., chaotic time-series prediction problems. However, ANNs mostly tend to suffer from long computation time and high model complexity.  This thesis presents a new category of CI paradigms by taking inspiration from emotions, and these CI models are referred to as emotion-inspired computational intelligence models (EiCIs). In the thesis, I have outlined the preliminary steps that have been taken to develop EiCIs. These steps include studying different emotional theories and hypotheses, designing and implementing CI models for two specific applications in artificial intelligence (prediction and optimization), evaluating the performance of the new CI models, and comparing the obtained results with the results of well-known CI models (e. g., ANNs) and discussing the potential improvement that can be achieved. The first step, and a significant contribution of this thesis, is to review the various definitions of emotions and to investigate which emotional theories that are the most relevant for developing a CI model.  Amongst different theories and hypotheses of emotions, the fear conditioning hypothesis as well as affect theory have been two main sources of inspiration {{in the development of the}} EiCIs proposed in this thesis. The fear conditioning hypothesis that was first proposed by LeDoux reveals some important characteristics of the underlying neural structure of fear conditioning behavior in biological systems. Based on the features of such networks, it could be an applicable hypothesis to be the basis of the development of a subgroup of EiCIs that could be used for prediction applications, e. g. BELIMs (Brain Emotional Learning Inspired Models), and as emotion-inspired engines for decision-making applications. The second emotional theory of the thesis is the affect theory (which was first suggested by Silvan Tomkins) that describes what the basic emotions are and how they can be associated with facial expressions. A mechanism to express the basic emotional feelings is also useful in designing another category of EiCIs that are referred to as emotion-inspired optimization methods.  The fundamental hypotheses of the thesis, have led to developing EiCIs, can be presented as follows. The first hypothesis is that the neural structure of fear conditioning can be considered to be a nature-based system with the capability to show intelligent behavior through its functionality. This hypothesis is stated on the basis of the three main characteristics of the neural structure of fear conditioning behavior. The first characteristic is that the amygdala is the main center for processing fear-induced stimuli and that it provides the fear reaction through its interaction with other regions of the brain such as the <b>sensory</b> cortex, the <b>thalamus,</b> and the hippocampus. The second characteristic is that the procedure of processing of fearful stimuli and the provision of emotional reactions is simple and quick. The third aspect is that the amygdala not only provides fear responses but also learns to predict aversive events by interacting with other regions of the brain, which means that an intelligent behavior emerges. The second hypothesis is that the system in which the three monoamines neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenalin and thus produces emotional behaviors, can be viewed as a biological system associated with the emergence of intelligent behavior. The above hypotheses state that a suitable way to develop new CI models is to take inspiration from the neural structure of fear conditioning and the natural system of three monoamine neurotransmitters. A significant contribution of this thesis is the evaluation of the ability of EiCIs by examining them to solve real-world problems such as the prediction of space weather phenomena (e. g., predicting real time-series such as sunspot number, auroral electrojet index, and disturbance time index) and the optimization of some central procedures in network communications. These evaluations have led to that comparable results have been obtained, which in turn supports the conclusion that EiCIs have acceptable and reasonable performance regarding computation time and model complexity. However, to achieve the final goal of the research study (i. e., to develop a CI model with low computation time and low model complexity), some enhancements of EiCIs are necessary. Moreover, new designs and implementations of these models can be developed by taking inspiration from other theories...|$|R
40|$|The brain noradrenergic (NA) {{system is}} of great {{importance}} for animal vital activities as it modulates a variety of cognitive processes, such as vigilance, arousal, attention, memory and learning (Berridge Waterhouse, 2003). Earlier studies showed a relation between NA systems activity and attention. For example, pharmacological activation of the NA system with 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist (idazoxan) resulted in improved performance in cognitive tasks involving exploration of novel stimuli (Devauges Sara, 1990). In contrast, 2 -agonist (clonidine) administration led to increase of the reaction time in a visuospatial target detection task (Mair et al. 2005). We aim to investigate the effects of NA on performance of an auditory discrimination task in rats. To manipulate the activity of NA system we will apply electrical stimulation of the Locus Coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus that contains the majority of brain NA neurons. This nucleus presents a very widespread net of efferent projections in {{the central nervous system}} and its activation leads to facilitation of sensoryevoked neuronal firing in different brain regions involved in information processing, including <b>sensory</b> cortices and <b>thalamus.</b> In all of these structures, the NA systemâs neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) optimizes neuronal signaling by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the neuronal responses and enhancing the response selectivity. The LC neurons display two types of activity: tonic and phasic discharges, depending on the behavioral state. The tonic discharge defines the general arousal state and phasic discharges are closely linked to processing of salient stimuli and focused attention, e. g. attendance to novel stimuli or target detection (Aston-Jones et al. 1997). In our experiments, we will use the LC stimulation parameters to mimic natural phasic discharges of the LC neurons and phasically activate LC at presentation of auditory stimuli. First, we developed a behavioral paradigm for auditory discrimination task in a fully-automated operant box. The task consisted in the discrimination of two sounds of distinct frequencies, 4 and 10 kHz. The rats had to initiate the sound presentation by nose-poking to an aperture {{in the center of the}} box wall. Each sound was associated with the reward (chocolate milk) delivery on the right or left port located on the opposite side of the box. The sounds were presented in a pseudo-random order. In case of incorrect choice, the trial was terminated and the rat had to initiate the next sound presentation. In order to achieve a reliable above-chance performance, the rats were trained using a multiple-step conditioning paradigm, which gradually led to the final performance of the discrimination task: (1) habituation - familiarization with the box and substance of reward; (2) sound-reward association â each sound presentation was paired with reward (3) reward delivery only when nose-poking during sound presentation (4) introduction of the trial initiation by nose-poking; and (5) introduction of the auditory discrimination task with repetition of the same sound in case of incorrect choice. The latter step was crucial for the effective discrimination learning as it prevented the rats from using a place preference strategy and forced them to pay attention to the properties of the sounds presented instead of responding randomly and inattentively and performing at a 50 success rate. Using this paradigm the rats needed 10 - 15 daily training sessions for steps 1 - 4; and 30 additional sessions to achieve a stable performance at 70 accuracy (step 5 and the full task). All the rats trained with this paradigm (n= 6) achieved the above-chance performance and were qualified for implantation of the chronic stimulation electrode into LC. All rats were able to perform the task with the same accuracy when tested 1 week after surgery. The majority of rats continued performing satisfactorily after the cable plugging procedure to the electrode socket on the rat head was introduced. Thus, the implemented behavioral paradigm results in a stable discrimination learning that was resistant to such manipulations as anesthesia during surgery, 1 week postsurgery recovery period, and the cable plugging procedure. We are currently collecting data on the effects of electrical stimulation of LC on performance of auditory discrimination task in the trained rats. The stimulation parameters are based on results obtained in our laboratory in anesthetized animals, which induce a transient desynchronization of the local field potentials in the prefrontal cortex. We will stimulate LC with 500 ms trains of pulses (0. 4 ms, 50 μA, 50 Hz) delivered immediately after trial initiation. We expect that such phasic activation of LC will increase NE release in the target cortical regions involved in the sensory discrimination and decision making and therefore affect the behavioral performance...|$|R
40|$|Stimulation of {{the central}} gray matter areas {{has been used for}} the {{treatment}} of chronic pain for decades. To better understand the mechanism of action of such treatment we studied the effects of stimulation of the periventricular gray (PVG) on the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> in two patients with chronic central pain. In each case, two electrodes were implanted in the PVG (Medtronic 3389) and the ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus (Medtronic 3387), respectively, under guidance of CT/MRI image fusion. The PVG was stimulated in the frequency range of 2 - 100 Hz in alert patients while pain was assessed using the McGill-Melzack visual analogue scale. In addition, local field potentials (FPs) were recorded from the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> during PVG stimulation. Maximum pain relief was obtained with 5 - 25 Hz stimulation while 50 - 100 Hz made the pain worse. This suggests that pain suppression was frequency dependent. Interestingly, we detected low frequency FPs at 0. 2 - 0. 4 Hz closely associated with the pain. During 5 - 25 Hz PVG stimulation the amplitude of this potential was significantly reduced and this was associated with marked pain relief. At the higher frequencies (50 - 100 Hz) however, there was no reduction in the FPs and no pain suppression. We have found an interesting correlation between thalamic activity and chronic pain. This curious low frequency potential may provide an objective index for quantifying chronic pain, and may hold further clues to the mechanism of action of PVG stimulation...|$|E

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the periventricular/periaqueductal {{gray area}} and <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> can reduce pain intensity {{in patients with}} neuropathic pain. However, {{little is known about}} its impact on quality of life, emotional well-being, and cognition. This study followed up 18 patients who had received DBS for neuropathic pain. Each participant had previously undergone psychometric evaluation of each of the above areas as part of a routine presurgical neuropsychological assessment. Commensurate measures were employed at a follow-up assessment at least 6 months postsurgery. DBS significantly improved mood, anxiety, and aspects of quality of life. Improvements correlated with reduced pain severity. However, the sample continued to show impairments in most areas when compared against normative data published on nonclinical samples. There was little change in general cognitive functioning, aside from deterioration in spatial working memory. However, improvements in pain severity were associated with less improvement (and even deterioration) on measures of executive cognitive functioning. Improvements in emotional well-being also were correlated with changes in cognition. These results suggest that DBS of the periventricular/periaqueductal gray and/or <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> improves quality of life and emotional well-being in sufferers, although there is some indication of executive dysfunction, particularly among those reporting greatest pain alleviation.

40|$|Most dorsal thalamic nuclei send axons to {{specific}} areas of the neocortex and {{to specific}} sectors of the thalamic reticular nucleus; the neocortex then sends reciprocal connections {{back to the same}} thalamic nucleus, directly as well indirectly through a relay in the thalamic reticular nucleus. This can be regarded as a ‘canonical’ circuit of the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus.</b> For the pathways that link the thalamus and the hippocampal formation, only a few comparable connections have been described. The reuniens nucleus of the thalamus sends some of its major cortical efferents to the hippocampal formation. The present study shows that cells of the hippocampal formation as well as cells in the reuniens nucleus are retrogradely labelled following injections of horseradish peroxidase or fluoro-gold into the rostral part of the thalamic reticular nucleus in the rat. Within the hippocampal formation, labelled neurons were localized in the subiculum, predominantly on the ipsilateral side, with fewer neurons labelled contralaterally. Labelled neurons were seen in the hippocampal formation and nucleus reuniens only after injections made in the rostral thalamic reticular nucleus (1. 6 – 1. 8 mm caudal to bregma). In addition, the present study confirmed the presence of afferent connections to the rostral thalamic reticular nucleus from cortical (cingulate, orbital and infralimbic, retrosplenial and frontal), midline thalamic (paraventricular, anteromedial, centromedial and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei) and brainstem structures (substantia nigra pars reticularis, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, superior vestibular and pontine reticular nuclei). These results demonstrate a potential for the thalamo-hippocampal circuitry to influence the functional roles of the thalamic reticular nucleus, and show that thalamo-hippocampal connections resemble the circuitry that links the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and neocortex...|$|E

This bilateral projection constitutes 10 - 30 % of the neurons in the auditory tectothalamic system. Studies by others have shown that comparable input to the corresponding thalamic visual or somesthetic nuclei is absent.

40|$|The vibrissae {{sensory pathway}} {{of the rat}} is topographically {{organised}} from the mystacial pad to the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> {{and on to the}} barrel cortex. The latter is essential for the rat to perform whisker guided behavioural tasks, probably due to its projections to sub-cortical motor areas such as the basal ganglia. Indeed, the striatum- major input nucleus of the basal ganglia – enables action selection and behavioural reinforcement by integrating sensory and motor information. A large topographical projection from the rat barrel cortex to widely distributed areas of the striatum is assumed to be an important structural component supporting whiskerguided behaviour. Population responses to vibrissae stimulation have not been extensively studied in sub-cortical structures, in particular in the striatum. Connectivity between thalamic, cortical and striatal neuronal ensembles in the context of sensory stimulation has never been addressed on a functional level. We used a 10 Hz air puff, allowing un-damped movement of multiple whiskers, to look at functional connectivity in contra-lateral cortex, thalamus and striatum i...|$|E
40|$|Developmental dyslexia, {{a severe}} and {{persistent}} reading and spelling impairment, {{is characterized by}} difficulties in processing speech sounds (i. e., phonemes). Here, we test the hypothesis that these phonological difficulties {{are associated with a}} dysfunction of the auditory <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus,</b> the medial geniculate body (MGB). By using functional MRI, we found that, in dyslexic adults, the MGB responded abnormally when the task required attending to phonemes compared with other speech features. No other structure in the auditory pathway showed distinct functional neural patterns between the two tasks for dyslexic and control participants. Furthermore, MGB activity correlated with dyslexia diagnostic scores, indicating that the task modulation of the MGB is critical for performance in dyslexics. These results suggest that deficits in dyslexia are associated with a failure of the neural mechanism that dynamically tunes MGB according to predictions from cortical areas to optimize speech processing. This view on task-related MGB dysfunction in dyslexics has the potential to reconcile influential theories of dyslexia within a predictive coding framework of brain function...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to {{play a key role in}} central pain sensory modulation and processing, but its response to repeated nociception at thalamic level is not well known. Current study investigated thalamic response to repeated nociception by recording and comparing the activity of the same thalamic neuron during the 1 st and 2 nd formalin injection induced nociception, with a week interval between injections, in awake and behaving mice. Behaviorally, the 2 nd injection induced greater nociceptive responses than the 1 st. Thalamic activity mirrored these behavioral changes with greater firing rate during the 2 nd injection. Analysis of tonic and burst firing, characteristic firing pattern of thalamic neurons, revealed that tonic firing activity was potentiated while burst firing activity was not significantly changed by the 2 nd injection relative to the 1 st. Likewise, burst firing property changes, which has been consistently associated with different phases of nociception, were not induced by the 2 nd injection. Overall, data suggest that repeated nociception potentiated responsiveness of thalamic neurons and confirmed that tonic firing transmits nociceptive signals...|$|E

40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate {{receptor}} (NMDAR) -dependent long-term depression (LTD) in {{the lateral}} {{nucleus of the}} amygdala (LA) {{is a form of}} synaptic plasticity thought to be a cellular substrate for the extinction of fear memory. The LA receives converging inputs from the <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus</b> and neocortex that are weakened following fear extinction. Combining field and patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in mice, we show that a paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation can induce a robust LTD at thalamic and cortical inputs to LA, and we identify different underlying molecular components at these pathways. We show that while LTD depends on NMDARs and activation of the protein phosphatases PP 2 B and PP 1 at both pathways, it requires NR 2 B-containing NMDARs at the thalamic pathway, but NR 2 C/D-containing NMDARs at the cortical pathway. LTD appears to be induced postsynaptically at the thalamic input but presynaptically at the cortical input, since postsynaptic calcium chelation and NMDAR blockade prevent thalamic but not cortical LTD. These results highlight distinct molecular features of LTD in LA that may be relevant for traumatic memory and its erasure, and for pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{features}} in the mammalian <b>sensory</b> <b>thalamus,</b> such as the types of neurons, their connections, or their neurotransmitters, are conserved in evolution. We found a wide range {{in the proportion of}} gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons in the medial geniculate body, from < 1 % (bat and rat) to 25 % or more (cat and monkey). In the bat, some medial geniculate body subdivisions have no GABAergic cells. Species-specific variation also occurs in the somesthetic ventrobasal complex. In contrast, the lateral geniculate body of the visual system has about the same proportion of GABAergic cells in many species. In the central auditory pathway, only the medial geniculate body shows this arrangement; the relative number of GABAergic cells in the inferior colliculus and auditory cortex is similar in each species. The range in the proportion of GABAergic neurons suggests that there are comparative differences in the neural circuitry for thalamic inhibition. We conclude that the number of GABAergic neurons in thalamic sensory nuclei may have evolved independently or divergently in phylogeny. Perhaps these adaptations reflect neurobehavioral requirements for more complex, less stereotyped processing, as in speech-like communication...|$|E
