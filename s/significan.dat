5000|$|The sign {{does not}} {{function}} {{as its own}} goal, but its purpose lies in {{its role as a}} signification (res <b>significans,</b> DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of [...] "scriptura scripturae interpres" [...] (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.|$|R
40|$|Staal’s {{thesis that}} ritual has no meaning has {{generated}} {{a lot of}} debate, as the theory runs against the everyday experience that people do attribute a lot of meaning to ritual. Many other authors have argued that ritual is primarily self-referential. However, rituals are recognizable over cultural and geographical boundaries, recognizable as ritual and as significant. This is what I call the ritual paradox. The solution of this paradox resides in the distinction between information and meaning, in this article called the distinction between message and meaning. Though ritual indeed has no intrinsic message people do attribute meaning on two levels: the self-referential meaning and the hermeneutic or exegetic meaning. Both are constructed on acts without intrinsic information, {{a tour de force}} our species, homo <b>significans,</b> is extremely proficient in. Where does this meaning stem from? The elements of ritual closely resemble everyday action and interaction, hence the meaning of ritual is derived from the lived experience of everyday life, but in a counter-intuitive form: actions in ritual are changed, but in a certain way and to a limited extent. Ritual consists of recognizable, ‘normal’ actions which have been ren-dered un-usual and counter-intuitive, comprehensible because slightly strange, thus creating a virtualized world. Thus, the very absence of an implicit message offers a window for the participant to construct his own meaning of the ritual, i. e. to attribute meaning to an information-free act. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} ideational {{change of the}} Sweden democrats (SD) during its first mandate in the Swedish {{parliament}} and focuses {{on the issues of}} immigration as well as crime and punishment which are theoretically relevant in regard of populist radical right parties (PRR). This inquiry is motivated in relation to the suggested <b>significans</b> of PRR-parties moderation of extreme ideas in order to reach representation and thereof obtain ability to influence policy. The thesis focuses on the potential change of the ideas of SD on two issues by analysing those ideas at the party´s early stage in the parliament in 2010 {{as well as in the}} end of this first mandate in 2014. The second aim of the thesis is to explain why SD display a radicalization, stabilization or moderation in those ideas. In order to describe the change in ideas an idea analysis with constructed ideal types is used as method and tool of analysis. For the explaination a theoretical framework on PRR-parties, inspired by Cas Mudde, is used with emphasis on the demand-side as well as the external supply-side. The results show stabile ideas regarding crime and punishment but a marginal ideational moderation on the issue of immigration between 2010 and 2014. According to the author, the relatively high propotion of voters contending to tougher punishment as well as the low salience of the issue could explain why the ideas on crime and punishment remain stabile. The marginal moderation of ideas on immigration is on the other hand understood with reference to the external supply-side, foremost as a necessity in order to approach the mainstream parties and gain coalition potential in its main issue...|$|R
