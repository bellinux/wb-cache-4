40|$|Following {{the massive}} {{economic}} policy restructuring and reforms {{since the early}} 1980 s, currency <b>substitution,</b> <b>asset</b> substitution and de facto dollarisation have become common phenomena in nearly all transition and developing economies. High and persistent inflation which have been a perennial feature of developing and transition economies is now known to be highly responsible for currency <b>substitution,</b> <b>asset</b> substitution and de facto dollarisation. This paper presents evidence on the macrodynamics of de facto dollarisation, currency substitution and asset substitution during {{the era of the}} implementation of the Financial Sector Adjustment Programmes (FINSAPs) in developing and transition economies with special reference to Ghana. The study has found out that de facto dollarisation whether in the form of asset substitution or currency substitution is highly prevalent and poses a serious threat to fiscal and monetary policies effectiveness in developing and transition economies. In Ghana, the principal long-run mainspring of de facto dollarisation is the ad hoc implementation of financial sector development programme that was embarked upon about two decades ago which has resulted in high exchange rate depreciation and price fluctuations. It is, however, likely that as the financial sector develops over a long period a time will come when further development of the financial sector would no longer instigate de facto dollarisation. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the dynamics of dollarisation and euroisation for 25 transition countries. Estimates {{of the amount of}} foreign currency in circulation (FCC) in transition countries are used to develop a new comprehensive dollarisation index (CDI) and separate indices of currency <b>substitution</b> (CSI) and <b>asset</b> <b>substitution.</b> When the CDI is compared to the traditional dollarisation index that relies solely on foreign currency deposits as a proxy for the extent of dollarisation, I find that the comprehensive dollarisation measure provides a more complete picture of the extent of de facto dollarisation and euroisation, and that it better reflects the separate influences of currency <b>substitution</b> and <b>asset</b> <b>substitution.</b> I find that the dynamic evolution of currency <b>substitution</b> and <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> in transition countries is both more variable and complex than is usually believed to be the case. These new dollarisation indicators enable researchers to examine the causes of the dollarisation process and its tendency to lead to irreversibility (hysteresis). Moreover, the currency <b>substitution</b> and <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> indices shed light on the dynamic consequences of these processes for the effectiveness of monetary policy. Finally, the new estimates of FCC make possible the measurement of effective currency/deposit ratios {{that can be used to}} develop new estimates of the size and growth of underground economies in transition countries.

We show that if short term debt limits the expropriation of debtholders, it also implies a lower leverage, which prevents the firm from increasing tax shields. We then examine the incentive of equityholders to increase the firm risk when debtholders hold the option to swap a perpetual coupon bond with short term debt. We find that this option mitigates equityholders' risk shifting incentives. Compared to standard short term debt, this restructuring option deters debtholders expropriation, it increases leverage and it reduces the loss in tax shields due to asset <b>substitution.</b> <b>Asset</b> substitution Restructuring Debt maturity Agency costs...|$|E

By referring to the under-investment paradox, the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> problem, the <b>asset</b> specificity proposition and the information asymmetry literature, we postulate that R&D-intensive firms should adopt specific financial policies. In conformity with our hypotheses, empirical results based on a sample of R&D-intensive and non-R&D firms in four major industrialized countries (Europe, the UK, Japan and the US) show that R&D-intensive firms exhibit significant lower debt and dividend payment levels, but shorter debt maturities and higher cash levels than non-R&D ones.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{this paper is to}} study the design of {{securities}} when a firm must raise external capital from an asymmetrically informed capital market and when the firm has operating discretion in the management of the capital raised that embodies the essence of the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> problem. It is shown that in this setting, if the operating discretion is sufficiently broad, there is no dissipation of value from <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> and hence no agency costs of this incentive problem, but the security design problem is severely constrained. Optimal operating policy decisions result in limiting security designs essentially to convex claims on firm cash flow. In this context, both equity and levered equity (the residual claim being inside debt) are natural candidates for optimal security designs. We characterize the private productivity information of the firm that yields equity as an optimal security design. This characterization involves an intuitive comparison of indices of mispricing gains of equity vis-a-vis those of levered equity. The relevant conditions are satisfied in a varietyof contexts, but they are not universal. We then pursue further the security designs that minimize mispricing and we show that in this context the optimal security designs are scaled versions of levered equity, which includes the conditions under which equity is optimal as a limiting case. This gives theoretical foundation for the use of inside debt in managing the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> problem even when there are no agency costs of <b>asset</b> <b>substitution...</b>|$|R

40|$|Banks face two {{different}} kinds of moral hazard problems: <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> by shareholders (e. g., making risky, negative net present value loans) and managerial rent seeking (e. g., investing in inefficient 'pet' projects and consuming perquisites that yield private benefits). The privately optimal level of bank leverage is neither too low nor too high: It balances efficiently the market discipline imposed by owners of risky debt on managerial rent seeking against the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> induced at high levels of leverage. However, when correlated bank failures can impose significant social costs, governments may have {{no option but to}} bail out bank creditors. Anticipation of this generates an equilibrium featuring systemic risk in which all banks choose inefficiently high leverage to fund correlated assets and market discipline is compromised. A minimum equity capital requirement can rule out <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> but also compromise market discipline by making bank debt too safe. The optimal capital regulation requires that a part of bank capital be unavailable to creditors upon failure, and be available to shareholders only contingent on good performance...|$|R

I find that financial leverage is negatively related to production flexibility but positively related to investment flexibility.

40|$|In {{this study}} we re-examine the pricing of equity and the risk {{incentives}} of shareholders in levered firms. We derive a down-and-out call equity valuation model which rests {{on the assumption that}} shareholders choose the optimal investment and asset returns' volatility as a function of current leverage. Contrarily to the Black and Scholes framework where, irrespective of the firm's leverage, they would always select infinite volatility projects, here the more deep out-of-the-money the shareholders' claim, the greater their incentives to select riskier investment projects. The model is thus consistent with and quantifies the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> problem previously acknowledged by the agency literature.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory {{to show how}} {{mark-to-market}} accounting and shareholder–debt holder agency conflicts interact to affect the prudential regulation of a financial institution. We demonstrate that, relative to a benchmark historical cost regime, mark-to-market accounting could alleviate the inefficiencies arising from <b>asset</b> <b>substitution,</b> but exacerbate those arising from the incentives to choose lower quality projects due to debt overhang. The inefficiencies due to debt overhang and <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> work in opposing directions. An increase in the propensity for <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> mitigates the debt overhang inefficiency, and this tradeoff is especially pronounced for highly levered financial institutions. The optimal choices of the accounting measurement regime and the prudential solvency constraint balance the conflicts between shareholders and debt holders. From a policy standpoint, our results suggest that a uniform capital requirement across institutions could be sub-optimal. In fact, if the solvency constraint is too tight (i. e., the capital requirements is too strict), historical cost accounting dominates mark-to-market accounting. Our results therefore sound a note of caution given the recent proposals to require both mark-to-market accounting and stricter capital requirements in the Basel III accords...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of a {{financial}} institution to show how prudential capital regulation and mark-to-market accounting interact to affect the institution’s project choices in the presence of shareholder—debt holder agency conflicts. We demonstrate that, relative to a benchmark “pure historical cost ” regime in which assets and liabilities on an institution’s balance sheet are mea-sured at their origination values, mark-to-market or fair value accounting could alleviate the inefficiencies arising from <b>asset</b> <b>substitution,</b> but exacerbate those arising from underinvestment due to debt overhang. The inefficiencies due to underinvestment and <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> work in opposing directions. An increase in the propensity for <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> mitigates under-investment, and this tradeoff is especially pronounced for highly levered financial institutions. The optimal choices of the accounting measurement regime and prudential solvency constraint balance the conflicts between shareholders and debt holders. Under fair value accounting, the op-timal solvency constraint declines with the institution’s marginal cost of investment in project quality and the excess cost of equity capital relative to debt capital. The optimal solvency constraint is institution-specific, which suggests that a uniform solvency constraint could be sub-optimal. In fact, if the solvency constraint in the fair value regime is sub-optimally chosen to be tighter than a threshold, historical cost accounting dominates fair value accounting...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{contingent}} convertible capital (CoCo-Bonds) might have perverse risk-taking incentives for banks (<b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> problem) and discourage them from investing in positive NPV projects and issuing new equity {{in times of}} crisis (debt overhang problem). Whenever the conversion price is set too high - {{as in the case of}} the Lloyds CoCo-Bond issuance in November 2009 - a wealth transfer will take place at the time of conversion. This will exacerbate both the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> problem and the debt overhang problem. We propose a new type of contingent convertible capital for banks - which we label Convert-to-Surrender Bonds (CoSu-Bonds) - which eliminates both the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> and the debt overhang problem. CoSu-Bond convert into equity once the equity ratio falls below a certain threshold and CoSu-Bond holders take over the bank while equity holders are totally wiped out. This instrument makes equity holders naturally risk averse and gives incentives to equity holders to raise new equity and to invest also in slightly negative NPV projects in times of financial distress. Our instrument has a unique price if it is augmented by a simple option for old equity holders to issue equity if the trigger is hit, thereby circumventing the problem of multiple equilibria. We develop a tractable model to analyze risk-taking incentives in the banking sector and present a detailled analysis of the Lloyds CoCo-Bond issuance. We finally discuss several policy issues associated with this new instrument including robustness and unique equilibria...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine how}} {{accounting}} conservatism {{relates to the}} design of private debt contracts with consideration of managerial risk preferences embedded in compensation contracts.

I find evidence that accounting conservatism, the presence of financial covenants, and collateral are positively associated with the choice of long-term debt; with short-term debt constituting an alternative form of creditor protection. More notably, I find evidence of a predicted positive association between the use of collateral and conservatism.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has been divided regarding how firms respond to bankruptcy risk, largely revolving around two competing forces. On the one hand, <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> encourages firms to increase the riskiness of assets to extract value from creditors. On the other, firms want to minimize bankruptcy risk, either by reducing cash flow risk or through increasing {{the size of the}} firm. I test these two theories using a natural experiment of chemicals used in production processes being newly identified as carcinogenic to explore how firms may respond to potential negative cash flow resulting from litigation risk. I use plantlevel chemical data to study firm exposure to risk. I examine how responses between firms of differing levels of chemical exposure may vary within the industry, how firm financial distress affects firm response and whether public and private firms respond differently. In general, my research provides support for the <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> theory. My first paper studies how investment response varies based on level of carcinogenic exposure. I find that firms with moderate levels of exposure make efforts to mitigate their cash flow risk and reduce their exposure. At the same time, firms with high levels of exposure increase their exposure and riskiness of future cash flows. These findings are consistent with <b>asset</b> <b>substitution</b> theory. My second paper analyzes the interaction of financial distress and risk exposure. I find that firms in a stronger financial position are more likely to limit their exposure by reducing the number of exposed facilities. On the other hand, not only do firms in weaker financial position not decrease their exposure, I find that, in some instances, they increase their exposure to carcinogens. This work again supports the theory of <b>asset</b> <b>substitution.</b> Finally, in my third paper, I explore if public firms respond differently to a potential negative cash flow shock than do private firms. I test whether existing public firms are more likely to attempt to minimize their cash flow risk and thus reduce their carcinogen exposure than are private firms.
