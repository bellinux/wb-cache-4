40|$|Purpose: Physical {{inactivity}} {{in conjunction}} with biological aging {{may lead to a}} decline in flexibility and neuromuscular function, contributing to physical frailty and an increased risk of injuries. Although, whole-body vibration has gained popularity as an alternative mode of exercise for improving physical fitness, only few studies examined the effects of WBV training on fitness parameters in middle-aged individuals and the outcomes are not clear. This study investigated the effects of a 2 -month whole-body vibration training (WBVT) program using a <b>side-to-side</b> <b>vibration</b> mode on flexibility, on power of lower limbs and on isokinetic peak torque of middle-aged women. Methods: Twenty-four middle-aged untrained females (43. 96 ± 3. 28 years) were assigned to a vibration (WBVG) or a control group (CG). The WBVT program consisted of twenty-four sessions on a <b>side-to-side</b> <b>vibration</b> platform (frequency 20 – 25 Hz, amplitude 6 mm, duration 6 – 8 min). Flexibility, vertical jumping performance (VJ), and isokinetic peak torque of knee extensors (KE) and flexors (KF) were measured prior to and 2 days following the completion of WBVT. Results: Post-training values of flexibility and VJ were significantly higher vs. pre-training values in WBVG (p < 0. 001 –p < 0. 01); they remained unchanged in CG. Post-training flexibility and VJ values were significantly greater in WBVG vs. CG (p < 0. 001 –p < 0. 05). The WBVT program had no effect on isokinetic peak torque of KE and KF. Conclusions: An 8 -week WBVT program improved flexibility and VJ in middle-aged untrained females and should be used by health and fitness professionals for counteracting the detrimental effects of sedentary lifestyle on flexibility and power of lower limbs. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Itali...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Short-term whole-body {{vibration}} training (WBVT) {{has emerged}} as an exercise method for improving neuromuscular performance and has been proposed for injury prevention and rehabilitation. This study investigated {{the effects of a}} short-term (<= 2 months) WBVT program using a <b>side-to-side</b> <b>vibration</b> on: (i) strength profile of knee extensors (ME) and flexors (KF), (ii) "functional" hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (ECCKF/CONKE), (iii) flexibility and (iv) vertical jumping performance (VJ). Furthermore, we explored the retention of performance gains 21 days following WBVT. Design: Randomized-controlled trial. Methods: Twenty-six moderately active females (20. 40 +/- 0. 27 years) were assigned to a vibration (VG) or a control group (CG). The short-term WBVT program consisted of sixteen-sessions on a <b>side-to-side</b> <b>vibration</b> platform (frequency: 25 Hz, amplitude: 6 mm, 2 sets x 5 min). Isokinetic and isometric peak torque of KE and KF, ECCKF/CONKE, flexibility, and VJ were measured pre, 2 days post, and 21 days following the cessation of WBVT. Results: Post-training values of flexibility, isokinetic and isometric peak torques of KF and ECCKF/CONKE ratio were higher than pre-training values in VG (p < 0. 05); however, they remained unchanged in CG. Post-training values were greater in VG vs. CG (p < 0. 05). Twenty-one days following WBVT, post-training values were no longer significantly different than pre-training values. The short-term WBVT program had no effect on strength profile of KE and on VJ. Conclusions: A short-term side-to-side WBVT program improved flexibility, the strength profile of knee flexors, and the "functional" hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio in moderately active females. Coaches and clinical practitioners should consider this type of training as an effective exercise mode for improving the strength asymmetry of reciprocal muscles at the knee joint.

40|$|We cultured and sequenced newly {{collected}} {{material of}} Percursaria dawsonii Hollenberg et I. A. Abbott, a poorly known epibiont of limpets found {{along the west}} coast of North America. Zoospores, parthenogametes, and zygotes exhibited empty-spore germination, which produced a prostrate system that expanded by stolon-like development. A dense carpet of initially uniseriate filaments arose from the prostrate system. These upright filaments soon became biseriate proximally and pluriseriate distally, where they were flat, twisted and distromatic for approximately four-fifths of their length and rarely became hollow in larger individuals. These fronds became fertile distally and released quadriflagellate zoospores and/or biflagellate isogametes. Individual gametophytic fronds were dioecious, and alternated with isomorphic sporophytic fronds. The gametes moved rapidly and often exhibited an unusual <b>side-to-side</b> <b>vibration</b> that made them appear like winged insects. Comparisons of 18 S rRNA gene and ITS sequences indicated that P. dawsonii {{should be included in the}} genus Blidingia, family Kornmanniaceae...|$|E
40|$|When a {{wind turbine}} {{operates}} above the rated wind speed, the blade pitch may {{be governed by}} a basic single-input–single-output PI controller, with the shaft speed as input. The performance of the wind turbine depends upon the tuning of the gains and filters of this controller. Rules of thumb, based upon pole placement, with a rigid model of the rotor, are inadequate for tuning the controller of large, flexible, offshore wind turbines. It is shown that the appropriate controller tuning is highly dependent upon {{the characteristics of the}} aeroelastic model: no single reference controller can be defined for use with all models. As an example, the ubiquitous National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)   5  MW wind turbine controller is unstable when paired with a fully flexible aeroelastic model. A methodical search is conducted, in order to find models with a minimum number of degrees of freedom, which can be used to tune the controller for a fully flexible aeroelastic model; this can be accomplished with a model containing 16 – 20 states. Transient aerodynamic effects, representing rotor-average properties, account for five of these states. A simple method is proposed to reduce the full transient aerodynamic model, and the associated turbulent wind spectra, to the rotor average. Ocean waves are also an important source of loading; it is recommended that the shaft speed signal be filtered such that wave-driven tower <b>side-to-side</b> <b>vibrations</b> do not appear in the PI controller output. An updated tuning for the NREL  5  MW controller is developed using a Pareto front technique. This fixes the instability and gives good performance with fully flexible aeroelastic models...|$|R
40|$|Frequency and {{amplitude}} {{determine the}} training load of whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise and thereby possible neuromuscular adaptations. We investigated {{the effects of}} amplitude and frequency of a single bout of WBV on flexibility and squat jump performance (SJ) and the time-course of these effects. In the amplitude study, twenty-five females performed three vibration protocols (VPs) for 6 min at frequency of 25 Hz and amplitudes of 4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm and one control protocol (CP). In the frequency study, eighteen females performed three VPs at 6 mm amplitude and frequencies of 15 Hz, 20 Hz, and 30 Hz and one CP. Flexibility and SJ were measured before, immediately-post and 15 min recovery. All protocols were performed on a <b>side-to-side</b> alternating <b>vibration</b> plate. In the amplitude study, flexibility was improved (p < 0. 01) immediately-post in VP 4, VP 6, VP 8 (31. 8 +/- 8. 2, 31. 9 +/- 7. 6, 31. 5 +/- 7. 9, respectively) and at 15 min recovery (31. 6 +/- 8. 1, 31. 5 +/- 7. 9, 31. 0 +/- 8. 2, respectively) vs. pre-vibration (30. 2 +/- 8. 6, 30. 3 +/- 8. 1, 30. 2 +/- 8. 3, respectively), but remained unchanged in CP (30. 6 +/- 8. 3 immediately-post, 30. 7 +/- 8. 2 at 15 min vs. 30. 4 +/- 8. 2 pre-vibration). In the frequency study, flexibility was improved (p < 0. 01) immediately-post in VP 15, VP 20, VP 30 (31. 5 +/- 5. 2, 31. 3 +/- 5, 31. 7 +/- 5. 3, respectively) and at 15 min recovery (31. 3 +/- 5. 4, 31. 3 +/- 5. 0, 31. 3 +/- 5. 3, respectively) vs. pre-vibration (30. 6 +/- 5. 4, 30. 2 +/- 5. 7, 30. 3 +/- 5. 9, respectively), but not in CP (30. 7 +/- 5. 1 immediately-post, 30. 6 +/- 5 at 15 min vs. pre-vibration 30. 5 +/- 5. 7). There were no significant effects of amplitude or frequency on SJ. In conclusion, a single WBV bout using a <b>side-to-side</b> alternating <b>vibration</b> plate may increase flexibility which persists for at least 15 min, without altering jumping performance. These effects were observed irrespective of frequency and amplitude. (C) 2009 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of shallow dynamic squatting (DS) versus static squatting (SS) with or without concurrent <b>side-to-side</b> alternating whole-body <b>vibration</b> (WBV) on vastus lateralis temperature and cardiovascular stress as indicated by heart rate (HR). Ten participants (five men, five women) participated in four interventions [DS with WBV (DS+), DS without WBV (DS-), SS with WBV (SS+), SS without WBV (SS-) ] 48 h apart, in a randomized order. The interventions were preceded by a approximately 20 -min rest period, consisted of 10 mins with or without WBV (26 or 0 Hz) with SS (40 degrees of knee flexion) or DS (55 degrees of knee flexion, at a cadence of 50 bpm) where SS+ and DS- were metabolically matched. Muscle (T(m)), core (T(c)), skin temperature (T(sk)), HR and VO(2) were recorded during each intervention. For T(m), there was a time (P< 0. 01) and WBV (P< 0. 01) effect but no squat effect was evident, and there was time xWBV interaction effect (P< 0. 01). In all four interventions, the work load was too low to cause cardiovascular stress. Instead normal, moderate physiological effects of exercise on autonomic control were observed as indicated by HR; there were no significant increases in T(sk) or T(c). There appears to be no benefit in performing an unloaded, shallow DS+ at a tempo of 50 bpm as T(m,) HR, VO(2) are likely to be increased by the same amount and rate without WBV. However, combining SS with WBV could be advantageous to rapidly increasing soft tissue temperature prior to performing rehabilitation exercises when dynamic exercise cannot be performed...|$|R
