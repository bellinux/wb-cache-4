The processing <b>units</b> included cottage <b>scale</b> (03), small scale (05) and large scale (02). The study revealed that returns per rupee invested in cottage <b>scale</b> <b>units,</b> was calculated as 2. 74 in making jelly and 2. 99 in jam; for small <b>scale</b> <b>units,</b> it was 2. 28 in jelly, 2. 43 in jam and 1. 89 in toffee; and for large <b>scale</b> <b>units,</b> the returns per rupee invested were 2. 52 in the manufacture of jelly, 2. 82 in jam and 2. 01 in toffee.

Because a linear <b>scale</b> <b>unit</b> {{is connected to}} each spherical joint located {{at both ends of}} an extensible limb through two rods, the <b>scale</b> <b>unit</b> can measure not only displacement of the prismatic joint but also the limb’s deformation. Moreover, the <b>scale</b> <b>unit</b> also measures the joint’s runout and its deformation in the limb’s direction because the rod end is in contact with the sphere of the spherical joint. Consequently, the unit accurately measures any change in the distance between the spherical joints independent of the external force. Further, temperature fluctuation has little effect on measured distance because the rods are made of a low expansion alloy.
