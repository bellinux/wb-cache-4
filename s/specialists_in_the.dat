5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup <b>specialists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading <b>specialists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
