25|$|The {{next step}} for Irwin was to {{determine}} if transsaccadic memory is tied to spatial position. He performed experiments using dot patterns and later, performed the same type of experiment alongside McConkie in his effort to prove the saccade target hypothesis. In those experiments, the researchers used a picture instead of dot patterns. Participants in the experimental condition were given an initial eye position, followed by a saccade target position on the picture. Unlike Irwin’s first experiment, where the pattern did not change spatial location during the saccade, the picture underwent one of three shift conditions: All <b>shift</b> <b>down,</b> target object <b>shift</b> <b>down,</b> or background shift up. Detection of change ended up being much higher when only the target object moved compared to when the entire image shifted. This demonstrated the importance of the target object in detection of image displacements.|$|E
25|$|Captioning is {{modulated}} {{and stored}} differently in PAL and SECAM 625 line 25 frame countries, where teletext is used {{rather than in}} EIA-608, but the methods of preparation and the line 21 field used are similar. For home Betamax and VHS videotapes, a <b>shift</b> <b>down</b> of this line 21 field must be done due to the greater number of VBI lines used in 625 line PAL countries, though only {{a small minority of}} European PAL VHS machines support this (or any) format for closed caption recording. Like all teletext fields, teletext captions can't be stored by a standard 625 line VHS recorder (due to the lack of field shifting support); they are available on all professional S-VHS recordings due to all fields being recorded. Recorded Teletext caption fields also suffer from a higher number of caption errors due to increased number of bits and a low SNR, especially on low-bandwidth VHS. This is why Teletext captions used to be stored separately on floppy disk to the analogue master tape. DVDs have their own system for subtitles and/or captions that is digitally inserted in the data stream and encoded on playback in video field lines.|$|E
