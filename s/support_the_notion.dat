25|$|King's {{cause of}} death was {{determined}} to be multi-infarct dementia, brought on by a series of small strokes caused by atherosclerotic vascular disease as a consequence of type 2 diabetes. However, two of his daughters alleged that King was deliberately poisoned by two associates trying to induce diabetic shock. The Clark County coroner's office confirmed on May 25, 2015, that it was performing an autopsy on King's body and conducting a homicide investigation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, although CNN reported that initial indications did not <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of foul play. The autopsy revealed King's death was of complications of Alzheimer's disease and congestive heart failure, with no evidence of poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Large {{and swift}} mammals are stalked and shot with bow and arrow. Smaller and {{burrowing}} mammals are usually captured by hand. Because Aché hunting {{has been extensively}} studied using focal follow and other systematic methods, the encounter rates with prey, the time required for a successful pursuit, and the expected energy gains from prey types, are all well known. This has allowed for numerous tests of specific decision models from Optimal Foraging Theory to be tested using Aché data. Results generally <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that Aché hunters pursue only those prey types that would increase their energy return rates, and pass by some species (many small birds, rodents, reptiles, etc.) that would probably lower overall foraging returns if pursued.|$|E
25|$|For centuries, monarchs {{ruled by}} the idea of divine right. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as caesaropapism. On the other side was the Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the Pope claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such {{as was the case with}} Henry VIII of England and Henry III of Navarre.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} meeting, Woodward {{announced}} that a reconstruction of the fragments indicated that the skull {{was in many ways}} similar to that of a modern human, except for the occiput (the part of the skull that sits on the spinal column), and brain size, which was about two-thirds that of a modern human. He went on to indicate that, save for two human-like molar teeth, the jaw bone was indistinguishable from that of a modern, young chimpanzee. From the British Museum's reconstruction of the skull, Woodward proposed that Piltdown Man represented an evolutionary missing link between apes and humans, since the combination of a human-like cranium with an ape-like jaw tended to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> then prevailing in England that human evolution began with the brain.|$|E

25|$|The city of Ayodhya is a holy {{site for}} Hindus, who know {{it as the}} birthplace of the god-king Rama. Following the Mughal conquest of the region in 1528, a mosque was built in Ayodhya by the Mughal general Mir Baqi, who named it the Babri Masjid after the Mughal emperor Babur. According to hearsay, Baqi {{destroyed}} a pre-existing temple of Rama at the site. Limited historical evidence exists to support this theory, and the existence of the temple itself is a matter of controversy. Numerous historians have stated that there is limited evidence to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that Rama was born at the precise location of the Babri Masjid, as well as that a temple to Rama once stood at the site. Additionally, the location of Ayodhya itself is a matter of dispute, since the city has shifted slightly over the millennia.|$|E
25|$|Efforts by the Dutch to find {{a federal}} {{solution}} for Indonesia included {{the establishment of the}} State of East Indonesia or Negara Indonesia Timur (NIT) in 1946. Mononutu {{became a member of the}} NIT parliament and headed the group of parliament members who were pro-republic. He focused his efforts to persuade other members of parliament to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of unifying NIT with the Republic of Indonesia. After the Dutch military offensive against the Republic of Indonesia called Operation Product or Agresi Militer Belanda I in 1947, Mononutu established the Unified Struggle for Indonesian Independence or Gabungan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan Indonesia. This organization sought to highlight the actions of the Dutch to keep Indonesia as its colony. In February 1948, he led a delegation of NIT officials to visit and meet with the leaders of the Republic of Indonesia in Yogyakarta. In 1949, NIT became a constituent of the newly formed United States of Indonesia or Republik Indonesia Serikat (RIS), which was then dissolved on 17 August 1950 and replaced by a unitary Republic of Indonesia.|$|E

500|$|The {{choice of}} Kent and Æthelberht was almost {{certainly}} dictated {{by a number of}} factors, including that Æthelberht had allowed his Christian wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established,and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom. [...] Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium, or overlordship, south of the River Humber. Lastly, the proximity of Kent to the Franks allowed for support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish Church and not merely as a spiritual adviser to the queen.
