5|$|Gabriel García Márquez {{was born}} on 6 March 1927 in Aracataca, Colombia, to Gabriel Eligio García and Luisa Santiaga Márquez Iguarán. Soon after García Márquez was born, his father became a {{pharmacist}} and moved, with his wife, to Barranquilla, leaving young Gabito in Aracataca.

In December 1936, his father took him and his brother to Sincé, while in March 1937, his grandfather died; the family then moved first (back) to Barranquilla {{and then on to}} <b>Sucre,</b> where his father started up a pharmacy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the spread}} of such ideas was {{forbidden}} in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of LouisXVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News {{of the events of}} 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many enlightened criollos came into contact with liberal authors and their works during their university studies, either in Europe or at the University of Chuquisaca (modern <b>Sucre).</b> Books from the United States found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, owing to the proximity of Venezuela to the United States and the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|The Departmental Water and Sanitation Plans program {{provides}} such services as planning and harmonizing resources and has regional systems of service provision {{at the level}} of each department of the country. The program was first implemented in four departments which have some of the most difficult conditions: <b>Sucre,</b> Córdoba, Magdalena and La Guajira.

In 2010 30 Departmental Plans were completed and published, covering almost all of the country's 32 departments.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure that}} the Presidency of Quito {{became a part of}} Gran Colombia and did not remain a {{collection}} of small, divided republics, Bolívar sent aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio José de <b>Sucre</b> to Guayaquil in February 1821. For a year <b>Sucre</b> was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides, exhausted, signed a ninety-day armistice. The following year, at the Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito; Gran Colombia's hold on the territory was secure. The following year, after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the Battle of Ica, San Martín met with Simón Bolívar in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27. Thereafter San Martín decided to retire from the scene. For the next two years, two armies of Rioplatense (Argentinian), Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the Andean regions of Peru and Upper Peru. A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make Bolívar head of the patriot forces in the country. An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio Olañeta, which was an extension of the Liberal Triennium, proved to be the royalists' undoing. La Serna lost control of half of his best army by the beginning of 1824, giving the patriots an opportunity.|$|E
50|$|Banco del Ecuador issued {{notes of}} 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 & 1000 <b>sucres.</b> It {{was one of}} the most {{powerful}} banks of the period.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the fall}} of his government, <b>Sucre's</b> {{policies}} {{formed the basis for}} the following ten-year rule of Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana (1829–39), the first native-born president, who was sworn into office in May 1829 after a series of short-term rulers. Santa Cruz, a mestizo, had a brilliant military career fighting for independence in the armies of Bolívar. His close connection with Bolívar had led to a short interlude as the president of Peru in 1826. It also made him a strong candidate to become Bolivia's new president after <b>Sucre's</b> resignation.|$|R

5|$|With the {{permission}} of King Philip II of Spain a group of Jesuits travelled to the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1568, some 30years after {{the arrival of the}} Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians and Mercedarians. The Jesuits established themselves in Lima in 1569 before moving east toward Paraguay; in 1572 they reached the Audience of Charcas in modern-day Bolivia. Because they were not allowed to establish settlements on the frontier they built chapter houses, churches and schools in pre-existing settlements, such as La Paz, Potosí and La Plata (present day <b>Sucre).</b>|$|E
5|$|Bolívar {{took control}} of Caracas with his victory {{at the battle of}} Carabobo, and the Congress of Cúcuta issued laws similar to those in Perú. Guayaquil {{declared}} independence, and Bolivar sent Antonio José de <b>Sucre</b> to reinforce them. Sucre's forces were not enough, and requested help from San Martín. Peru sent a military force of 1,300 men. Bolívar entered the city a month later, and claimed that for historical reasons Quito should be part of Colombia. San Martín and Bolívar sought to generate Latin American integration, but disagreed on the type of government: Bolívar proposed a republic, and San Martín a constitutional monarchy, reasoning that {{it would be easier to}} receive international recognition for the now-independent South American nations. Peru and Colombia signed a treaty of integration, to be proposed to Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay, and at a later point to the United Provinces of Central America and the Empire of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In Venezuela, {{citizens}} in coastal areas of Falcón, <b>Sucre</b> and Isla Margarita {{were moved to}} safer areas, and several thousands were evacuated due to the hurricane. The Simón Bolívar International Airport, as well as three other mainland airports, were closed. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. temporarily closed its oil refinery in Curaçao, and two ports were briefly shut down; this caused a delay in two oil deliveries. The Valero Energy Corporation shut down its largest oil refinery in Aruba. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, oil companies in Trinidad and Tobago ceased production and removed workers from offshore rigs; the Atlantic LNG company closed exports. Seven shelters were opened on Tobago, where about 560people evacuated for the storm. Two people died: one man trying to save his car, and one girl sleeping in her bed, when a tree fell on the roof above her room. Most evacuees were from low-lying areas, and {{on the day of the}} storm's passage most schools and businesses were closed.

50|$|Between 1887 and 1892 over 1.75 million <b>sucres</b> {{worth of}} {{substandard}} coin was withdrawn, {{so that only}} high quality silver coin remained in circulation. President Antonio Flores Jijón (son of Presidente Juan José Flores) announced that from August 15, 1890, only national coin was allowed to circulate in Ecuador, and Ecuador's monetary system was finally unified. But the total face value of coin in circulation had been reduced. In order to alleviate the shortage of small change, the President authorized (June 14, 1890) the minting of 30,000 <b>sucres</b> in copper coins of 1/2 and 1 centavo.|$|R
50|$|The first {{notes of}} the Central Bank (Banco Central del Ecuador Sociedad Anonima) were issued in 1928 in {{denominations}} of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 <b>sucres.</b> These notes had a gold redemption clause, e.g.,Pagará al portador á la vista CINCO SUCRES en oro ó giros oro (promises to pay the bearer at sight FIVE SUCRES in gold or gold exchange). The gold clause was retained on Banco Central's notes until 1939, when the text was modified to Pagará al portador á la vista CINCO SUCRES.

5|$|In Trinidad and Tobago, the {{government}} set up shelters and sent home non-essential oil workers. Officials canceled flights {{and shut the}} ports as a precaution. Stores and business closed early after locals had stocked up on life supplies. Army troops were deployed in Port of Spain to avert looting. The threat of the storm caused a rise in unleaded oil prices. In Venezuela, boats were ordered to remain at port, while flights were canceled to Isla Margarita and Puerto la Cruz. Rescue workers were mobilized {{in the capital city}} of Caracas to prepare in the event of landslides. Ahead of the storm, the head of <b>Sucre</b> state declared a state of emergency, and later Caracas was placed under the same state once the rains began. According to the governor of Venezuela's capital district, local weather media expected the storm to only brush Caracas and surrounding areas; as a result, not all precautions were made. On August7, weather officials stated that the brunt of the storm had passed and that the storm was weakening; this was before the onslaught of the flooding rains. In neighboring Colombia, officials issued a wind and heavy rain warning in response to the storm. Towns shut off electricity along the coast and canceled flights.
