40|$|Although {{sickling}} and <b>solubility</b> <b>tests</b> and {{peripheral blood}} film methods are today available for {{sickle cell disease}} screening in Uganda, their reliability and ease of applicability have not been determined. This study was therefore carried out to determine the reliability of sickling and <b>solubility</b> <b>tests</b> and peripheral blood film method for screening for SCD in Uganda. This was descriptive laboratory based study which was carried out at Makerere University College of Health Sciences. The 200 samples from children aged between 6 months and five years were independently analyzed using sickling and <b>solubility</b> <b>tests</b> and peripheral blood film method. Hemoglobin electrophoresis cellulose acetate {{was used as the}} gold standard. Sickling and <b>solubility</b> <b>tests</b> had sensitivities of 65. 0 % and 45. 0 % respectively and peripheral film had 35. 0 %. Sickling, solubility and peripheral film had specificities of 95. 6 %, 90. 0 % and 96. 7 % respectively. Sickling had diagnostic accuracy of 92. 5 %, solubility (85. 5 %) and peripheral film (90. 5 %). Sickling had a Cohen’s Kappa of 0. 6, solubility 0. 3 and peripheral film 0. 4. Sickling test had turn around time (TAT) of 38 minutes, solubility 70 minutes and peripheral 44 minutes. In conclusion, the sickling test was more reliable and easier to perform than solubility test and peripheral blood film method. It would therefore be a recommended test for preliminary screening of children for SCD at district health centers IV and confirming only positives using hemoglobin electrophoresis...|$|E

40|$|BBL ™ Desoxycholate Reagent Droppers {{are used}} for the {{presumptive}} differentiation of pneumococci from other gram-positive cocci by the bile <b>solubility</b> <b>test.</b> SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Sodium desoxycholate is a salt of purified bile acid {{and can be used}} in lower concentrations than other salts of bile acids. It is soluble in water and lyses pneumococcal cells treated with a 10 % solution. The bile <b>solubility</b> <b>test</b> may be performed by adding the sodium desoxycholate solution to a cell suspension or directly to colonies on a blood agar plate. 1 - 3 Each dropper is good for one day’s use after ampule has been broken. PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE The bile <b>solubility</b> <b>test</b> is based on the observation that cells of Streptococcus pneumoniae lyse when treated with a 10 % solution of sodium desoxycholate, while other streptococci and grampositive cocci are not bile soluble. Lysis occurs because bile soluble organisms contain an autolytic amidase that, when activated by bile salts, cleaves the bond between alanine and muramic acid in the cell wall. 4 REAGENTS Desoxycholate Reagent Droppers contain 0. 5 mL of 10 % aqueous solution of sodium desoxycholate...|$|R

The deionized water used in the <b>solubility</b> <b>test</b> was submitted to atomic absorption spectrophotometry to determine and quantify Ca 2 +, Na+, K+, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 + and Pb 2 + ions release. In addition, the outer and inner surfaces of nonsubmitted and submitted samples of each material to the <b>solubility</b> <b>test</b> were analysed by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way anova and Tukeys post hoc tests (a = 0. 05). Results Solubility results, in percentage, sorted in an increasing order were - 1. 24 +/- 0. 19 (MTA-A), 0. 28 +/- 0. 08 (AH Plus), 5. 65 +/- 0. 80 (Sealapex), 14. 89 +/- 0. 73 (MTA Fillapex) and 20. 64 +/- 1. 42 (iRoot SP). AH Plus and MTA-A were statistically similar (P > 0. 05), but different from the other materials (P < 0. 05). High levels of Ca 2 + ion release were observed in all groups except AH Plus sealer. MTA-A also had the highest release of Na 2 + and K+ ions. Zn+ 2 ion release was observed only with AH Plus and Sealapex sealers. After the <b>solubility</b> <b>test,</b> all surfaces had morphological changes. The loss of matrix was evident and the filler particles were more distinguishable.

The hinged polymer material was studied intensively in terms of its spectroscopy; Fourier Transform Infrared - FTIR, 1 H’NMR, thermal properties (Differential Scanning Calorimetry-DSC and Thermogravimetric Analysis-TGA) as well as voltammetry and conductivity. Conductivity was evaluated using three different approaches including; 4 probe measurements, plotting of I/V curves based on potentiostatic measurements and an electrochemical impedance experiment using a dielectric Solartron interface.

To enhance the acid performance and to minimize formation damage, this study provides a systematic investigation of the interactions between the Al-based retarded mud acid and clay minerals in sandstone reservoirs. Furthermore, for the first time, ??F NMR spectroscopy was used to follow the reactions of Al-based retarded mud acid with clay minerals. <b>Solubility</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to evaluate the retardation of the Al-based retarded mud acid when reacted with kaolinite, bentonite, and illite. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and ??F NMR were used to analyze the concentrations of key cations and components in the supernatant while the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were used to identify the reaction products and detect any precipitation. This study shows that AlCl? can retard the reaction of HF with kaolinite, bentonite, or illite at 75 and 200 ?F in Al-based retarded mud acid. Even with 5 wt% AlC?? 6 H?O added to the acid system, no AlF? precipitate was observed in any of the <b>solubility</b> <b>tests.</b> Coreflood tests showed significant permeability improvement in the Berea sandstone when Al-based retarded mud acid was used.

Synthetic compound was carried out organoleptic <b>test,</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>test,</b> melting point test, gas chromatography, structure elucidation with ultraviolet spectrophotometry, infrared spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR), mass spectroscopy; and amount of yield. Synthetic compound was white smooth crystal powder, and had a specific flavour with yield was 4. 68 % and melting point was 132 - 133 OC. <b>Solubility</b> <b>test</b> showed the  synthetic compound dissolved in ethanol, methanol, chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, hot water, and acetone; very difficult soluble in water. Gas chromatography chromatogram showed one peak with retention time 13. 321 minute. Based on structure elucidation conclude that synthetic compound was cinnamic acid...|$|R
