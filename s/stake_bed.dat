5000|$|Gladiator {{trucks were}} {{available}} as: Cab and Chassis; Wrecker; Stake Bed; and chassis-mounted campers with extended wheelbases. The load bed options were Townside, Thriftside (a [...] "step-side"), and <b>Stake</b> <b>Bed,</b> {{with up to}} 8600 lb G.V.W. and almost two-ton payload capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Variations {{included}} a passenger bus called a Metro Coach, a Metro partial cab-chassis with front-end sections (for end-user customization), and a cab-over truck called a [...] "walk-in cab". The truck (also called a chassis cab) variation could be configured {{with a separate}} box or container for cargo transport or left open to be fitted with other equipment such as a compactor for a garbage truck or a <b>stake</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Large {{flood storage}} {{reservoirs}} serve many ecosystem functions but {{suffer from a}} decrease in aquatic habitat quality due {{to the loss of}} large woody debris. Because of this, reservoirs are often the target of habitat enhancement projects, which aim {{to increase the amount of}} structure in the reservoir. These structures may be natural, such as rock and brush piles, or they can be artificial and composed of synthetic materials. The addition of structures meets certain objectives, such as increasing angler success and providing fish nursery habitat, adult fish sanctuary, and a site for fish spawning and production (Tugend et al. 2002). However, artificial structures can be costly, difficult to maintain, and ineffective and unaesthetically pleasing in shallow water. We suggest using Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) as an alternative to <b>stake</b> <b>beds,</b> which is the most common type of artificial structure in Kentucky Lake. Bald cypress can withstand long periods of inundation (Megonigal and Day 1992), and it is native to Kentucky. Furthermore, the tree’s pneumatophores and buttresses can mimic the interstitial spacing of <b>stake</b> <b>beds</b> and other artificial structures. In this study, we quantified fish use of cypress trees, <b>stake</b> <b>beds,</b> and open water areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} {{effect of}} Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn sulfides on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity of Mo and W sulfides, under experimental conditions like industrial ones, using <b>staked</b> <b>beds,</b> was studied. Synergism between <b>staked</b> <b>beds</b> {{in all the}} studied pairs, with a magnitude that leads a volcano curve with a maximum in Co and Ni sulfides was detected. Promotion was well explained by the formation of spillover hydrogen (Hso) in the first bed (in which Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn sulfides supported on g-Al 2 O 3 were located) that migrate to the second bed (in which Mo or W sulfides supported on g-Al 2 O 3 were located), 5 mm below.

50|$|Cars {{and trucks}} were also molded in larger sizes, from about five inches {{up to about}} ten inches or so. These {{appeared}} both as cars and trucks / utility vehicles. Larger cars included an Indianapolis style open wheel racer (see photo), a 1957 Cadillac Eldorado convertible, a less realistic Cadillac-style 'station wagon', and also a 1955 Plymouth station wagon airport limousine with nine different people molded into the windows (see photo). Utility vehicles produced were a detailed fire truck, a variety of tractors and farm implements, a road grader and other construction vehicles, an articulated cab and <b>stake</b> <b>bed</b> truck. Tanks and airplanes were a staple, and many other more fantastic creations were also produced.|$|E
50|$|Pioneer {{sessions}} {{were introduced in}} 1965. Although not technically a unit, the pioneer {{sessions were}} unique in that they were two weeks long allowing campers a more in-depth camping experience. During their stay campers were given extra time and opportunities to participate in their favorite activities. The highlight of their stay was an overnight canoe trip to Lake Egypt. Campers traveled {{in the back of}} a <b>stake</b> <b>bed</b> truck to a peninsula of Lake Egypt, from which they would paddle to another peninsula on the lake to camp out during the night. Campers carried all their food and gear in the canoes with them. The Pioneer sessions were an early experiment for camp with trips away from camp. As Frontier units were later introduced the Pioneer sessions were discontinued. The early 2000s saw a return of two-week sessions in the form of Mega Camp. This allowed campers the chance to stay two weeks and participate in extra activities such as the climbing wall and teams course. Although no such program currently exists, campers may attend as many concurrent sessions as they qualify for according to gender.|$|E
50|$|Small {{cars were}} at first {{packaged}} in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, {{with a few}} exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' {{on opposite sides of}} each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft {{have been made in the}} small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied.Siku keeps up with odd German sports cars selections like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on flat bed semi trucks, forestry log loaders, piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed <b>stake</b> <b>bed</b> Mercedes Unimog, potato digger truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10 story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long).|$|E

50|$|These {{were simple}} and {{straightforward}} trucks with stubby noses and short turning radius. Their name {{is correct in}} that many were purchased as fleet trucks, and usually lacked the flash and comfort of the more custom Transtar series. These trucks were reliable, easily fixed and maintained, and offered a low cost heavy truck for those looking in this market area. The construction and heavy duty market also got its version of the Fleetstar with a special Construction package, but these were eclipsed by the smaller Loadstar and larger Paystar series of trucks. Many older Fleetstar trucks got a second lease on life after over the road trucking by being converted to everything from <b>stake</b> <b>beds</b> to van bodies to dump trucks. Quite a few examples are around with over 1 million miles on the odometer.|$|R

40|$|Public health {{fears and}} {{economic}} concerns surround bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations. A resurgence of bed bug infestations was seen nationwide {{beginning in the}} early 2000 s, and anecdotal reports from pesticide applicators and health districts in Idaho suggest a similar upward trend; however, the magnitude of the Idaho problem, the geographic distribution, pesticide application practices, costs, and client education practices is unclear. Web-based, electronic, and phone surveys were developed for three groups with a <b>stake</b> in <b>bed</b> bug response and/or control including Idaho Health Districts, licensed pest control operations (PCO), and members of the Idaho lodging and restaurant association in order to assess the bed bug problem in Idaho. Preliminary PCO responses suggest a statewide distribution of bed bugs, with an apparent increase in call volume over the last 12 months suggests this is an increasing burden. Preliminary survey results suggest that complaints were received from all lodging types; however, hotels, shelters, and high-density housing were most frequently reported as problematic settings for infestation. Bed bugs were found extensively throughout these facilities, especially near beds. The inspection and pesticide application process is timely, often requiring repeat application, and costly to achieve elimination. There is a need for Idaho-specific educational materials by both public health and PCO professionals regarding bed bug public health risks and safe elimination practices...|$|R
50|$|Borrowing {{a tactic}} used by general Ngô Quyền in 938 to defeat an invading Chinese fleet, the Đại Việt forces drove iron-tipped <b>stakes</b> into the <b>bed</b> of the Bạch Đằng River, and then, {{with a small}} flotilla, lured the Mongol fleet into the river just as the tide was {{starting}} to ebb, while their route to the sea had been blockaded by large warships. Unable to return or escape to the sea, the entire Mongol fleet of 400 craft {{was caught in a}} bloody boarding and missile battle, sunk, captured, or burned by fire arrows. This would later become known as the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288). The invading Mongol army of the Yuan retreated to China, harassed en route by Trần Hưng Đạo's troops. The Yuan officers such as Abachi and Fanji died in the bloody retreat and Omar was captured.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 25 - 30 years, cassava {{agronomy}} research in India has made tremendous progress. In {{the recent past}} {{there has been a}} steady increase in the cultivation of cassava in nontraditional areas, despite the fact that cereals form the major crop and staple food of the country. There has been a marked {{increase in the number of}} cassava-based industries in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, which is responsible for the expansion of the area under cassava in those states. Compared to 1980 / 81 the cassava area in Andhra Pradesh increased by 40 % and in Tamil Nadu by 34 %. In the state of Kerala, where cassava is traditionally grown for food, the cassava area decreased considerably (46 %) due to farmers’ preference for more remunerative plantation crops like rubber and coconut. A shift in the traditional cropping pattern, however, could also be noted in Kerala where rice in the lowlands is now being replaced by cassava, as the latter produces more income than the former. The yield of cassava has been almost static in the range of 19 to 23 t/ ha in Kerala, about 7 to 10 t/ha in Andhra Pradesh, and 36 - 37 t/ha in Tamil Nadu, which has the highest yield in the world. Extensive research on cassava’s nutritional requirements, agro-techniques, cropping systems and a long-term fertilizer trial have been conducted during the past three decades. Under rainfed conditions the best time of planting was found to be April-May; however, under irrigated conditions, it can be planted during any part of the year. Pit followed by mound has been identified as the best method for planting cassava stakes, using a spacing of 90 x 90 cm. Removing all but two healthy shoots on opposite sides of the stem has been found to increase yields. Investigations on the use of cassava plants as an alternate source for rearing eri silk worms revealed that the cassava root yield was adversely affected by this practice. Irrigating the crop at 25 per cent available soil moisture depletion level during the growth period could double the root yield. Supplementary irrigation at IW/CPE ratio= 1. 0 increased the root yield by 90 per cent over the rainfed crop. Continuous application of NPK fertilizers did not significantly effect soil pH, but the available nutrient status of the soil was considerably enhanced, while the build-up of P was excessively high. An appreciable increase in the soil pH (4. 7 to 6. 1) was noticed in the treatment that received continuous applications of wood ash. Organic carbon content of the soil was found to increase in the plots that received farm-yard manure (FYM). When chemical fertilizers were applied regularly, the Cu and Zn status of the soil declined, but these deficiencies were not observed in plots that received FYM in addition to NPK. It was further revealed that the N and K requirement of the crop was in the ratio of 1 : 1. Liming at a rate of 2 t CaO/ha was found to be effective in increasing root yields in very acid soils. Application of sulfur resulted in an increase in starch and a decrease in the HCN content of roots. Significant responses to soil application of the micronutrients Zn, B and Mo were also observed. Cropping systems research has shown that short-duration (seven months) cassava varieties can be grown successfully in a rice-based cropping system. Cowpea and groundnut were found quite remunerative as intercrops in cassava. Incorporation of cowpea as green manure in situ at time of planting cassava was found to be as effective as the application of FYM; in addition, it also reduced the N requirement by 50 %. Cassava stems stored vertically gave better sprouting on planting as compared to those stored horizontally. Cassava stems of 7 - 11 months age and having a diameter of 2 - 4 cm were ideal as planting material. In non-traditional areas where rainfall is limited to 4 - 5 months per year, planting of cassava <b>stakes</b> in nursery <b>beds</b> at very close spacing, followed by transplanting at 20 DAP, was found to be quite effective in ensuring uniform establishment of the crop while also enhancing the eradication of cassava mosaic disease. When cassava was grown on slopes, planting on staggered mounds reduced soil loss due to erosion by 40 - 50 %. When cassava was grown in a multitier cropping system, its association with banana or coconut was found to be beneficial; however, when grown with eucalyptus or leucaena, the root yields were reduced by 60 - 80 %. Pruning the crop at eight months and thereafter retaining the crop for another eight months resulted in a two-fold increase in yield over the normal harvest...|$|R
40|$|Fishing for {{shrimp in}} San Francisco Bay started about 1869. The first {{fishermen}} were Italians {{and there were}} 8 boats engaged in the fishery. They used small meshed seines 60 feet long and 8 feet deep with a bag in the center. The nets were used in deep water and took very few small shrimp or fish. They usually took from 50 to 75 pounds of shrimp in a haul and made from 3 to 5 hauls on each tide. In 1871 the Chinese introduced the Chinese shrimp net and began to take large quantities of shrimp, but as the market for fresh shrimp has always been limited, the greater portion of the catches was dried for export to China. The Chinese fished in Tomales Bay and San Francisco Bay. The Tomales Bay camps were abandoned during the early nineties. In 1885 public opinion became aroused against the Chinese nets, as they took large quantities of young fish, and the controversy on this subject continued until 1901, when the Legislature passed a law placing a closed season on shrimp fishing for the months of May, June, July and August. The Chinese hired attorneys to fight this. A boat crew was arrested for a test case, which the State won through all the courts {{up to and including}} the United States Supreme Court. In 1905 the shrimp interests managed to get the four-month closed season removed, {{but at the same time}} it was made unlawful to export dried shrimps. In 1909 a closed season of three months, June, July and August, was again adopted, and in 1911 the use of the Chinese nets was prohibited altogether. During the period from 1900 to 1911 there was constant trouble over the shrimp fishing. Fish and game deputies were arresting the Chinese crews and there was continual agitation. In 1915 the backers of the Chinese put through a bill which again allowed shrimp fishing on south San Francisco Bay (District 13) with the Chinese shrimp nets. At about the same time a trawl was put in use in the northern end of the bay. The law prohibiting the exportation of dried shrimps was retained until 1919, when it was repealed. From 1919 to the present time Chinese shrimp nets have been used in District 13, the shrimp trawls in District 12, and not more than one-half of any one catch could be dried legally. Shrimp fishing is carried on under several methods of organization. Frank Spenger Company and Quan Brothers maintain their own camps and buy the shrimps from the trawlers, who fish for them at a definite price per pound. The fishermen in this case have no more interest in the shrimps after they have delivered them. The Chinese camps in South San Francisco are organized under three working plans. The larger number of camps are owned by Chinese companies maintaining offices in Chinatown. These camps are leased to a group of men who work on shares among themselves. The company which owns the camp is paid for its use by handling the total catch at a definite price which allows it a profit. The price paid to the camps for fresh shrimps, for instance, has been 5 ½ cents per pound for a number of years. The camp crew maintains the boats, gear and buildings, and manages its own commissary as a community affair. One man is usually camp boss and has the responsibility of supervising the activities of the camp. There are two camps which depart from this procedure. In one of these, two men own the camp and gear and pay definite wages and found to the crew, and in the other, two men own the boat and gear and work in partnership, sometimes hiring a third man. The present day camps vary from a 2 man outfit fishing 20 nets to a camp of 8 men using 50 nets. The first of September is the beginning of the fiscal year in the camps. At this time the shareholders are at liberty to break away if they choose and go to some other camp. Very few groups stay together more than a year, and there is considerable shifting around, though few men leave the fishery and very few new men come in. The beds maintained by each company are held from year to year. They were originally laid out on a first-come-first-served basis. There are unwritten rules concerning the <b>staking</b> of new <b>beds.</b> A new bed must be far enough away so it will not "cork" an old bed. "Claim jumping" is rare, but a controversy over this between two large companies nearly precipitated a tong war in 1930. The matter was, however, amicably arranged. A bed does not necessarily have to be operated to be held. The larger companies generally have two or more beds, although they seldom work more than one. In some portions of the bay the beds can be used only during the summer due to weather conditions, and these are left idle during the winter...|$|R
