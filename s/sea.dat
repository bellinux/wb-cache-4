5|$|A {{number of}} <b>sea</b> anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out <b>sea</b> anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the <b>sea</b> anemone. Despite their venomous cells, <b>sea</b> anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, <b>sea</b> spiders and molluscs. The <b>sea</b> slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the <b>sea</b> otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in <b>sea</b> otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The <b>sea</b> otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of <b>sea</b> otters in 1989.|$|E

5000|$|Acoustic <b>seabed</b> {{classification}} is the partitioning of a <b>seabed</b> {{acoustic image}} into discrete physical entities or classes. This {{is a particularly}} active area of development {{in the field of}} <b>seabed</b> mapping, marine geophysics, underwater acoustics and benthic habitat mapping. <b>Seabed</b> [...] classification is one route to characterizing the <b>seabed</b> and its habitats. <b>Seabed</b> characterization makes the link between the classified regions and the <b>seabed</b> physical, geological, chemical or biological properties. Acoustic <b>seabed</b> classification is possible using a wide range of acoustic imaging systems including multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar, single-beam echosounders, interferometric systems and sub-bottom profilers. <b>Seabed</b> classification based on acoustic properties can be divided into two main categories; surficial <b>seabed</b> classification and sub-surface <b>seabed</b> classification. Sub-surface imaging technologies use lower frequency sound to provide higher penetration, whereas surficial imaging technologies provide higher resolution imagery by utilizing higher frequencies (especially in shallow water).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{hydrodynamic}} forces {{acting on}} the <b>seabed</b> around the pipeline in unidirectional ocean currents have been investigated numerically. Two types of <b>seabed</b> are considered, i. e., plane and distorted <b>seabed.</b> The influences of gap between pipeline and <b>seabed</b> {{on the distribution of}} forces along the <b>seabed</b> are studied in detail. Computational re-sults show that the pressure at the upstream side of the pipeline gradually decreases and the pressure difference between two sides of the pipeline presents a declining trend with the increase of gap between pipeline and <b>seabed.</b> For the pressure distributions between the distorted <b>seabed</b> and the plane <b>seabed,</b> a double-peaks distribution is observed for the case of distorted <b>seabed,</b> but only one peak exists for the plane <b>seabed.</b> With the increase of gap between pipeline and <b>seabed,</b> the value of peak shear stress along the distorted <b>seabed</b> at the upstream side gradually decreases and the one at the down-stream side varies slightly. When the gap ratio reaches 0. 7, the peak shear stress at the upstream side of the pipeline al-ready decreases to a normal level for the case of distorted <b>seabed,</b> while the peak shear stress at downstream side is still a large one for the distorted <b>seabed...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} {{model for the}} wave-induced <b>seabed</b> response in a porous <b>seabed</b> is proposed. Most previous studies have considered two-dimensional cases and a flat <b>seabed.</b> In this study, a full three-dimensional case is considered {{as well as a}} sloping <b>seabed.</b> The wave model (SWAN) and soil model (PORO-WSI) is coupled into one model. With the new model, the effects of wave and soil characteristics on the ocean waves-induced <b>seabed</b> response (including pore pressure and stresses) are investigated. Based on numerical results, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the magnitude of the wave-induced soil response in a sloping <b>seabed</b> is much smaller than that in a flat <b>seabed</b> (2) the wave-induced pore pressure decreases as the slope of the <b>seabed</b> increases.

5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded <b>sea</b> kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related <b>sea</b> snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded <b>sea</b> krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda <b>sea</b> snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E

5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the <b>sea</b> mink was its own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. Those {{who argue that}} the <b>sea</b> mink was a subspecies often {{refer to it as}} Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the <b>sea</b> mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest <b>sea</b> mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the <b>sea</b> mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be <b>sea</b> minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were <b>sea</b> minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the <b>sea</b> mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E
