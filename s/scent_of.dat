5|$|Between April and May 1996, Hoffman {{appeared}} at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing-Davey production of Caryl Churchill's The Skriker. Following this, based on his work in <b>Scent</b> <b>of</b> a Woman, he was cast by writer–director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in his debut feature Hard Eight (1996).

Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{levels in}} males {{have been shown}} to vary {{according}} to the ovulating state of females. Males who were exposed to <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> ovulating women recorded a higher testosterone level than males who were exposed to <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> nonovulating women. Being exposed to female ovulating cues may increase testosterone, which in turn may increase males' motivation to engage in, and initiate, sexual behaviour. Ultimately, these higher levels of testosterone may increase the reproductive success of males exposed to female ovulation cues.|$|R

5|$|Though P. rebeli parasitizes the Myrmica schencki ants and Gentiana cruciata food plant, it also {{acts as a}} host to the {{parasitoid}} ichneumon wasp (Ichneumon eumerus). The I. eumerus is a wasp {{that attempts}} to parasitize the P. rebeli {{after it has been}} introduced to the Myrmica ants' nests. The adult wasp searches for Myrmica ant nests by responding strongly to the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> Myrmica schencki ants, the species that P. rebeli most commonly and successfully parasitizes.|$|E
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E

5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity of the organism.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
