40|$|Coastal and estuarine {{nurseries}} {{are essential}} habitats for juvenile flatfish. These small but productive areas provide food supply and sustain adult fish populations. The Mont-Saint-Michel Bay (MSMB) supports an important flatfish nursery ground but differs from many other nursery habitats due to limited freshwater inputs. The {{objectives of the}} present study in the MSMB were to (1) use gut content analysis to identify prey of the 2 most abundant flatfish <b>species</b> (<b>common</b> <b>sole</b> Solea solea and plaice Pleuronectes platessa) for different juvenile age-classes (0 -group and 1 -group for sole, 0 -group for plaice), (2) use C and N stable isotope analysis to model the production sources sustaining juvenile flatfish production, and (3) compare these results with previous knowledge of estuarine nursery grounds located in western Europe. Items found in gut contents differed between species and size classes, with juvenile plaice having a larger prey spectrum. Despite accounting for sensitivity to large uncertainties in source signatures and trophic enrichment factors, stable isotope mixing models led to robust outputs. In contrast to previous studies in estuarine nurseries, we found that microphytobenthos was the major carbon source contribution to juvenile flatfish. The contribution of freshwater particulate organic matter was nonetheless significant, in spite of the very limited river inputs to MSMB...|$|E

40|$|DISPAS [3] is an individual-based, probabilistic, {{agent-based}} simulator {{developed as}} a support for fish stock assessment, in particular for the <b>species</b> of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea L.) in the Adriatic Sea. DISPAS has been developed by the University of Camerino {{in collaboration with the}} Institute of Marine Sciences (CNR - ISMAR) of Ancona. The simulator is implemented on the Repast Symphony suite [2] and can be used to reproduce the biomass and the abundance of the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> observed along the period 2005 - 2011 by scientific surveys. Data for the estimation of the probabilities and for the validation come from the SoleMon project [1]. In order to specify and simulate more detailed scenarios, spatial interactions among the agents and the environment are introduced. In particular, each agent - representing an individual of the modeled species - can perform a Random Walk within the simulation space, which is divided in a grid of cells. Each cell is also associated with a value representing Food Availability. Such amount can be consumed by the agents and is continuously generated using a given rate. The rate can be influenced by geographical or environmental available data. Another improvement is the introduction - besides the current micro scale, where the simulated space is an average square kilometer - of a macro scale in which the entire Adriatic Sea can be represented and simulated. In the latter case, an agent does not represent an individual of the species anymore; instead, it represents a group of individuals that can possibly move from an area of the sea to another according to known biological information...|$|R
40|$|International audience: Coastal {{systems could}} be {{affected}} by hypoxic events brought about by global change. These areas are essential nursery habitats for several fish <b>species</b> including the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea L.). Tolerance of fish to hypoxia depends on species and also on their physiological condition and nutritional status. Indeed, high dietary lipid content has been recently shown to negatively impact the resistance of sole to a severe hypoxic challenge. In order to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the early response to hypoxic stress, the present work examined the hepatic transcriptome in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> fed diets with low and high lipid content, exposed to severe hypoxia. The activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was also investigated through the quantification of threonine- 172 phosphorylation in the alpha subunit. The results show that hypoxia consistently regulates several actors involved in energy metabolism pathways and particularly AMPKα, {{as well as some}} involved in cell growth and maintenance or unfolded protein response. Our findings reveal that (1) the expression of genes involved in biological processes with high energy cost or implicated in aerobic ATP synthesis was down-regulated by hypoxia, contrary to genes involved in neoglucogenesis or in angiogenesis, (2) the consumption of high lipid induced regulation of metabolic pathways going against this energy saving, and (3) this control was fine-tuned by the regulation of several transcriptomic factors. These results provide insight into the biological processes involved in the hepatic response to hypoxic stress and underline the negative impact of high lipid consumption on the tolerance of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> to hypoxia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{hierarchical}} Bayesian framework for modeling {{the life cycle}} of marine exploited fish with a spatial perspective. The application was developed for a nursery-dependent fish <b>species,</b> the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea), on the Eastern Channel population (Western Europe). The approach combined processes of different natures and various sources of observations within an integrated framework for life-cycle modeling: (1) outputs of an individual-based model for larval drift and survival that provided yearly estimates of the dispersion and mortality of eggs and larvae, from spawning grounds to settlement in several coastal nurseries; (2) a habitat suitability model, based on juvenile trawl surveys coupled with a geographic information system, to estimate juvenile densities and surface areas of suitable juvenile habitat in each nursery sector; (3) a statistical catch-at-age model for the estimation of the numbers-at-age and the fishing mortality on subadults and adults. The approach provided estimates of hidden variables and parameters of key biological significance. A simulation approach provided insight to the robustness of the approach when only weak data are available. Estimates of spawning biomass, fishing mortality, and recruitment were close to the estimations derived from stock-assessment working groups. In addition, the model quantified mortality along the life cycle, and estimated site-specific density-dependent mortalities between settled larvae and age- 0 juveniles in each nursery ground. This provided {{a better understanding of the}} productivity and the specific contribution of each nursery ground toward recruitment and population renewal. Perspectives include further development of the modeling framework on the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> and applications to other fish species to disentangle the effects of multiple interacting stress factors (e. g., estuarine and coastal nursery habitat degradation, fishing pressure) on population renewal and to develop risk analysis in the context of marine spatial planning for sustainable management of fish resources...|$|R
40|$|Ende, S. S. W. (2015). Culturing soles on ragworms: Growth {{and feeding}} behaviour. PhD thesis, Wageningen University, The Netherlands. Despite the high market demand and {{intensive}} research efforts since the 1960 s commercial culture of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea L.) has been unsuccessful. Problems related to availability and price of suitable raw materials (invertebrates) {{and the low}} tolerance to crowding have hampered the development of intensive sole culture. Alternative extensive pond cultures systems are currently explored where <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> can graze on natural food. The general {{aim of this study}} was to get insight into which factors limit growth of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> foraging on ragworms in ponds. The results did not show any nutritional effects that may hamper the growth of <b>common</b> <b>sole.</b> At non-limiting conditions, i. e. when fed chopped ragworms and when housed in sediment free tanks, <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> showed higher food intake, higher growth rates and higher nutrient utilization efficiencies than when fed mussels or a formulated diet. The results however suggest that growth in a pond with ragworms was limited by reduced foraging capabilities of <b>common</b> <b>sole.</b> To explore this hypothesis, the effect of prey size, predator size and prey density were tested. Overall, intake of buried ragworms was reduced by more than half in contrast to intake of unburied ragworms. Intake of buried ragworms was reduced regardless of ragworm size or <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> size. Increasing ragworm density only resulted in satiation intake values in smaller <b>common</b> <b>sole.</b> Our results additionally indicate that the presence of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> hampers ragworm performance in a pond. Ragworms reduced their feeding activities when receiving water from tanks which contained <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> and ragworms, i. e. when <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> could graze on ragworms. Results from this PhD study suggest that the growth of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> in ponds is not limited by nutritional but by their foraging abilities. However, the results of this study are too incomplete to fully predict growth performance of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> in a pond. Factors such as temperature, oxygen supply or feeding activity need to be investigated to make comprehensive growth predictions.  ...|$|R

The growth rate in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> fed the natural prey (8. 5 g kg- 0. 8 d- 1) was significantly higher compared to the growth rate in fish fed the artificial feed (5. 1 g kg- 0. 8 d- 1). Nutrient and energy intake was significantly lower in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> fed the artificial feed than in fish fed natural prey. The only exception was fat intake which was higher in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> fed the artificial feed in contrast to fish fed the natural prey. Nutrient and energy retention efficiencies were significantly lower in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> fed the artificial feed than in fish fed the natural prey. In conclusion, the low growth in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> fed the artificial feed was related to lower nutrient and energy intake as well as lower nutrient and energy retention efficiencies.

40|$|International audienceThe French Atlantic coast {{contains}} large highly productive intertidal mudflats {{that are}} colonised by juveniles of numerous flatfish <b>species,</b> including the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea, L.). These ecosystems are also heavily exploited by the shellfish farming industry. Intensive bivalve culture {{is associated with}} substantial biodeposition (1 – 6 t-dw ha− 1 day− 1), which directly or indirectly contributes to increase exopolysaccharide (EPS) concentrations at the interface between water column and seabed. EPS are long-chain molecules organised into colloids, which influence rheological properties of water, particularly viscosity. Increased water viscosity had consequences for ventilatory activity of juvenile flatfish, whereby the minimal pressure required to ventilate the medium increases directly with EPS concentration. Moreover, the critical EPS concentration ([EPS]crit) at which water was {{no longer able to}} flow through the branchial basket ranged from almost nil to over 30 mg l− 1, depending on species and size. [EPS]crit was lower in small individuals and individuals from species with high metabolic rates (turbot and plaice). These differences may depend upon gill and bucco-branchial cavity morphometrics. The ventilatory workload of sole increased with viscosity to a maximum at 2 mg EPS l− 1. Viscosity might, therefore, be a limiting factor for flatfish post larvae, which colonise the intertidal mudflats, depending upon their size and species. EPS concentrations in the field can reach 15 mg l− 1. A selective effect is conceivable but remains to be estimated in the field...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the {{spatial distribution of}} young-of-the-year <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> based on beam trawl surveys conducted in late summer in the coastal and estuarine parts of the Bay of Biscay (France).

To kill without recovery, the current was applied for 5 s, followed by chilling in ice water for 10 min. Loss of consciousness and sensibility were assessed by neural (EEG), physiological (ECG) and behavioural parameters. An epileptiform insult was observed in all yellowtail kingfish (n = 27), <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (n = 25) and pike-perch (n = 25) after administering a current of 0. 54 +/- 0. 12 A(rms) (124 V dc and 11 V-rms ac; 100 Hz), 0. 65 +/- 0. 23 A(rms) (98 V dc and 8. 4 V-rms ac; 100 Hz) and 0. 75 +/- 0. 24 A(rms) (144 V dc and 13 V-rms ac; 100 Hz) during 1 s through the head of individual fish, respectively. When yellowtail kingfish (n = 11) was submitted to a 5 s electrical stun followed by chilling in ice water, this resulted in passing 0. 72 +/- 0. 13 A(rms) for 5 s and no recovery during chilling. In the case of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (n = 10) and pike-perch (n = 12), passing 1. 4 +/- 0. 64 and 0. 75 +/- 0. 24 A(rms) during 5 s followed by chilling in ice water for 10 min resulted in an irrecoverable stun in 9 out 10 fish and 11 out 12 fish, respectively. We conclude that for yellowtail kingfish the investigated combination of electrical stunning and chilling is suitable for humane slaughter, whereas for <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> and pike-perch this procedure needs to be optimised.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to design a {{breeding}} program for increased productivity of farmed <b>common</b> <b>sole,</b> Solea solea, 1) using natural mating in groups to obtain offspring and 2) using present farm infrastructures as much as possible. Parental allocation with DNA marker data on offspring from natural mating parents showed that parental contributions were highly skewed. This indicates that few animals contribute to majority of the offspring. Levels of coancestry in offspring populations were high (2 - 4 %) showing that selection methods need to restrict rates of inbreeding in future generations. Genetic variances of body weight and body length in <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> were measured at harvest and it was shown that genetic improvement of these traits is possible. It was pointed out that selection on growth of <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> needs {{to be accompanied by}} selection for shape to compensate for undesired correlated responses in shape. Further, it was demonstrated that in populations with skewed contributions, use of marker data can be more efficient once breeding values are estimated with continuous molecular relatedness rather than with a reconstructed pedigree. To decrease costs of breeding programs, selection of parents may be from production populations directly. Results indicated that estimation of genetic parameters is affected by husbandry practices as grading, but that effects are predictable. To optimise breeding programs with natural mating of parents, 2 -stage selection schemes with optimal contribution selection from mass selected and genotyped fractions were compared with mass selection schemes. Using 2 -stage selection schemes, rates of inbreeding can be restricted with a smaller nucleus than with mass selection schemes. However, response is lower as well. The different findings in this thesis are put into context of a breeding program for <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> and discussed in relation to profitability, benefits of natural mating and correlated responses to selection for growth...|$|R

In the present study, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to describe the trophic network until the young-of-the-year sole and to compare interannual variations in the dominant trophic pathways in the sole nursery areas in this bay. Particulate organic matter (POM), sediment organic matter (SOM), microphytobenthos, benthic invertebrate sole prey and young-of-the-year <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> were collected during the summer over 4 years characterised by contrasting river discharges.
