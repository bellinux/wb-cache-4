40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} concentrations and emission rates of particulate matter (PM) from mechanically ventilated livestock buildings were evaluated {{in a laboratory}} facility and in a swine-finishing barn. Concentrations of PM were measured inside the room (room sam-pling) and at the exhaust duct (exhaust sam-pling). Concentrations at the exhaust duct were determined using high-volume traverse downstream of the exhaust fan, low-volume traverse downstream of the fan, and fixed sampling upstream and downstream of the fan. The traverse methods, which served as the reference, were conducted under isokinetic conditions; fixed sampling was done under both isokinetic and <b>sub-isokinetic</b> conditions. Compared to the traverse method, both room sampling and exhaust sampling under <b>sub-isokinetic</b> conditions overestimated PM con-centrations. Fixed sampling under isokinetic conditions, on the other hand, {{did not differ significantly}} (P> 0. 05) from the high-volume traverse method. Thus, isokinetic fixed sam-pling can be an alternative to the more expen-sive and time-consuming high-volume PM traverse method to measure PM concentra-tions and emission rates at the exhaust...|$|E
40|$|Data are {{reported}} for both airborne and wind tunnel {{testing of the}} aerosol inlet on the CIRPAS Twin Otter research aircraft. Though utilizing different instrumentation and assumptions, results from the two test venues show broad agreement. The roll off in transmission efficiency of the inlet under standard flight conditions starts at ∼ 3. 5 μm but plateaus at 5. 5 μm particle diameter at a value slightly in excess of 0. 6. This value persists to the upper limit of the test range at 9 μmand is likely due to the <b>sub-isokinetic</b> aspiration flow of the inlet. This research was conducted under ONR research grants N 00014 - 04 - 1 - 0447 and N 00014 - 97 - 1 - 0132...|$|E
40|$|The second-generation University of Colorado closed-path tunable-diode laser {{hygrometer}} (CLH- 2) is {{an instrument}} for the airborne in situ measurement of total water content – the sum of vapor-, liquid- and ice-phase water – in clouds. This compact instrument has been flown on the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V aircraft in an underwing canister. It operates autonomously and uses fiber-coupled optics to {{eliminate the need for}} a supply of dry compressed gas. In operation, sample air is ingested into a forward-facing <b>sub-isokinetic</b> inlet; this sampling configuration results in particle concentrations that are enhanced relative to ambient and causes greater instrument sensitivity to condensed water particles. Heaters within the inlet vaporize the ingested water particles, and the resulting augmented water vapor mixing ratio is measured by absorption of near-infrared light in a single-pass optical cell. The condensed water content is then determined by subtracting the ambient water vapor content from the total and by accounting for the inertial enhancement of particles into the sampling inlet. The CLH- 2 is calibrated in the laboratory over a range of pressures and water vapor mixing ratios; the uncertainty in CLH- 2 condensed water retrievals is estimated to be 14. 3 % to 16. 1 % (1 -σ). A vapor-only laboratory intercomparison with the first-generation University of Colorado closed-path tunable-diode laser hygrometer (CLH) shows agreement within the 2 -σ uncertainty bounds of both instruments...|$|E
