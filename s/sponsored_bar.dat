50|$|Although Mitchell's {{team has}} found its home in NASCAR, the team {{originated}} in 1978 with Circle <b>Bar</b> <b>sponsoring</b> Chet Fillip in late models. The team officially {{started out as}} Circle Bar Auto Racing Inc., with Fillip as their driver. The team qualified for the 1982 Indianapolis 500, finishing 24th in a Gurney Eagle with a Cosworth power plant. Fillip also qualified for the 1983 Indianapolis 500 before DNQ-ing for the 1985 Indy 500 with a Lola chassis. The next week at Milwaukee, the team finished 10th with Fillip and sold their equipment to Al Unser Jr., who would take the championship. CBR made its NASCAR debut with Fillip in 1985, in the No. 31 Circle Bar Truck Corral Ford at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Fillip ran sixteen races for Mitchell in 1986, and had a best finish of twelfth in the No. 81. At {{the end of the}} year, Mitchell sold his equipment to Fillip. Afterwards, Circle <b>Bar</b> <b>sponsored</b> the late model efforts of John Kelly in 1989, with the shop based in San Antonio, Texas. Moving to Ozona, the team picked up the championship in 1990. The next year, CBR moved to the All-Pro Series with Kelly, but Alabama native Rick Crawford took his place in 1992. Together, they attempted the 1993 Coca-Cola 600, but failed to qualify. Using Circle Bar's equipment, Crawford had great success in the All-Pro Series, beginning a partnership between Mitchell and Crawford to race in the series until 1996.|$|R
5000|$|Bainum's {{political}} career {{is best known}} for his successful efforts to end special tax breaks for private clubs, such as the all-male Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. Bainum and his sister, Barbara Bainum, filed a lawsuit against the club. In 1984, as a result of the lawsuit, a Montgomery County, Maryland, judge ruled that Burning Tree must give up its $186,000 yearly real estate tax exemption if it does not allow women. In 1986, legislation he <b>sponsored</b> that <b>barred</b> private clubs that exclude women from receiving state tax breaks became law. This effort earned him “the hostility of Washington’s politico-golfing community”. As a Maryland lawmaker, Bainum sponsored a child support bill to require employers to deduct court-ordered payments, similar to how taxes are deducted, as well as legislation requiring public officials to disclose withdrawals from failed savings and loans, increase penalties for illegal handgun use, make information public on toxic substances and hazardous waste, increase fees on heavy trucks to offset road repair costs, and tax relief for low-income tenants.|$|R

During the 1980s and 1990s, tobacco companies aggressively advertised their products in bars and nightclubs, mostly targeting younger audiences. According to insider documents from tobacco companies RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris, tobacco companies had several strategies for targeting youth.

[...] He would run the first four races of the season with Circle Bar, scoring two top tens. However, prior to Kansas Crawford announced that he would not race for Circle Bar in the #14 truck and would instead race in the Ray Hackett Racing #76 truck with sponsorship from SUPERSEAL Construction Products. This would be the first race in his record 327 Camping World Truck Series starts that he would not be in the #14 and would not be racing under Circle Bar Racing. Crawford would qualify for that race 15th and finish 31st after an accident going for the lead. In August, Crawford would take yet another unfamiliar step in his career as he would join forces with Tagsby Racing to race in the EnjoyIllinois.com 225 at Chicagoland Speedway. This would be the first race in his career that he would race in a Chevrolet truck. Crawford would earn his 3rd top ten finish in 6 races with an 8th-place finish in the race.

40|$|This Article offers both {{a way to}} {{understand}} emerging developments in the regulation of the legal profession in the United States and internationally, and an explanation for why these developments grounded in a relational perspective on lawyers and their work {{are likely to be}} more effective in encouraging lawyers to follow the legal ethics rules and to fulfill professional aspirations. The dominant United States approach to lawyer regulation is the command and control model that penalizes lawyers for failing to follow a lengthy set of prescribed rules. As the article explains, this approach assumes – and reinforces the idea – that lawyers are Holmesian bad men who approach rules with the goal of figuring out what they can get away with within the bounds of the law. Such an approach will inevitably lead many lawyers to think of legal ethics rules as both the floor and ceiling of their aspirations, and will encourage lawyers to treat the rules instrumentally. In contrast, a principles-based approach similar to those in Australia and the United Kingdom, creates a system where regulators initially articulate a set of goals, and lawyers then work with the regulators to develop a plan for complying with those goals, including proactive programs to audit compliance. This approach acknowledges the reality that lawyers and regulators both function through a web of relationships and seeks to create incentives within those relationships for lawyers to comply with both the letter and the spirit of professional regulations. Lawyers who help develop their own plans would have an incentive to follow them, and they could create plans through law firms or, if they are in small or solo practices, through plans they develop in groups <b>sponsored</b> by <b>bar</b> associations. As a historical note, we also offer an explanation for the much-noted evolution of legal ethics rules from aspirations to black letter law during the course of the Twentieth Century. A relational understanding of lawyers supported the aspirational approach, while an atomistic view led to formal rules. Today, in order to restore professional respirations, the community of lawyers needs to achieve a balance between rules and aspirations that can only occur within a relational framework that acknowledges that lawyers are both individuals and members of communities...|$|R
50|$|The Gold Coast Blue Tongues license has expired {{two years}} after they were {{suspended}} from the AIHL due to their inability to organise a new ice rink. In response the league has started making enquiries in Brisbane to gauge interest in placing a team back in the city. The Central Coast Rhinos who played in the AIHL between 2005 and 2008 applied to re-enter the league at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. Their application however was rejected for undisclosed reasons. The Sydney Bears announced that they were moving from the Sydney Ice Arena to the Penrith Ice Palace. The Bears previously played at the Ice Palace from 2007 to 2011 before relocating to the Ice Arena. The teams move comes after the Ice Arena's land was approved for redevelopment. In January 2015 the Sydney Ice Dogs announced a deal with DGB Media Group to produce a highlights program for their home games which will be aired on the Television Sydney station. On 4 February the Canberra Institute of Technology announced that they had signed on with the CBR Brave as a major sponsor with a deal that would include the Institutes logo on the team jerseys and their students working with the players {{as part of their}} training. The Brave also signed Anytime Fitness as a sleeve sponsor, Benchmarc Financial Group as a pants sponsor and Smoque restaurant as the club's official post match partner. In April 2015 the Sydney Ice Dogs signed Southern Cross Group Services as a new sponsor for the club. In March the league revealed new branding which included a new logo and slogan “Fast, Fierce, Full-on”. The new logo which is designed to represent the Australian Commonwealth star and a blade of an ice hockey stick was developed by Coordinate. The CBR Brave announced that they had established a junior affiliate club, known as the Junior Brave, in conjunction with Ice Hockey ACT to compete in the NSW Midget Ice Hockey League. On 17 March Hards Transport signed a deal with the Adelaide Adrenaline to become the clubs naming rights sponsor.

25|$|Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, {{coinciding with}} the change to the Generation 6 model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the {{windshield}} prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial {{in the case of}} siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Martin Truex, Jr.) placed {{in the center of the}} windshield header. Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and <b>sponsor</b> logos were <b>barred</b> from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added to the rear of the roof adjacent to the number. In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the NASCAR Chase for the Championship, requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background of the windshield header would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season. For 2015, the liveries of the Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window.

5000|$|In 1997, CBR focused its {{operations}} towards NASCAR, specifically its all-new Craftsman Truck Series. Continuing his partnership with Crawford and Ford, Mitchell debuted the No. 14 Ford at the Chevy Trucks Challenge in 1997 with Circle <b>Bar</b> <b>sponsoring.</b> Crawford made every race and finished 12th in points, runner up to Kenny Irwin Jr. for Rookie of the Year. 1998 brought the team's first win at Homestead Miami Speedway, but inconsistency {{put them at}} 18th in points. Crawford would not win {{for the next four}} years, but had two top ten points finishes in between, including a runner-up points finish to Mike Bliss in 2002. Crawford would take his second, and arguably biggest win at the season opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250, with a last lap pass on Travis Kvapil. The win propelled him to a seventh-place points finish. Rick would win again in 2004 at Martinsville, but dropped to twelfth in points. The 2005 season was a mixed bag, as the team won again at Loudon, but Crawford was forced to miss the first race of his career due to a crash during qualifying at Kentucky Speedway. Road racer Boris Said took his place, but was taken out in an early wreck. Rick won again at ORP in 2006 and finished ninth in points. Although the 2007 season was a winless one for the No. 14 team, they added on a second truck with David Starr who brought along sponsorship from Navistar International for both trucks. The added equipment resulted in a near win at Mansfield Motorsports Park and a fifth-place points finish for Crawford. Crawford slipped to seventh in points in 2008, and tenth in 2009 with twenty top-tens in between both seasons. Longtime crew chief Kevin [...] "Cowboy" [...] Starland left Circle Bar after 2009 for Panhandle Motorsports and International departed both the No. 10 and the No. 14 for Randy Moss Motorsports. Despite the lack of sponsorship, Circle Bar gained a new crew chief in Blake Bainbridge and ran the first four races of the season before having to release Crawford before Kansas and having to wait on additional sponsorship to continue running the season. The team has not been heard from since. Team owner Tom Mitchell died in 2014 at age 83.|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to the subject of 2 ̆ 2 professionalism, 2 ̆ 2 there is a gap between the leaders of the {{organized}} bar and its members. Bar leaders are eager to discuss the subject. For example, this year 2 ̆ 7 s annual meeting of the American Bar Association (2 ̆ 2 ABA 2 ̆ 2) afforded bar leaders, as well as legal academics, a host of opportunities to share strategies to promote 2 ̆ 2 professionalism 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 professional values. 2 ̆ 2 The Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the <b>Bar</b> <b>sponsored</b> a program on 2 ̆ 2 Professionalism in Law Schools and the Profession. 2 ̆ 2 Organizations representing bar executives, bar presidents, and bar foundations jointly presented a program called 2 ̆ 2 Tough Talk, Tough Solutions-Re-establishing Lawyers 2 ̆ 7 Values. 2 ̆ 2 The Texas Center for Legal Ethics and Professionalism convened a meeting of the National Consortium of Professionalism Initiatives, comprised of representatives of bar associations and ethics and professionalism centers, whose mission includes encouraging lawyer professionalism. In contrast, most practicing lawyers at the annual meeting did not come to discuss professionalism. They came to learn something that they considered useful to their practice, to network with other lawyers, or to enjoy a tax- deductible vacation. In the many programs designed for practitioners, professionalism {{does not appear to have}} received much play even when there were opportunities to discuss it. It is hard enough to get practitioners to talk about legal ethics. Although the subject is largely about the law of lawyer regulation, lawyers are uncomfortable with the subject 2 ̆ 7 s moral overtones. Moreover, lawyers may be concerned that the 2 ̆ 2 dirty little secrets 2 ̆ 2 of their area of practice-the ways in which their real- world practices appear to depart from the disciplinary rules as written and interpreted by ethics committees-will be revealed and criticized. It is infinitely harder to get practitioners to talk about professionalism. Here, the touchy concept of morality is front and center. Lawyers 2 ̆ 7 practices are even more vulnerable to criticism since lawyers are more likely to disregard 2 ̆ 2 professional values 2 ̆ 2 than disciplinary rules. Further, unlike the question of how to avoid sanctionable conduct, the question of how to act professionally has no direct relevance to lawyers 2 ̆ 7 livelihood since lawyers are not at risk of losing their licenses for conduct that is merely 2 ̆ 2 unprofessional. 2 ̆ 2 At best, practitioners may perceive that a discussion of professionalism is of no value; at worst, they might resent paying good money to be preached to or to have their moral judgment impugned. It is much easier to talk to law students about professionalism since they are a captive audience. Practitioners do not have to show up. One can therefore understand why there has been little effort to infuse 2 ̆ 2 professionalism 2 ̆ 2 into bar programs generally, why programs specifically dealing with 2 ̆ 2 professionalism 2 ̆ 2 are clearly labeled, and why participants in those programs perceive that they are preaching to the choir...|$|R
