5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone {{is ready}} to hand over his title {{as the leader of}} Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A {{competition}} is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While trying to take down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall head back to New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes the car into the church and shoots her. It is then revealed that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins to repress his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream.|$|E
25|$|Keeping Miley's secret {{involves}} a two sided effort. As Hannah, she must keep her fans unaware that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a normal kid, and as Miley, she must keep her friends unaware that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Hannah Montana. In interviews, Miley Cyrus {{spoke of the}} implausibility {{of being able to}} keep a secret such as Miley and her family do in the show in a world of intense media scrutiny. The show however, remains workable primarily based on suspension of disbelief.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> crucial. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a <b>really</b> great {{sounding}} board for me. She's {{a really good}} producer {{in the sense that}} she's very musical and has a great sense of song structure and so forth. So <b>she</b> <b>was</b> great to bounce ideas off. And she sang on nearly all the songs. So <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a great part of this record.|$|R

Edna arrives one day {{at the door of}} Agnes and Tobias’s home. She takes it for granted that they will let her and Harry stay there for however long it takes them to get over their unnamed fear.|$|E
25|$|Hannah Montana is Miley Stewart's alter ego. The {{character}} was originally {{going to be}} named Alexis Texas, but the name was changed to Hannah Montana. Hannah exists as a secret identity, an extremely popular and influential worldwide popstar. Hannah's many fans are not aware that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> just a normal teenage girl, and Miley tries to keep her two lives separate from each other.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E

25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> in love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E
500|$|... subtitled a {{continental}} chronicle {{in the original}} version, is a Japanese manga series written by Jun Maeda and illustrated by Rei Izumi. The story centers on a young girl named Hibiki who is the apprentice to a very skilled wizard named Shirotsuki. Hibiki does not have much skill with magic, {{and the only thing}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> good at is making tea. After an accident where her teacher nearly dies, Hibiki comes to stay at a famous magic academy and works as a teacher herself.|$|E

[...] "You have so often been dead in love," [...] his mother counseled Booth in a letter, [...] "be well assured <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> and truly devoted to you."

500|$|Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki {{joined her}} court. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living {{arrangements}} were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed {{it does not seem to}} me that in herself <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a poet at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivia is {{captured}} by Walternate's forces, imprisoned {{in the government}} facility on Liberty Island and put through both physical and psychological treatments by Walternate to make her believe that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the Fauxlivia of the parallel universe. Olivia manages to escape the facility and make it to [...] "Manhatan" [...] (in the Other Side parallel universe, the island is spelled with only one [...] "T"). She coerces a taxi driver named Henry (Andre Royo) to drive her to the Opera House where she believes she can return home, by threatening to harm his family, {{but by the time}} she arrives, an [...] "Amber protocol" [...] has been issued, sealing the building in [...] "amber", a substance that the Other Side Fringe Division deploys to envelop time fractures. She directs Henry to the address for Massive Dynamic, but finds the facility does not exist in this universe. As Henry goes to a gas station to fill his taxi, Olivia cries to herself in the station's bathroom.|$|E
500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital. She {{said that she}} has found that her [...] "fan base will follow" [...] her whatever she does. She explained that, [...] "My job is not to disappoint , not to cheat them. And I feel like the last little appearance on GH cheated them. I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a brave, courageous actress" [...] and added that [...] "It really has been fantastic to watch, and I think she is terrific." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|Viewers saw {{the slow}} {{build-up}} to Pauline's climactic exit throughout {{the latter part}} of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: [...] "she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia {{is more than just a}} thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Ron and {{the others}} deal with their meetings: April acts as uninterested as possible, Andy makes {{promises}} to people against Ron's wishes, and Ann provides several medical consults after revealing <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a nurse (not a parks and recreation department employee). Although the two had previously been developing a romantic interest, Andy now acts uninterested in April because he feels uncomfortable about the eight-year age difference between them, further upsetting April on a difficult day. Ron, who views the many meetings as an utter nightmare, calls in the others {{during the middle of}} the day for a progress report, and angrily berates April for her mistake. After all the meetings, April arranges her own meeting with Ron, where she announces she is quitting. When Andy learns this, he convinces Ron that April is a great assistant. Ron goes to April's house and convinces her to come back by telling her about Andy's compliments. April then reveals that she knows Ron is Duke Silver, since her mother is a huge fan, and that she recognized him the first time that they met. On her first day back, April successfully scares off someone wanting to meet with Ron by scheduling absurd meeting dates and times such as June 50th, the [...] "one-teenth" [...] of [...] "march-tember" [...] and 2:65 PM. Ron gives her an approving smile and nod while watching from his office.|$|E

500|$|Although both singers {{worked with}} {{producer}} Benny Blanco in studio on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears recorded her vocals {{for the song}} before Sabi, who actually raps on the track. The latter also revealed she felt lucky and honored because Spears does not do features often, while commenting that [...] "it's just pretty crazy, I mean, I grew up watching Britney Spears. All my friends watched Britney Spears and we even had a routine to [...] that we were gonna perform, like, for a middle-school talent show. So it's a dream come true. Never did I ever think that I'd be in the mix with Britney. I'm just lucky." [...] When asked about how she learned about Sabi {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Spears revealed, [...] "friends and people around me are always showing me new artists that they love and that's how I learned about Sabi and ended up working with her on '(Drop Dead) Beautiful'. I have always wanted to feature a new artist on one of my albums and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> cool." [...] A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on March 7, 2011. Four days later, it leaked in full online, along with another Femme Fatale track, [...] "Inside Out". On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be [...] "Criminal", [...] "Inside Out" [...] or [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." [...] After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that [...] "Criminal" [...] was chosen as the fourth single.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Fiennes {{was cast}} as Gareth Mallory, a former {{lieutenant}} {{colonel in the}} British Army and now {{the chairman of the}} Intelligence and Security Committee, which gives him the authority to regulate MI6. At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of M. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a [...] "really interesting part which is really quite fun". To play the returning character of Miss Moneypenny, Naomie Harris was cast. Harris' role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. Despite ongoing speculation in the media that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny, this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production of the film, with Harris herself even {{going so far as to}} dismiss claims that Eve was in fact Moneypenny, stating that [...] "Eve is not remotely office-bound". According to Harris, Eve [...] " [...] she is Bond's equal, but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> his junior". Another character returning to the series was Q, played by Ben Whishaw. Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play, and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying [...] "I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney. The producers briefly considered approaching Sean Connery to play the role in a nod to the 50th anniversary of the film series, but elected not to as they felt Connery's presence would be seen as stunt casting and disengage audiences from the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
