5000|$|Stitch-Bonding is {{a special}} form of warp {{knitting}} [...] and is commonly used {{for the production of}} composite materials and technical textiles. As a method of production, stitch-bonding is efficient, {{and is one of the}} most modern ways to create reinforced textiles and composite materials [...] for industrial use. The advantages of the stitch-bonding process includes its high productivity rate and the scope it offers for functional design of textiles, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. [...] Stitch-bonding involves layers of threads and fabric being joined together with a knitting thread, which creates a layered structure called a multi-ply. [...] This is created through a warp-knitting thread system, which is fixed on the reverse side of the fabric with a <b>sinker</b> <b>loop,</b> and a weft thread layer. [...] A needle with the warp thread passes through the material, which requires the warp and knitting threads to be moving both parallel and perpendicular to the vertical/warp direction of the stitch-bonding machine. [...] Stitch-bonded fabrics are currently being used in such fields as wind energy generation and aviation. [...] Research is currently being conducted into the usage and benefits of stitch-bonded fabrics as a way to reinforce concrete. Fabrics produced with this process offer the potential of using “sensitive fiber materials such as glass and carbon with only little damage, non-crimp fiber orientation and variable distance between threads”.|$|E
