5|$|As of the 2010 Census, the {{population}} consisted mostly of Russians (89.0%), Ukrainians (4.8%), and Belarusians (1.7%). Other groups of note include Komi (~1,600inhabitants), Sami (~1,600), and Karelians (~1,400). The indigenous <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> are mostly concentrated in Lovozersky District.|$|E
5|$|The Sami peoples {{were subject}} to forced collectivization, {{with more than half}} of their {{reindeer}} herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization {{were subject to}} forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{migration}} to the peninsula continued into the 16th century, when new settlements such as Kandalaksha and Porya-Guba were established. Kola was first mentioned in 1565. In {{the end of the}} 15th century, the Pomors and the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> were forced into serfdom, mostly by the monasteries. Monastery votchinas greatly expanded during the 17th century, but were abolished in 1764, when all of the Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants.|$|E

5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit with}} his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the {{detailed}} results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native <b>Sami</b> <b>people,</b> reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded {{a grant from the}} Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of iron ore deposits {{in the north of}} Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> at Skansen.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} of the {{peninsula}} was already settled in the 7th–5th millennium BCE, the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE, when various peoples started to arrive from the south. However, by the 1st millennium CE only the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> remained. This changed in the 12th century, when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula's game and fish riches. Soon after, the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. No permanent settlements, however, were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Smeerenburg {{was one of}} {{the first}} settlements, {{established}} by the Dutch in 1619. Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, a few individuals started to overwinter. Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic. By the late 17th century, Russian hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as the polar bear and fox. After British raids into the Barents Sea in 1809, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and ceased by the 1820s. Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast <b>Sámi</b> <b>people</b> from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left, but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s.|$|E

5|$|By the 13th century, {{a need to}} formalize {{the border}} between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian {{countries}} became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Voryema River, which now is a part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to pay tribute. The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> pay tribute to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except {{in the eastern part of}} Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{pursued a}} foreign policy that was active in all {{directions}} (although foremost {{to the west and}} south-east). In the north-east, the relationship with Novgorod had been tense due to a dispute over the right to tax the <b>Sami</b> <b>people,</b> as well as raiding from both Norwegian and Karelian sides. Eventually, the Mongol threat drove Prince Alexander Nevsky to negotiations with Haakon that likely strengthened Norwegian control of Troms and Finnmark. An embassy from Novgorod one time asked for Haakon's daughter Christina for a marriage, but Haakon refused due to the Mongol threat. Due to the Elven-based Norwegian presence in the seas around the south of Sweden and into the Baltic Sea, Norway increasingly relied on Baltic grain from Lübeck. The import was however halted in the late 1240s due to the plundering of Norwegian ships in Danish seas by ships from Lübeck. In 1250, Haakon made a peace and trade agreement with Lübeck, which eventually also opened the city of Bergen to the Hanseatic League. During the conflict, Haakon had reportedly been offered control over the city by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In any case, Haakon's policy regarding Northern German ports largely derived from his strategy of attempting to exploit the internal turmoil that had erupted in Denmark following the death of King Valdemar II in 1241.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by reindeer husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with reindeer husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E

50|$|Since {{no party}} had a {{majority}} of the mandates a coalition was formed for the executive council consisting of: Norwegian Sami Association, Sami resident in Southern-Norway, Johttisápmelaččaid Listu, Centre Party, and <b>Sami</b> <b>People's</b> Party. Aili Keskitalo from the Norwegian Sami Association was elected as the president. Johan Mikkel Sara from Sami resident in Southern-Norway got the vice president position, while Per A. Bær got a seat in the board of the Finnmark Estate. The six members in the executive council consisted in addition to the president and vice-president of: Terje Tretnes (<b>Sami</b> <b>People's</b> Party), Randi A. Skum, and Jarle Jonassen (the later both from Norwegian Sami Association).|$|R
5000|$|The book uses [...] "Lap" [...] {{mainly to}} notice that Samis are still pagan and it is {{concluded}} that Lap is a word introduced by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1150 - 1220) to distinguish <b>Sami</b> <b>peoples</b> living near the ocean (coast-fenni) and in the woodland (lapp-fenni).|$|R
25|$|Kven and <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> share {{a common}} history of Norwegianization. However, post-Norwegianization {{policies}} have treated them differently. <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> have been recognized as the indigenous people in Northern Norway. They have their own schools and parliament, and they elect three of the six members for the board of Finnmark Estate (the organization owning about 95% {{of the land in}} the county of Finnmark). Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> too much, whereas on the Sami side there are people who think the Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the <b>Sami</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{must also}} be noted that Woman Land and <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> are {{discussed}} altogether separately in Gesta.|$|E
25|$|In a Norwegian text (11-12th century) {{the name}} Kiriali {{referring}} to Karelians, and the term cornuti Finni, interpreted as {{referring to the}} Lapps or <b>Sami</b> <b>people,</b> first appear.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the <b>Sami</b> <b>people's</b> existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian Tacitus. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the Fenni. However, the first Nordic sources date from the introductions of runes and include specifically the Account of the Viking Othere to King Alfred of England.|$|R
50|$|Some of the <b>Sami</b> <b>people's</b> {{traditional}} Noaidi {{beliefs and}} practices shared important features with those of some Siberian cultures. Some of their joiks were sung during shamanistic rites, and this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story). As in various cultures of Northern Asia, mimicking sounds from nature can also be present.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sámi</b> <b>peoples</b> in {{northern}} Scandinavia today belong to Christian churches. During recent years, {{there has been}} a movement in some churches to encourage the use of the Sami languages and culture to express believers' faith. Official Sámi bodies exist today in the Lutheran Church of Sweden and Church of Norway, {{as well as in the}} Mission Covenant Church of Sweden.|$|R
25|$|Waffen-SS (6. SS-Gebirgs-Division Nord) were {{fighting}} in the Lapland War. There were encounters between the <b>Sámi</b> <b>people</b> and the Germans. The assimilated Sámi would have been {{fighting in the}} Finnish army.|$|E
25|$|Again, as with Ohthere, <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> and Kvens are not {{discussed}} at the same time. The saga tells how Norwegians taxed the <b>Sami</b> <b>people,</b> {{but there is no}} indication in the saga that the Kvens would have competed with the Norwegians for control of the Sami or lived near or among them. Much debate has taken place concerning whether the saga provides truthful information of Iron Age Kvenland by mentioning that the Kvens had a real-sounding 'king' and a 'law' to divide the loot. The saga places the confrontation of Norwegians and Karelians in the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|But towards north many pagan tribes—alas!—stretch {{from the}} east behind Norway, namely Karelians (Kiriali) and Kvens (Kwæni), corneous <b>Sami</b> <b>people</b> (cornuti Finni) and both peoples of Bjarmia (utrique Biarmones). But what tribes dwell behind them, have we no certainty.|$|E
