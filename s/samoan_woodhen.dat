50|$|The <b>Samoan</b> <b>woodhen</b> (Gallinula pacifica), {{also known}} as Samoan wood rail, is a nearly flightless rail endemic to the Samoan island of Savai'i, and {{probably}} extinct. As it has evolved adaptations for a more terrestrial lifestyle and at least partly nocturnal habits, it is probably better placed in a distinct genus, Pareudiastes (which sometimes includes the more distinct Makira wood rail too), but this issue {{has not yet been}} thoroughly researched. It was known as puna'e ("one that jumps up") to the native Samoans; this was said to relate to the bird's habit of making a jumping dash into cover when startled from its resting place.|$|E
