5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|E

The analytical models of both tooling configurations are based upon the solution of Maxwell equations in axially symmetrical formulation. For ferromagnetic materials, the attraction effect is based upon magnetic forces prevailing over the Lorentz forces for low frequency discharges. For nonferromagnetic materials, the attraction forces are created by employing the auxiliary screen which attracts the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank.</b> The concept of attraction in this inductor system is based upon inducing currents flowing in the same directions in the screen and in the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank.</b> In addition to the analytical models, the described concepts are illustrated by the experimental results on attraction of sheet metal blanks employing a single turn inductor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Trends in the {{automotive}} industry tend towards safety, fuel saving and reduction of exhaust gas result in an increased application of high strength steels as well as stainless steels in the car body production. Deep drawing is a tension/compression forming process of a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> to a hollow part without a volitional thickness changing. This permanent deformation occurs when the applied stress exceeds the elastic limit of the material. The elastic deformation within the overall amount of deformation is not desired and leads to the so called spring back, which {{is directly related to}} the materials strength, sheet thickness and Young’s modulus. Besides strength and elastic modulus there are more factors affecting the part quality or the spring back behavior of deep drawn components. This paper will cover the effect of relevant forming parameters, as there are the die radius, the height of the beads and the drawing clearance. Furthermore, the residual stresses, which are correlated with spring back, were measured by means of the 3 MA sensor (Micromagnetic Multiparameter Microstructure- and Stress-Analyses) ...|$|E

In the last decades, metal forming gained attention of the researchers and considerable changes has occurred. Because for {{a small number of}} parts, the conventional metal forming processes are expensive and time-consuming in terms of designing and manufacturing preparation, the manufacturers and researchers became interested in flexible processes. One of the most investigated flexible processes in metal forming is incremental sheet forming (ISF). ISF is an advanced flexible manufacturing process which allows to manufacture complex 3 D products without expensive dedicated tools.

However, the tool and the experimental set up dynamic effects that could influence the single point incremental forming process have not been addressed. Therefore, the aim of this research focuses on studying the dynamics interaction among the tool, the experimental set up and the sheet blank during the forming process. To quantify these effects, we have dynamically characterized the process response behavior and used finite element simulations to identify the resonance vibrational frequencies as well as the magnitude of the maximum von Mises stresses and found that if we want to avoid undesirable vibrational effects that could affect the final formed part, {{we need to have a}} robust experimental set up...|$|R

The ultrasonic excitation of the forming tool reduces the vertical component of the forming force. In addition, application of ultrasonic vibration reduces the surface roughness of the specimen.

In the present paper, a statistical analysis and optimization of the effective factors on this parameter are performed in the UVaSPIF process. For this purpose, response surface methodology (RSM) is selected as the experiment design technique. The controllable factors such as vertical step size, sheet thickness, tool diameter, wall inclination angle, and feed rate are specified as input variables of the process. The obtained results from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis of the experimental data confirm the accuracy of the mathematical model. Furthermore, it is shown that the linear, quadratic, and interactional terms of the variables are effective on the surface roughness parameter. To optimize the surface roughness parameter, the most appropriate conditions of the experiment are determined using desirability method, and statistical optimization is subsequently verified by conducting the confirmation test. 1...|$|E
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of sheet metal are consumed every month in various sectors of industry, the automotive, furniture, white and brown goods, electrical and body building (including coaches and containers) being the chief consumers. A {{large number of}} "critical" automotive sheet metal parts lead to rejections leading to wastage of sheet metal during manufacturing. Here, a product that permits a smaller window of variation in material properties compared to that permitted by the standards {{is said to be}} "critical". The wastage due to layout (utilization) of blanks on the sheet and that on account of rejections constitutes total wastage. While a number of algorithms are available to maximize sheet utilization and curtail the wastage, there appears to be none to minimize rejections. Thus, it will always be helpful to an industry to use a system capable of predicting and minimizing these rejections at the sheet layout stage. This paper views wastage in totality and attempts to minimize the total wastage arising from layout as well as rejections. Highly strained regions in a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> are identified. Based on the permissible window of variation in the material properties, a 'defect map' is generated on the sheet. The blanks are laid out and the possible number of rejections is predicted probabilistically, leading to the prediction of the actual utilization of the material. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

In the present work, a general framework based on the finite element method for the simulation of the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blanking</b> process is presented. The proposed approach properly addresses all the numerical challenges related to blanking.

Moreover, the frictional contact interactions are simulated with the classical Coulomb law and an energetically consistent formulation of area regularization. Finally, ductile fracture is modeled thanks to the element deletion method coupled with a fracture criterion. The blanking process is then simulated for different setting parameters.

40|$|The forming limit diagram (FLD) is {{probably}} the most common representation of sheet metal formability and can be defined as the locus of the principal planar strains where failure is most likely to occur. Experimental determination of the FLD consists in performing a set of formability tests on a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank,</b> where a regular grid has been previously etched. After each test, the deformation of the grid is measured and the relative strains computed. Strains observed closely at the fracture location are related to as ‘failed’ points, while strains observed on the sound areas of the specimens are labelled as ‘safe’ points. Starting from a set of experimental tests, the FLD should be empirically determined through a statistical analysis of collected data. In fact, statistical approaches (such as linear regression) are required to properly account for the internal randomness of failure occurrence. Linear regression, as well as most of the other empirical approaches in the scientific literature, takes into account only information related to the safe points. This paper proposes a different approach, the logistic regression, for the empirical determination of FLDs. Logistic regression allows to directly derive the probability of an event (e. g. the failure) as a function of different predictor variables (both the principal planar strains). Therefore, by using logistic regression, the process designer can directly associate the failure probability to the scrapping costs, in order to economically evaluate a new sheet metal forming operation. Logistic regression allows the determination of the FLD by including information concerning both safe and failed points...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{consider}} the effect of different parameters on the wrinkling phenomenon of square cups during the deep drawing process. An experimental system was prepared which consisted of a hydraulic press capable of applying different loads on the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> and a blank holder and the process was controlled by a computer. All simulations were performed by using the ABAQUS/EXPLICIT V 6. 9 software, and the effect of different aluminium alloys, punch and die radius, blank holder force, blank holder gap, and friction coefficient on the wrinkling phenomenon has been investigated. Moreover, the minimal blank holder force was obtained by plotting minor strain with respect to the major strain of produced cups, and obtaining the maximum height of wrinkle in a cup. The wrinkling phenomenon was further investigated on different alloys such as A 6111 -T 4, AA 5754 -O and Al- 1050. The results imply that increasing the blank holder force and friction coefficient on the one hand and reducing the blank holder gap, punch radius, and die radius on the other hand, may lead to a reduction in wrinkling during the deep drawing process. Nevertheless, under the same circumstances of the deep drawing process, the wrinkling of the A 6111 -T 4 alloy is more significant compared to the Al- 1050 and AA 5754 -O alloys, while the Al- 1050 alloy needs less blank holder force to avoid wrinkling. Using this simulation program it is possible to easily simulate the wrinkling of sheet metal blanks with the least number of trial and error...|$|E

In deep drawing process, a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> form cylindrical components by process in which central portion of sheet is pressed into die opening to draw the metal into desired shape without folding the corners. Earing {{is one of}} the major defects observed during deep drawing process due to anisotropic nature of sheet metal. Earing is defined as formation of waviness on uppermost portion of deep drawn cup. Knowledge about ear formation in deep drawing process allows a prior modification of process which can result in defect free final product with financial saving and time. The initial blank shape used in present study is circular in nature. The objective of present study aims to produce parts which are earing defect free. Earing can be reduced by modifying the initial blank shape such as use of non circular blank as in present study. Efforts have been made to study the earing problem in deep drawing of cylindrical cups by finite element modeling software HYPERWORK- 12 and Incremental RADIOSS as solver.

The polyurethane pad is adopted as the die instead of rigid mold because it has the advantages of wide hardness range and high load-bear capacity. Due to the application of polyurethane pad, the surrounding region adjacent to the pierced hole will occur to plastically deform and deflect, which greatly differs from that in the conventional blanking. In this paper, the effects of blank material and thickness, polyurethane hardness, punch penetration depth on deformation behavior were mathematically analyzed and modeled, and then a series of experiments through varying process parameters were conducted to validate the relationship between process parameters and product quality. The degree of sample deflection was exactly measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the deformed area varies with different blank elongations and increases with increasing blank thickness for a given material. When polyurethane pad with low hardness level is employed, it results in large area deformation and quality degradation. Moreover, the deflection degreearound the hole edge becomes more severe along with punch penetration, but the penetration depth along blank thickness is not in proportion to the amount of punch advancement...|$|R

The proposed process combined hydroforming of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> to create micro-channel arrays with in-die mechanical bonding to create double bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation to result in thin, lightweight, and flexible bipolar plates where flow fields are formed {{on both sides and}} internal cooling channels are formed in the middle, eliminating further welding, assembly and sealing operations otherwise required with the existing methods. For a successful development of the proposed process, different scientific and research issues are investigated and discussed in this study. First, to characterize the material behavior of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> at micro-scale, hydraulic bulge tests are performed to investigate the so-called “size effects” (i. e., grain, specimen, and feature size) on the material behavior. Based on the bulge test results, new material models are developed to include the size effect parameters. Second, to understand the deformation mechanics of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> in micro-feature fabrication under complex loading conditions, hydroforming of different micro-channel sizes using thin sheets is performed. Effects of channel design and process condition on the overall channel formability are discussed. With the use of FEA and appropriate material models, a parametric study is conducted to establish design guidelines for process and tooling design. Third, a mechanical bonding process, specifically, pressure welding of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>metals,</b> is investigated to gain a full understanding of the process limitation and characterization. The understanding from the welding tests suggests different process windows for successful bonding of thin sheets. Finally, predictive process models of the hybrid process are developed using a finite element (FE) tool for rapid evaluation the process producibility. Based on the simulation results, a set of experimental tooling is developed and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid process for fabrication of fuel cell bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation...|$|R
