5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{concluded}} that HIV/AIDS is spreading {{at different rates}} in the five countries, with the epidemic the most advanced in Nigeria and Ethiopia. In all countries, however, risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> are driving infection rates upward at a precipitous rate.|$|E
40|$|Study Objectives: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the prevalence, changes, and demographic as well as psychosocial correlates of <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and intention to engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in early adolescents in Hong Kong, with <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> indexed by <b>sexual</b> intercourse. Design: Three waves of longitudinal data on sexual intercourse, intention to engage in sexual intercourse, family functioning, and positive youth development were collected from 28 secondary schools in Hong Kong. Results: There were significant influences of grade and gender on adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> or intention to engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Significant main effects of immigration status on <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were also found. While no effect of family economic background was found, effect of family intactness existed for <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Family functioning and positive youth development at Grade 7 were negatively associated with students' <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and intention to engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> at Grade 9. Conclusion: Grade, gender, immigration status, and family intactness were related to <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and/or intention to engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in junior secondary school students. Promoting positive youth development and family functioning could serve as protective factors to reduce <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and intention to engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in Chinese early adolescents in Hong Kong.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{olfaction}} {{is essential for the}} occurrence of <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in male goldfish. Sex pheromones from ovulatory females elicit male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> chasing and sperm releasing act. In female goldfish, ovarian prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) elicits female <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> egg releasing act. It has been considered that olfaction does not affect <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in female goldfish. In the present study, we reexamined the involvement of olfaction in <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> of female goldfish. Olfaction was blocked in male and female goldfish by two methods: nasal occlusion (NO) which blocks the reception of olfactants, and olfactory tract section (OTX) which blocks transmission of olfactory information from the olfactory bulb to the telencephalon. <b>Sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> of goldfish was induced by administration of PGF to females, an established method for inducing goldfish <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in both sexes. <b>Sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in males was suppressed by NO and OTX as previously reported because of lack of pheromone stimulation. In females, NO suppressed <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> but OTX did not affect the occurrence of <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Females treated with both NO and OTX performed <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> normally. These results indicate that olfaction is essential in female goldfish to perform <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> as in males but in a different manner. The lack of olfaction in males causes lack of pheromonal stimulation, resulting in no behavior elicited. Whereas the results of female experiments suggest that lack of olfaction in females causes strong inhibition of <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> mediated by the olfactory pathway. Olfactory tract section is considered to block the pathway and remove this inhibition, resulting in the resumption of the behavior. By subtract sectioning of the olfactory tract, it was found that this inhibition was mediated by the medial olfactory tracts, not the lateral olfactory tracts. Thus, it is concluded that goldfish has gender-typical olfactory regulation for <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior...</b>|$|R

25|$|Sexually dimorphic {{behaviors}} such as mounting, urine spraying and some forms of male aggression are reduced due to the decrease in hormone levels brought about by neutering.

Four databases were searched for studies (published between 1980 and 2012) on the relation between pubertal timing or status and <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> The outcomes were (1) sexual intercourse; (2) combined sexual behavior; and (3) risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Earlier pubertal timing or more advanced pubertal status was related to earlier and more <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> and earlier pubertal timing was related to more risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Further, the links between (1) pubertal status and combined <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and (2) pubertal timing and sexual intercourse status, combined <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> and risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were stronger for girls than boys. Most links between pubertal status, timing, and <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and <b>sexual</b> risk <b>behavior</b> were stronger for younger adolescents.

25|$|Research {{indicates}} that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> but {{its association with}} dominance and submission, as well as taboo, makes it an appealing stimulus to people of all sexual orientations.

Fisting is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon that people can relax enough to accommodate an object {{as big as a}} fist being inserted into the anus.|$|E
25|$|When V. crabro <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{were first}} studied, the colony {{seemed to be}} under {{pheromone}} control by the queen because none of the workers reproduced.

In a colony with a queen, the workers are more related to the queen’s larvae than their own. Contrary to previous assumptions, the workers were actually enforcing sterility in one another. Worker policing is the behavior exhibited to prevent other workers within the colony from producing males. This can be completed by either physically destroying worker-laid eggs or by discriminating against those workers that wish to reproduce.|$|E

25|$|Appetitive {{behaviors}} are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. However, appetitive {{behaviors are}} disrupted by the lesions in rostral part rather than caudal part of medial preoptic area. Lesions of the rostral part of medial preoptic area also diminish preference for female by male rats. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments {{showed that the}} level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. mPOA’s involvement in the control of appetitive <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> is also confirmed by pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic system in it. In rats, lesions to mPOA can eliminate the male copulatory behavior but can only diminish appetitive behavior, which suggests that some other parts of the brain, except for mPOA, are also responsible for sexually appetitive behavior.|$|E
25|$|From feminists' perspectives, sexology, {{which is}} the study of human {{sexuality}} and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.|$|E
25|$|Anal sex can {{exacerbate}} hemorrhoids {{and therefore}} result in bleeding; in other cases, {{the formation of}} a hemorrhoid is attributed to anal sex. If bleeding occurs as a result of anal sex, it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an anal fissure) or perforation (a hole) in the colon, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal mucous membrane being thin, and small blood vessels being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and sigmoid colon (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests {{that a majority of}} college students report having sex with multiple partners while practicing inconsistent condom use.

The present study recruited 50 students from the University of Arkansas to participate in an anonymous survey on their drinking habits, risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> and their perception of normative risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Correlational analyses revealed a positive relationship between risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and alcohol consumption.

The hypothesis that paternal avoidant attachment would predict coercive <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> independently of its relationship with aggression and antisociality was also supported. Posthoc analysis indicated that maternal anxious attachment was associated with antisociality and that paternal avoidant attachment was associated with both antisociality and coercive <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> These {{results are consistent with}} criminological and psychological research linking adverse early family experiences with offending and lend support to an attachment-theoretical framework for understanding offending behavior in general and <b>sexual</b> offending <b>behavior</b> in particular.

40|$|HIV {{continues}} to disproportionately plague select {{communities across the}} United States. Individual <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> serves as a dominant explanation for differences in HIV infection. In public health, {{little attention has been}} placed on community context and features of the community environment as important predictors of sexual health. The community environment and resources or lack of resources may influence <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> This may contribute to disparate rates of HIV transmission. I examine how socioenvironmental factors and sex ratios influence <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and HIV rates, and contribute to race/ethnic differences in risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> I used multilevel models and data from the Behavioral Risks Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to determine the cross-sectional association across 15 states between county-level factors and risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> for different racial/ethnic groups. The measure of <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> examined was the number of sexual partners. The county level factors examined included imbalanced sex ratio, residential segregation, and the percent of residents below poverty. Results: Increased residential segregation was associated with higher odds of risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in all groups although a clear dose response trend was only observed in Whites. The association between <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and county sex ratios partly followed the pattern predicted by the Alternative Sex Ratio Mate Preference Shifts Hypothesis. Racial/ethnic differences in risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were reduced after adjustment for marital status and age. I did not find a substantial effect of adjustment for racial residential segregation, percent below poverty, or the sex ratio at the county level. Conclusion This {{is one of the first}} studies to examine the hierarchical association of county-level variables with risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Future multilevel work with different measures of <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and alternative contextual measures is needed to better understand the social processes affecting HIV risk and the factors contributing to persistent race/ethnic differences...|$|R
25|$|Male <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> can {{be divided}} into two phases: the appetitive phase, which {{contains}} highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. The medial preoptic area of the brain is considered to control the expression of both male copulation and male appetitive sexual behavior. It is found that large lesions of SDN-POA severely disrupt copulatory behavior in rats. Also, cell-body lesions of SDA pars compacta (a homologue of SDN-POA) in gerbils produce severe disruptions of male copulatory behavior. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromaticity of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17β-estradiol). Like in SDN-POA, aromatase-expression neurons are a specific marker of the nuclear boundary of POM in quails. The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} a study by Deborah Tolman and her colleagues {{indicated}} that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television in general does not directly affect their <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> rather it {{is the type of}} message they view that has the most impact. Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men objectifying women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more comfortable talking about their own sexual needs in their sexual experiences as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held more control over their sexuality. Findings for boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less sexual experiences.|$|E
25|$|Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams.|$|E
