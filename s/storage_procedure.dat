40|$|Background: Magnetic bead {{purification}} for {{the analysis}} of low-abundance proteins in body fluids facilitates the identification of potential new biomarkers by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The aims of our study were to establish a proteome fractionation technique and to validate a standardized blood sampling, processing, and <b>storage</b> <b>procedure</b> for proteomic pattern analysis. Methods: We used magnetic bead separation for proteome profiling of human blood by MALDI-TOF MS (mass range, 1000 – 10 000 Da) and studied the effects on the quality and reproducibility of the proteome analysis of anticoagulants, blood clotting, time and temperature of sample storage, and the number of freeze–thaw cycles of samples. Results: The proteome pattern of human serum was characterized by � 350 signals in the mass range of 1000 – 10 000 Da. The proteome profile showed timedependent dynamic changes before and after centrifugation of the blood samples. Serum mass patterns differed between native samples and samples frozen once. The best reproducibility of proteomic patterns was with a single thawing of frozen serum samples.

The specimens of D. menstrualis were submitted to three types of <b>storage</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as wet, dry, and frozen and were extracted {{with a mixture of}} dichloromethane:methanol (2 : 1) and acetone. Qualitative differences were not observed by GC/MS analyses of all crude extracts containing mainly the diterpenes pachydictyol A (I), 6 -hydroxy-dichotoma- 3, 14 -diene- 1, 17 -dial (II), 6 -hydroxy- 2, 7 -cycloxenia- 3, 14 -diene- 1, 17 -dial (III), and 6 -acetoxy-dichotoma- 3, 14 -diene- 1, 17 -dial (IV). The most efficient and selective extraction of the compounds with intermediate polarity produced by D. menstrualis was obtained using acetone, but with less mass production.

The cold <b>storage</b> <b>procedure</b> (2 - 4 ºC) recommended for extending seed longevity of Quercus genus proved ineffective: the harvest is totally lost within 3 months of storage and the processing costs are very high. The main objective of this study was the optimization of acorns storage for a minimum period of 6 months in order to permanent availability of high quality reproductive materiel and, consequently, to enhance the reforestation success. We performed the acorns storage taking in account the mother-tree and bag type, and assessed their physiological behavior, before and at different times of storage, to understand the biology process and the impact of tree-mother in storing success. In parallel, we assessed the effect of storing on the seedling quality. Then we monitored the acorn maturation to set the right time for harvesting and assessed its initial sanitary quality as well as its effect on the seedling vigor. In order to demonstrate the storage technique and inform against its limitations, we analyzed the acorn quality at two storage levels (5 and 17 months). In the context of implementation of the technique, we assessed the effect of nursery time production (NTP) and fertilization on the seedling growth potential. A new procedure of cork oak acorn wet-cold storage was developed for a period of 12 - 15 months (12 - 15 MC) and implemented at real scale with developing an efficient prototype of acorn processing.
