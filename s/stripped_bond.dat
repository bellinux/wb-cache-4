40|$|A {{conventional}} bond is a {{debt instrument}} {{consisting of a}} series of periodic coupon payments plus the repayment of the principal at maturity. As the name suggests, a zero-coupon bond has no coupon payments. It has only a single payment consisting of the repayment of the principal at maturity. The zero-coupon bond is sold at a discount and then redeemed for its face value at maturity. The return to the investor is the difference between the face value of the bond and its discounted purchase price. In this article, the author examines the investment characteristics of zero-coupon bonds. In particular, a type of zero-coupon bond known as a <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> is discussed. A <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> is created by stripping coupon payments from conventional <b>bonds.</b> The <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> market in Canada has grown substantially since the late 1980 s and is now an integral part of Canadian fixed-income markets. As well, the opportunity to trade in the <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> market improves the liquidity and efficiency of Canadian fixed-income markets, thus helping to reduce the overall cost of borrowing to the government. ...|$|R
40|$|Structural damage {{detection}} {{at the earliest}} possible stage {{is very important in}} the aerospace industry to prevent major failures. In this work, a potential cost-effective crack detection method using piezoelectric <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> on the structure was studied. A crack model was developed and validated. Static, modal and transient dynamic analysises are performed for the case of piezoelectric <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> to the structure by using a finite element method to explore the effectiveness of the crack detection method. Panel methods are used for steady flow problems of fixed wings in order to calculate the pressure distributions on the wing surface. A flat wing with a crack subjected to aerodynamic load was simulated to predict the presence of the crack. It is found that the voltage difference between the piezoelectric <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> at the same location (one on the upper side and the other on the lower side) can be used to predict the presence of the crack. For wing structure crack detection, the sensitivity is limited if the steady aerodynamic load is used as an excitation...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: When {{strengthening}} concrete structures using externally bonded {{composite material}} plates, {{the bond between}} the concrete and plate typically fails well before the plate’s tensile capacity is achieved. To enhance the bond performance, using composite fabric between the plate and the concrete was explored. Six tension development specimens were tested to determine the maximum tensile load that {{could be applied to}} a CFRP plate before it debonded. Three specimens had a Sika CarboDur <b>strip</b> <b>bonded</b> directly to the concrete, while three others had the CarboDur <b>strip</b> <b>bonded</b> to two plies of Sikawrap Hex 230 C fabric material. The fabric was used to distribute the load over a larger bond area. The specimens without fabric failed at an average load of 60. 5 kN while the specimens with the CFRP fabric failed at an average load of 92. 6 kN. These failure loads represent 18 % and 27. 5 % of the plate capacity respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} single-lap shear tests, {{conducted}} on specimens with fiber reinforced cemen- titious matrix (FRCM) composite <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> to concrete blocks, {{are presented in}} this paper. The FRCM composite was comprised of polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO) fibers and polymer-modified cement-based mortar. This study indicates that in PBO FRCM–concrete joints debonding mainly occurs at the matrix–fiber interface. Friction between fiber filaments and between fibers and matrix is observed after the debonding process initiates. The experimental data suggest that a width effect does not exist among the fiber bundles, and an effective bond length can be defined and is approximately 260 mm. Axial strain profiles along the bonded length are analyzed to investigate the stress-transfer mechanism at the matrix–fiber interface...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{the effect}} of the number of applied {{anchorage}}s, arrangement, and types of anchorage on stress distribution between the CFRP strip and the concrete surface were studied. Two different anchoraging arrangements with two types of anchorage and three different numbers of anchorages are tested on 12 test specimens by keeping the concrete compressive strength and the CFRP <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> length constant. In addition, two test specimens without any anchorages, totalling 14 specimens, were tested. It is observed that the anchorages {{had an impact on the}} stress distribution of the CFRP strips and increased the strength and the stiffness of the specimens. The specimens did not fail by peeling of the CFRP strips, instead they were ruptured at the point where the anchorages were situated.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} masonry arches and vaults {{strengthened}} with surface fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement {{in the form}} of <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> at the extrados and/or intrados, considering strip arrangements that prevent hinged mode failure, so the possible failure modes are: (1) crushing, (2) sliding, (3) debonding, and (4) FRP rupture. Mathematical models are presented for predicting the ultimate load associated with each of such failure modes. This study has shown that the reinforced arch is particularly susceptible to failure by crushing, {{as a result of an}} ultimate compressive force being collected by a small fraction of the cross section. Failure by debonding at the intrados may also be an issue, especially in the case of weak masonry blocks or multiring brickwork arches. Failure by sliding has to be considered if the reinforcement is at the extrados and loading is considerably nonsymmetric...|$|R

The model is described {{by a set of}} differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions. An analytical solution to the problem is determined, including explicit expressions for the internal forces, displacements and interfacial stresses. The model predicts an overall non-linear mechanical response for the strengthened beam, ranging over several stages: from linearly elastic behaviour to damage, until the complete detachment of the FRP reinforcement...|$|R

This composite sheet was wound in jelly-roll fashion around a mandrel and inserted into the regenerator housing. The photoresist strips, formed using a photolithographic technique, provided a 25 micron spacing for the axial flow of gas between each layer of PPMI. Ineffectiveness results are presented for this material under actual operating conditions in a pulse tube refrigerator and compared with a numerical model. The numerical model indicated that a polyimide regenerator would perform much better than one constructed of stainless steel screen, but the experimental results showed the opposite behavior.

Acoustic testing was performed on the basic canister and with noise-attenuating design modifications. The basic canister experienced noise amplifications at 56 and 80 Hz, which are attributed to the fundamental canister acoustic mode and local panel structural resonances, respectively. The standing wave response at 56 Hz was effectively suppressed by the incorporation of a cardboard baffle midway between the canister end-caps (an additional overall noise reduction of 4 dB). The canister was next tested with 14 %, 22. 5 % and 31 % sound absorptive coverages on the interior walls. The coverage was effective between 400 - 3000 Hz; the maximum benefit (9 dB) occurring at 1600 Hz. Viscoelastic damping <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> to the canister exterior provided an additional 4 to 5 dB attenuation over much of the frequency range and has an overall reduction of about 10 dB as compared to 4. 4 dB without damping.
