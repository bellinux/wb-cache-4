40|$|The {{dissimilar}} metal weld {{is demanding}} {{as well as}} the similar weld, however, dissimilar weld is more complex than similar weld due to the necessity of being applied in zones where a requirement is to improve some properties. In this work the main purpose is to know the mechanical behavior of a dissimilar weld between HSLA Steel and Superduplex Stainless Steel (SDSS) to establish if the joint is feasible or not. The alloys were welded with GTAW process using a 60 -deg and 90 -deg <b>single-V</b> <b>groove</b> test specimens in order to observe the effect of the weld pass. The filler metal was chosen with the aid of Schaeffler diagram. It was found that the ER 25. 10. 4 L filler metal provided the best equilibrium between ferrite and austenite phase in the Superduplex Stainless Steel final microstructure and a band of martensite in the HSLA steel final microstructure. The dissimilar joint presented acceptable mechanical properties which are superior to the HSLA in the as-received condition, but lower than the SDSS in the as-received condition, proving that the filler metal was the adequate...|$|E
40|$|An {{independent}} assessment {{was conducted to}} determine the critical initial flaw size (CIFS) for the flange-to-skin weld in the Ares I-X Upper Stage Simulator (USS). A series of weld analyses are performed to determine the residual stresses in a critical region of the USS. Weld residual stresses both increase constraint and mean stress thereby having an important effect on the fatigue life. The purpose of the weld analyses was to model the weld process {{using a variety of}} sequences to determine the 'best' sequence in terms of weld residual stresses and distortions. The many factors examined in this study include weld design (<b>single-V,</b> double-V <b>groove),</b> weld sequence, boundary conditions, and material properties, among others. The results of this weld analysis are included with service loads to perform a fatigue and critical initial flaw size evaluation...|$|R
