40|$|Post-inflationary {{boundary}} conditions {{are essential to}} the existence of our highly <b>structured</b> <b>universe,</b> and these can only come about through quantum mechanical state reductions – i. e., through measurements. The choice is between: An ‘objective ’ measurement that allows reduction to occur independent of conscious observers, and an ‘observer ’ based measurement that ties reduction to the existence of a conscious observer. It is shown in this paper that that choice cannot be determined empirically; so how we finally understand state reduction will be decided by the way that reduction is used in a wider (future) theoretical framework...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} a <b>structured</b> <b>universe</b> in the multi-pole moments, auto-correlation function, and cluster statistics of cosmic rays above 10 ^ 19 eV. We compare structured and uniform source distributions with and without magnetic fields obtained from a cosmological simulation. We find that current data marginally favor structured source distributions and magnetic fields reaching a few micro Gauss in galaxy clusters but below 0. 1 micro Gauss in our local extragalactic neighborhood. A pronounced GZK cutoff is also predicted in this scenario. Future experiments will make the degree scale auto-correlation function a sensitive probe of micro Gauss fields surrounding the sources.

40|$|This is a {{proposal}} for rethinking the main lines of Plato’s philosophy, {{including some of the}} conceptual tools he uses for building and maintaining it. Drawing on a new interpretive paradigm for Plato’s overall vision, the central focus is on the so-called Forms. Regarding the guiding paradigm, we propose replacing the dualism of a world of Forms separated from a world of particulars, with the monistic model of a hierarchically <b>structured</b> <b>universe</b> comprising interdependent levels of reality. Regarding the tools of the trade, we distinguish between three constructs that have come, one and all, and largely indiscriminately, to be regarded as Forms: Ideal Forms, Conceptual Forms, and Relational Forms. This recalibration of what we know of Plato’s outlook, tools, and methods, together with a realignment of these with his general aims, will also help restore the philosopher’s emphasis on that which is good, a perspective often blurred in the structure of two worlds...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{propagation}} of iron and proton nuclei above 10 ^ 19 eV in a <b>structured</b> <b>Universe</b> with source and magnetic field distributions obtained from a large scale structure simulation and source densities about 10 ^(- 5) Mpc^(- 3). All relevant cosmic ray interactions are taken into account, including photo-disintegration and propagation of secondary products. Iron injection predicts spectral shapes different from proton injection which disagree with existing data below about 30 EeV. Injection of light nuclei or protons must therefore contribute at these energies. However, at higher energies, existing data are consistent with injection of pure iron with spectral indices between 2 and 2. 4. This allows a significant recovery of the spectrum above roughly 100 EeV, {{especially in the case}} of large deflections. Significant auto-correlation and anisotropy, and considerable cosmic variance are also predicted in this energy range. The mean atomic mass A fluctuates considerably between different scenarios. At energies below 60 EeV, if the observed A > 35, magnetic fields must have a negligible effect on propagation. At the highest energies the observed flux will be dominated by only a few sources whose location may be determined by next generation experiments to within 10 - 20 degrees even if extra-galactic magnetic fields are important.

40|$|We study {{signatures}} of a <b>structured</b> <b>universe</b> in the multi-pole moments, auto-correlation function, and cluster statistics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays above $ 10 ** 19 eV. We compare scenarios where the sources are distributed homogeneously or {{according to the}} baryon density distribution obtained from a cosmological large scale structure simulation. The influence of extragalactic magnetic fields is studied by comparing the case of negligible fields with fields expected to be produced along large scale shocks with a maximal strength consistent with observations. We confirm that strongly magnetized observers would predict considerable anisotropy on large scales, which is already in conflict with current data. In the best fit scenario only the sources are strongly magnetized, although deflection can still be considerable, of order 20 degrees up to 10 ** 20 eV, and a pronounced GZK cutoff is predicted. We then discuss signatures for future large scale full-sky detectors such as the Pierre Auger and EUSO projects. Auto-correlations {{are sensitive to the}} source density only if magnetic fields do not significantly affect propagation. In contrast, for a weakly magnetized observer, degree scale auto-correlations below a certain level indicate magnetized discrete sources. It may be difficult even for next generation experiments to distinguish between structured and unstructured source distributions...|$|E

40|$|Measures of {{structural}} similarity between known protein structures provide an objective basis for classifying protein folds and for revealing a global {{view of the}} protein <b>structure</b> <b>universe.</b> Here, we describe a rapid method to measure structural similarity based on the profiles of representative local features of Cα distance matrices of compared protein structures. We first extract {{a finite number of}} representative local feature (LF) patterns from the distance matrices of all protein fold families by medoid analysis. Then, each Cα distance matrix of a protein structure is encoded by labeling all its submatrices by the index of the nearest representative LF patterns. Finally, the structure is represented by the frequency distribution of these indices, which we call the LF frequency (LFF) profile of the protein. The LFF profile allows one to calculate structural similarity scores among a large number of protein structures quickly, and also to construct and update the “map” of the protein <b>structure</b> <b>universe</b> easily. The LFF profile method efficiently maps complex protein structures into a common Euclidean space without prior assignment of secondary structure information or structural alignment...|$|R
40|$|Even in our secular age, {{the sacred}} {{continues}} to be a powerful cognitive space in the landscape of the imagination. I am a Roman Catholic and amongst those who struggle to exist both in the <b>structured</b> <b>universe</b> of the sacred, and the contemporary plurality of the city. The mystery of the incarnation provides a theological argument for the indwelling of the Spirit in creation through time. With the advent of secularism however, it is possible to conceive of a time outside the sacred. Tension within theology in academia, faith in politics, or religion in a pluralistic society, reveals a boundary between our beliefs and our public face which becomes a rigid barrier – distinct as the private and public. Conflicting temporal structures of the sacred and secular give definition to this divide. Architecture has historically placed itself as interlocutor, negotiating complex thresholds in order to engage meaning. Contemporary sacred architecture, however, has avoided confrontation with the public realm. Thick edges distinguish the realms of the sacred and the quotidian. This thesis engages the border between the sacred and the secular. An analysis of the temporal structures of contemporary sacred space and its civic environment opens up an exploration of one such border around St. Basil’s Church in Toronto. The definition of a threshold at this edge challenges our contemporary divide by exploring potential transitions. Between the church and the street, architecture inhabits the edge, expanding and articulating connections. Methods are explored for constructing built forms which promote a transition between, and interaction of, sacred and secular temporalities. At this threshold, individual creativity provides metaphors for ontology. Crossing this threshold creates opportunities for overlap between the time of the sacred and the time of the secular. These transitions challenge how we imagine both the church and the city in contemporary architecture...|$|E
