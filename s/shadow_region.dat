50|$|There {{are three}} basic zones within each plant population; the {{reproductive}} core, the marginal establishment zone, {{and the outer}} seed shadow. The reproductive core of the plant population is {{the area in which}} sexually mature parental plants are present. This is the established reproductive source that provides the positive force for the population's expansion. The second region is the marginal establishment zone. In this region, seeds are successful and plants establish. The plants in this region have yet to reach reproductive maturity, thus they do not contribute to the seed dispersal potential of the population. The final region is the seed <b>shadow</b> <b>region.</b> In this region, inflow of seeds from the reproductive core is occurring, but because of environmental conditions germination or seedling survival is repressed causing an absence of species representatives in this region. This region is controlled by the negative force of the environment to the extent of zero success of the population.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{driver of}} the Sq current is the {{external}} (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height, while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights. A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by 180°. This {{appears to be the}} result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity [...] The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity. [...] Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150 km from the equator. Such enhancement of the Sq current by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. During a solar flare, bursts of solar radiation from the environment of an active sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet. During a solar eclipse, the electric conductivity decreases in the <b>shadow</b> <b>region,</b> and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area. It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity. In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar thermosphere. This current system is called Ddyn.|$|E

The first section handles the special case of shadows cast on planar surfaces, and the second section covers more general shadow algorithms, i. e., casting shadows onto arbitrary surfaces. 1 Planar Shadows A simple case of shadowing occurs when objects cast shadows on planar surfaces. Two kinds of algorithms for planar shadows are presented in this section. The terminology used here is illustrated in Figure 1, where occluders are objects that cast shadows onto receivers.
