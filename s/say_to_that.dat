At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>that?</b> I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E

[...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said.

2500|$|The first {{works that}} Warhol {{submitted}} to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay. In Popism, furthermore, the artist recalls {{a conversation with the}} film maker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. De Antonio explained that Warhol was [...] "too swish and that upsets them." [...] In response to this, Warhol writes, [...] "There was nothing I could <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change... Other people could change their attitudes but not me". In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like [...] "Um, no" [...] and [...] "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.|$|E
2500|$|Following Coleridge's {{response}} was an anonymous {{review in the}} May 1820 Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, possible by either John Lockhart and John Wilson together or just Lockhart on his own. Of Wordsworth's abilities as a poet in general, the review claimed: [...] "Mr Wordsworth ... is entitled to be classed with the very highest names among his predecessors, as a pure and reverent worshipper of the true majest of the English Muse" [...] and that [...] "Of the genius of Mr Wordsworth, in short, it {{is now in the}} hands of every man to judge freely and fully, and for himself. Our own opinion, ever since this Journal commenced, has been clearly and entirely before them; and if there be any one person, on whose mind what we have quoted now, is not enough to make an impression similar to that which our own judgment had long before received– we have nothing more to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> person in regard to the subject of poetry." [...] In discussing the ode in particular, the review characterised the poem as [...] "one of the grandest of his early pieces". In December 1820 came an article in the New Monthly Magazine titled [...] "On the Genius and Writings of Wordsworth" [...] written by Thomas Noon Talfourd. When discussing the poem, Talfourd declared that the ode [...] "is, to our feelings, the noblest piece of lyric poetry in the world. It was the first poem of its author which we read, and never shall we forget the sensations which it excited within us. We had heard the cold sneers attached to his name... and here – in the works of this derided poet – we found a new vein of imaginative sentiment open to us – sacred recollections brought back to our hearts with all the freshness of novelty, and all the venerableness of far-off time". When analysing the relationship between infants and the divine within the poem, the article continued: [...] "What a gift did we then inherit! To have the best and most imperishable of intellectual treasures – the mighty world of reminiscences of the days of infancy – set before us in a new and holier light".|$|E
