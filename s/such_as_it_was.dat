During the Kettle War, in which her brother Joseph attempted to open the Scheldt River for naval passage, Marie Antoinette succeeded in obliging Vergennes to pay a huge financial compensation to Austria. Finally, the queen was able to obtain her brother's support against Great Britain in the American Revolution and she neutralized French hostility to his alliance with Russia.|$|E

A lifelong {{bachelor}} and teetotaler (although Bennett was known by select associates to occasionally drink alcohol when {{the press was}} not around to observe this), he led a rather lonely life in a hotel and later, in a boarding house. For a while a younger brother roomed with him. He ate his noon meal on workdays at the Alberta Hotel. Social life, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> centred on church. There was, however, no scandal attached to his personal life. Bennett worked hard and gradually built up his legal practice. In 1908 {{he was one of}} five people appointed to the first Library Board for the city of Calgary and was instrumental in establishing the Calgary Public Library.|$|E
25|$|The {{semifinal}} {{series was}} very {{typical of the}} way D.C United played throughout {{the second half of}} the season. The attack, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> generated a handful of chances at best, and United became the first team in league history to fail to record a shot on goal as the home team in a playoff match. The passing accuracy was the 3rd worst for any MLS team in any game since 2010. The Red Bulls dominated possession and finally broke through in the second half as one-time United player Dax McCarty headed home the winner in a 1-0 defeat for United. The return match didn't go much better for United. Again, the Red Bulls dominated possession, but thanks to some big saves by Hamid, United still had a chance to try and knot the series as the game drifted into stoppage time. The Red Bulls, however, would finish off United's 2015 season, with a counter-attack goal in stoppage time, scored by Bradley Wright-Phillips, giving NYRB a 2-0 aggregate series win.|$|E

25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E
500|$|The Earl of Aylesford {{attempted}} {{to stem the}} mounting violence {{on the night of}} the 14th, but despite having the help of other magistrates, he was unable to control the crowd. [...] On the 15th, the mob liberated prisoners from the local gaol. Thomas Woodbridge, the Keeper of the Prison, deputized several hundred people to help him quell the mob, but many of these joined in with the rioters themselves. The crowd destroyed John Ryland's home, Baskerville House, and drank the supplies of liquor which they found in the cellar. When the newly appointed constables arrived on the scene, the mob attacked and disarmed them. One man was killed. The local magistrates and law enforcement, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> did nothing further to restrain the mob and did not read the Riot Act until the military arrived on 17 July. Other rioters burned down banker John Taylor's home at Bordesley Park.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} his doctorate, Sledd obtained an appointment {{as a professor}} of Greek at Methodist-affiliated Southern University (now known as Birmingham–Southern College) in Greensboro, Alabama. Several months later, on July 6, 1904, he was unanimously selected to be the president of the University of Florida at Lake City by its board of trustees. At the time of his appointment, the University of Florida at Lake City was experiencing a controversy of its own: its administration and faculty were hopelessly fractured by personality conflicts and its unpopular president's failed attempts at improving the small school's instruction and academic standing. The university's board of trustees had removed the ineffectual president, and dismissed seven members of its small faculty. The university, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> had been known as [...] "Florida Agricultural College" [...] until 1903. When Sledd arrived in Lake City, it was a school with a new name, a faculty fractured by contentious personalities, an unknown number of returning students and an uncertain future. Sledd required all previous faculty members to re-apply if they desired to keep their jobs, hired replacement instructors, most of whom had earned doctoral degrees in their respective fields (in contrast to the previous faculty), and set about devising rigorous academic standards for the school's new students. Although the university was a designated land-grant college under the federal government's Morrill Act, it received insufficient annual financial assistance from the state government, and its finances remained tenuous.|$|E

Domestically, Jadid attempted a socialist transformation of Syrian society at forced pace, creating unrest and economical difficulties.

However, the time was not yet ripe for such a step. Contemporary agriculture on the Plateau was not exactly widespread, but <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> the ranchers relied upon it for sustenance, and perceived a threat to their economic well-being if the land was put off limits to ranching and farming. (Many years later, Valles Caldera National Preserve was established in the adjoining Jemez Mountains with language that explicitly mandated promoting the economic interests of the region in terms of agriculture and forestry.) These pressures, combined with opposition from Santa Clara Pueblo, prevented Pajarito National Park from being approved at that time.|$|E
2500|$|These revelations {{were not}} full, however. Though unique, they were {{proportioned}} {{on the scale}} the revealing made necessary (p.87). The reality of the Resurrection is one thing, and its appearance to something else, just as the disciples still await the full, unmediated revelation. This was the paradox and the tension of the primitive Christian experience, which created {{the nature of the}} Ekklesia, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> and is. [...] "The Risen One reveals in the appearances his glorified existence" [...] (p.87). Central to this is corporeality, of a kind which prohibits both spiritualizing and materializing. Künneth rejects the classic Lutheran commentator Quenstadt's definition of Christ's new body: [...] "reproductio sive reparatio of precisely the same body as was destroyed by death, ex atomis sue particulis illius corporis hinc inde disiectis atque dissipatis"(p.88), just as he rejects Bultmann's mythical Christ.

Support for the notion that at least a few of these cars were produced in 1943 would come from a photograph (obtained from Toyota Motor Co.

2500|$|The league began {{a college}} draft in 1972 {{in an attempt}} to {{increase}} the number of U.S.- and Canadian-born players in the league. The foreign image of soccer was not helped, however, by a league that brought in many older, high-profile foreign players, and frequently left Americans on the bench. This effort was often doubly futile, as while many of the foreign players were perhaps [...] "big names" [...] in their home countries, almost none of them qualified as such in North America, and they quickly absorbed most of the available payroll, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> which could have otherwise been used to pay North American players better. As of 1979, NASL rules required that each squad start two U.S. or Canadian players—often a goalkeeper and an outside defender—and that each 17-man roster carry six native players. The U.S. had lacked sufficient quality youth soccer programs in the 1950s, resulting in the dearth of U.S.-born talent in NASL in the 1970s. NASL suffered a minor blow with a players strike at the start of the 1979 season, but the strike was honored by only one third of the players and lasted only five days.|$|E
2500|$|While {{coming to}} {{question}} the official ideology, Ornea was already an opponent of the Romanian regime's methods. Around 1970, as nationalism, national communism and Protochronism were being imposed on {{an increasing number of}} publications, Ornea joined the faction of professionals who attempted to promote a different line from within the cultural system. Reviewing this debate, literary critic Pia Brînzeu argued that Ornea, with Manolescu, Andrei Pleșu and Adrian Marino (who [...] "appreciated Western values and favored the acceptance of some advanced social and cultural issues"), represented [...] "the opposition" [...] to communist or nationalist magazines such as Flacăra, Luceafărul and Săptămîna ("which insisted on maintaining Romania's isolation from Europe"). American researcher Katherine Verdery lists Ornea, Iorgulescu, Pleșu, Manolescu and Ștefănescu among those who [...] "took a visible stand" [...] against officially condoned Protochronism (a group also including, in her opinion, Iorgulescu, Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Gheorghe Grigurcu, Norman Manea, Alexandru Paleologu and Eugen Simion). The disadvantage for Ornea's camp, Brînzeu writes, was in that its members generally [...] "could not voice their opinions aloud". Verdery however singles out Ornea's [...] "antiprotochronist" [...] columns, which condemned the practice of prefacing reprints of consecrated scientific works with messages with retrospectively attached them to Protochronist tenets (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> with a 1987 edition of Nicolae Iorga's Evoluția ideii de liberatate, [...] "The Evolution of the Idea of Liberty", which the editor Ilie Bădescu had prefaced with a Protochronist manifesto). Nevertheless, literary historian Florin Mihăilescu argues, Protochronist ideologue Edgar Papu abusively cited Ornea's texts, alongside those of many other figures outside the national communist circles, in such manner as to appear that they too supported Protochronist theories.|$|E
