5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>From</b> a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|Because it is <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> {{the nearest}} major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced {{the phenomenon of}} geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically {{different from that of}} other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, a French {{squadron}} under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois used Batavia on Java {{as a base}} {{to attack}} the China Fleet, although the attempt ended in failure at the Battle of Pulo Aura. Java presented a clear threat to British maritime interests in the South China Sea, but the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean was too weak in 1805 to consider operations <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> its main base at Madras while Linois remained active. By the start of 1806, Linois had sailed into the Atlantic and an expeditionary force had seized the Dutch base at the Cape of Good Hope, securing the western Indian Ocean and providing reinforcements that allowed Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to begin operations against the Dutch forces in the East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E
5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the main centres of broch-building {{is something of a}} mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, Linois was {{operating}} off the Indian port of Vizagapatam when his squadron encountered the British warship HMS Centurion and two merchant ships under her protection. In the ensuing Battle of Vizagapatam, Centurion was badly damaged; {{one of the}} merchant ships was captured and the other driven ashore. Rather than ensure the capture or destruction of Centurion, Linois refused further combat for fear of damaging his ships in shallow coastal waters and withdrew, again provoking censure from Napoleon. In August 1805, Linois was engaged with another convoy of East Indiamen in the central Indian Ocean, but on this occasion was confronted by the ship of the line HMS Blenheim under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge. After some ineffectual skirmishing, Linois withdrew again, unwilling to risk taking fatal damage to his ships <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> a safe port. Although he had seized five Indiamen {{and a number of}} small ships that had been sailing individually during his three-year cruise, he failed to make a significant impact on British trade in the region and ruined his reputation as a successful naval commander. Deciding to switch his operations to the Atlantic after discovering that a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew was searching for him, Linois visited the Cape of Good Hope, where one of his frigates was wrecked. He subsequently cruised the coast of West Africa, capturing two small ships but again failing to make a significant impact on British trade in the region. Learning from an American ship that a British expeditionary force had captured Cape Town, Linois decided to return to France with his remaining ships, the 74-gun ship of the line flagship Marengo and the frigate Belle Poule, sailing northwards and crossing the equator on 17 February.|$|E

25|$|The {{news was}} greeted with caution, because there was doubt {{as to whether the}} ships were the Channel Fleet or the British convoy.

25|$|Unfortunately, TNOs are <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the Sun {{that they}} are very cold, hence {{producing}} black-body radiation around 60 micrometres in wavelength.

This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs.|$|E

25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly.

His view is that <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|It {{would take}} another hundred years and several wasted {{opportunities}} (for both sides) before the Crusader states were wiped out.

Within 200 years of the Palaiologan restoration, the Byzantine Empire was eliminated {{with the fall of}} Trebizond in 1461, whilst Egypt fell sixty years later in 1520 under the Ottoman Sultan Selim I.|$|E
