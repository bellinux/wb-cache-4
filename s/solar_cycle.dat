5|$|The {{magnetic}} field also varies {{in time and}} location. The quasi-periodic 11-year <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.|$|E
5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle,</b> the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|For example, in the 17th century, the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> {{appeared}} to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided {{in time with the}} era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E
30|$|At the Indian {{chain of}} stations, D and Z {{residuals}} show a periodicity of ~ 2 <b>solar</b> <b>cycles,</b> while H residuals show out-of-phase variations with the sunspot cycle. At Alibag, the D residuals show a periodicity of ~ 2 <b>solar</b> <b>cycles,</b> whereas the H and Z residuals {{are found to}} be opposite in phase with a quasi-periodicity of 3 <b>solar</b> <b>cycles</b> for the period 1921 – 2009.|$|R

5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every <b>solar</b> <b>cycle,</b> a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E

5|$|Sunspots {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E
25|$|The {{equatorial}} region has a faster rotation speed than the polar zones. The {{result of the}} Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle,</b> while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle.</b> Approaching the minimum of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> (also named butterfly cycle), {{the extension of the}} quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are the coronal holes.|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{autocorrelation}} coefficients of the daily Wolf sunspot numbers over a period of 128 years reveal a number of interesting features of the variability of solar activity. Besides establishing periodicities for the solar rotation, <b>solar</b> activity <b>cycle,</b> and, perhaps, the 'Gleissberg Cycle', they suggest that active longitudes do exist, but with much greater strength and persistence in some <b>solar</b> <b>cycles</b> than in others.

25|$|Due to its link {{to other}} kinds of solar activity, sunspot {{occurrence}} {{can be used to}} help predict space weather, the state of the ionosphere, and hence the conditions of short-wave radio propagation or satellite communications. Solar activity (and the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle)</b> have been implicated in global warming, originally the role of the Maunder Minimum of sunspot occurrence in the Little Ice Age in European winter climate. Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on terrestrial climate in a direct sense.

25|$|Sunspots are {{temporary}} phenomena on the Sun's photosphere {{that appear}} as spots {{darker than the}} surrounding areas.

25|$|The Sun, in {{this respect}} as in many others, is {{relatively}} benign: the variation between its maximum and minimum energy output is roughly 0.1% over its 11-year <b>solar</b> <b>cycle.</b> There is strong (though not undisputed) evidence that even minor changes in the Sun's luminosity have had significant effects on the Earth's climate well within the historical era: the Little Ice Age of the mid-second millennium, for instance, may {{have been caused by}} a relatively long-term decline in the Sun's luminosity. Thus, a star {{does not have to be}} a true variable for differences in luminosity to affect habitability. Of known solar analogs, one that closely resembles the Sun is considered to be 18 Scorpii; unfortunately for the prospects of life existing in its proximity, the only significant difference between the two bodies is the amplitude of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle,</b> which appears to be much greater for 18 Scorpii.|$|E
