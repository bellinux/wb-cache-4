500|$|The Pinto's design {{positioned}} its {{fuel tank}} between the rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time. The Pinto's vulnerability to fuel leakage and {{fire in a}} rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear [...] "crush space", a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear, and an [...] "essentially ornamental" [...] rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers). [...] Crash testing, conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks, {{as part of a}} response to NHTSA proposed regulations, demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds. [...] Design changes were made, but post launch tests showed similar results.

40|$|Often {{concepts}} of sustainability have been criticised for being theoretically ill-founded and lacking practical impact. This paper provides a new theoretical foundation of sustainable development, {{which is based}} on a coherent set of three normative and functional categories: <b>systems</b> <b>integrity,</b> justice and quality of life. From these three categories indicators for sustainability are deduced that allow to measure progress in sustainable development. Based on the set of criteria and its indicators, interdependencies between the different aspects of sustainability are analysed with the help of expert judgements and cross impact analysis. This paper concludes with sketching a deliberative approach to generate future strategies for sustainability. sustainability concepts; sustainability indicators; systems theory; social justice; quality of life; cross-impact analysis; deliberation; participation; sustainable development; <b>systems</b> <b>integrity.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} {{companies in}} the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain <b>system</b> <b>integrity.</b> The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas price volatility. Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>System</b> <b>integrity</b> {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} childhood intelligence {{is just one}} aspect of a well wired and well-functioning body and {{suggests that there is}} a latent trait that encompasses intelligence, health and many other factors. This trait indexes how well the body is functioning and how well the body can respond to change and return to a normal balance again (allostatic load). According to the <b>system</b> <b>integrity</b> hypothesis lower IQ does not cause mortality but instead poor <b>system</b> <b>integrity</b> causes lower intelligence and poorer health as well as a range of other traits which {{can be thought of as}} markers of <b>system</b> <b>integrity.</b> Professor Ian Deary has proposed that fluctuating asymmetry, speed of information processing, physical co-ordination, physical strength, metabolic syndrome and genetic correlation may be further potential markers of <b>system</b> <b>integrity</b> which by definition should explain a large part of or nullify the relationship between intelligence and mortality.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{significant}} role of anti-corruption compliance {{should be encouraged}} to create good business and investment climate. Especially, in the circumstances of higher number of bribery and corruption cases, whilst preparing for Asian Economic Community, the necessary actions to reduce the financial crime and economic crime should be fostered into all aspects of business activities. To reduce bribery and corruption cases in Indonesia, National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> as part of National Strategy on Corruption Prevention and Eradication is urged to be conducted. With the implementation of National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> among all public or governmental institutions and private institutions, the institutions itself will be strengthened. National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> should be implemented through all the people, process and technology in the organizations. So, at the end, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to prevent any financial crime, particularly in the Indonesian anti-corruption regime. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores and analyzes anti-bribery regulations and the important role of National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> as the prevention approach to build anti-corruption compliance in Indonesia. Findings – The National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> and Anti-Corruption Compliance can be viewed as important elements for preventing any financial crime. The new perspective is needed for all of the public institutions and private institutions to build and implement National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> in all business activities. Furthermore, all of business society has a {{significant role}} of developing the sustainable good business environment in Indonesia. Encouraging National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> in every business sector is also a way to achieve the last purpose, which is to strengthen economic competitiveness. Practical implications – The paper can be a source to explore about the National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> and Anti-Corruption Compliance based on Indonesia perspectives. Originality/value – This paper gives contributions by encouraging the public and private institutions to build anti-corruption compliance by implementing National <b>Integrity</b> <b>System</b> within their organizational culture to prevent financial crime and lead to sustainable economic growth. ...|$|R
