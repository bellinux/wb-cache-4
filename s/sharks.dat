5|$|A popular myth is that <b>sharks</b> are {{immune to}} disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. <b>Sharks</b> have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect <b>sharks.</b> The evidence that <b>sharks</b> are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show <b>sharks</b> to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E
5|$|All tiger <b>sharks</b> {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger <b>sharks</b> {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid <b>sharks.</b> Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5000|$|Sharks: There are {{at least}} 22 <b>shark</b> species including: Blue <b>shark,</b> Silky <b>shark,</b> Bigeye {{thresher}} <b>shark,</b> Pelagic thresher <b>shark,</b> Oceanic whitetip <b>shark,</b> and Tawny nurse <b>shark.</b>|$|R

Standardized catch rates were estimated using a Generalized Linear Mixed modeling approach assuming a delta-lognormal error distribution. The explanatory variables considered for standardization included geographical area, seasonal trimesters, fishing target species, and mode a factor that classifies recreational fishing in shore, headboat, charter or private/rental boat...|$|R
5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as the great white <b>shark,</b> tiger <b>shark,</b> blue <b>shark,</b> mako <b>shark,</b> {{thresher}} <b>shark,</b> and hammerhead <b>shark</b> are apex predators—organisms {{at the top of}} their underwater food chain. Many <b>shark</b> populations are threatened by human activities.|$|R
5|$|Blacktip reef <b>sharks,</b> {{particularly}} small individuals, {{fall prey}} to larger fishes, including groupers, grey reef <b>sharks,</b> tiger <b>sharks</b> (Galeocerdo cuvier), and {{members of their own}} species. At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger <b>sharks</b> by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon. Their known parasites include the tapeworms Anthobothrium lesteri, Nybelinia queenslandensis, Otobothrium alexanderi, and Platybothrium jondoeorum, a myxosporidian in the genus Unicapsula, and the monogenean Dermophthirius melanopteri. One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark, caused by the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.|$|E
5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground <b>sharks,</b> the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip <b>sharks</b> (collectively called the requiem <b>sharks)</b> {{along with the}} houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead <b>sharks.</b> They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of <b>sharks</b> dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first <b>sharks</b> and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true <b>sharks,</b> suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first <b>sharks</b> looked very different from modern <b>sharks.</b> The majority of modern <b>sharks</b> {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that <b>sharks</b> grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E

5000|$|The genus name Heptranchias is {{from the}} Greek heptra meaning [...] "seven arms", and agchein meaning [...] "throttle", {{referring}} to this <b>shark's</b> seven pairs of gill slits. Other common names for this species include one-finned <b>shark,</b> perlon <b>shark,</b> sevengill cow <b>shark,</b> sevengilled Mediterranean <b>shark,</b> sevengilled <b>shark,</b> sharpnose seven-gill <b>shark,</b> snouted sevengill <b>shark</b> and slender sevengill <b>shark.</b> Some authors believe this species is distinct enough to merit its own family, Heptranchiidae.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shark</b> species {{include the}} Caribbean reef <b>shark,</b> lemon <b>shark,</b> bull <b>shark,</b> tiger <b>shark,</b> hammerhead <b>shark,</b> silky <b>shark,</b> nurse <b>shark,</b> blacktip <b>shark,</b> {{and the great}} white <b>shark.</b> There are many areas of large {{tropical}} fish populations, including by Waterlemon Cay in Leinster Bay, which provides habitat for sergeant major, blue chromis, parrotfish, queen triggerfish and queen angelfish. Another island visited for its tropical fish- and bird life is Buck Island, a 19015-acre marine protected district, which offers great diversity of coral.|$|R
5|$|Female copper <b>sharks</b> {{make use}} of shallow inshore habitats, varying from {{stretches}} of open coast to more sheltered bays and inlets, as nurseries. These nurseries provide abundant food and {{reduce the likelihood of}} predation by larger members of the species. Known and suspected nursery areas occur off northern North Island from Waimea Inlet to Hawke Bay for New Zealand <b>sharks,</b> off Albany, in and around Gulf St Vincent, and in Port Phillip Bay for Australian <b>sharks,</b> off Niigata (Japan) for northwestern Pacific <b>sharks,</b> off the Eastern Cape for South Africa <b>sharks,</b> off Rhodes (Greece), Nice (France), and Al Hoceima (Morocco) for Mediterranean <b>sharks,</b> off Río de Oro (Western Sahara) for northwest African <b>sharks,</b> off Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca (Argentina) for southwestern Atlantic <b>sharks,</b> and off Paita and Guanape Cove (Peru), in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay (Mexico), and in and around San Diego Bay for eastern Pacific <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally some <b>sharks</b> {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem <b>sharks</b> (such as the bull and blue <b>sharks),</b> and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef <b>sharks</b> feed {{mainly on}} bony fishes, with {{cephalopods}} such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters {{making up the}} remainder. The larger <b>sharks</b> take {{a greater proportion of}} cephalopods. These <b>sharks</b> hunt individually or in groups, and have been known to pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. They excel at capturing fish swimming in the open, and they complement hunting whitetip reef <b>sharks,</b> which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of smell is extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef <b>sharks</b> may be roused into a feeding frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the <b>sharks</b> involved was attacked and consumed by the others.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "bull shark" [...] {{comes from}} the <b>shark's</b> stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive, {{unpredictable}} behavior. In India, the bull <b>shark</b> may {{be confused with the}} Sundarbans or Ganges <b>shark.</b> In Africa, it is also commonly called the Zambezi River <b>shark</b> or just Zambi. Its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names, including Ganges River <b>shark,</b> Fitzroy Creek whaler, van Rooyen's <b>shark,</b> Lake Nicaragua <b>shark,</b> river <b>shark,</b> freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, Swan River whaler, cub <b>shark,</b> and shovelnose <b>shark.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Pondicherry <b>shark</b> are uncertain. In a 1988 study based on morphological data, Compagno tentatively grouped {{it with the}} smalltail <b>shark</b> (C. porosus), blackspot <b>shark</b> (C. sealei), spottail <b>shark</b> (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek <b>shark</b> (C. dussumieri), Borneo <b>shark</b> (C. borneensis), and hardnose <b>shark</b> (C. macloti).|$|R
5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{first described}} the grey reef <b>shark</b> in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, {{in the scientific}} journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this <b>shark</b> around the world include black-vee whaler, bronze whaler, Fowler's whaler <b>shark,</b> graceful <b>shark,</b> graceful whaler <b>shark,</b> grey <b>shark,</b> grey whaler <b>shark,</b> longnose blacktail <b>shark,</b> school <b>shark,</b> and shortnose blacktail <b>shark.</b> Some of these names are also applied to other species.|$|R

5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef <b>sharks</b> are preyed upon by larger <b>sharks</b> such as {{the tiger}} shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the <b>sharks</b> of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel <b>sharks.</b> They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher <b>sharks,</b> shortfin and longfin mako <b>sharks,</b> and great white shark.

5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped the smoothtooth blacktip <b>shark</b> {{with the}} spinner <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), the blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. limbatus), the graceful <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchoides), and the finetooth <b>shark</b> (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species {{is closely related}} to the graceful <b>shark,</b> the blacktip <b>shark,</b> and the Australian blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. tilstoni).|$|R
5|$|The oceanic whitetip <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus longimanus), {{also known}} as Brown Milbert's sand bar <b>shark,</b> brown <b>shark,</b> nigano <b>shark,</b> oceanic white-tipped whaler, and silvertip <b>shark,</b> is a large pelagic requiem <b>shark</b> inhabiting {{tropical}} and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>sharks</b> are carnivorous. Basking <b>sharks,</b> whale <b>sharks,</b> and megamouth <b>sharks</b> have {{independently}} evolved {{different strategies}} for filter feeding plankton: basking <b>sharks</b> practice ram feeding, whale <b>sharks</b> use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth <b>sharks</b> make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|E
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef <b>sharks</b> often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef <b>sharks</b> following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky <b>sharks</b> (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef <b>sharks,</b> using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large <b>sharks.</b> At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white <b>sharks.</b> They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white <b>sharks</b> and shortfin mako <b>sharks.</b> <b>Sharks</b> attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
500|$|The genus name Nebrius {{is derived}} from the Greek word nebris or nebridos, meaning the skin of a fawn. The {{specific}} epithet ferrugineus is Latin for [...] "rust-colored". Other common names for this species include giant sleepy <b>shark,</b> Madame X (a name coined by the <b>shark</b> fisherman Norman Caldwell in the 1930s for the then-unidentified Australian specimens), nurse <b>shark,</b> rusty catshark, rusty <b>shark,</b> sleepy <b>shark,</b> spitting <b>shark,</b> and tawny <b>shark.</b> Based on morphological similarities, Nebrius {{is believed to be the}} sister genus of Ginglymostoma, with both being placed in a clade that also contains the short-tail nurse <b>shark</b> (Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum), the whale <b>shark</b> (Rhincodon typus), and the zebra <b>shark</b> (Stegostoma fasciatum).|$|R
500|$|Initial {{efforts to}} resolve the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the silky <b>shark</b> were inconclusive; based on morphology, Jack Garrick in 1982 suggested the blackspot <b>shark</b> (C.sealei) as its closest relative. In 1988, Leonard Compagno assigned it phenetically to an informal [...] "transitional group" [...] also containing the blacknose <b>shark</b> (C.acronotus), the blacktip reef <b>shark</b> (C.melanopterus), the nervous <b>shark</b> (C.cautus), the copper <b>shark</b> (C.brachyurus), and the night <b>shark</b> (C.signatus).|$|R
500|$|The {{common name}} [...] "milk shark" [...] {{comes from a}} belief held in India that eating this <b>shark's</b> meat enhances lactation. Other names for this species include fish <b>shark,</b> grey dog <b>shark,</b> little blue <b>shark,</b> Longmans dogshark, milk dog <b>shark,</b> sharp-nosed (milk) <b>shark,</b> Walbeehm's sharp-nosed <b>shark,</b> and white-eye <b>shark.</b> A 1992 phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Gavin Naylor, based on allozymes, found that the milk <b>shark</b> is the most basal of the four Rhizoprionodon species examined. The extinct R. fischeuri, known from Middle Miocene (1612 Ma) deposits in southern France and Portugal, may {{be the same as}} R. acutus.|$|R
5|$|<b>Sharks</b> {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras. It is currently thought that the <b>sharks</b> form a polyphyletic group: some <b>sharks</b> are {{more closely related to}} rays than they are to some other <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Sharks</b> can {{be highly}} social, {{remaining}} in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, oceanic whitetip <b>sharks</b> dominate silky <b>sharks</b> of comparable size during feeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sharks</b> {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} only {{after many years}} and produce few offspring in comparison to other harvested fish. Harvesting <b>sharks</b> before they reproduce severely impacts future populations.|$|E
50|$|The {{shortfin mako}} <b>shark</b> (Isurus oxyrinchus), {{also known as}} the blue pointer or bonito <b>shark,</b> is a large {{mackerel}} <b>shark.</b> It is commonly referred to as the mako <b>shark,</b> as is the longfin mako <b>shark</b> (Isurus paucus).
