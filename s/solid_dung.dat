40|$|The steroids {{trenbolone}} acetate (TbA) and melengestrol acetate (MGA) are licensed as growth promoters for farm animals in several meat-exporting countries. Although {{many studies have}} explored their safety for both animals and consumers, {{little is known about}} their fate after excretion by the animal. Our study aimed to determine the residues and degradation of trenbolone and MGA in <b>solid</b> <b>dung,</b> liquid manure, and soil. In animal experiments lasting 8 weeks, cattle were treated with TbA and MGA. <b>Solid</b> <b>dung</b> and, in case of trenbolone, liquid manure were collected and spread on maize fields after 4. 5 and 5. 5 months of storage, respectively. Determination of the hormone residues in all samples included extraction, clean-up (solid-phase extraction), separation of metabolites and interfering substances by HPLC (RP- 18), and quantification by sensitive enzyme immunoassay. Procedures were validated by mass spectrometry (MS) methods. During storage of liquid manure the level of trenbolone decreased from 1, 700 to 1, 100 pg/g (17 alpha-isomer), corresponding to a half-life of 267 days. Before storage, the concentrations in the dung hill ranged from 5 to 75 ng/g TbOH and from 0. 3 to 8 ng/g MGA. After storage, levels up to 10 ng/g trenbolone, and 6 ng/g MGA were detected. In the soil samples trenbolone was traceable up to 8 weeks after fertilization, and MGA was detected even {{until the end of the}} cultivation period. The results show that these substances should be investigated further concerning their potential endocrine-disrupting activity in agricultural ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|There are {{similarities}} between livestock farming in Europe and Asia. There is close coupling of intensive agriculture with industrialization {{and there are}} environmental impacts caused by the production of very large amounts of organic wastes in limited areas. There are also differences deriving from geographical, climatic and cultural factors, which have led to particular problems in each region. In Europe, {{there is still a}} lack of appreciation of the full agronomic value of the manures produced, although most are spread in an organized way. In Asia, <b>solid</b> <b>dung</b> {{is more likely to be}} valued and sold as a product for fish farms and vegetable or fruit production. However, land on which organic waste can be spread is limited and less accessible, and river pollution is commonplace. In both regions, effective treatment options are available but, in the absence of financial support, they are rarely popular unless a financial return is implied, as in biogas schemes...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY An {{interdisciplinary}} research program on organic pig production, EKOPIG, was financed by FORMAS and by SLU. Part IV of EKOPIG {{was carried out}} at SLU-Alnarp and emphasis was on housing systems for organic growing-finishing pigs. In this part, an animal house for organic growing-finishing pigs was built. The planning and construction of the building is described in this report. When planning {{the design of the}} animal house, a number of principles were taken into consideration. Among others, the pigs should be easy to control and monitor. It should also be easy to control feeding and production, to weigh the pigs, and to send them to slaughter. The labour requirement should be minimized by using automatic manure and feeding systems. The building construction should be simple, uninsulated, and self-ventilating, and to a major extent be constructed of locally available wooden material. In addition, dung contact between the animal groups should be avoided [...] The house had room for 128 growing-finishing pigs distributed into 8 pens of 16 pigs each (Figure 8). There were two different pen types, of which one had deep straw bedding (Figure 15), and the other had slanted floors and the “straw-flow” system (Figures 12 and 16). The pens were designed according to the EU and KRAV regulations (with or without letting the animals go outside). The total pen area was 1. 5 m 2 per pig inside and 1 m 2 per pig outside on the concrete area. The building was constructed at JBT’s research farm for pig studies at Odarslöv, and had bearing outer walls and framework roof trusses. The animal house was located near the existing manure container (Figures 1 and 2). The concrete floor was poured on location (Figure 3) upon which walls were built up of cavity cement blocks. The sides of the dung channel and the wall towards the animal area were also built of cavity cement blocks (Figure 4). The lower section of the wall was built of lightclinker blocks which were plastered on both sides, and above this section the wall was made of a wooden frame covered with wood panels (Figure 5). The roof consisted of cement fiber plates (Figure 6). There was natural ventilation due to the wooden slats on the walls and an open roof ridge with transparent covering. The roof ridge was furnished with a wind shield and was solid the first 4 m from each gable. The pen with the straw flow system had a lying area which was covered and a floor profile slanting to the dung channel (Figure 16). All the pens were placed in a row with openings towards the north (Figure 13) facing the concrete area and pasturage. An inspection passage was placed along one of the outside walls (Figure 9). The concrete outside lying area had the same design for all of the pens (Figure 14). The floor profile for the pens and concrete areas are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The pigs were fed using an automatic dry feed system (Figure 18) in transverse troughs (Figure 17), and over the troughs water pipes with nose valves were placed so the pigs had the possibility of wetting the feed. Roughage was distributed in containers placed in the concrete area on the stable walls (Figures 19 and 20). The pigs had free access to water via a water cup located in the dung alley (Figure 21). The water installations were protected from frost using an electric heating cable inserted in the water pipes in the animal house. Ordinary straw was used as bedding and it was handled in the form of big bales transported into the house using a tractor with a front loader (Figure 22). The dung from the animal house was managed both as solid and liquid manure. The pens with deep straw bedding were cleaned using a front loader once per batch, and the dung transported to an area for <b>solid</b> <b>dung</b> located near the animal house. The pens which had slanted floors were kept clean via the activity of the animals. Straw was distributed to the lying area and much of the straw carried out to the pen floor. Due to the animals’ activity it ended up in the dung area (10 % slant) {{at the lower end of}} the pen. There it was mixed with the dung and pressed down by the pigs through an opening between the floor and the pen wall (Figure 23). A dung alley/channel with concrete slats connected all the pens (Figure 24), and it was scraped daily using a cable driven scraper (Figure 25). The dung was moved to a pump well and then pumped over to a storage container. The manure was mixed before pumping by pumping it around (Figure 7) the dung channel on the outside area. During the planning phase for the animal house, many calculations for the use of feed, water, straw and as well as the quantities of dung and urine which would be produced were carried out (Table 1) An estimation of the building costs was carried out with the help of the data for cost estimation for farm production buildings obtained from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Table 8). The present calculation was based on the prices for 2002, and the estimated cost for the animal house was 1, 465, 000 SKK, or 11, 450 SKK per pig place. The building area per pig was 3. 9 m 2 including the service areas. The cost of the manure containers and straw storage was not included in this estimation. The size of the pasture areas was calculated and consideration was taken to the recommendations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus loading (Tables 2 – 5) per ha for pigs on pasture. An estimation was made of the amount of the produced manure which would remain in the house or be on the outside areas. For 4 of the 8 pens (Figure 26) fenced lots were made (Figure 28) which the pigs had access to in the summer months. Special transport alleys (Figure 27) out to these lots were also built to maintain a good longevity for these hard used areas. The pasture lots were established with a wide range of grasses (Table 6) which were completed later with more diverse species (Table 7) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{diode array}} near {{infrared}} (NIR) spectrometer {{that can be}} mounted on a mobile agricultural machine was tested under lab conditions for its effectiveness as a rapid, on-site hog (Sus domesticus) manure composition sensor. One hundred and sixty nine diverse hog manures, collected from farms {{in the northern part}} of Belgium, were assayed by conventional wet chemical analysis and spectroscopy for the following constituents: dry matter content, organic matter content, pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, calcium, sodium and magnesium. Samples were scanned (two fills, three measurements each) on a Zeiss Corona 1. 7 VisNIR diode array instrument equipped with an OMK measuring head, ranging between 400 and 1700 nm (five scans per measurement) using a sample cell (50 mm diameter) for diffuse reflectance scanning from the bottom. Based on the absorbance-constituent and constituent-constituent correlations, the constituents were divided into two groups: one for those in the <b>solids</b> (<b>dung)</b> and one for those in the liquid (urine). The pH was not correlated to any other constituent and, therefore, treated separately. Partial least squares calibrations were developed for the constituent groups and for each of the constituents separately using leave-one-out cross-validation, showing a common spectral basis for each constituent group. To investigate the possibility of developing a cost-effective sensor, regression calibrations were developed using a few wavelengths selected based on the partial least squares regression and validated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results demonstrated that: (1) approximate quantitative predictions can be made for total N, NH 4 -N and K, (2) a discrimination between high and low values can be made for DM, OM, P and Mg, (3) prediction of Ca, Na and pH are not possible (yet), (4) one measurement and one filling of the cup give a reliable measurement, (5) a cost-effective sensor measuring only a few appropriately selected wavelengths might be able to give comparable results, (6) further work will be necessary to optimise sample presentation and calibration procedures and (7) mounting a diode array instrument on a slurry tanker can make environmentally and economically sound nutrient management possible. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|More than 2 {{billion people}} {{worldwide}} rely on <b>solid</b> fuels—wood, <b>dung,</b> crop residues, or coal— and traditional stoves or open fires for cooking, lighting, and, in colder climates, heating. Exposure to the emissions caused by burning these fuels {{is believed to}} be responsible for a significant share of the global burden of disease. To achieve wide-spread health improvements, interventions that reduce exposures to indoor air pollution will need to be adopted by large numbers of households in the developing world. Households can be expected to adopt a new technology, such as an improved stove, if the perceived benefits of adoption are greater than the costs. While the physical impacts of adopting an improved stove, such as reduced emissions or improved fuel efficiency, can be observed directly, the value in monetary terms to the household of the physical changes is less evident. Yet it is essential to estimate the monetary values if we are to assess the household-level benefits of potential interventions, compare them to the costs, and thereby understand household incentives to adopt the interventions and identify policies to support adoption. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop an approach for identifying the benefits to households o...|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] Household use of {{unprocessed}} <b>solid</b> fuels (wood, <b>dung,</b> crop residues/grasses, and coal) for cooking and heating exposes large proportions of people in developing countries {{to high levels of}} toxic air pollutants indoors. Indoor smoke contains some of the same pollutants found in tobacco smoke and in ambient air, which have been linked with serious health consequences. There is growing evidence that exposure to indoor smoke can cause serious respiratory and other adverse health effects, but {{the quantity and quality of}} scientific literature vary considerably by type of health outcome. There is compelling evidence linking indoor smoke to acute respiratory infections in children and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis in women. But, the evidence linking indoor smoke to asthma, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited and sometimes conflicting; and evidence linking indoor smoke to cataract and blindness, otitis media, lung fibrosis, and cardiovascular disease is weak or nonexistent. Many of the studies use indirect measures of smoke exposure and reported measures of health outcomes, do not adequately account for confounding and interactions, and few address gender aspects of smoke exposure and its health effects. Differences in gender roles result in differential exposures to indoor smoke among males and females; and gender differences in nutritional status, treatment, and care result in differential effects of these exposures. Moreover, there are biological and genetic differences between males and females that mediate the effects of smoke exposure on health. There is need to improve both the quality and quantity of research in this area, using better study designs, direct measures of smoke exposure, and clinical measures of health outcomes. To reduce exposures to indoor smoke, there is need to promote widespread use of cleaner fuels, provide improved cookstoves, and inform people about potential health risks, especially to women and young children...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} {{indicated}} that cow dung {{can be used as}} a potential substrate for alkaline protease production. Enzyme production by the B. subtilis strain VV was to the tune of 4030 [*]±[*] 128 U/g <b>solid</b> substrate (cow <b>dung)</b> after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C. The selection of a cheap substrate in SSF for the production of any metabolites is an important factor from an industrial point of view. Apart from the cost, the availability of the substrate is a critical factor. An ideal substrate is one which is available in large quantities and throughout the year too. Although many cheap agro-industrial residues were evaluated (Prakasham et al. 2006; Johnvesly et al. 2002;Gessesse 1997) for the production of alkaline proteases, the availability of these substrates is seasonal. Apart from agro-industrial wastes, more attention has been paid to the evaluation of solid wastes for the production of alkaline proteases (Ravindran et al. 2011; Ganesh Kumar et al. 2008). Waste water from the manufacture of shochu was also tried (Morimura et al. 1994) for production of proteases. In spite of evaluating these substrates, the search for a novel substrate continues. Recently, we used cow dung as a substrate for the production of a halo-tolerant alkaline protease using a alkalophilic isolate, Halomonas sp. PV 1 (Vijayaraghavan and Vincent 2012). Of all the alkalophilic microorganisms that have been screened for use in various industrial applications, members of the genus Bacillus were found to be predominant and a prolific source of alkaline proteases (Kumar and Takagi 1999). Reports on SSF of cow dung for the production of alkaline protease using Bacillus sp. are limited or perhaps not available. Hence, the present investigation aimed to exploit cow dung that is cheap and globally available for alkaline protease production by Bacillus subtilis. The protein content of the cow dung medium was evaluated before and after fermentation. The cow dung possessed 80 [*]±[*] 12 mg protein/g solid substrate, and the organism utilized 40 [*]±[*] 4.5 % of the protein content for the growth and synthesis of protease.|$|R
