Both are left aligned to correspond with the each appendix entry, but only the addendum is separated from the preceding text (Note F) by a sizeable line break. It is also marked by a <b>spacer</b> <b>bar.</b> The first and second parts of the colophon have double line breaks to separate them from the preceding section, while {{the second part of}} the colophon also has a <b>spacer</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} factor on a jig grinder is the dual-spindle configuration. The main spindle is roughly positioned with between 1" [...] or 2" [...] of travel for setup, and then the [...]100" [...] of outfeed is used during machine operation to outfeed into the work. A <b>spacer</b> <b>bar</b> may be used between the grinder and main spindle, allowing large (9" [...] radius or larger) work to be completed. The main spindle has {{a wide range of}} speeds to ensure proper grinder feed rates are maintained.|$|E
5000|$|A warm edge or thermal spacer {{is a type}} of <b>spacer</b> <b>bar</b> used in {{insulated}} {{glazing in}} windows. It separated the panes of glass in double or triple glazing and seals off the air cavity between each. Modern spacers are generally made from vinyl (uPVC) or high-grade steel which both have better insulation properties than other materials. The resulting spacer system {{is often referred to as}} a “warm edge.” It is sometimes generally referred to, particularly in Europe, by the brand [...] "Swiss Spacer." [...] In the past, these spacer bars were often made of aluminum which allowed heat transfer through the window which led to both heat loss and condensation.|$|E
25|$|New {{technology}} has emerged {{to combat the}} heat loss from traditional <b>spacer</b> <b>bars,</b> including improvements to the structural performance and long-term-durability of improved metal (aluminum with a thermal barrier) and foam spacers.|$|R

40|$|A {{hexagonal}} protective {{and high}} temperature resistant system for the Space Shuttle Orbiter consists of a multiplicity of pockets formed by hexagonally oriented <b>spacer</b> <b>bars</b> secured on the vehicle substructure. A packing of low density insulating batt material 18 in each pocket, and a thin protective panel of laterally resilient advanced carbon-carbon material surmounting the peripherals bars and packing. Each panel has three stepped or offset lips on contiguous edges. At {{the center of each}} pocket is a fully insulated stanchion secured to and connecting the substructure and panel for flexing the panel toward the substructure and thereby prestressing the panel and forcing the panel edges firmly against the <b>spacer</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Breakage due to {{thermal stress}} is {{most common in}} large pieces of sealed {{insulating}} glass with heavy heat-absorbing (reflective) coatings. The coating is usually applied to the [...] "number two" [...] surface (the inside face of the outside lite). This causes the outside lite of glass to heat up more than the inside lite as the coating converts radiant heat from the Sun into sensible heat. As the outer lite expands due to heating, the entire unit bends outward. If the <b>spacer</b> <b>bar</b> or other edge condition connects the two lites of glass in a very rigid manner, bending stresses can develop which exceed {{the strength of the}} glass, causing breakage. This was the cause of extensive glass breakage at the John Hancock Tower in Boston.|$|E

50|$|Concrete <b>spacers</b> and <b>bar</b> {{supports}} {{are made}} of the same material as the poured concrete, so {{thermal expansion and contraction}} are equal. And because they are the same material, the concrete and spacers will bond. No gaps! Concrete <b>spacers</b> and <b>bar</b> supports help maintain material integrity and uniformity of the concrete, and provide a cover over the reinforcement that protects against corrosion.|$|R
5000|$|Plastic <b>spacers</b> and <b>bar</b> {{supports}} do not bond {{well with}} concrete, therefore they are NOT compatible materials. Much of this compatibility is explained through a single phrase : Plastic has mechanical (holds {{the bar in}} position) but NO structural properties (always will remain a foreign element within the construction). But why is that? Well here is a detailed explanation of this affirmation: ...|$|R
50|$|The main coil is {{the outer}} part of the line trap which is made from {{stranded}} aluminum cable. The reactor coil, depending on the device, {{can be made up}} of several aluminum wires, allowing equal distribution amongst the parallel wires. The stranded aluminum coil is wound in one layer. However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a cooling duct between them to avoid overheating. The cooling duct is created with <b>spacer</b> <b>bars</b> made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides a low impedance path for the electricity flow. Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a line trap must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a line trap unit is inserted between the busbar and connection of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and high impedance to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{environmental}} and economic factors, biodiesel has been introduced to partially replace the diminishing stock of petroleum-based fuel. However, the use of biodiesel such as palm biodiesel is placing additional demands on automotive components, e. g. rubber components, due to a compatibility issue in the fuel system. In engineering applications where hostile environments are involved, the long-term mechanical response of rubber components is affected by interactions existed between diffusion of liquids into the material and fluctuating multiaxial loading. Hence, {{it is crucial to}} investigate the durability of rubber components in this aggressive environment. A number of studies on static immersion tests to investigate the diffusion of liquids in stress-free rubber {{can be found in the}} literature. However, studies focusing on the coupling between diffusion and large deformation in rubber, and the resulting swelling and mechanical response under cyclic loading conditions are less common. In the present work, a compression device for the investigation of interaction between diffusion of palm biodiesel and large compressive strain in rubber is developed. The apparatus is comprised of four rectangular stainless steel plates with <b>spacer</b> <b>bars</b> in between, which are designed such that pre-compression can be introduced on the rubber specimens while they are immersed into biodiesel. This allows diffusion and large strain to take place simultaneously. Different pre-compressive strains and biodiesel blends are considered. At the end of each immersion period, the resulting swelling behavior and mechanical response of rubber specimens under cyclic loading conditions are investigated. The features of this compression device are discussed and perspectives are drawn. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The MC {{portion of}} the MH module was stacked using the copper buttons as <b>spacers.</b> Stainless steel <b>bars</b> {{measuring}} 3 -inch wide by 1 / 8 -inch thick were welded along all the corner edges, except the outer radius edges, where the bars were bolted to plates 1, 2, 13 and 14. The buttons were then knocked out. Nine strain gauge rosettes were mounted on the model. Three rosettes were placed at various locations on along the bottom or inner radius side. Each rosette was centered in a gap between two absorber plates. The same pattern was duplicated on the opposite side. In addition, two rosettes {{were placed on the}} top stainless straps that were bolted down. One rosette was placed on each side, located {{in the center of the}} strap and the center of the model. The last rosette was placed on the bottom or inner radius of the model, in the first gap. The included graphs plot stress intensity versus load applied for each of the nine rosetts, and for all three load cases. The stress curves are linear in all cases, except for the rosettes mounted on the unwelded straps, where buckling did occur. The maximum stress occurring in the model was between plate 14 and the ground plate on the side near the inner radius. Maximum allowable bending stress for 304 stainless is 18000 psi. Maximum stress seen by the model in this test is 13, 554 psi, which represents a 25 % overload condition. Deflection curves are linear as well, and all three cases are nearly identical. Gap measurements taken before loading and at 5000 lbs, and 10000 lbs, showed no appreciable difference...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement <b>spacers</b> (i. e. <b>bar</b> supports, chairs) {{are crucial}} {{elements}} of reinforced concrete, but {{their influence on}} the microstructure and long-term durability is not clear. This study investigates the effect caused by plastic and cementitious spacers, and steel wire chairs combined with different aggregate sizes, curing and conditioning regimes on the transport properties, microstructure and chloride-induced corrosion of concrete structures. Concrete cylindrical samples were prepared with 25 and 50 mm high plastic, steel and cementitious spacers. Samples were then cured, conditioned and tested for oxygen diffusivity, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity and chloride diffusivity. Selected samples were pressure impregnated with fluorescent epoxy to study the extent and spatial distribution of epoxy intrusion. The interfacial zone between the spacer and concrete was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscope in the backscattered electron (BSE) mode. The ingress of chloride, particularly near the interface between spacers and concrete matrix was studied using micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF). The effect of plastic and cementitious spacers on chloride- induced corrosion via capillary rise and cyclic wetting/drying was investigated using small reinforced concrete beams. The feasibility of improving the bond between spacer and concrete by increasing surface roughness of plastic spacers was also investigated. Results show that concrete samples containing plastic spacers consistently gave the least resistance to transport and the highest epoxy penetration followed by samples with cementitious spacers, and then steel spacers. The control samples (samples without spacers) had the highest resistance to transport in all cases. The epoxy penetration occurred mainly through the spacer-concrete interface. The microstructure of the spacer-concrete interface showed significantly lower cement content and higher porosity compared to 'bulk paste' farther away form the interface. Higher penetration of chloride ions was detected along spacer-concrete interface compared to the control sample or the bulk paste farther away. It is evident that spacers initiate early corrosion and this may reduce the service-life of reinforced concrete structures. The implications of these findings on durability of concrete structures are discussed. Several recommendations to improve the bond at the interface between spacer and concrete are presented.
