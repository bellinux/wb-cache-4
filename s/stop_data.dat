5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic <b>stop</b> <b>data.</b> The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{we propose}} a fast {{reconfiguration}} alternative {{that can be}} used when only a few nodes fail at about the same time. Also, depending on the number of nodes that become disconnected when one or more CHs break down, we offer the option of <b>stopping</b> <b>data</b> transmission during reconfiguration or continuing to gather the data generated by the sensor nodes that remain connected. We analyze these different reconfiguration alternatives and provide guidelines {{that can be used}} for the sink to decide when to choose one option over the others.|$|R

It was also explained that the reconfiguration procedure does not necessarily have to be complete, {{but it can be}} sped up using the routing information collected previously and by going straight into the reservation phase (fast). Given the expected time to carry it out and the amount of data that may be lost if reconfiguration is due to node failures, we analyze the conditions under which it is better to perform a complete or a fast reconfiguration, using only the otherwise unused time or <b>stopping</b> <b>data</b> to run an exclusive reconfiguration.|$|R
50|$|Schiaparelli module has 3 sets {{of three}} thrusters, nine total, that operate {{starting}} at about 1 km (half a mile) up in pulse mode, slowing the spacecraft from 70 m/s (252 km/h) to 4 m/s (14 km/h). Each {{of the nine}} engines is a CHT-400 rocket engine that can produce 400 Newtons of thrust.These rocket engines are fueled by three spherical 17.5 liter tanks holding hydrazine propellant. The tanks hold about 15-16 kilograms of hydrazine (about 34 pounds, 2.4 stones) of fuel per tank, or 46 kg overall (101 pounds or 7.24 stones). The propellant is pressurized by helium, held in a single tank containing 15.6 liters at a pressure of 170 bar (2465 psi). The thrusters shut down 1-2 meters/yards from the surface, after which the crumple zone underneath the lander handles the final <b>stop.</b> <b>Data</b> from a timer, doppler radar, and inertial measurement unit are merged in the lander's computers to control {{the operation of the}} thrusters.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{questionable}} research practices (QRPs) {{have been}} identified as common in the field. [...] Such practices, while not intentionally fraudulent, involve capitalizing on the gray area of acceptable scientific practices or exploiting flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting, often in an effort to obtain a desired outcome. Examples of QRPs include selective reporting or partial publication of data (reporting only some of the study conditions or collected dependent measures in a publication), optional stopping (choosing when to <b>stop</b> <b>data</b> collection, often based on statistical significance of tests), p-value rounding (rounding p-values down to [...]05 to suggest statistical significance), file drawer effect (nonpublication of data), post-hoc storytelling (framing exploratory analyses as confirmatory analyses), and manipulation of outliers (either removing outliers or leaving outliers in a dataset to cause a statistical test to be significant). A survey of over 2,000 psychologists indicated that a majority of respondents admitted to using at least one QRP. False positive conclusions, often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author's own confirmation bias, are an inherent hazard in the field, requiring a certain degree of skepticism on the part of readers.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{changing}} of rollsign/blind displays, through electronic control, has been possible {{since at least}} the 1970s, but is an option that primarily has been used on rail systems - where a metro train or articulated tram can have several separate signboxes each - and only infrequently on buses, where it is comparatively easy for the driver to change the display. These signs are controlled by a computer through an interface in the driver's cabin. Barcodes are printed on the reverse of the blind, and as the computer rolls the blind an optical sensor reads the barcodes until reaching the code for the requested display. The on-board computer is normally programmed with information on the order of the displays, and can be programmed using the non-volatile memory should the blind/roll be changed. Although these sign systems are normally accurate, over time the blind becomes dirty and the computer {{may not be able to}} read the markings well, leading occasionally to incorrect displays. For buses, this disadvantage is outweighed by the need (compared to manual) to change each destination separately; if changing routes, this could be up to seven different blinds. Automatic-setting rollsigns are common on many light rail and subway/metro systems in North America. Most Transport for London buses use a standard system with up & down buttons to change the destination shown on the blinds & a manual override using a crank. The blind system is integrated with a system controlling announcements & passenger information, which uses satellites to download <b>stop</b> <b>data</b> in a sequential order. It uses GPS to determine that a bus has departed a stop, and announce the next stop.|$|E
30|$|If several nodes (e.g. 3 or more) fail roughly at {{the same}} time, {{it may not be}} prudent to run a fast {{reconfiguration}} since the routing information stored at the sensor nodes may need to be updated to reflect the new topology. If that is the case, a complete reconfiguration is advisable, but the sink still has to decide if <b>stopping</b> <b>data</b> transmission from all nodes during the time needed to run an exclusive reconfiguration would cause more/less data losses than running a normal reconfiguration losing the data generated only by the disconnected nodes during a longer time.|$|R

30|$|The Superframe {{structure}} of Low-delay Traffic-adaptive Medium Access Control (LTDA-MAC) [15] comprises of a beacon, fixed CAP, CFP, extended dynamic CFP and inactive sleep state. At {{the beginning of}} communication, the body coordinator broadcasts a beacon to all nodes in the network for clocks synchronization. During a channel allocation period, each node competes for a slot in the fixed CAP period along with the requesting of dynamic CFP slot from a body coordinator. The body coordinator allocates the fixed CFP and extended CFP slots to those nodes who gets a channel access in the fixed CAP slot. The limitation of this scheme is that the body coordinator transmits a notification alert to all nodes for <b>stopping</b> <b>data</b> transmission. With this <b>stopping</b> of <b>data,</b> the throughput of the MAC is reduced {{in the terms of}} a higher dropping of a patient’s data, a higher delay, and re-transmission of the dropped packet which consumes a higher energy of nodes. Thus, these issues badly reduce the performance of MAC protocol which cannot allocate the slots to emergency data in an appropriate time.|$|R

40|$|Racial profiling, or the {{practice}} of using race, ethnicity, or other racially based characteristics to decide when to stop, cite, or search drivers, has been studied and analyzed by researchers for decades. Attempts {{have been made to}} gain an understanding of why officers commit acts of racial profiling and to identify different evaluation methods that allow for accurate analysis of racial profiling data. This study attempts to create a new method of evaluation by utilizing the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) as a benchmark for racial profiling data. Variables from the CTPP are used to create estimates of the transient travel population, or driving population. Using traffic <b>stop</b> <b>data</b> from the North Carolina State Highway Patrol (NCSHP), analyses are conducted to evaluate whether the CTPP can be utilized to accurately benchmark traffic <b>stop</b> <b>data.</b> An assessment is also conducted to determine whether there is any evidence of racial profiling by the NCSHP. The results of this research show not only that the CTPP can be utilized to efficiently and accurately benchmark traffic <b>stop</b> <b>data,</b> but also that the prior method of utilizing basic Census statistics severely underestimates racial profiling. Evidence is also produced to show that several counties in North Carolina were subject to racial profiling by the NCSHP...|$|E
