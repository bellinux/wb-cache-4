5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over <b>scientific</b> <b>advice.</b> In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) {{provides}} <b>scientific</b> <b>advice</b> for {{organizations and}} the public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, {{most of whom are}} children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.|$|E

Johnson promised the 540 Bikini Atoll family members living on Kili and other islands {{that they would}} be able to return to their home. The Atomic Energy Commission cleared radioactive debris from the island, and the U.S. Trust Territory was in charge of rebuilding structures and replanting crops on the atoll. But shortly afterward the Trust Territory ended regular air flights between Kwajalein Atoll and Bikini Atoll which seriously impeded progress. Coconut trees were finally replanted in 1972, but the AEC learned that the coconut crabs retained high levels of radioactivity and could not be eaten. The Bikini Council voted to delay a return the island as a result.|$|E

In the Canadian system however under the 2002 Species at Risk Act the ultimate determination of conservation status (e.g. endangered) is a political, cabinet-level decision; Cabinet decided to not accept COSEWIC's 2003 recommendations. Bell has explained how both COSEWIC and public perceptions were manipulated, and the governing law broken, to favour that decision. In 2005 the WWF-Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on cod fishing on the Grand Banks, {{in the form of}} bycatch and of poor enforcement of the restrictions by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide <b>scientific</b> <b>advice</b> and management of fisheries in the northwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Robert P. Crease, a colleague of Marburger at Stony Brook University, characterized him as someone who [...] " [...] to the White House as a scientist, not an advocate. He refused to weigh in on high-profile, politically controversial issues, but instead set about fixing broken connections in the unwieldy machinery by which the government approves and funds scientific projects.... Some bitterly criticized him for collaborating with the Bush administration. But he left the office running better than when he entered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huhne {{was an avid}} {{supporter}} of Professor David Nutt after he was dismissed by Home Secretary Alan Johnson {{as chairman of the}} Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in November 2009. Nutt had criticised the government's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug rather than keeping it as a class C. Huhne said the decision to sack Nutt was [...] "disgraceful" [...] and commented: [...] "what is the point of having independent <b>scientific</b> <b>advice</b> if {{as soon as you get}} some advice that you don't like, you sack the person who has given it to you?". Attacking the government, he said that if they did not want to take expert <b>scientific</b> <b>advice</b> they might as well have a [...] "committee of tabloid newspaper editors to advise on drugs policy". Cannabis had been re-classified as a class C drug in 2004 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett, only for Jacqui Smith to reverse the ruling in 2008, a decision taken despite official advisers recommending against it.|$|E

2500|$|Because Prince William Sound {{contained}} many rocky coves {{where the}} oil collected, {{the decision was}} made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil. [...] At the time, both <b>scientific</b> <b>advice</b> and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the Exxon Valdez spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than [...] of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.|$|E

A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with [...] "acute psychotic episodes", [...] "chronic liver disease" [...] and family breakdown.

Methods: Test papers of 721 copies of traditional Chinese medical qualification examination (practical skills examination) were collected from the examination district of Shanghai in 2009. The papers were analyzed by using the principle and method of teaching statistics. The difficulty and reliability coefficients, discrimination and scores were evaluated. Results: The reliability coefficient of the paper was 0. 527, the difficulty coefficients of different parts differed from 0. 582 to 0. 828 and the discrimination ranged from 0. 401 to 0. 753. The average score was 75. 519 with the standard deviation of 11. 073. The examinees had high scores in Chinese medicine training, including acupoint location and methods of acupuncture and moxibustion, but low scores in practice and display of Western medicine. Conclusion: The reliability coefficient, discrimination and the difficulty are all preferable.
