25|$|In general, illegal {{immigrants}} from Mexico and Central America come {{for economic reasons}}, but also sometimes due to political oppression. From Asia, they come for economic reasons but some come involuntarily as indentured servants or sex slaves. From Sub-Saharan Africa, they come for economic activities and there is <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> of slave trade. From Eastern Europe, they come for economic activities and to rejoin family already in the United States. However, {{there are also some}} who come involuntarily who work in the sex industry.|$|E
25|$|In May 1915, Clarke and MacDermott {{established}} a Military Committee or Military Council within the IRB, consisting of Pearse, Plunkett and Ceannt, {{to draw up}} plans for a rising. Clarke and MacDermott joined it shortly after. The Military Council was able to promote its own policies and personnel independently of both the Volunteer Executive and the IRB Executive. Although the Volunteer and IRB leaders were not against a rising in principle, they were {{of the opinion that}} it was not opportune at that moment. Volunteer Chief-of-Staff Eoin MacNeill supported a rising only if the British government attempted to suppress the Volunteers or introduce conscription, and if such a rising had <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> of success. IRB President Denis McCullough and prominent IRB member Bulmer Hobson held similar views. The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.|$|E

500|$|In early April, polls gave Nixon <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> {{of winning}} the Democratic primary, which would mean his {{election}} was secured. He sent out mailings to Democratic voters. Boddy attacked Nixon for the mailings; Nixon responded that Democratic voters should {{have the opportunity to}} express no confidence in the Truman administration by voting for a Republican. [...] "Democrats for Nixon", a group affiliated with Nixon's campaign, asked Democratic voters [...] "as one Democrat to another" [...] to vote for the congressman, sending out flyers which did not mention his political affiliation. Boddy quickly struck back in his paper, accusing Nixon of misrepresenting himself as a Democrat. A large ad in the same issue by the [...] "Veterans Democratic Committee" [...] warned Democratic voters that Nixon was actually a Republican and referred to {{him for the first time}} as [...] "Tricky Dick". The exchange benefited neither Nixon nor Boddy; Douglas won the primary on June 6 and exceeded their combined vote total.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the legends}} {{that have grown}} up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least not for any reason {{connected}} with independence), as no public announcement {{was made of the}} Declaration of Independence. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, [...] "We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{six degrees}} of {{separation}} concept was examined Milgram's 1967 [...] "small world experiment" [...] that tracked chains of acquaintances in the United States. In the experiment, Milgram sent several packages to 160 random people living in Omaha, Nebraska, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a set final individual, a stockbroker from Boston, Massachusetts. Each [...] "starter" [...] received instructions to mail a folder via the U.S. Post Office to a recipient, but with some rules. Starters could only mail the folder to someone they actually knew personally on a first-name basis.

2500|$|Since 1990, Don Essig, the stadium's PA {{announcer}} since 1968, {{has declared}} that [...] "It never rains at Autzen Stadium" [...] before each home game {{as the crowd}} chants along in unison. He often prefaces it with the local weather forecast, which quite often includes <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> of showers, but reminds fans that [...] "we know the real forecast..." [...] or [...] "let's tell our friends from (visiting team name) the real forecast..." [...] If rain is actually falling before the game, Essig will often dismiss it as [...] "a light drizzle", or [...] "liquid sunshine" [...] but not actual rain by Oregon standards.

2500|$|In 1999 the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, {{sponsored}} {{in part by}} the TV show Nova and the BBC, and organised and led by Eric Simonson, {{arrived at}} Everest to search for the lost pair. Guided by the research of Jochen Hemmleb, within hours of beginning the search on 1 May, Conrad Anker found a frozen body at [...] on the north face of the mountain. As the body was found at , below where Irvine's axe had been found in 1933 at , the team expected the body to be Irvine's, and were hoping to recover the camera that he had reportedly carried with him. They were surprised to find that name tags on the body's clothing bore the name of [...] "G. Leigh Mallory." [...] The body was well preserved, due to the mountain's climate. A brass altimeter, stag-handled lambsfoot pocket knife with leather slip-case and an unbroken pair of snow-goggles were also recovered from Mallory's corpse. The team could not, however, locate the camera that the two climbers took to document their final summit attempt. Experts from Kodak have said that if a camera is ever found, there is <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> that its film could be developed to produce printable images, if extraordinary measures are taken, and have provided guidance as to handling of such a camera and the film inside, in the event that such were found in the investigation. Before leaving the site of Mallory's death, the expedition conducted an Anglican service for the climber and covered his remains with a cairn on the mountain.|$|E

2500|$|The F-86 was {{vulnerable}} to the diminutive Folland Gnat, nicknamed [...] "Sabre Slayer." [...] The Gnat is credited by many independent and Indian sources as having shot down seven Pakistani Canadair Sabres in the 1965 war. while two Gnats were downed by PAF fighters. The PAF's F-104 Starfighter of the PAF was the fastest fighter operating in the subcontinent {{at that time and}} was often referred to as [...] "the pride of the PAF". However, according to Sajjad Haider, the F-104 did not deserve this reputation. Being [...] "a high level interceptor designed to neutralise Soviet strategic bombers in altitudes above 40,000 feet," [...] rather than engage in dogfights with agile fighters at low altitudes, it was [...] "unsuited to the tactical environment of the region." [...] In combat the Starfighter was not as effective as the IAF's far more agile, albeit much slower, Folland Gnat fighter. Yet it zoomed into an ongoing dogfight between Sabres and Gnats, at supersonic speed, successfully broke off the fight and caused the Gnats to egress. An IAF Gnat, piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, landed at an abandoned Pakistani airstrip at Pasrur and was captured by the Pakistan Army. The pilot claimed that most of his equipment failed and even if he could get <b>some</b> <b>chance</b> on that, the Starfighters snuffed it. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. Sqn Ldr Saad Hatmi who flew the captured aircraft to Sargodha, and later tested and evaluated its flight performance, was of view that Gnat was no [...] "Sabre Slayer" [...] when it came to dog fighting. The Pakistan Air Force had fought well in countering the much large Indian Air Force and supported the ground forces.|$|E
