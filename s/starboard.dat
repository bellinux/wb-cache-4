5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the <b>starboard</b> side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the <b>starboard</b> side is present, but {{severely}} compacted.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to <b>starboard</b> and climbed slightly, during which the <b>starboard</b> wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the <b>starboard</b> wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} the He 111Z had the pilot and his {{controls}} in the port fuselage only. The controls themselves and essential equipment were all that remained in the <b>starboard</b> section. The aircraft had a crew of seven; a pilot, first mechanic, radio operator and gunner in the port fuselage, and the observer, second mechanic and gunner in the <b>starboard</b> fuselage.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's <b>starboard</b> wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second <b>starboard</b> engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to <b>starboard.</b> It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The <b>starboard</b> battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the <b>starboard</b> quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the <b>starboard</b> side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's <b>starboard</b> side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the <b>starboard</b> anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the <b>starboard</b> side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the <b>starboard</b> wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the <b>starboard</b> wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the <b>starboard</b> wing caught on fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} most {{damaging}} attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded {{on the port}} side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a <b>starboard</b> turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the <b>starboard</b> outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the <b>starboard</b> side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining <b>starboard</b> lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One <b>starboard</b> lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second <b>starboard</b> lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Glorious was hit {{again in}} the centre engine room at 17:20 and this caused her to lose speed and {{commence}} a slow circle to port. She also developed a list to <b>starboard.</b> The German ships closed to within 16,000 yards and continued to fire at her until 17:40. Glorious sank at 18:10, approximately at , with 43 survivors.|$|E
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor {{for the rest of the}} day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the <b>starboard</b> forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second funnels. Two minutes later, she began to list to <b>starboard</b> and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|E
5|$|The German {{heavy cruiser}} , ship #36, survived both the Able and Baker tests but was too {{radioactive}} to have leaks repaired. In September 1946 she was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she capsized {{in shallow water}} on December 22, 1946, five months after Baker. She remains there today, with <b>starboard</b> propeller blades in the air.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Department {{conducted}} an international design competition for Texas {{and the winner}} was the Naval Construction & Armaments Co. of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The winning design placed Texass forward turret {{on the port side}} and her aft turret to <b>starboard.</b> The need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure. This significantly limited the gun's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun's arc of fire. Furthermore, neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired, as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her <b>starboard</b> deck was damaged.|$|E
5|$|The tender Daisy 2, skippered by John Gatt, {{had been}} tied {{up for the}} night to Royal Oaks port side. As the sinking {{battleship}} began to list to <b>starboard,</b> Gatt ordered Daisy 2 to be cut loose, his vessel becoming briefly caught on Royal Oaks rising anti-torpedo bulge and lifted from the sea before freeing herself.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} way to New York, West Gate took on 6,700 tons of cargo that {{included}} locomotives, steel rails, and other materiel for the United States Army and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June. The ship soon developed engine trouble and {{dropped out of the}} convoy to head to St. John's, Newfoundland, for repairs. While headed to St. John's in moderate seas under a cloudy sky, West Gate was attacked by two German submarines at 19:15 on 3 July. One U-boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship, crossing to <b>starboard.</b> As West Gate quickly turned to port to evade the U-boat, a second U-boat surfaced one point to <b>starboard.</b> While West Gates radio operator sent out a preemptive SOS, her gunners opened fire on the two submarines. Though her gunners made hits on neither boat, both were bracketed with fire, quickly submerged, and apparently departed the scene. West Gate arrived at St. John's at 18:00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels.|$|E
5|$|Although the Vietnam Service Medal is a {{personal}} service award, it is permissible and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the port and <b>starboard</b> bridge wings. Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975.|$|E
5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} <b>starboard</b> to close range. Neither ship was in good {{fighting}} trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the <b>starboard</b> bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to <b>starboard.</b> As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to <b>starboard</b> and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|At about 02:30, crewmen aboard Tubantia {{spotted a}} stream of bubbles rapidly {{approaching}} the ship's <b>starboard</b> side, followed by an explosion. The ship quickly began sinking. Distress calls sent out by Tubantia were answered by three ships, Breda, Krakstau, and La Campine, which between them rescued all 80 passengers and all 294 members of the crew. The ship and her cargo were a total loss. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the entire war.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have {{inherent}} lists to <b>starboard</b> when under combat loads that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship's only junior {{officer to}} {{have died in the}} sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown {{following}} Mr. Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the <b>starboard</b> side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.|$|E
5|$|Following the operation, Seydlitz and {{the other}} heavy units of the High Seas Fleet {{returned}} to the North Sea. On 11–12 September, Seydlitz {{and the rest of}} the I Scouting Group covered a minefield laying operation off Terschelling. On 24 November, the ship ran aground in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, but was quickly refloated. On 4 December, while exiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, Seydlitz became entangled in one of the net barriers. Divers had to remove the tangled nets from the <b>starboard</b> screws.|$|E
5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns. The two controlling the port-side guns were adjacent to their guns while the <b>starboard</b> {{directors were}} mounted fore and aft on the island. They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the <b>starboard</b> side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In late February 1944, Scherf {{took part}} in a sortie over Axis {{occupied}} territory with Squadron Leader Howie Clevelend; Scherf flew the leading aircraft of the two. The pair attacked an Axis airfield at St Yan, France, and successfully destroyed three aircraft on the ground. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a Heinkel He 111Z twin-fuselage glider tug towing two Gotha Go 242 gliders. Scherf and Clevelend attacked the party, with Clevelend firing first and destroying one of the gliders. Scherf then destroyed the second glider, before the pair assaulted the Heinkel. In the first pass, Scherf set the <b>starboard</b> engine ablaze while Clevelend hit the <b>starboard</b> side. Scherf made a second firing pass, before the Heinkel spiralled to the ground with three of its five engines on fire. This action was Scherf's final sortie of his tour. The pair were credited with shooting down three aircraft in this operation, with an additional three others damaged or destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the <b>starboard</b> side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the <b>starboard</b> bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the <b>starboard</b> quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{service is}} commemorated with a stained-glass {{window at the}} Garden Island Naval Chapel. One of the ship's anchors is {{incorporated}} into a memorial to naval aviation at Nowra, New South Wales. Another anchor and the <b>starboard</b> side ship's bell are {{on display at the}} RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island. Memorabilia from Melbournes voyages with the Fleet Air Arm embarked, and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on Melbourne, are on permanent static display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at HMAS Albatross.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the <b>starboard</b> gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The <b>starboard</b> wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1917, while {{performing}} trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup, {{believed to have}} been N6453, successfully on board Furious, becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. On 7 August, he made one more successful landing in the same manner, but on his third attempt, in Pup N6452, the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the <b>starboard</b> bow, killing him. The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2013, British Airways Flight 34, a Boeing 747–436 G-BNLL, hit a {{building}} at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg after missing a turning on a taxiway. The <b>starboard</b> wing was severely damaged {{but there were}} no injuries amongst the crew or 189 passengers, however four members of ground staff were injured when the wing smashed into the building. The aircraft was officially withdrawn from service in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with Seydlitz in the lead, {{followed}} by Moltke, Derfflinger, and Blücher, {{along with the}} light cruisers Graudenz, Rostock, Stralsund, and Kolberg and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. Graudenz and Stralsund {{were assigned to the}} forward screen, while Kolberg and Rostock were assigned to the <b>starboard</b> and port, respectively. Each light cruiser had a half-flotilla of torpedo boats attached.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1970, coincidentally Coast Guard Day, {{the pair}} of cutters set out on what {{would prove to be}} their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts {{embarked}} for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, Point Marone was the target of a command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts. After the mine explosion, Point Marone listed to <b>starboard</b> but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. Point Marone suffered three shrapnel holes at the <b>starboard</b> waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the mess deck and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud. After patching and painting, Point Marone was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1983, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry {{collided}} with a KC-135A Tanker aircraft over Saudi Arabia during Operation ELF-1. Both aircraft were recovered back to Riyadh Air Base. The Tanker received substantial damage, with parts impact and loss of pressure, as well as shut down of the two <b>starboard</b> engines. The E-3 received severe damage with the partial loss of a left wing section.|$|E
