The Drivers' Championship has been won in the final race of the season 29 times in the 67 seasons it has been awarded. The earliest in a season that the Drivers' Championship has been clinched was in , when Michael Schumacher secured the title with six races remaining.|$|E

Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is {{laughing}} at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side}} of the girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Atchison {{submitted}} his {{script to}} the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences along with about 4,500 others, {{in hopes of}} winning the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. Atchison's script ended up being one of five scripts selected, and he won the grant. Editor Glenn Farr, then {{a member of the}} committee, offered to edit Atchison's film as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was finished. Producer Sid Ganis was also attracted to the story during the award presentation ceremony. Nancy Hult Ganis, Sid's wife who was interested in public education, encouraged him to follow through with the film.|$|E
5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|The Sirens and Ulysses {{was painted}} using an {{experimental}} technique, which {{caused it to}} begin to deteriorate as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was complete. It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty's work in 1849 and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and {{was placed in the}} gallery's archives. Restoration began on the work in 2003, and in 2010 the painting went on display in the Manchester Art Gallery, over 150 years after being consigned to storage.|$|E

5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened {{almost as}} <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> began, but the top riders {{in the general}} classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode conservatively, to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E

5|$|German {{infantry}} {{began to}} advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing {{to cross the}} front line as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> ended. They marched under the glow of massive searchlights, bouncing light off the clouds. The armor was located farther back, near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben {{to the east and}} north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station. They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I&R platoon. This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Girls {{wanted to}} become part of the {{movement}} almost as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E
5|$|In May 1798, {{the arrest}} {{of a number of}} the leaders of the United Irishmen {{provoked}} the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a widespread uprising across Ireland. The Rebellion took the British authorities by surprise, but the introduction of regular British Army troops rapidly defeated the Irish armies and the last resistance was brought to an end in September with the surrender of a small French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck. The French authorities had also been taken by surprise by the uprising, and were consequently unprepared: the forces they deployed were inadequate to face the much larger British armies operating in Ireland at the time. News of this defeat had still not reach the continent by October, when a second French invasion force set out. Closely watched by the Royal Navy as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> left Brest, the squadron was defeated on 12 October 1798 at the Battle of Tory Island: fewer than a third of the French ships returned to France.|$|E

5|$|Neville was {{keeper of}} the royal seal under the new king, Henry III (r. 1216–1272) from about 6 November 1218. He {{had been at the}} royal court since May 1218, and was given custody of the seal as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was made up. One of the first {{documents}} subsequently sealed was a declaration that no charters or other rights would be granted in perpetuity until Henry attained his majority. Neville was also vice-chancellor of England under the chancellorship of Richard Marsh, who had been elected as Bishop of Durham in 1217 and {{spent most of his time}} attending to ecclesiastical affairs in his northern diocese. In fact, if not in name, Neville was responsible for all the duties of the chancellorship, and he exercised most of the power of that office, although Marsh continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death in 1226. When instability threatened the royal government in May and June 1219 Neville was ordered by Pandulf, the papal legate, to remain in London with the Great Seal while a royal council was held at Gloucester. The council resulted in royal government coming under the control of Hubert de Burgh the Justiciar, Pandulf, and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1945, U-2336 left Larvik {{and headed}} out into the North Sea. On 7 May 1945, U-2336 sank the last Allied {{merchant}} ships to be lost to a German submarine in the war, when she torpedoed and sank the freighters Avondale Park and Sneland I (in order) off the Isle of May inside the Firth of Forth. The first of the two ships to be sunk was the Sneland I, which exploded as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was hit killing seven of her crew members, including the captain. Avondale Park was hit next, alarming the 28 man crew who believed that they had struck a mine. Avondale Park sank two minutes after being hit. Two crew members had been killed while the rest managed to enter a lifeboat or jump into the sea. U-2336 later returned to Kiel on 14 May 1945 and then transferred to Wilhelmshaven, Germany, where she was surrendered to the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E
