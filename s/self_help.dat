In an interview article for Alternative Press, Chamberlain and Gillespie {{confirmed that the}} band was reuniting.|$|E

25|$|In the West, {{the term}} is {{sometimes}} used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers' naiveté, particularly in certain tantra schools, <b>self</b> <b>help,</b> hippie and other new religious movements.|$|E

25|$|Apparently, {{the trouble}} started {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that the building was in need of repairs. Numerous fundraisers were held, including a benefit concert by Ozomatli. But they were not enough to cover the repairs necessary, which raised safety issues for <b>Self</b> <b>Help's</b> workers and liability concerns for the organization. There was the additional complication of the ownership of the building, which still belonged to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Self</b> <b>Help's</b> {{mission is}} to create and protect {{ownership}} and economic opportunity for all. Self-Help does this by providing responsible financial services, lending to small businesses and nonprofits, developing real estate and promoting fair financial practices. While Self-Help's work benefits communities of all kinds, {{the focus is on}} those who may be underserved by conventional lenders, including people of color, women, rural residents and low-wealth families and communities.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 the Day of the Dead Celebration {{had grown}} {{too large to}} be held in the <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> parking lot. The celebration was moved to its current {{location}} at East Los Angeles Civic Center on 3rd Street and Mednik Avenue.|$|E
25|$|A Day to Remember's third <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> Fest {{took place}} in San Bernardino on March 7, 2015. A Day to Remember did not perform, but they did produce the festival along with Fly South Music Group {{and a few other}} agencies.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, news {{became public}} that <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> {{had been sold}} by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The former owners, the Sisters of Saint Francis, said they asked the Archdiocese to {{facilitate}} {{the sale of the}} building. Sister Carol Snyder said it became untenable to support a venture that did not make money.|$|E
40|$|I {{argue for}} a pattern theory of self as a useful way to {{organize}} an interdisciplinary approach to discussions {{of what constitutes a}} self. According to the pattern theory, a self is constituted by a number of characteristic features or aspects that may include minimal embodied, minimal experiential, affective, intersubjective, psychological/cognitive, narrative, extended and situated aspects. A pattern theory of <b>self</b> <b>helps</b> to clarify various interpretations of self as compatible or commensurable instead of thinking them in opposition, and it helps to show how various aspects of self may be related across certain dimensions. I also suggest that a pattern theory of <b>self</b> can <b>help</b> to adjudicate (or at least map the differences) between the idea that the self correlates to self-referential processing in the cortical midline structures of the brain and other narrower or wider conceptions of self...|$|R

25|$|The {{families}} of the victims of the bomb created the Omagh Support and <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> Group after the bombing. The organisation is led by Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son, Aidan, was killed in the Omagh attack. Its web site provides over 5000 newspaper articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other information sources relating to the events leading up to and following the bombing as well as information about other terrorist attacks.|$|E
25|$|Lan Shi-de's older sister. She's {{a famous}} author of <b>self</b> <b>help</b> love books {{even though she}} is 32 years old and last of her friends not to be married. She starts dating Yan Kai but breaks up with him when he tells her he doesn't want to get married. She starts falling for Zheng Yu-xiang later on but is heart broken when she uncovers his scheme to exact revenge on her.|$|E
25|$|Several {{attempts}} were made by <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> to purchase the building and were rejected by the new owners. It not being financially feasible for the not-for-profit organization to continue paying rent, {{it was able to}} secure a new space and in March 2011 moved to 1300 East First Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033. The mosaic statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe was also transported to the new location.|$|E
50|$|Naho's {{friend who}} {{received}} a letter from her future <b>self</b> and <b>helps</b> the group keep Kakeru from dying. She teases Hagita about them being a couple and harasses him, to which he denies he likes her.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} this deck was created, the feminist {{movement}} was experiencing a surge in popularity. Women were empowering themselves {{in a variety of}} ways, but {{a great deal of attention}} was placed on feminist art and the relationships forged between the artist, the work, and the viewer. This time period is often viewed as one of the most progressive eras of feminist artwork. Although the mood of the 1970s was reported to be somewhat dark and uncertain, particularly in the Berkeley area where Vogel and Noble resided, the empowerment that many women gained through exploring their spirituality and artistic <b>selves</b> <b>helped</b> to push them through the decade.|$|R
5000|$|In the Ars Nova adaptation, she pursues Iona and {{the other}} Mental Models who she {{believes}} to be acting abnormally due to their contact with Gunzō singlemindedly. After the intense fight with Iona {{at the end of}} the series, Iona befriends her after she realizes that her previously solitary life was somehow sad and lonely. After which, she leaves the Fleet of Fog to explore the world and does not join the Blue Steel Fleet. In the Cadenza film, her reformed <b>self</b> <b>helps</b> to save I-401 and restore her systems from the Student Council Fleet. She then engages in a fight with her sister Hiei, allowing I-401 to deal with Musashi.|$|R
25|$|The former <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> {{building}} {{contained a}} gallery, Galería Otra Vez, a printing room, office, studio space for artists-in-residence, and storage areas in two stories. Today the exterior {{walls of the}} building are adorned with embedded ceramic pieces, mosaics, and murals. The large statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe that stood {{in the parking lot}} has been relocated to the new building. The mosaic work was done by the artist Eduardo Oropeza.|$|E
25|$|Insurers {{will often}} use {{insurance}} agents to initially market or underwrite their customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, {{meaning that they}} can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to improved and personalized service. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs etc.) to market their products.|$|E
25|$|Lady Birdwood became {{involved}} in campaigns against trade unions, setting up the Citizens Mutual Protection Society in the early 1970s, which launched a failed attempt to run a private postal service. She took {{a leading role in}} several far-right pressure groups, including the Immigration Control Association, Common Cause, the British League of Rights (of which she was General Secretary) and <b>Self</b> <b>Help,</b> the latter attempting, unsuccessfully, to charge Arthur Scargill with sedition.|$|E
50|$|Preksha {{meditation}} is {{the practice}} of purifying the emotions and conscious (chitta) and realizing the own <b>self.</b> It <b>helps</b> in leading a peaceful life and is a system of meditation for attitudinal change, behavioral modification and integrated development of personality.|$|R
3000|$|... “Sin” {{taxes are}} {{designed}} to induce people to make better personal health decisions. By raising {{the price of the}} unhealthy item, government can make the overconsumption of food more costly for today’s <b>self,</b> <b>helping</b> achieve what the individual’s long-term self would desire by decreasing the consumption of food today. O’Donoghue and Rabin (2003) discuss “optimal sin taxes” designed to correct self-control problems, using the specific example of overeating. They show that imposing seemingly large sin taxes on unhealthy items while lowering taxes on other items may not hurt rational consumers by much (relative to the optimal “Ramsey” taxes), {{and at the same time}} may create significant benefits for those who overconsume the unhealthy items due to self-control problems.|$|R
50|$|Today, St. Agnes {{offers an}} {{incredible}} education, fostering the uniqueness and individuality of each child. The Administration, Faculty and Staff dedicate them <b>self</b> to <b>helping</b> students achieve academic excellence with their commitment and experience. The total enrollment between grades K to 8 is 850 students.|$|R
25|$|The {{revival of}} the {{indigenous}} holiday Día de los Muertos {{was part of the}} Mexican-American reclamation of indigenous identity, an important social aspect of the Chicano Movement. <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> played an integral role in the holiday's revival in California. The first celebration was in 1974, and by 1978 it had become an event requiring $14,000 in funding. Today, the Day of the Dead is one of Los Angeles's major celebrations, and receives funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, among other sources.|$|E
25|$|At first, {{material}} support for <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> was scarce. Boccalero raised funds from Beverly Hills art enthusiasts and sought donations from art stores, museums, and Catholic organizations. In 1974, the artists realized {{that in order}} to accomplish their goal of creating a permanent home for a community arts center, they would need the support of major institutions such as the National Endowment for the Arts. Boccalero attended grant-writing workshops and hired professional administrative staff, including a bilingual office manager supplied by the American GI Forum's SER-Jobs for Progress.|$|E
25|$|Winston (Jeff Lumby) is {{the owner}} and sole {{employee}} of Rothschild's Sewage and Septic Sucking Services. Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. He is always seen wearing a hard hat, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually able to {{look on the bright}} side of things even in the face of certain disaster. He is also a fan of <b>self</b> <b>help</b> speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.|$|E
40|$|Everyone {{talks about}} their feelings, {{but what exactly}} are they? What are the {{distinguishing}} features of feelings, {{and how do they}} differ from emotions and affects? How do our feelings influence the kinds of people we are, and the sorts of communities and societies in which we live? In this wonderful short book, acclaimed author Stephen Frosh interrogates the terrain of feelings and asks how this ‘hidden’ dimension of the <b>self</b> <b>helps</b> shape our worlds. The book provides an accessible and thought-provoking introduction to the major debates around feelings in the modern world. Feelings is an accessible and engaging resource for students, academics, and indeed anyone with an interest in gaining a better understanding of this fundamental area of life...|$|R

50|$|On {{examining}} the passport Ben discovers that it conceals {{one of the}} Tourists' time travel devices. He eventually makes it work {{and returns to the}} previous evening to try and save his daughter and the townsfolk from the disaster. Realising that Hilary is then at her grandfather's house, he tries to sneak her away, but he is caught and thrown into jail, which is itself soon to be destroyed. However he convinces the deputy to allow him his one phone call and manages to contact his pre-existing self at the hotel, just as that self is meeting with Reeve. This alternate <b>self</b> <b>helps</b> the 'original' Ben to escape from the jail and together they manage to alert and save most of the people by ringing the bells in the old church {{on the other side of}} town.|$|R
25|$|The first {{official}} {{activity of the}} organization was an inaugural batik and silkscreen workshop that ended with a group exhibition. Participating artists paid a small fee and provided their own materials. Thus began the <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> tradition of instructing budding artists in graphic arts techniques. Shortly thereafter, funds provided by the California Arts Council allowed the hiring of artists Peter Tovar, Fernando Amozorrutia,Carlos Bueno,Victor Du Bois,Jeff Gates,Linda Orozco, Jesse Rays, Carla Wbeber,Silvia Chavez,Michael Amescua and Linda Vallejo as arts instructors. It {{should be noted that}} the first Day of the Dead Celebration in the USA began in 1974 at SHG.|$|E
25|$|Preparation {{generally}} {{begins in}} August with papel picado-making, altar-making, and printmaking workshops {{for children and}} adults. On November 1, participants, many of whom paint their faces as calaveras, proceed down Cesar Chavez to Evergreen Cemetery, where personal and family altars are set up and food is (pan de muerto) offered to the deceased family members there interred. Sometimes a mass is celebrated there. Then attendees return to <b>Self</b> <b>Help,</b> where altars, ofrendas, prints, and other works are exhibited. Often there are musical and theatrical performances. In 1978, Luis Valdez's Teatro Campesino performed El Fin del Mundo {{as part of the}} program.|$|E
25|$|Boccalero {{functioned as}} {{executive}} director until her death in 1997, at which point she was succeeded by Tomás Benítez. In May 2005, the artist Gustavo LeClerc became the center's new artistic director, and was charged with broadening Self Help's horizons. The personnel changes may have been symptoms of larger problems. Benítez stepped down in March 2005 as a financial crisis became public knowledge. On June 7, 2005, the doors of <b>Self</b> <b>Help</b> were locked and the staff was dismissed. The unforeseen nature of the closure evoked an angry reaction from the artists affiliated with {{the center and the}} community at large. A series of meetings were held to ensure that the closure was only temporary and to pre-empt any potential future problems resulting from lack of funding or the lack of organizational transparency.|$|E

2500|$|During the tournament, {{a version}} of Rogue appears through the time travel gate Eclipse from an {{alternate}} future, corrupted by his inner evil after Frosch is killed by Gray Fullbuster in his timeline. [...] "Future" [...] Rogue combines his shadow magic with Sting's White Dragon Slayer Magic forcibly acquired after killing him in the future. He tricks Hisui E. Fiore by advising her to use the time travel gate Eclipse as a weapon to save the kingdom from a dragon invasion, setting the gate to allow seven dragons from the historical Dragon King Festival {{to appear in the}} present to be used against Acnologia. While Rogue's present <b>self</b> <b>helps</b> fight the dragons, Future Rogue's battle with Natsu Dragneel ends with Eclipse being destroyed, returning Rogue and the dragons to their original time periods, but not before Rogue helps Natsu avert his own future by warning him of Frosch's fate.|$|R
40|$|The {{artifacts}} {{produced by}} medical imaging technologies {{raise questions about}} our physicality {{and what it means}} to be human. Looming death, the promise of healing, and perhaps ultimate transcendence compel us to allow the shift in medicine from human-driven to device-driven. It’s conceivable that the radiographic image, or at least the perception brought about by the imagery of our inner <b>selves,</b> <b>helped</b> take us to that place. While both the patient and doctor currently remain necessary to the medical experience at some level, the imaging technologies make their location, time, and place less relevant, and lessen the significance of physical human interaction. At some point, the machine must analyze the patient and the doctor must analyze the machine’s analysis, i. e., the images, but we face the possibility that never the two shall meet. Regardless, the medical images offer rich, complicated visual rhetoric from which to understand ourselves...|$|R
