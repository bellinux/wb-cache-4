Our framing <b>of</b> the <b>salience</b> construct includes its elements, temporality, and several ontological perspectives <b>of</b> <b>salience.</b> In answer to calls for clarity {{in the use of}} concepts in the identity-related literature, this framing is applied to Identity Theory and Social Identity Theory. We find each theory unclear in its use <b>of</b> <b>salience,</b> the naming <b>of</b> the elements <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> and the ontological perspective <b>of</b> <b>salience.</b> The importance <b>of</b> gaining clarity in defining and using salience is the contribution to answering questions inherent to identity theories, namely ‘Is an identity triggered by an object <b>of</b> <b>salience,</b> or does the active identity determine which objects <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> gain attention?’ Research propositions based on the proposed definition <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> and the results of the analysis are offered.

25|$|Oxytocin is {{typically}} remembered {{for the effect}} it has on prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, oxytocin {{is often referred to}} as the “love hormone". However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin in fear and anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases the <b>salience</b> <b>of</b> certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.|$|E

Conversely, adding barriers, such as a separate registration process, can suppress turnout. The <b>salience</b> <b>of</b> an election, the effect that a vote will have on policy, and its proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.|$|E

25|$|To {{investigate}} the <b>salience</b> <b>of</b> religious beliefs in establishing group identity, {{researchers have also}} conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice.

These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E
25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is because you need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the <b>salience</b> <b>of</b> ethnic identity diminishes.|$|E
25|$|Nasally {{administered}} oxytocin {{has been}} reported to reduce fear, possibly by inhibiting the amygdala (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses). Indeed, studies in rodents have shown oxytocin can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala. Some researchers have argued oxytocin has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since intranasal administration of oxytocin also increases envy and Schadenfreude. Individuals who receive an intranasal dose of oxytocin identify facial expressions of disgust faster than individuals who do not receive oxytocin. Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, oxytocin increases the <b>salience</b> <b>of</b> cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of oxytocin, individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo. Oxytocin modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats that are genetically modified to have a surplus of oxytocin receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. Oxytocin enhances the aversive social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the aversive stimulus is encountered again.|$|E

40|$|The <b>salience</b> {{hypothesis}} <b>of</b> psychosis {{rests on}} a simple but profound observation that subtle alterations {{in the way that}} we perceive and experience stimuli have important consequences for how important these stimuli become for us, how much they draw our attention, how they embed themselves in our memory and, ultimately, how they shape our beliefs. We put forward the idea that a classical memory illusion – the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) effect – offers a useful way of exploring processes related to such aberrant belief formation. The illusion occurs when, as a consequence of its relationship to previous stimuli, a stimulus that has not previously been presented is falsely remembered. Such illusory familiarity is thought to be generated by the surprising fluency with which the stimulus is processed. In this respect, the illusion relates directly to the salience hypothesis and may share common cognitive underpinnings with aberrations of perception and attribution that are found in psychosis. In this paper, we explore the theoretical importance of this experimentally-induced illusion in relation to the <b>salience</b> model <b>of</b> psychosis. We present data showing that, in healthy volunteers, the illusion relates directly to self reported anomalies of experience and magical thinking. We discuss this finding in terms <b>of</b> the <b>salience</b> hypothesis and <b>of</b> a broader Bayesian framework of perception and cognition which emphasizes the <b>salience</b> both <b>of</b> predictable and unpredictable experiences...|$|R
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, <b>salience</b> <b>of</b> targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computaional method of cal-culating the measure <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> in understand-ing metaphors. We mainly treat metaphors {{in the form}} of “A is (like) B, ” in which “A ” is called tar-get concept, and “B ” is called source concept. In understanding a metaphor, some properties of the source concept are transferred to the target con-cept. In the transfer process, we first have to select the properties of the source concept that can be more preferably transferred to the target concept. The measure <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> represents how typical or prominent the property is and is used to measure the transferability of the property. By introducing the measure <b>of</b> <b>salience,</b> we have to consider only the high salient properties after the selection. The measure <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> was calculated from Smith & Medin’s probabilistic concept[l 2, 131 according to Tversky’s two factors[l 4]. One is intensity which refers to signal-to-noise ratio; this is calculated from the entropy of properties. The other is di-agnostic factor which refers to the classificatory significance of properties; this is calculated from the distribution of the property’s intensity among similar concepts.

But Greeley also insisted on the disastrous impact of Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical upholding the Catholic ban on contraception, holding it almost solely responsible for a sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975. He believed that lay Catholics understood far better than their bishops that sex in marriage was intended by God to be joyous and playful, a true means of grace.|$|E

40|$|The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is {{the most}} popular {{indirect}} measure of attitudes in social psychology. It has been suggested that salience asymmetries are a non-associative contaminant of the IAT that threatens the accurate assessment <b>of</b> attitudes. <b>Salience</b> asymmetries in the IAT are claimed to correspond with visual search asymmetries, and differences in target familiarity. In this thesis, I propose that processing fluency is the common mechanism underlying both visual search asymmetries and familiarity. Several experiments were conducted to determine whether visual search asymmetries, familiarity, or processing fluency most reliably corresponds with salience asymmetry effects in the IAT. The first series of experiments revealed that processing fluency is a better predictor <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> asymmetry effects in the IAT than is visual search asymmetry (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, a novel method was developed to distinguish between the effects <b>of</b> valence and <b>salience</b> in the IAT. Using this method, I demonstrated that the effects <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> in the IAT are consistent with a fluency account <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> asymmetries. Familiarity was also shown to produce salience asymmetry effects in the IAT (Chapter 4), which is also consistent with the fluency account. When fluency and familiarity were set against each other in Chapter 5, it was processing fluency, rather than familiarity, that predicted salience asymmetry effects in the IAT. Although processing fluency is a good predictor <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> asymmetries, the results of Chapter 6 reveal that the fluency account cannot explain all examples <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> asymmetries in the IAT. The data presented here are consistent with the view that the more fluently processed target category is compatible with the pleasant attributes on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> asymmetries. The current experiments suggest that when there are valence differences between the target categories, salience asymmetries can potentially distort IAT effects. When the positive target category is more salient, salience asymmetries appear to increase IAT effects. In contrast, when the negative target category is more salient, salience asymmetries appear to decrease IAT effects. However, further evidence is required to determine how the effects <b>of</b> <b>salience</b> and valence combine in the IAT...|$|R
