More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end.

40|$|The {{importance}} of studying the futures {{markets and the}} relationship between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices is given by the possibility that futures contracts offer in order to reduce particular risks. The financial theory presents the relationships between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices in the framework of both the non-arbitrage theory and the asset pricing theory, but none of them offer information about the direction of causality between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices. This paper attempts to analyse the dynamic relationship between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices of the crude oil, a very important commodity. The empirical analysis is focused to examine the causal dynamics between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices in crude oil market; the results confirm that the prices of one and two maturity futures predict spot prices.

The test is carried out over the time period of 3 / 1 / 2006 – 30 / 6 / 2011 where it is split into two sub periods based on the changes in the index constituents and refresh times. The empirical work is carried out using the economic modelling based on the VECM framework for <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices. Our findings show that there is some (but weak) evidence against the cost of carry relationship between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices in both our sub periods. This research also found bidirectional causality between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices with a stronger causality from futures to spot.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the hypothesis of}} Tilton et al. (2011) that assert investor demand affects commodity prices when <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices are closely correlated during strong contango in a hard commodity like copper. However, using daily data of crude palm oil (CPO) <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices from January 2000 to July 2016, after {{taking into account the}} variance of the increments in a random walk as measured by variance ratio, our study finds that <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices are highly correlated during backwardation period. It is further observed that: First, investor demand on the futures market is highly correlated with <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures prices during backwardation, but lesser during weak contango, and the least correlated during strong contango. Second, the efficiency of the futures market is related to the degree of correlation between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures price changes. High efficient information transmission in the futures market is linked to a high correlation between <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures markets and vice versa. Therefore, we extend the hypothesis that the preference of holding a long position in the futures market is due to the anticipation of insufficient supply of CPO which happens during the backwardation period...|$|R

Based on the time-varying AR(1) -GARCH(1, 1) -M models, the results show that the open-to-close returns of the NASDAQ 100 index <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures have predictive power over both the open-to-close and close-to-open returns of KOSDAQ 50 index <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures. In particular, the open-to-close returns of both NASDAQ 100 index <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures have much stronger effect over the close-to-open returns of KOSDAQ 50 index spot. We also find that the NASDAQ 100 index futures returns have strong predictive power over the KOSDAQ 50 index futures returns similar to the results from the NASDAQ 100 index spot. In addition, the tests show that the close-to-open returns of the NASDAQ 100 index futures, rather than those of NASDAQ 100 index spot have stronger information spillover effect over the open-to-close returns of both the KOSDAQ 50 index <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> futures. The results also represent that there is co-movement between the KOSDAQ 50 index <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> the NASDAQ 100 index <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> between the KOSDAQ 50 index futures and the NASDAQ 100 index futures. These findings support that the market efficiency and the international stock market integration are on the increasing trend in terms of both mean and time varying volatility. Specifically, the results of the information spillover effects between NASDAQ 100 index futures market and the KOSDAQ 50 index futures market would provide useful information in country diversification and industry diversification. 2 I...|$|R
