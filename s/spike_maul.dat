25|$|The <b>spike</b> <b>maul,</b> {{also known}} as a spiking hammer, is a type of {{sledgehammer}} with a long thin head which was originally used to drive spikes.|$|E
2500|$|The golden spike {{was made}} of 17.6-karat (73%) copper-alloyed gold, and weighed 14.03 troy ounces (436 g).

2500|$|On {{smaller scale}} jobs spikes are still driven into wooden {{sleepers}} by hammering {{them with a}} <b>spike</b> <b>maul.</b> Though this manual work has been largely replaced by hydraulic tools and machines, commonly called [...] "spikers" [...] (A machine that removes spikes is called a [...] "spike puller"). Splitting of the wood can be limited by pre-boring spike holes or adding steel bands around the wood.|$|E
50|$|Brands of <b>spike</b> <b>mauls</b> include Slug-Devil, Tamco and Warwood.|$|R
5000|$|Bell: This is {{the more}} common variety. Bell <b>spike</b> <b>mauls</b> are mostly {{cylindrical}} in shape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spike</b> <b>mauls</b> are akin to sledge hammers, {{typically}} weighing from 8 to 12 lb with 30 to 36 in-long handles.They have elongated double faced {{hardened steel}} heads. The head is typically over 12 in long {{to allow the}} user to drive spikes {{on the opposite side}} of the rail without breaking the handle.|$|R
2500|$|To {{drive the}} final spike, Stanford lifted a silver <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> {{and drove the}} spike into the tie, {{completing}} the line. Stanford and Hewes missed the spike, but the single word [...] "done" [...] was nevertheless flashed by telegraph around the country. In the United States, the event {{has come to be}} considered one of the first nationwide media events. The locomotives were moved forward until their [...] "cowcatchers" [...] met, and photographs were taken. [...] Immediately afterwards, the golden spike and the laurel tie were removed, lest they be stolen, and replaced with a regular iron spike and normal tie. At exactly 12:47pm, the last iron spike was driven, finally completing the line.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> {{is a type}} of {{hand tool}} used to drive {{railroad}} spikes in railroad track work. It is also known as a spiking hammer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spike</b> <b>maul,</b> {{also known}} as a spiking hammer, is a type of {{sledgehammer}} with a long thin head which was originally used to drive spikes.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>spike</b> <b>mauls</b> have {{symmetrical}} heads, {{but most}} {{have a slightly}} longer thinner side and a shorter larger diameter side of equal weight. The long side allows a user to spike over abnormally tall rails, and to drive spikes down next to highway crossing planks. The shorter side provides more surface area which requires less accuracy for normal spiking.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spike</b> <b>mauls</b> are {{hardened}} tools. Occasionally {{the head}} may become upset or chipped. Heads are often reground {{on a bench}} grinder to remove nicks and metal flow. This practice is becoming less common as grinding can hide cracks and other defects. It is also possible to overheat the steel while grinding and {{remove some of the}} temper from the tool.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all <b>spike</b> <b>mauls</b> take a {{standard}} 36 in oval eye sledge hammer handle, which is frequently replaced {{through the course}} of heavy use. It is common practice in many locales to cut down the long handle to about 28 in. This makes the maul more convenient when used only to [...] "set" [...] spikes for a powered spiker. It also makes the [...] "windmill" [...] spiking technique more comfortable. Windmilling is when a user takes the maul handle with both hands locked and strikes the spike with repeated fast blows by swinging in a circular motion over the shoulder. The standard [...] "wood chopping" [...] motion is more comfortable and natural for most people.|$|R

50|$|Legend has it {{that when}} the Golden Spike was to be placed to mark the {{completion}} of the transcontinental railway, the driving of the spike was to be done by Leland Stanford, President of the Southern Pacific. When Stanford was unable to hit the spike properly, Casement supposedly took the <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> and drove it himself but the story is probably apocryphal.|$|E
5000|$|On {{smaller scale}} jobs spikes are still driven into wooden {{sleepers}} by hammering {{them with a}} <b>spike</b> <b>maul.</b> Though this manual work has been largely replaced by hydraulic tools and machines, commonly called [...] "spikers" [...] (A machine that removes spikes is called a [...] "spike puller").

5000|$|Another iconic use of sledgehammers is {{for driving}} {{railroad}} spikes into wooden sleepers during rail construction. When the two {{ends of the}} Union Pacific railroad were joined at Promontory, Utah, Leland Stanford hammered a golden spike into a tie with a silver hammer. Sledges used to drive spikes for rails had curved heads that came down to a [...] "beak" [...] that was only about one inch across. The shape meant that drivers needed to be accurate, and spot where the spike hit was often not much larger than a dime. Anything larger would hit the plate or the tie. The curved head kept the handle away from the rail, as the spikes were driven with the rail between the spike and the driver. These are often called <b>spike</b> <b>mauls.</b>|$|R
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and levelled {{to get ready for the}} rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with <b>spike</b> <b>mauls.</b> The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.|$|R
5000|$|As {{maintenance}} of way workers, besides lining bars gandy dancers also used special sledge hammers called <b>spike</b> <b>mauls</b> to drive <b>spikes,</b> shovels or ballast forks to move track ballast, [...] large clamps called [...] "rail dogs" [...] to carry rails, and ballast tamper bars or picks {{to adjust the}} ballast. [...] The same ground crews also performed the other aspects of track maintenance, such as removing weeds, unloading ties and rails, and replacing worn rails and rotten ties. The work was extremely difficult and the pay was low, {{but it was one}} of the only jobs available for southern black men and newly arriving immigrants at that time. Black men working on the railroad were held in high esteem among their peers. There’s a blues song that says [...] "when you marry, marry a railroad man, every day Sunday, a dollar in your hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "So gandy dancing goes in {{with the}} music. That's the way it’s been since way back. In the {{beginning}} of the railroad, you had to line it up. That’s where the gandy dancers come in. And you even gandy danced behind a maul. Even spiking, you make the <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> talk; you sing to it. Like when you’re driving a spike down. SINGING “Big cat, little cat, teeniny kitten. Big cat!” That’s you driving the spike as hard as you could. He’d holler, “Make a wheel out of that maul.” And that means spike fast. And so, with two of us spiking, you make that maul talk! “Big cat, little cat, teeniny kitten,” and that spike would be down." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} differences in railroad <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> methods between expe-rienced track workers and novice subjects. Differences {{were analyzed by}} develop-ing a quantitative measure of {{the orientation of the}} <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> path during spik-ing. The relationship between spiking motion pattern and spiking performance in both novice and experienced subjects was also investigated. Subjects were video-taped while using a <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> on an instrumented spike force measuring system. Analysis of videotapes and performance measures revealed significant differences in motion patterns and performance between novice and experienced subjects. It was concluded from analysis of <b>spike</b> <b>maul</b> motion patterns that experienced track workers had developed a more efficient ballistic technique than had novices. This technique was evidenced by positioning of the maul close to the body's center of gravity, flexing the elbows, and using wrist motion on the downswing...|$|E
