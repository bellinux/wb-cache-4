5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David Stern, and the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing both sides were the division of revenue {{and the structure of}} the <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> and luxury tax. Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> structure intact.|$|E

50|$|Several European {{association}} football leagues {{have considered}} introducing <b>salary</b> <b>caps</b> {{in the early}} 21st century. In 2002, the BBC reported that the G14 group of 18 leading European football teams would cap their payrolls at 70% of team's income, starting from the 2005/2006 season, however this did not occur. Serie A, the leading Italian football league and The Football League in England have also considered <b>salary</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
5|$|Faced with <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> constraints, the Flames {{were unable}} to re-sign Cammalleri {{following}} the season. He left Calgary to sign a five-year, $30 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens. Midway through the 2009–10 season, he scored the 20,000th goal in Montreal franchise history on December 28, 2009, against the Ottawa Senators. A knee injury resulted in Cammalleri missing six weeks of play, but he finished the season with 50 points in 65 games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Ehrhoff {{was traded to the}} Vancouver Canucks on 28 August 2009, along with defenceman Brad Lukowich, in {{exchange}} for prospects Patrick White and Daniel Rahimi. The deal was done primarily to clear <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> space in anticipation of the Sharks' acquisition of star forward Dany Heatley from the Ottawa Senators. For the Canucks, Ehrhoff's acquisition addressed the need for a puck-moving defenceman to rush the puck up the ice.|$|E

He scored his first career playoff goal, in his 30th post-season game, against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Bruins opted not to re-sign the 32-year-old Bégin, due both to their <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> constraints and a desire to build a younger lineup.|$|E

40|$|Professional {{team sports}} leagues {{provide insight into}} the {{problems}} facing the management of functioning cartels. This paper provides an analysis of the incentives and outcomes inherent in the management of professional team sports cartels. Except for revenue sharing and <b>salary</b> <b>caps,</b> league cartel management outcomes are consistent with league-wide revenue maximization and have no impact on competitive balance. However, there are predictable impacts on the profitability of strong- and weak-drawing teams within the league. While providing an analytical review of the literature, the work here also yields new results concerning <b>salary</b> <b>caps,</b> local TV revenue sharing, and the behavior of cartel managers in the face of rival leagues. ...|$|R

50|$|Fantasy racing rules, formats {{and point}} systems vary widely. Most American games follow NASCAR Sprint Cup racing and award driver points {{based on the}} {{official}} NASCAR points system. To {{reduce the likelihood of}} ties, game rules can restrict driver starts according to criteria based on <b>salary</b> <b>caps,</b> driver rankings or frequency of selection. Games that follow one specific series combine driver or roster <b>salary</b> <b>caps</b> with a point system based on predictions for driver pit strategy, advancement or retreat from starting position, fastest lap or qualifying performance. Other games follow the results of all the top stock car racing, open wheel racing, drag racing and sports car racing series and require players to pick at least one driver from each race per weekend in filling out a seven driver roster.|$|R

5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money.
