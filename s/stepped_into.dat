With the death of Garfield, Chester A. Arthur <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the presidency.|$|E

Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women in the Bond films' title sequences.|$|E

5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|In April 1970, a {{team led}} by Albert Ghiorso working at the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the competition. They claimed to have {{synthesized}} the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with nitrogen-15 ions. Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E

5|$|After this débâcle {{the rest}} of Richardson's stage career was at the National, with one late exception. He played Lord Touchwood in The Double Dealer (1978), the Master in The Fruits of Enlightenment (1979), Old Ekdal in The Wild Duck (1979) and Kitchen in Storey's Early Days, {{specially}} written for him. The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night.

5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further {{conflict}} in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|E
5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the path of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Kotzer {{estimated}} that a frontal assault against the Egyptians would be useless, {{as they were}} dug in {{on both sides of}} the pillbox. In complete darkness, the 1st Company made its way south through the wadi hoping to avoid enemy fire from superior positions and weapons until they were close enough to respond. At 03:00, the Israeli artillery barrage started, but did not do significant damage and only alerted all Egyptian positions to the Israeli presence. The only Israeli unit close to engagement at the time was Kotzer's company. About 100 m away from the Egyptian defense line, they <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> an ambush and the leading squad was eliminated. Kotzer ordered the machine gunners to climb to the east bank of the wadi to provide cover for a counterattack, and this move also led to Israeli casualties. The counterattack was difficult and only destroyed some small Egyptian entrenchments.|$|E
5|$|Vision Racing {{was unable}} to secure {{sponsorship}} to run a second car in 2009, leaving Foyt out of a ride. He returned to A. J.

Foyt finished 16th on the lead lap as his teammate Vitor Meira was injured in a late-race crash. Paul Tracy was drafted as the substitute driver for Meira at the next race, but Foyt <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the car for his home race at Texas Motor Speedway. Ryan Hunter-Reay drove the car {{for the rest of}} the season and Texas would be Foyt's last race of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the middle of the fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, RKO Pictures, {{which had}} {{produced}} no films while under Wesray control, was spun off yet again. Actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill and her husband, producer Ted Hartley, acquired a majority interest and merged {{the company with}} their Pavilion Communications. After a brief period as RKO/Pavilion, the business was reorganized as RKO Pictures LLC. With the inaugural RKO production under Hartley and Merrill's ownership, False Identity (1990), the company also <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the distribution business. In 1992, it handled the well-regarded independent production Laws of Gravity, directed by Nick Gomez. RKO's next significant release came in 1998 with Mighty Joe Young, a remake of a 1949 RKO movie that was itself something of a King Kong redux. In the early 2000s, the company was involved as a coproducer on TV movies and modestly budgeted features {{at the rate of}} about one annually. In 2003, RKO coproduced a Broadway stage version of the 1936 Astaire–Rogers vehicle Swing Time, under the title Never Gonna Dance.|$|E
