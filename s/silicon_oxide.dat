25|$|Many {{handheld}} breath analyzers sold {{to consumers}} use a <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide</b> sensor (also called a semiconductor sensor) {{to determine the}} blood alcohol concentration. These sensors are far more prone to contamination and interference from substances other than breath alcohol. The sensors require recalibration or replacement every six months. Higher end personal breath analyzers and professional-use breath alcohol testers use platinum fuel cell sensors. These too require recalibration but at less frequent intervals than semiconductor devices, usually once a year.|$|E
25|$|This {{dependence}} is crucial, as {{twice as}} much silicon is being consumed at higher temperatures. The deposition occurs selectively on pure Si only, but not on <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide</b> or nitride, thus the reaction is highly sensitive to contamination or substrate pre-treatment. The decomposition reaction is fast, but saturates when the tungsten layer thickness reaches 10–15 micrometers. The saturation occurs because the tungsten layer stops diffusion of WF6 molecules to the Si substrate {{which is the only}} catalyst of molecular decomposition in this process.|$|E
25|$|In common {{integrated}} circuits, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon {{serves as}} a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide,</b> an insulator that is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions. Silicon {{has become the most}} popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown (an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.|$|E

25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide</b> region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

2500|$|Silicides {{are usually}} {{prepared}} by direct {{reaction of the}} elements. For example, the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals react with silicon or <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide</b> to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, {{and most of these}} compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides [...] contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the [...] anion, isoeelctronic with white phosphorus, P4. Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e.g. Cu5Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e.g. U3Si2) or four silicon atoms (e.g. 44−) at first, followed by chains (e.g. CaSi), layers (e.g. CaSi2), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e.g. α-ThSi2) as the silicon content rises even higher.|$|E
2500|$|An {{essential}} {{feature for}} the formation of laterite is the repetition of wet and dry seasons. Rocks are leached by percolating rain water during the wet season; the resulting solution containing the leached ions is brought to the surface by capillary action during the dry season. These ions form soluble salt compounds which dry on the surface; these salts are washed away during the next wet season. Laterite formation is favoured in low topographical reliefs of gentle crests and plateaus which prevents erosion of the surface cover. The reaction zone where rocks are in contact with water—from the lowest to highest water table levels—is progressively depleted of the easily leached ions of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. A solution of these ions can have the correct pH to preferentially dissolve <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide</b> rather than the aluminium oxides and iron oxides.|$|E
