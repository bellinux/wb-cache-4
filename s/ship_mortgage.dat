50|$|In a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage,</b> a {{shipowner}} gives {{a lender}} (or mortgagee) {{an interest in}} a ship as security for a loan. Similar to other types of mortgage, a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> legally consists of three parts: the mortgage loan, the mortgage document (deed) and the rights derived from the mortgage deed onto money lender. Ship mortgages differ from other types of mortgage in three ways. First, some privileged claims could have a higher ranking over that of mortgagee against the ship. Second, ships naturally move between jurisdictions. And third, a ship is always at risk of partial or total damages at sea. The use of ship mortgages emerged as a widely accepted practice in shipping industry in the 19th century as {{a major source of}} finance for ship owners.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide {{an analysis of the}} current issues and conditions affecting shipping finance in Russia based {{on the development of the}} systems of <b>ship</b> and <b>mortgage</b> registration. Particular economic reasons describing the situation on the shipping markets lie outside the scope of this thesis. However, a general overview of the situation of the shipping markets and results achieved by the leading banks will be provided in the first chapter. The reason is to demonstrate that in spite of a business recession in some areas, shipping companies continue to experience favourable market conditions such as the increased freight rates and the continuing demand for gross tonnage capacity. The latter has led to the companies expanding or upgrading existing vessels. Another reason for choosing the above subject was the experience obtained working in the shipping finance group of a City of London law firm during the last 9 months. The author was involved as an assistant in a number of loan facility transactions for financing newbuildings for the Russian-controlled borrowers. Analysing the structure of the transactions it was noted that mortgage over the vessels and vessel registration in one of the open ship registries were prerequisites of the lending banks. In this thesis the following issues are to be considered: (i) the role of mortgage over the vessel as one of the securities in a shipping finance transaction; (ii) the role of underlying vessel registration and advantages and/or disadvantages of the existing types of ship registries; (iii) the procedures for <b>ship</b> and <b>mortgage</b> registration under Russian law and (iv) an analysis of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the Russian mortgage. In order to integrate the above issues, the following structure and terminology will be used in this thesis: (a) overview of shipping finance based on the results of the shipping banks survey published (chapter 2); (b) analysis of shipping finance characteristics, sources and main types of securitisation in shipping finance (chapter 2); (c) current issues in relation to <b>ship</b> and <b>mortgage</b> registration (chapter 3); (d) research on provisions of the <b>ship</b> and <b>mortgage</b> registration under Russian law (chapter 3); and (e) comparison between requirements in connection with (i) ship registration in the Russian International Ship Registry and Norwegian International Ship Registry...|$|R

40|$|Bank {{and other}} {{financial}} institutions providing ship finance require legal protection {{just as much as}} other entrepreneurs. When a bank finances the purchase of a ship, the borrower has to execute a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> in favour of the bank. By definition, a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> is a security over the ship which enables the bank, on default by the borrower, to take possession of the ship and sell it to discharge the debt. In order to enforce the <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage,</b> the bank may ask a maritime court to arrest the ship and, through judicial procedure, sell or auction it. This paper comparatively explores the legal and practical issues regarding the nature and the enforcement of ship mortgages in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

By definition, a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> is a security over the ship which enables the bank, on default by the borrower, to take possession of the ship and sell it to discharge the debt. In order to enforce the <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage,</b> the bank may ask a maritime court to arrest the ship and, through judicial procedure, sell or auction it. Ownerships and mortgages of ships may be registered with any registries located in jurisdictions such as Panama, Liberia, Bahamas, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands. These registries are {{often referred to as the}} “flags of convenience”. As these countries depend significantly on income from shipping, they open their registers to non-nationals. Anyone can register a ship on one of these open registers, and a link between the nationals of the flag state and the ship is not required (1). On the other hand, a ship is a highly mobile vehicle of carriage. It may not return to its home base nor visit the same port again. It is a well-established international shipping practice that ship mortgages can be enforced world-wide, regardless of where the mortgages are registered. This paper comparatively explores the legal and practical issues as regards the nature and the enforcement of ship mortgages in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The introduction of laws on ship mortgages and registration were prompted by the China’s need to purchase more vessels and obtain shipping finance through various finance structure such as equity, debt or charters that are consistent with international standards. In fact, most major shipping companies in China expand their fleets by adopting these types of financing structures or arrangements. The Rules of the People’s Republic of China Governing Registration of Ships came into force on 1 st January 1995 (the Registration Rules). Under the Registration Rules, the following ships shall be registered: ships owned by citizens of the PRC whose residence or principal places of business are located within the territory thereof; ships owned by enterprises with legal person status established under the laws of the PRC and whose principal places of business are located within the territory thereof, provided that if foreign investment is involved, the proportion of registered capital contributed by Chinese investors shall not be less than 50 %; public service ships of the PRC Government and ships owned by institutions with legal person status; and other ships whose registration is deemed necessary by the competent authority of harbour superintendency of the PRC. The Bureau of Harbour Superintendency is the competent authority in charge of the registration of ships, but the Ship Registration Administration (situated at various ports) is the agency in control of actual registration. Before registration can occur, the Harbour Superintendency requires submission of proper documentation (2). Having examined and verified the application for registration of ownership, the Ship Registration Administration shall issue to the shipowner whose application meets the requirements of the Rules, a Certificate of Registration of Ship’s Ownership and a Certificate of Ship’s Nationality. Where mortgage is established with respect to a ship of 20 tons gross tonnage or over, the mortgagee and the mortgagor shall apply to register it with the Ship Registration Administration (3) to obtain a Certificate of Registration of <b>Ship</b> <b>Mortgage.</b> Where two or more mortgages have been established on the same ship, the authority will make the registration in sequence of dates on which the applications were registered, and indicate the respective dates in the register of ships. Special provisions covering the making of commercial loans also exist. Thus, a Chinese shipping company wishing to borrow foreign currencies in its own name directly from a foreign entity for the purpose of purchasing vessels, must first seek approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). This is governed by the Administration of Borrowing of International Commercial Loans by Domestic Organisations Procedures promulgated by SAFE in 1997. Under the laws, all international commercial loans (4) require SAFE approval or risk being declared void. In addition, all international commercial loans must be registered with SAFE which will then issue a Foreign Debt Registration Certificate, to be presented to authorised banks. This will enable borrowers to open foreign exchange bank accounts and undertake procedures for remitting foreign exchange abroad. Bearing in mind that some overseas lenders may be reluctant to take a mortgage over a vessel under the PRC flag, there has been a recent tendency for domestic shipping enterprises wishing to avoid the red tape of the above procedures, to set up subsidiaries in developed maritime countries such as Liberia and Panama. Under such schemes, loans are advanced to these subsidiaries for the purchase of ships, but once the transactions are completed, both the ownership and mortgages must be registered with the appropriate Liberian or Panamanian authorities. The offshore subsidiaries may then charter the ships back to their mother companies in China (5). As part of the transaction, the Liberian or Panamanian shipowners must also assign all their rights and benefits (e. g. assignment of insurance proceeds, charter, sub-charter and freight) in favour of the overseas lender as security. When a foreign mortgagee enforces his foreign registered mortgage in China, the law of the flag state (not Chinese Law) shall apply to the mortgage of the ship (6). It is speculated that this strategy will continue to dominate the market of ship financing in the PRC, unless the relevant authorities relax the control of foreign exchange. Although cutting down on the red tape, the SAFE may not be entirely excluded from these proceedings, as the overseas financial institutions involved may require guarantees from the parent companies in China for the loans advanced to their overseas subsidiaries in addition to taking mortgages of the ships. Assignment by the Chinese companies, the bareboat charter, rights in relation to the various insurances of the ship, and the sub-charter freight may also be regarded as guarantees which require SAFE approval. Under the Rules Governing Guarantees, only qualified financial institutions authorised by the central government can provide guarantees to foreign lenders for foreign debts. Government departments and unincorporated institutions cannot issue guarantees for foreign debts. Any subsequent amendment to the principal loan agreement shall be subject to the consent of the guarantor and to the approval of SAFE...|$|E

The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.|$|R
