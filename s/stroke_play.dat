5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors for the next five years, and is exempt from qualifying for the PGA Championship for life. The champion also receives membership on the PGA Tour for the following five years and invitations to The Players Championship for five years. The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a match play event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a <b>stroke</b> <b>play</b> event.|$|E
5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of <b>stroke</b> <b>play,</b> match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} forms of golf play, match play and <b>stroke</b> <b>play.</b> <b>Stroke</b> <b>play</b> is more popular.|$|E

50|$|Speed golf (also {{known as}} extreme golf, fast golf, fitness golf and hit and run golf) is {{a variant of}} golf which scores both on <b>strokes</b> <b>played</b> and the time taken to {{complete}} the round.|$|R
25|$|Golf {{is played}} for the lowest number of strokes by an {{individual}}, known as <b>stroke</b> <b>play,</b> or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. <b>Stroke</b> <b>play</b> is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.|$|E
25|$|Fourball: {{defined in}} Rules 30 and 31, {{this is also}} played between two teams of two players each, but every player plays their own ball and for each team, the lower score on each hole counts. Fourballs can be played as match play or <b>stroke</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
25|$|The score {{achieved}} {{for each}} and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in <b>stroke</b> <b>play.</b> <b>Stroke</b> <b>play</b> is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where {{the first player to}} win a hole wins the tournament.|$|E
5000|$|... diddleA diddle is {{a double}} <b>stroke</b> <b>played</b> at the current {{prevailing}} speed of the piece. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any diddles in that passage would consist of sixteenth notes.|$|R
25|$|The indoor cricket {{cut shot}} is an attacking <b>stroke</b> <b>played</b> to balls pitched short and outside off-stump. The {{aim is to}} hit the ball late and into the ground, with the ball ideally hitting the top corner of Zone B on the off side (See Indoor cricket court). The <b>stroke</b> is <b>played</b> with the bat {{horizontal}} to pitch (cross-bat), and is hit when the ball is directly in line with the body.|$|R

She was the 1983 English Intermediate Champion, the 1984 Welsh Open <b>Stroke</b> <b>Play</b> Champion and the South Eastern Champion in both 1983 and 1984. She was {{also a member of}} the Great Britain and Ireland Curtis Cup Team in 1984. She turned professional in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Stableford is a {{scoring system}} {{used in the}} sport of golf. Rather than {{counting}} {{the total number of}} strokes taken, as in <b>stroke</b> <b>play,</b> it involves scoring points {{based on the number of}} strokes taken at each hole. Unlike traditional scoring methods, where the aim is to have the lowest score, under Stableford rules, the objective is to have the highest score.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{investigation}} into the computer vision problem of tracking humans in digital video. The investigation domain is digital tennis footage and the aim is to track the tennis player and recognise the <b>strokes</b> <b>played.</b> The motivation behind this investigation is to eventually automate the task of digital tennis footage annotation so that metadata, such as the time codes and a description of the <b>strokes</b> <b>played,</b> are automatically appended to the video. This then enables a number of compelling applications, from simple search facilities for the home viewer, to more complex analysis tools suitable for a tennis coach. The system developed solves the problem of tennis player tracking and stroke recognition using relatively simple, and well known, image processing operations constrained by an a priori knowledge of the image capture conditions, the background scene, and the application domain...|$|R

25|$|Dilshan is {{credited}} {{for the creation}} of the Dilscoop, which he stumbled upon and then perfected, during the Indian Premier League 2009 tournament. His innovative <b>stroke</b> <b>play</b> is acknowledged by many commentators and pundits thereby earning the recognition of being {{known as one of the}} most aggressive batsmen of all time. Apart from his Dilscoop, Dilshan is a prolific player of width possessing the ability to hit nearly any delivery pitched outside the off-stump for runs, and has perfected a lethal cover drive against pace bowlers.|$|E

Woosnam {{would go on to}} win the European Seniors Tour Order of Merit that year becoming the only person to have won the Order of Merit on both the European Seniors Tour and the regular European Tour.|$|E
5000|$|A draw is a <b>stroke</b> <b>played</b> {{with the}} effect that, for a {{right-handed}} player, the ball moves {{from right to}} left during flight. Conversely the ball will move from left to right for a left-handed player. These characteristics are achieved with sidespin by either an in-to-out swingpath or a closed clubface, relative to the swingpath, at impact.|$|R

However, by 2007, {{he was selected}} to open the batting with Sanath Jayasuriya in ODI game against India where he started to showcase himself as an attacking and threatening opening batsman. Since 2007, his <b>stroke</b> <b>play</b> has included a host of aggressive strokes which has allowed him to dominate the ODIs arena on many occasions. Until retirement, he slotted as the permanent opening batsman for Sri Lanka as well as operating as a handy right-arm off-break bowler in both ODI and T20I matches.|$|E

Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, {{was alone in the}} room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you doing}} back here? I told you not to get out tonight'...|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} men's major championships, only The Masters uses a sudden-death playoff format, first used in 1979. The U.S. Open still uses an 18-hole playoff at <b>stroke</b> <b>play</b> {{on the day}} after the main tournament, with sudden-death if two (or more) contestants remain tied after 18 holes. First used in 1989, The Open Championship uses a four-hole total-stroke playoff, while the PGA Championship uses a three-hole total-stroke playoff, first used in 2000. The PGA Championship {{introduced}} the sudden-death playoff to the majors in 1977 and used it seven times through 1996.
