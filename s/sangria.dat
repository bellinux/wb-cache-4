40|$|A água para o consumo humano e animal é um patrimônio cada vez mais escasso que é necessário preservar. O processo de desinfecção utilizado atualmente tem como base desinfetantes clorados, que em combinação com resíduos orgânicos, resultam em trihalometanos (potencialmente oncogênicos). A proposta deste trabalho foi avaliar a citotoxicidade de cinco extratos de plantas, capazes de promover desinfecção da água, frente a seis linhagens celulares, a saber: Vero (ATCC CCl 81) African {{green monkey}} cells; MDBK (ATCC CCL 24) Martin Darby Bonne Kidney cells; MDCK (ATCC CCL 34) Canis familiaris kidney cells; CRFK (ATCC CCL 94) Felix catus kidney cells; PK 15 (ATCC CCL 33) Sus scrofa kidney cells; RK 13 (ATCC CCL 37) Orytolagus cuniculus Kidney cells, e avaliar cultivos celulares mais sensíveis para o teste de toxicidade de extratos de plantas. Destes extratos, o mais tóxico foi o de Erva de Formigueiro (Chenopodium álbum) diante de todas as células testadas. O extrato de chapéu de couro (Sagittaria montevidensis) foi medianamente tóxico e os demais baleeira (Cordia curassavica), folha da fortuna (Bryophyllum pinnatum [Kurz]) e sete <b>sangrias</b> (Cuphea carthagenensis [Jacq. ] J. F. Macbride) foram os menos tóxicos. Este resultado foi estatisticamente significativo (p= 0, 99), quando se comparou o extrato das plantas frente às concentrações e às células estudadas. Entre as células utilizadas, as mais sensíveis foram a VERO (rim de macaco) e a CRFK (rim de gato) quando comparadas com as demais foram (MDBK, MDCK, PK 15, RK 13), com diferença significativa (p= 0, 99). Conclui-se que há necessidade de serem avaliados os extratos vegetais quanto a toxicidade, antes do emprego como recursos de saúde, e que algumas células são mais eficazes que outras na detecção de efeito citopatogênico. Freshwater for {{human and animal}} {{consumption}} is an increasingly rare patrimony {{that needs to be}} preserved. The currently adopted disinfection process uses chloride disinfectants which, combined with organic residues, result in trihalomethane (potentially oncogenic). The aim of this work was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of five plant extracts, capable of promoting water disinfection, against six cell lines: Vero (ATCC CCl 81) African green monkey cells; MDBK (ATCC CCL 24) Martin Darby Bonne kidney cells; MDCK (ATCC CCL 34) Canis familiaris kidney cells; CRFK (ATCC CCL 94) Felix catus kidney cells; PK 15 (ATCC CCL 33) Sus scrofa kidney cells; RK 13 (ATCC CCL 37) Oryctolagus cuniculus kidney cells, as well as to evaluate the most sensitive cell cultures for the toxicity test of plant extracts. The most toxic extract was that of white goosefoot (Chenopodium album) against all tested cells. California arrowhead (Sagittaria montevidensis) extract had median toxicity and extracts of "erva baleeira" (Cordia curassavica), miracle leaf (Bryophyllum pinnatum [Kurz]) and colombian waxweed (Cuphea carthagenensis [Jacq. ] J. F. Macbride) were the least toxic. This finding was statistically significant (p= 0. 99) when the plant extracts were compared regarding the concentrations and the studied cells. The most sensitive cells were VERO (monkey kidney) and CRFK (feline kidney) compared to the others (MDBK, MDCK, PK 15, RK 13), with significant difference (p= 0. 99). In conclusion, plant extracts must be evaluated as to their toxicity before being used as health resources and some cells are more effective than others in the detection of cytopathogenic effects...|$|R
