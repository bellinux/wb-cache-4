The master logs the updates, which then ripple through to the <b>slaves.</b> The <b>slave</b> <b>outputs</b> a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending (and potentially re-sending until successfully applied) of subsequent updates.|$|R
40|$|Hard sync”, {{a form of}} {{oscillator}} synchronization, is {{a technique}} which synthesizes a characteristic rich family of sounds. We describe how to perform it by integrating a bandlimited impulse pattern, avoiding the unpleasant aliasing heard in a naive digital rendering. The synthesis is refined by using a minimum-phase bandlimited step function, which eliminates lookahead and integration. This idea also gives simple bandlimited syntheses of other discontinuous waveforms. 1 What is hard sync? Oscillator synchronization involves two oscillators, a master and a slave, with frequencies f 0 and f 1. We will consider sawtooth oscillators. In hard sync, whenever the master cycles around, it resets the phase of the slave oscillator. The fundamental frequency of the <b>slave’s</b> <b>output,</b> is thus equal to f 0. Figure 1 shows this for a master wavelength of 10 and a slave wavelength of 3. We treat the signal as unipolar, 0 to 1, for simplicity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design of LLC resonant converter IC for LED backlight unit based on PFM/PWM dual-mode feedback. Dual output LLC resonant architecture {{with a single}} inductor is proposed, where the master output {{is controlled by the}} PFM and <b>slave</b> <b>output</b> is controlled by the PWM. To regulate the master output PFM is used as feedback to control the frequency of the power switch. On the other hand, PWM feedback is used to control the pulse width of the power switch and to regulate the <b>slave</b> <b>output.</b> This chip is fabricated in 0. 35 um 2 P 3 M BC(Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS) Process and the die area is 2. 3 mm* 2. 2 MM.

40|$|In this paper, a new soft {{switched}} {{cell that}} overcomes {{most of the}} drawbacks of the normal "hard switched-pulse width modulation" converter is proposed to contrive a new family of soft switched PWM converters. All of the semiconductor devices in this converter are turned on and off under exact or near zero voltage switching (ZVS) and/or zero current switching (ZCS). No additional voltage and current stresses on the main switch and main diode occur. A push-pull converter equipped with the proposed snubber cell is analyzed in detail. The predicted operation principles and theoretical analysis of the presented converter are verified with a prototype of a 50 W PWM push-pull multi-output converter with insulated MOSFET and for regulation of <b>slave</b> <b>outputs</b> magnetic amplifier post regulators are considered as post regulators. Moreover; this multioutput converter has a simple structure, low cost, and ease of control circuitry...|$|R
40|$|A {{velocimeter}} {{was developed}} based on modulated filtered Rayleigh scattering (MFRS). The MFRS velocimeter was successfully demonstrated by making one-component velocity measurements in a supersonic expansion using molecular Rayleigh scattering in a jet of N 2. These measurements {{were made in}} a sweep mode where the Rayleigh scattered profile is cross-correlated with absorption in a static cell to determine velocity. To improve temporal resolution the frequency-locked mode of operation was developed, with an in-situ referencing scheme to compensate for signal fluctuations arising from density variations in the probe volume. Spectroscopic grade (i. e. continuously tunable, single-mode) laser sources with high power (greater than 100 mW) are not commercially available at the wavelength of interest (780 nm). We developed an all-solid-state system with a low power (approximately 10 mW) spectroscopic grade laser source in a Littrow cavity is amplified by a broad-area diode laser. We have demonstrated that the <b>slaved</b> <b>output</b> tracks the injected input but have not yet demonstrated power gain {{by the end of}} the grant period...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a secondary-side, dual-mode feedback LLC resonant controller IC with dynamic PWM dimming for LED backlight units. In {{order to reduce}} the cost, master and <b>slave</b> <b>outputs</b> can be generated simultaneously with a single LLC resonant core based on dual-mode feedback topologies. Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM) and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) schemes are used for the master stage and slave stage, respectively. In order to guarantee the correct dual feedback operation, Phased-Locked Loop (PLL) -based automatic duty control circuit is proposed in this paper. The chip is fabricated using 0. 35 μm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology, and the die size is 2. 5 mm × 2. 5 mm. The frequency of the gate driver (GDA/GDB) in the clock generator ranges from 50 to 425 kHz. The current consumption of the LLC resonant controller IC is 40 mA for a 100 kHz operation frequency using a 15 V supply. The duty ratio of the slave stage can be controlled from 40 % to 60 % independent of the frequency of the master stage...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{synchronization}} region of two unidirectionally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo systems, in a master-slave configuration, {{under the influence}} of external forcing terms. In the particular region where the slave anticipates the dynamics of the master system, we observe that the synchronization is robust to the different types of forcings. We then use the predict-prevent control method to suppress unwanted pulses in the master system by using the information of the <b>slave</b> <b>output.</b> We find that this method is more efficient than the direct control method based on the master dynamics. Finally, we observe that a perfect matching between the parameters of the master and the slave is not necessary for the control to be efficient. Moreover, this parameter mismatch can, in some cases, improve the control. © 2012 American Physical Society.

40|$|We {{describe}} a high-power, frequency-tunable, external cavity diode laser (ECDL) system near 626 nm useful for laser cooling of trapped ^ 9 Be^+ ions. A commercial single-mode laser diode with {{rated power output}} of 170 mW at 635 nm is cooled to ≈ - 31 C, and a single longitudinal mode is selected via the Littrow configuration. In our setup, involving multiple stages of thermoelectric cooling, {{we are able to}} obtain ≈ 130 mW near 626 nm, sufficient for efficient frequency doubling to the required Doppler cooling wavelengths near 313 nm in ionized Beryllium. In order to improve nonlinear frequency conversion efficiency, we achieve larger useful power via injection locking of a slave laser. In this way the entirety of the <b>slave</b> <b>output</b> power is available for frequency doubling, while analysis may be performed on the master output. We believe that this simple laser system addresses a key need in the ion trapping community and dramatically reduces the cost and complexity associated with Beryllium ion trapping experiments.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{algorithm}} based on model following control {{to recover the}} uncompensated slave disturbance on time delayed motion control systems having contact with environment. In the previous works, a modified Communication Disturbance Observer (CDOB) was shown {{to be successful in}} ensuring position tracking in free motion under varying time delay. However, experiments show that due to the imperfections in slave plant Disturbance Observer (DOB) when there is rapid change of external force on the slave side, {{as in the case of}} environment contact, position tracking is degraded. This paper first analyzes the effect of environment contact for motion control systems with disturbance observers. Following this analysis, a model following controller scheme is proposed to restore the ideal motion on the slave system. A virtual plant is introduced which accepts the current from the master side and determines what the position output would be if there was no environment. Based on the error bet ween actual system and model system, a discrete time sliding mode controller is designed which enforces the real slave system to track the virtual <b>slave</b> <b>output.</b> In other words, convergence of slave position to the master position is achieved even though there is contact with environment. Experimental verification of the proposed control scheme also shows the improvement in slave position tracking under contact forces...|$|E

When ready for data, the slave end will raise its complementary line, CTS in this example, which signals the master to start sending data, and for the master to begin monitoring the <b>slave's</b> data <b>output</b> line. If either end needs to stop the data, it lowers its respective [...] "data readyness" [...] line.|$|R

40|$|High side-mode {{suppression}} ratio (SMSR) and higher optical power output of frequency converted lightwave is successfully realized by {{single side band}} injection locking of distributed feedback laser (DFB). This method is of great potential {{in the application of}} fast optical frequency sweep signal generation. Compared to that acquired from direct carrier suppressed single sideband (CS-SSB), the SMSR of the injection locked slave laser by single sideband injection locking is much higher (32. 5 dB to 12 dB at best), {{and the power of the}} injection locked <b>slave</b> laser <b>output</b> is 11 dB higher (- 22 dBm to - 33. 5 dBm) than converting directly from CS-SSB.

50|$|The {{second issue}} {{deals with the}} use of IRQ2 and IRQ9 from the {{introduction}} of a slave 8259 in the PC/AT. The <b>slave</b> 8259's INT <b>output</b> is connected to the master's IR2. The IRQ2 line of the ISA bus, originally connected to this IR2, was rerouted to IR1 of the slave. Thus the old IRQ2 line now generates IRQ9 in the CPU. To allow backwards compatibility with DOS device drivers that still set up for IRQ2, a handler is installed by the BIOS for IRQ9 that redirects interrupts to the original IRQ2 handler.|$|R

This occurred both because of the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate in the 1800s which increased the agricultural trade and introduced large-scale slave plantations to the region {{and as a result of}} exorbitant taxes leveled by the Bornu authorities which caused free people in the empire to purchase <b>slaves</b> to increase <b>output</b> and pay taxes.|$|R

40|$|Many new {{applications}} of the Global Positioning System (GPS) are required to process weak GPS signals {{in the presence of}} other strong GPS signals. Unfortunately, the 1023 chip Gold code sequences used for the GPS C/A spreading codes limit the dynamic range of a typical GPS receiver such that the power difference between the strongest and weakest GPS signal is limited to less than 21 dB. When this condition is not satisfied, the multiple access interference (MAI) experienced can cause difficulties, ranging from poor measurement quality through to weak signal acquisition and tracking failures. This research investigates cross correlation mitigation (CCM) using digital signal processing performed within the GPS receiver, with the following research contributions: a) 	Development of a novel CCM technique called Adaptive Orthogonalisation Using Constraints in which the de-spreading code used to track the GPS signal is dynamically adjusted to reject MAI from other strong GPS signals. Computer simulations as well as a full C implementation using a software correlator were performed and the software correlator tested using GPS IF samples captured from a GPS receiver connected to a hardware GPS simulator. The limitations of this technique were also analysed. b) 	Development of a CCM technique called Delayed Parallel Interference Cancellation (DPIC) in which slave channels are employed to estimate the MAI between pairs of strong and weak signals, with the <b>slave</b> channel <b>outputs</b> subtracted from the weak signal correlations following appropriate scaling. Thorough performance characterisation of the technique was performed using computer simulations. The algorithm was validated using both a C software correlator and a Verilog hardware correlator by processing MAI affected signals generated using a hardware GPS simulator. A comparison of DPIC with other related methods is also provided. c) 	Development of 'on-the-fly' data bit estimation for data bit estimation as required for subtractive type CCM techniques such as DPIC and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). d) 	Development of a comb-filtering statistical technique to indicate the presence of MAI and continuous wave interference (CWI). Algorithms enabling calculation of detection thresholds using the comb-filter noise statistic (CFNS) are also presented and validated using computer simulations...|$|R
