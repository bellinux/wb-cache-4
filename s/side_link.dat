40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a grasping strategy of unknown objects imitating human grasping reflex for anthropomorphic robot hands. In the proposed grasping, each joint of the thumb and the fingers is controlled independently using the contact force affecting its adjacent fingertip <b>side</b> <b>link.</b> By setting a suitable contact force, both fingertip grasping and enveloped grasping with uniform grasping force are executable. Experimental results of three-dimensional unknown object grasping using an anthropomorphic robot hand, named Gifu Hand, with a distributed tactile sensor, are shown. Copyright © 2002 IFA...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigate}} the adsorption {{and growth of}} thin films of N-heteroaromatic acids and related molecules on Ag(111) surface. The N-heteroaromatic acids have ring-nitrogen and carboxylic groups. Hence, two primary hydrogen bond motifs are observed in their bulk crystal structures: head-to-tail hydrogen bond and tail-to-tail hydrogen bond. Furthermore, the high electron density of the aromatic rings increases the complexity of their electrostatic properties. The surface structure thus reflects the delicate balance between the intermolecular interactions and adsorbate-substrate interactions. 	The surface adsorption model of isonicotinic acid (INA) is suggested based upon the STM and XPS study. The monolayer structure is stabilized by the head-to-tail hydrogen bonds along direction and weak <b>side</b> <b>link</b> hydrogen bonds. 12 rotational/reflection domains c 0 -exist on the surface. Using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), the layer-dependent orientation of the isonicotinic acid is determined. In the first monolayer, INA molecules are qseudo-parallel to the metal surface. The second and third layers possesses a combined twist (~ 20 °) and tilt (~ 10 °) orientation. This incline angle is contributed to the slight distortion (0. 2 %) along <b>side</b> <b>link</b> hydrogen bond direction upon the registration to the substrate. 	With two additional aromatic rings, 9 -acridine carboxylic acid (ACA) possesses a greater quadrupole. The surface structure is thus affected. The main interaction is still head-to-tail hydrogen bonding. However, electrostatic interactions are the main interactions to connect the head-to-tail chains. RAIR spectra reveal that at low coverage, the mobile species are head-to-tail linked. A proposed orientation of the monolayer films are given based upon the characteristic vibrational frequencies. The vibrational spectra of Anthroic acid (AA) is also done for the comparison reason. The orientation difference between the ACA monolayer and the AA monolayer are contribute to their electronic properties...|$|E

30|$|Conventional data uses {{anonymity}} {{techniques to}} hide personal {{information that can}} cause <b>side</b> <b>link</b> attacks. Anonymization methods, based on k-anonymity, have been widely employed for such purposes [1]. These methods fall into two broad categories. The first category constitutes of techniques that generalize data {{from the bottom of}} the taxonomy tree towards its top and are referred to as the bottom-up generalization (BUG) [2]. The second one is based on walking through the taxonomy tree from the top towards the bottom, known as the top-down specialization (TDS) [3]. However, traditional anonymization methods lack scalability and cannot, in general, cope with large sizes of data, as their performance degrades. Hence, a need for scaling up of the conventional methods is essential. Scaling up the conventional methods has resulted in several amendments to these fundamental techniques, including parallel BUG [4], hybrid BUG and TDS [5], and two-phase TDS [6].|$|E
