5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in <b>sixth</b> <b>class,</b> around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E

25|$|Brassinosteroids - are a {{class of}} polyhydroxysteroids, a group of plant growth regulators. Brassinosteroids have been {{recognized}} as a <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> of plant hormones, which stimulate cell elongation and division, gravitropism, resistance to stress, and xylem differentiation. They inhibit root growth and leaf abscission. Brassinolide was the first identified brassinosteroid and was isolated from extracts of rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen in 1979.|$|E

2500|$|Because International Telecommunication Union (ITU) {{regulations}} still required {{proficiency in}} Morse telegraphy for operation below 30MHz, new Technicians were allowed all modes and bands above 50MHz. [...] If a Technician passed {{any of the}} contemporary Morse tests, he or she gained access to the so-called Novice HF privileges, essentially [...] "upgrading" [...] to what a Tech had before the new rules went into effect. [...] This new, <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> had no name until the FCC started calling them [...] "Technician Plus" [...] in 1994. With a code-free class now available, Technician class became a second entry class, eventually surpassing the number of Novice class license holders.|$|E

In the fifth, they learn grammar and begin upon a series of halachic {{excerpts}} from the Talmud, the text being in Hebrew and the explanations in the vernacular. Before the approach of a holy day they memorize the laws in the Shulchan Aruch pertaining to that holy day. The <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> is preparatory to the yeshivah in the bet ha-midrash and is conducted by the ḥakam-rabbi. In this class every day one halachah, with the commentaries of Rashi and the Tosafot, is studied, and compared with the conclusions in the codes of Maimonides, Asheri, and Caro.|$|E

2500|$|Recognizing her stature in the {{speculative}} fiction genre, Le Guin was the Professional Guest of Honor at the 1975 World Science Fiction Convention in Melbourne, Australia. That {{year she}} was also named the sixth Gandalf Award Grand Master of fantasy. The Science Fiction Research Association (SFRA) gave her its Pilgrim Award in 1989 for her [...] "lifetime contributions to SF and fantasy scholarship". At the 1995 World Fantasy Convention she won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, a judged recognition of outstanding service to the fantasy field. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted her in 2001, its <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> of two deceased and two living writers. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made her its 20th Grand Master in 2003. In 2010, Le Guin was awarded the Lyman Tower Sargent Distinguished Scholar Award by the North American Society for Utopian Studies.|$|E
2500|$|They {{described}} a six-point scale, {{ranging from a}} healthy person (class 1) to one with an extreme systemic disorder that is an imminent threat to life (class 4). The first four points of their scale roughly correspond to today's ASA classes 1-4, which were first published in 1963. The original authors included two classes that encompassed emergencies which {{otherwise would have been}} coded in either the first two classes (class 5) or the second two (class 6). By the time of the 1963 publication of the present classification, two modifications were made. First, previous classes 5 and 6 were removed and a new class 5 was added for moribund persons not expected to survive 24 hours, with or without surgery. Second, separate classes for emergencies were eliminated in lieu of the [...] "E" [...] modifier of the other classes. [...] The <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> is now used for declared brain-dead organ donors. Saklad gave examples of each class of patient in an attempt to encourage uniformity. Unfortunately, the ASA did not later describe each category with examples of patients and thus actually increased confusion.|$|E

50|$|The {{third floor}} {{contained}} a 400-seat hall, {{and the first}} two floors, 12 classrooms. From the beginning, the school was thought unsuitable being too dark, noisy (from the constant stream of electrically powered street cars) and too far from West Newton Street. The remaining fifth and <b>sixth</b> <b>classes</b> walked the two mile (3 km) round trip twice each month to attend school assemblies.|$|R

60|$|The Court Painter of His Majesty the King of Crim Tartary {{returned}} to that monarch's dominions, carrying away {{a number of}} sketches which he had made in the Paflagonian capital (you know, of course, my dears, that {{the name of that}} capital is Blombodinga); but the most charming of all his pieces was a portrait of the Princess Angelica, which all the Crim Tartar nobles came to see. With this work the King was so delighted, that he decorated the Painter with his Order of the Pumpkin (<b>sixth</b> <b>class)</b> and the artist became Sir Tomaso Lorenzo, K.P., thenceforth.|$|E
60|$|THE {{increase}} of the towns of Manhattan, as, {{for the sake of}} convenience, we shall term New York and her adjuncts, in all that contributes to the importance of a great commercial mart, renders them {{one of the most remarkable}} places of the present age. Within the distinct recollections of living men, they have grown from a city of the fifth or <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> to be near the head of all the purely trading places of the known world. That there are sufficient causes for this unparalleled prosperity, will appear in the analysis of the natural advantages of the port, in its position, security, accessories, and scale.|$|E
60|$|CLASS I.—In this class, {{the young}} {{of both sexes}} resemble, more or less closely, the adult female, whilst the adult male differs, often in the most {{conspicuous}} manner, from the adult female. Innumerable instances in all Orders could be given; it will suffice to call to mind the common pheasant, duck, and house-sparrow. The cases under this class graduate into others. Thus the two sexes when adult may differ so slightly, and the young so slightly from the adults, that it is doubtful whether such cases ought to come under the present, or under {{the third or fourth}} classes. So again the young of both sexes, instead of being quite alike, may differ in a slight degree from each other, as in our <b>sixth</b> <b>class.</b> These transitional cases, however, are few in number, or at least are not strongly pronounced, in comparison with those which come strictly under the present class.|$|E
50|$|The Primary Certificate Examination (1929-1967) was the {{terminal}} examination {{at this level}} until the first primary-school curriculum, Curaclam na Bunscoile (1971), was introduced, though informal standardised tests are still performed. The primary school system consists of eight years: Junior and Senior Infants, and First to <b>Sixth</b> <b>Classes.</b> Most children attend primary school {{between the ages of}} four and twelve although it is not compulsory until the age of six.

So even now I cannot say I have seen anybody die. A {{few days before the}} end, some young men found us out in our extremity. They were revolutionists, {{as you might}} guess. He ought to have trusted in his political friends when he came out of prison. He had been liked and respected before, and nobody would have dreamed of reproaching him with his indiscretion before the police. Everybody knows how they go to work, and the strongest man has his moments of weakness before pain. Why, even hunger alone is enough to give one queer ideas as to what may be done. A doctor came, our lot was alleviated as far as physical comforts go, but otherwise he could not be consoled--poor man. I assure you, Miss Haldin, that he was very lovable, but I had not the strength to weep. I was nearly dead myself. But there were kind hearts to take care of me. A dress was found to clothe my nakedness. I tell you, I was not decent--and after a time the revolutionists placed me with a Jewish family going abroad, as governess. Of course I could teach the children, I finished the <b>sixth</b> <b>class</b> of the Lyceum; but the real object was, that I should carry some important papers across the frontier. I was entrusted with a packet which I carried next my heart. The gendarmes at the station did not suspect the governess of a Jewish family, busy looking after three children. I don't suppose those Hebrews knew what I had on me, for I had been introduced to them in a very roundabout way by persons who did not belong to the revolutionary movement, and naturally I had been instructed to accept a very small salary. When we reached Germany I left that family and delivered my papers to a revolutionist in Stuttgart; after this I was employed in various ways. But {{you do not want to}} hear all that. I have never felt that I was very useful, but I live in hopes of seeing all the Ministries destroyed, finances and all. The greatest joy of my life has been to hear what your brother has done." ...|$|E
