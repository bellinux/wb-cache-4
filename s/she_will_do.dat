25|$|Chimène {{is alone}} in {{a room in the}} palace and is torn apart by {{conflicting}} emotions: love, desire for revenge and honour. But she vows to avenge her father (Scene 1). The king enters and tries to console Chimène, treating her as his own daughter: he declares how fond he was of her dead father, but also reveals the respect in which everyone holds Rodrigue, the one man capable of leading the fight against the Moors. Nevertheless, the king promises to capture and punish her father's killer (Scene 2). Left alone with her maids, Chimène reveals her undying love for Rodrigue. She adored him before the fatal duel, and now that fate has divided them and all hope is dead, their love still remains intact. Nevertheless, she says <b>she</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> what honour demands, and the more she loves Rodrigue, the more she will seek to punish him (Scene 3). The next scene is taken up by a dramatic duet between Chimène and Rodrigue, who has just arrived: he begs her to kill him, but she fails to follow through with her vow of revenge, and the two are left in despair (Scene 4). Alone again, Rodrigue contemplates death (Scene 5), until he is met by his father and his followers, and asked to march against the army of the Moors which has just laid siege to the city. If he is to die, he should do so nobly for his king and country. Encouraged by his father's words, Rodrigue agrees to fight and the first act ends with a martial chorus (Scene 6).|$|E

Louise denied the rumour, claiming that it was started by Beatrice and Helena to undermine her position at court. However, on Henry's death, relations between the sisters sporadically improved, and it was Louise, rather than the Queen, who was the first to arrive at Cimiez to be with the widowed Beatrice. Nevertheless, Louise's jealousy did not evaporate completely. James Reid, the Queen's physician, wrote to his wife a few years later: [...] "Louise is as usual much down on her sisters.

Stanton insisted, however, that the women's rights conventions were too narrowly focused; she brought forward a variety of challenging concepts {{in the form of}} essays for Anthony to read to the audiences. When Stanton made known her interest in completing The Woman's Bible, Anthony was unhappy at the futility of the effort, a harmful digression from the focused path which led to woman suffrage.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't {{know how much of}} it was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something <b>she</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> in real life." ...|$|E

[...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] You {{never have to worry about}} giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This Is My Life, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This Is My Life, said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking.
