40|$|Blind <b>source</b> {{separation}} algorithms typically {{require that}} the number of <b>sources</b> are known in advance. However, it is often the case {{that the number of}} <b>sources</b> change over time and that the total number is not known. Existing <b>source</b> separation techniques require <b>source</b> number estimation methods to determine how many <b>sources</b> are active within the mixture signals. These methods typically operate on the covariance matrix of mixture recordings and require fewer active <b>sources</b> than mixtures. When <b>sources</b> do not overlap in the timefrequency domain, more <b>sources</b> than mixtures may be detected and then separated. However, separating more <b>sources</b> than mixtures when <b>sources</b> overlap in time and frequency poses a particularly difficult problem. This paper addresses the issue of <b>source</b> detection when more <b>sources</b> than sensors overlap in time and frequency. We show that repetitive structure in the form of time-time correlation matrices can reveal when each <b>source</b> is active. 1...|$|R

5000|$|A {{dependent}} <b>source</b> is {{a current}} <b>source</b> or voltage <b>source</b> {{that depends on}} the voltage or current of another element in the circuit. When a dependent <b>source</b> is contained within an essential mesh, the dependent <b>source</b> should be treated like an independent <b>source.</b> After the mesh equation is formed, a dependent <b>source</b> equation is needed.
