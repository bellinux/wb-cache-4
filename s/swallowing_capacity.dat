40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} postoperative oral functions of patients who had undergone total or subtotal (75 %) glossectomy with preservation of the larynx for oral squamous cell carcinomas. METHODS: Speech intelligibility and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> of 17 patients who had been treated between 1992 and 2002 were scored and classified using standard protocols 6 to 36 months postoperatively. The outcomes were finally rated as good, acceptable, or poor. RESULTS: The 4 -year disease-specific survival rate was 64 %. Speech intelligibility and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> were satisfactory (acceptable or good) in 82. 3 %. Only 3 patients were still dependent on tube feeding. Good speech perceptibility did not always go together with normal diet tolerance, however. CONCLUSIONS: Our satisfactory results are attributable to the use of large, voluminous soft tissue flaps for reconstruction, and to the instigation of postoperative swallowing and speech therapy on a routine basis and at an early juncture.

40|$|We studied {{clinical}} features potentially related to dysphagia and three indices from a timed test of swallowing—average volume per swallow (ml), average time (s) per swallow and swallowing capa-city (ml/s) —in 181 screened healthy adults and 30 patients with {{motor neurone disease}} (MND). In healthy adults, age, sex and height accounted for 44. 3 % and 55. 6 % of the variance of log average volume per swallow and log <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity,</b> respectively. Symptoms and signs were more preval-ent in the MND group and were associated with reduced <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> and reduced average volume per swallow; repeatability studies on these two indices in both groups showed that the median difference between the mean of two recordings on successive days and the mean of all recordings (6 - 15 over 3 days) was < 5 % (maximum third quartile 12. 8 %, indices expressed as percent predicted according to age and sex). Using this simple bedside test, swallowing function can be quantified on a ratio scale and expressed as percent of that pre-dicted by age and sex; such information may improve the predictive value of clinical assessment and provides a practical way of monitoring change in patients with dysphagia...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a {{variable}} geometry (VG) mixed flow turbine with a novel, purposely designed pivoting nozzle vane ring. The nozzle vane ring was matched to the 3 -dimensional {{aspect of the}} mixed flow rotor leading edge with lean stacking. It was found that for a nozzle vane ring in a volute, the vane surface pressure is highly affected by the flow in the volute rather than the adjacent vane surface interactions, especially at closer nozzle positions. The performance of the VG mixed flow turbine has been evaluated experimentally in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The VG mixed flow turbine shows higher peak efficiency and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> at various vane angle settings compared to an equivalent nozzleless turbine. Comparison with an equivalent straight vane arrangement shows a higher <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> but similar efficiencies. The VG turbine unsteady performance was found to deviate substantially from the quasi-steady assumption compared to a nozzleless turbine. This is more evident in the higher vane angle settings (smaller nozzle passage), where there are high possibility of choking during a pulse cycle. The presented steady and unsteady results {{are expected to be}} beneficial in the design of variable geometry turbochargers, especially the ones with a mixed flow turbin...|$|E
40|$|To {{review a}} series of 23 {{consecutive}} patients with squamous cell carcinomas arising from oropharynx who underwent infra hyoid musculo-cutaneous flap reconstruction including soft palate in alternative to free radial forearm flap or maxillofacial prosthesis. Post operative radiotherapy was performed for all patients. Every reconstruction healed quickly without major wound complications. The functional results evaluated by speech and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacities,</b> were good for 17 patients, fair for 4 patients and bad for 2. The infra hyoid musculo-cutaneous flap is a versatile, reliable and convenient flap suitable for repairing small and medium sized defects; {{it can be used}} in combination with other flaps, and in selected cases obviates the need for a microvascular free radial forearm flap or maxillofacial prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances in {{swallowing}} {{are common}} in neurologic disease but difficult to evaluate in the clinical setting. Fundamental variables such as bolus volume, <b>swallow</b> <b>capacity</b> (volume ingested over time), and the relation between ingestion and time for important events in oral and pharyngeal swallowing have not been sufficiently studied. We therefore employed a composite method for monitoring oral and pharyngeal swallowing function: the test of Repetitive Oral Suction Swallow (the ROSS test). The technical details are described as well as preliminary results from a pilot study of 20 healthy subjects and 5 patients with neurologic swallowing impairment. The correlation with respect to time sequences for major events in bolus ingestion and oral processing as monitored by the ROSS test and by videoradiography is explained. With this simple and rapid bedside test, the immediate and long-time result of therapeutic interventions in dysphagic patients may be monitored...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} role of class IV laser therapy in the amelioration of nutritional status of patients affected by oral mucositis due to radiotherapy {{of the head and}} neck region during oncological treatment. METHODS: Sixty-three oncological patients were included in this study. All patients were affected by tumors in the head and neck region and had developed oral mucositis during radiotherapy. Forty-two patients had been treated by high-power laser therapy whereas 21 patients had been managed with traditional medications. Data collection included weight measurement (kilogram) and body mass index (BMI) calculation (mass (kilogram) /(height) (square meter)) on the first and last day of radiotherapy. In addition, gender, age, pathology, and the kind of oncological treatment have been considered. RESULTS: Laser-treated patients decreased less in BMI during radiotherapy (p[*]=[*] 0. 000). Patients treated by combined oncological treatments (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy and/or surgery) had a higher weight loss during radiotherapy (p[*]=[*] 0. 015). According to a multivariate regression analysis, the only variable which significantly influenced the reduction of BMI was laser treatment (p[*]=[*] 0. 000). CONCLUSIONS: Laser therapy is actually considered one of the recommended remedies for the healing of oral mucositis due to cancer treatments. Healing of mucositis can deeply influence the feeding capacity of patients, through reduction of pain and improvement of chewing and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacities.</b> It also allows lowering the costs for hospitalization and supportive care. Laser therapy should become part of nutritional interventions in oncological patients affected by oral mucositis...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Comparar o desempenho de idosos brasileiros, residentes em uma instituição de longa permanência, no teste de deglutição de 100 ml de água com os resultados obtidos em idosos ingleses. MÉTODOS: Dezoito idosos residentes numa instituição de longa permanência, considerados normais para a função de deglutição (13 mulheres e cinco homens, com idade média de 83, 46 anos) foram solicitados a beber 100 ml de água de um copo plástico, reproduzindo o estudo inglês. O avaliador observou lateralmente o número de goles, tempo gasto e intercorrências, gerando três índices: volume por deglutição (ml), tempo por deglutição (s) e capacidade de deglutição (ml/s). RESULTADOS: A capacidade de deglutição para homens foi menor do que a das mulheres, divergindo do estudo original. O tempo médio de cada deglutição e o volume médio por deglutição foi semelhante para ambos os gêneros. CONCLUSÃO: A capacidade de deglutição em idosos é {{inferior}} à de adultos normais, indicando lentificação da deglutição. A diferença entre gêneros encontrada no estudo original não foi reproduzida, entretanto nossa amostra foi mais idosa. PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} performance of Brazilian elderly patients living in a long-term care facility on the 100 ml water swallowing test with the results obtained with British elderly. METHODS: Eighteen elderly subjects (13 women and five men, mean age 83. 46), residents in a long-term care facility and considered normal regarding the swallowing function, were selected {{to take part in}} this study. As in a British study, they were laterally observed by the examiner while swallowing 100 ml of water from a plastic cup. The examiner observed the number of sips, the time taken, and complications during the test, which generated the following indices: volume per swallow (ml), time per swallow (s), and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> (ml/s). RESULTS: The elderly men had lower <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> than the women in the research, oppositely from the original British study. The mean time per swallow and the mean volume per swallow were similar for both genders. CONCLUSION: The <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> in elderly subjects is lower than that of normal adults, suggesting slowing in the deglutition process. The difference between genders reported in the original study was not found in the present study; however, our sample was older...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For {{many years}} {{there has been}} {{interest}} in the possibility of enhancing the performance of wind turbines by encasing them in a duct or ‘shroud’, but practical considerations have prevented commercial realization. While this possibility is not ruled out, more benecial schemes for shrouding may well arise for water turbines in tidal streams. In this paper, the performance of a shrouded turbine has been analysed using one-dimensional theory by treating the ducts upstream and downstream of the turbine as contractions or expansions having specied diffusion efciencies. It is shown that, for given diffuser efciencies, there is an optimum turbine resistance for generating maximum power, because the <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the duct is increased as the resistance decreases. Simple experiments with static resistance elements in the duct have conrmed this theory for the <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> and shown that there is little to be gained by controlled diffusion at inlet. However, efcient controlled diffusion at outlet can lead to power enhancements of more than 30 per cent over an optimized turbine of the same area in the freestream. To achieve this, a more lightly loaded turbine must be utilized. Claims in the literature of much greater enhancements than this are sometimes made in relation to non-optimized conditions for the freestream case. The alternative requirement, that maximum power should be extracted from a given inlet area, is also analysed and shown to require a highly loaded turbine...|$|E
40|$|The pulse flow {{performance}} of a turbocharger turbine {{is known to be}} different than its corresponding steady flow performance. This often leads to less-than-satisfactory 1 D engine model prediction. In this study, the effectiveness of a 1 D pulse flow turbine model is assessed against experimental data with the aid of 3 D CFD model. The turbine under study is a single-entry variable geometry mixed-flow turbine. The result shows highly comparable pulse flow <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> and actual power characteristics between 1 D and 3 D models. The over-prediction in 1 D actual power magnitude is found to be due to the simplification of combining nozzle and rotor stage pressure loss together...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{prospective}} study of 100 consecutive stroke patients. Within 24 h after stroke onset {{they were asked}} specifically about swallowing complaints and subjected to a clinical examination including neurologic examination, Mini-Mental test, and Barthel score. Dysphagic patients were examined with the repetitive oral suction swallow test (the ROSS test) for quantitative evaluation of oral and pharyngeal function at 24 h, after 1 week, and after 1 month. At 6 months, the patients were interviewed about persistent dysphagia. Seventy-two patients could respond reliably at 24 h after the stroke onset and 14 of these complained of dysphagia. Non-evaluable patients were either unconscious, aphasic, or demented. The presence of dysphagia was not influenced by age or other risk factors for stroke. Facial paresis, but no other clinical findings, were associated with dysphagia. Dysphagia 24 h after stroke increased the risk of pneumonia but did not influence the length of hospital stay, the manner of discharge from hospital, or the mortality. The initial ROSS test, during which the seated patient ingests water through a straw, was abnormal in all dysphagic stroke patients. One-third of the patients were unable to perform the test completely. Above all, dysfunction was disclosed during forced, repetitive swallow. All phases of the ingestion cycle were prolonged whereas the suction pressures, bolus volumes, and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacities</b> were low. Abnormalities of quantitative swallowing variables decreased with time whereas the prevalences of swallowing incoordination and abnormal feeding-respiratory pattern became more frequent. After 6 months, 7 patients had persistent dysphagia. Five of these were initially non-evaluable because of unconsciousness, aphasia, or dementia...|$|R

40|$|Few {{data support}} thermal or {{chemical}} stimulation as therapy for neurogenic dysphagia. Our aims were {{to explore the}} behavioural effects of thermal (cold) and chemical (citrus) modalities on water swallowing in healthy subjects (n= 65; mean age, 45 years; 44 females) and acute stroke patients (n= 22; mean age, 67 years; 8 females) [UK]. Multiple randomized timed 50 -ml swallowing tests were performed for each of 4 water conditions: (1) room temperature (RT), (2) cold (CD), (3) citrus (CT) and (4) combined cold and citrus (CD + CT). The inter-swallow interval (ISI), swallowing volume velocity (speed) and volume per <b>swallow</b> (<b>capacity)</b> were measured. In healthy subjects, only CD + CT, as compared to RT, slowed the speed (12. 3 &# 177; 0. 5 vs. 10. 3 &# 177; 0. 5 ml/s, P&# 60; 0. 03) and decreased the capacity (16. 4 &# 177; 0. 9 vs. 14. 6 &# 177; 0. 7 ml per swallow, P&# 60; 0. 02) of swallowing. ISI was unaffected, except by CD + CT in healthy young subjects (&# 60; 60 years) where it was reduced (1. 44 &# 177; 0. 02 vs. 1. 30 &# 177; 0. 02 s, P&# 60; 0. 02). Despite smaller volumes ingested by stroke patients, CD + CT, compared to RT, slowed both the speed (3. 8 &# 177; 0. 4 vs. 4. 5 &# 177; 0. 5 ml/s, P&# 60; 0. 03) and capacity (7. 6 &# 177; 0. 7 vs. 8. 5 &# 177; 0. 7 ml per swallow, P&# 60; 0. 03) of swallowing but {{had no effect on}} ISI. We concluded that combined thermal and chemical modification of water consistently alters swallowing behaviour in healthy and acute stroke patients.

40|$|Aims The aims of {{the thesis}} were to {{validate}} investigation instruments for stroke patients with dysphagia, and to improve oropharyngeal dysphagia therapies. Methods/Results A Lip Force Meter, LF 100, affirmed excellent intra- and inter-reliability, sensitivity and specificity. Controls had significantly stronger lip force (LF) and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> (SC) than stroke patients. A normal lower limit of LF was set to 15 Newton. Dysphagia symptoms improved in 7 stroke patients after a 5 -week sensorimotor stimulation therapy comprising manual body and facial regulation in combination with palatal plate application. Impaired LF and impaired SC were parallel phenomena in 22 acute stroke patients and did not differ regardless of {{presence or absence of}} facial palsy. LF and SC improved and were parallel phenomena in 30 stroke patients and did not differ regardless of presence or absence of facial palsy, time lag between stroke attack and start of treatment, or age. SC was normalized in 19 of 30 dysphagia patients after a 5 - 8 -week daily lip muscle self-training with an oral screen. Conclusions LF 100 is an appropriate and reliable instrument for measuring lip force. Dysphagia improvement, by body and facial sensorimotor stimulation in combination with palatal plate application, or by training with an oral screen is excellent examples of brain plasticity and cortical reorganisation.. <b>Swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> and lip force in stroke patients are parallel phenomena. A sub clinical facial paresis seems to be present in most stroke patients. Training with an oral screen can improve LF and SC in stroke patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} taste and oral anaesthesia on human sequential swallowing. Subjects were healthy adults (n = 42, mean age 28 years, 21 females), investigated {{by means of a}} water swallow test. Taste stimuli comprised quinine, glucose, citrus and saline solutions compared with neutral water. Oral anaesthesia comprised topical lidocaine at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg and compared with placebo. Data were collected on swallowing speed (volume per second), inter-swallow interval and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> (volume per swallow). Compared with water, glucose, citrus and saline reduced swallowing speed (10. 94 ± 0. 89 versus 9. 56 ± 0. 79, 9. 33 ± 1. 19, 9. 37 ± 0. 92 ml/s respectively, P < 0. 05). Inter-swallow interval was increased only by quinine and saline (1. 47 ± 1. 11 versus 2. 13 ± 0. 34 and 1. 92 ± 0. 31 s, P < 0. 04). <b>Swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> was only marginally increased by quinine (P = 0. 0759). Compared with the placebo, only 40 mg of lidocaine altered swallowing, immediately re-ducing the swallowing speed (7. 89 ± 2. 34 versus 10. 11 ± 3. 26 ml/s, P < 0. 05) and increasing inter-swallow interval (1. 67 ± 0. 38 versus 1. 45 ± 0. 29 s, P < 0. 01) without affecting capacity. By 15 min all measures except sensory thresholds had returned to baseline values. Thus, swallowing function is highly influenced by chemosensory input, providing insight into how oral sensation regulates pharyngeal swallowing...|$|E

40|$|The {{current work}} investigates a {{circumferentially}} divided turbine volute designed such that each gas inlet feeds a separate {{section of the}} turbine wheel. Although {{there is a small}} connecting interspace formed between the nozzle and the mixed-flow rotor inlet, this design does well to preserve the exhaust gas energy in a pulsed-charged application by largely isolating the two streams entering the turbine. However, this type of volute design produces some interesting flow features as a result of unequal flows driving the turbine wheel. To investigate the influence of unequal flows, experimental data from the turbocharger facility at Imperial College have been gathered over a wide range of steadystate, unequal admission conditions. These test results show a significant drop in turbine performance with increasing pressure difference between inlets. In addition, the <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacities</b> of each gas inlet are interdependent, thus indicating some flow interaction between entries. To understand the flow physics driving the observed performance, a full 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the turbine was created. Results show a highly disturbed flow field {{as a consequence of the}} nonuniform admission. From these results, it is possible to identify the regions of aerodynamic loss responsible for the measured performance decrease. Given the unequal flows present in a double-entry design, each rotor passage sees an abrupt change in flow conditions as it rotates spanning the two feeding sectors. This operation introduces a high degree of unsteady flow into the rotor passage even when it operates in steady conditions. The amplitude and frequency of this unsteadiness will depend both on the level of unequal admission and the speed of rotor rotation. The reduced frequency associated with this disturbance supports the evidence that the flow in the rotor passage is unsteady. Furthermore, the CFD model indicates that the blade passage flow is unable to fully develop in the time available to travel between the two different sectors (entries) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of 4 -month of {{respiratory}} muscle training on pulmonary and <b>swallowing</b> function, exercise <b>capacity</b> and dyspnoea in manifest patients with Huntingtons disease. Design: A pilot randomised controlled trial. Setting: Home based training program. Participants: Eighteen manifest Huntingtons disease patients with a positive genetic test and clinically verified disease expression, were randomly assigned to control group (n= 9) and training group (n= 9). Intervention: Both groups received home-based inspiratory (5 sets of 5 repetitions) and expiratory (5 sets of 5 repetitions) muscle training 6 times a week for 4 months. The control group used a fixed resistance of 9 centimeters of water, and the training group used a progressively increased resistance from 30 % to 75 % of each patients maximum respiratory pressure. Main measures: Spirometric indices, maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, six minutes walk test, dyspnoea, water-swallowing test and swallow quality of life questionnaire were assessed before, at 2 and 4 months after training. Results: The magnitude of increases in maximum inspiratory (d= 2. 9) and expiratory pressures (d= 1. 5), forced vital capacity (d= 0. 8), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (d= 0. 9) and peak expiratory flow (d= 0. 8) was substantially greater for the training group in comparison to the control group. Changes in swallowing function, dyspnoea and exercise capacity were small (d′ 0. 5) for both groups without substantial differences between groups. Conclusions: A home-based respiratory muscle training program appeared to be beneficial to improve pulmonary function in manifest Huntington’s disease patients but provided small effects on swallowing function, dyspnoea and exercise capacity...|$|R

Methods: We included patients with stroke-related dysphagia at two different time periods: {{the first group}} of 12 patients studied in 1997 - 2 002 had to train with a PP, the other one of 14 patients studied in 2003 - 2008 had to train with an OS. All patients were evaluated by a <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> test (SCT), and by a self-assessed visual analogue scale (VAS) of water <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> at entry of the study, after 13 weeks of training, and at a late follow-up. Results: At end of treatment the SCT had normalized in 33 % of PP patients and in 71 % of OS patients. There was a significant SCT improvement difference between the PP and OS groups in the period from baseline to late follow-up (p < 0. 002) in favor of the OS group. VAS as tested at baseline and at end of treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups. Training with PP and with OS produced remaining improvement of SCT and of VAS as assessed at a late follow-up. Conclusion: The outcome of OS training on SCT in patients with stroke-related dysphagia seems to be superior to PP training. The improvement as assessed with VAS did not differ between the two groups. Training with PP or OS gives a longstanding improvement of SCT and VAS...|$|E
40|$|Flow in a {{turbocharger}} turbine {{is highly}} unsteady in nature as it {{responds to the}} exhaust manifold of an internal combustion (IC) engine. Despite this it is conventional to use quasi-steady turbine models in one-dimensional turbocharged engine simulations, even though they cannot reproduc~ the known hysteresis of turbine mass flow and performance characteristics 'recorded under pulsating flow conditions. Using filling-and-emptying models improves the situation by permitting mass accumulation in the turbine volute. Depending on the unsteadiness level, this approach may still be insufficient to capture true turbine operation since neither method can resolve unsteady effects due to pressure wave action in the flow. It is unclear when transition occurs between filling-and-emptying and wave action modes. To this end, a proprietary computational gas dynamics code in C++ is presented to simulate the unsteady, compressible flow inherent to Ie engine exhaust manifolds. The Euler equations for onedimensional inviscid flow are discretized to provide second-order, conservative, shock-capturing finite difference schemes able to resolve wave propagation in ducts with area variation, wall friction and heat transfer. A wave action turbine volute model is constructed using bespoke boundary conditions. Validation against experimental data shows satisfactory agreement for pulse frequencies up to 40 Hz, and improved instantaneous <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> prediction at all tested frequencies compared to quasi-steady calculations. Fourier series characterization of on-engine pUlse waveforms reveals multiple harmonic components, causing significant regions of divergence between filling-and-emptying and wave action predicted hystereses. Comparison of concurrent wave action and filling-and-emptying simulations applying simpler sinusoidal waveforms allows development of the unsteadiness measures FSt and FSt(p). An approximate guideline to ensure a filling-and-emptying mode stipulates FSt s 0. 15 and FSt(p) s 0. 02. Evaluation of FSt and FSt(p) for an example on-engine case indicates certain wave action already by 1600 r/min, borne out by subsequent inspection of the <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> traces.

40|$|A timed test of <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} for use in patients with neurogenic dysphagia. Swallowing speed (ml/s) has been demonstrated to have high intra- and inter- rater and test- retest reliability, and to be essentially independent of flavour or temperature. "Guideline" normal values were established in individuals without a swallowing disorder: swallowing speed was less in females than males and declined in both groups with age. The validity of a swallowing speed less than 10 ml/s as an index of abnormal swallowing was tested by comparison with the complaint of abnormal swallowing {{in a group of}} 81 neurological patients. Swallowing speed had a sensitivity of 96 % and specificity of 69 %: some apparent false positive responses were found in patients with disordered swallowing, mainly due to multiple sclerosis. Using a standard questionnaire and examination a similar pattern of symptoms and signs were statistically associated with both the clinical complaint of abnormal swallowing and swallowing speed. It is concluded that swallowing speed is a reliable and valid index for assessing disordered swallowing in neurological patients and may be of value in monitoring response to therapy...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Bariatric {{surgery is}} an {{effective}} treatment for obesity; however, after surgery the patient may have difficulty in swallowing liquid and solid foods. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate liquid ingestion in patients who had undergone bariatric surgery. METHOD: We studied 43 volunteers with normal body mass index (BMI) (BMI: 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m²), 55 subjects with class III obesity (BMI: > 40. 0 kg/m²), and 48 subjects with bariatric surgery for treatment of class III obesity. The method chosen for evaluation was the water swallowing test. The subjects drank in triplicate 50 mL of water while being precisely timed {{and the number of}} swallows were counted. RESULTS: There was no difference between subjects with normal BMI and subjects with class III obesity. During the first 2 months after bariatric surgery the patients showed an increase in the time needed to drink the entire volume, in the number of swallows, and in the inter-swallow interval, and a decrease in the volume <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> (volume/swallowing) and swallowing flow rate (volume swallowed/second). After 2 months, the results of the swallowing measurements moved in the direction of normal values.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} any {{motility}} disturbance in any quadrant of the face other than the quadrant innervated by the lower facial nerve contralateral to the cortical lesion after stroke. Thirty-one stroke-afflicted patients with subjective dysphagia, consecutively referred to a swallowing centre, were investigated with a facial activity test (FAT) in all four facial quadrants and with a <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> test (SCT). Fifteen healthy adult participants served as FAT controls. Sixteen patients were judged to have a central facial palsy (FP) according to the referring physician, but all 31 patients had a pathological FAT in the lower quadrant contralateral to the cortical lesion. Simultaneous pathology in all four quadrants was observed in 52 % of stroke-afflicted patients with dysphagia; some pathology in {{the left or right}} upper quadrant was observed in 74 %. Dysfunction in multiple facial quadrants was independent of the time interval between stroke and study inclusion. All patients except two had a pathological SCT.

40|$|Turbocharging {{is playing}} today a {{fundamental}} role {{not only to}} improve automotive engine performance, but also {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust emissions for both Spark Ignition and diesel engines. Dedicated experimental investigations on turbochargers are therefore necessary {{in order to get a}} better understanding of its performance. The availability of experimental information on realistic turbine steady flow performance is an essential requirement to optimize engine-turbocharger matching calculations developed in simulation models. This aspect is more noticeable as regards turbine efficiency, since its <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> can be accurately evaluated through the measurement of mass flow rate, inlet temperature and pressure ratio across the machine. Actually, in the case of a turbocharger turbine, isentropic efficiency directly evaluated starting from measurement of thermodynamic parameters at the inlet and outlet sections can give significant errors. This inaccuracy is mainly related to the difficulty of a correct evaluation of the turbine outlet temperature due to the flow field and temperature distribution at the exit of the machine. In the paper a preliminary experimental analysis on the direct evaluation of turbine isentropic efficiency is reported. In particular, a specific “hand-made” three holes probe was adopted to measure flow field distribution and thermodynamic quantities downstream the turbine...|$|E
40|$|The stator and {{rotor blade}} hub {{sections}} {{designed for a}} high pressure turbine stage were studied in detail for their aerodynamic and heat transfer characteristics. The profile sections were tested in the National Aeronautical Laboratory(NAL) cascade tunnels over a range of exit flow Mach numbers. The flow field and heat transfer characteristics of the cascades were analysed,employing the Euler code,the method of singularities and the K- turbulence model. The results {{indicated that there was}} scope for improving the blade profile sections for the proposed high Mach number application. In particular,it has been observed that the energy loss coefficients of the stator blade are rather high around the design point. The air <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the rotor blade design appears to be inadequate compared to the design expectations. The predictions of the surface pressure distributions obtained from the Euler code are generally in good agreement with the measured values in the Transonic Cascade Tunnel. The measured distribution of heat transfer coefficients around the blade surfaces give a useful data base for the design of the cooled blades. Prediction of the heat transfer for these transonic blades using the K- model of turbulence appears to be in general,not adequate. Recourse to correlation of the measured data using power-law relations appears to be promising,at least as a short time measure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{assess the}} {{frequency}} and severity of coughing and choking episodes, possible related factors, and their association with chest infections in patients with motor neuron disease (MND).  METHODS—Thirty seven patients with MND and 23 healthy volunteers were studied. Cough was assessed using a questionnaire and a 3 day diary, and volitional cough quantified by peak cough flow and sound intensity. Other clinical symptoms, smoking habit, affective state, oral secretions, bulbar signs, and quantitative assessments of swallowing and respiratory function were documented.  RESULTS—Patients with MND coughed and choked significantly more often and {{to a greater degree}} than the healthy volunteers (26 of 37 patients with MND and 2 of 23 volunteers, p< 0. 001). Female sex, older age, abnormal speech, reduced <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity,</b> and low forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted were each significantly associated with excessive coughing and choking episodes in patients with MND. Smokers had significantly more severe and prolonged episodes of coughing and choking than non-smokers (p< 0. 05). Patients with upper motor neuron bulbar signs had a greater tendency to severe and prolonged episodes of coughing and choking than those without (p< 0. 05). Chest infections were reported only rarely among the patients who coughed and choked.  CONCLUSIONS—Coughing and choking episodes are common in patients with MND but infrequently associated with overt chest infection. Upper motor neuron bulbar signs may both promote factors (for instance, dysphagia) which trigger cough and reduce volitional capacity to suppress it. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} swallowing training combined with low-frequency electrical stimulation on dysphagia after ischemic stroke.   Methods A total of 68 patients with dysphagia after ischemic stroke were divided into control group (N = 34, receiving swallowing training and feeding strategies) and combined treatment group (N = 34, receiving swallowing training, feeding strategies and low-frequency electrical stimulation). Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) and Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) were {{used to evaluate the}} swallowing function of patients in 2 groups before and after 15 d of treatment. Results According to Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification, 34 patients in control group were classified into 12 cases with total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), 8 cases with partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), 10 cases with posterior circulation infarct (POCI) and 4 cases with lacunar infarct (LACI); 34 patients in combined treatment group were classified into 10 cases with TACI, 7 cases with PACI, 11 cases with POCI and 6 cases with LACI. Compared with before treatment, the VFSS score increased (P = 0. 003, 0. 000), while SSA score decreased (P = 0. 003, 0. 000) in both groups. Compared with control group, the VFSS score increased (P = 0. 004), while SSA score decreased (P = 0. 020) in combined treatment group.   Conclusions Swallowing training combined with low-frequency electrical stimulation can significantly improve the <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> of patients with acute ischemic stroke, and the effect is better than mere swallowing training.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2015. 04. 007 </p...|$|E
40|$|Oral and {{pharyngeal}} dysfunction {{is common}} in Parkinson's disease. To reveal the frequency of swallowing dysfunction and correlate swallowing dysfunction with locomotor disturbances, we studied 75 patients with Parkinson's disease staged I-IV according to the Hoehn and Yahr score. We assessed oral and pharyngeal swallow during optimal medication by a quantitative test of swallowing (the ROSS test) measuring the suction pressure, bolus volume, <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity,</b> and time for important events in the swallowing cycle. We found abnormal results in 7 / 12 patients (58 %) in stage 1 of the Hoehn and Yahr score, in 13 / 14 patients (93 %) in stage 2, in 29 / 32 patients (91 %) in stage 3, and in 16 / 17 patients (94 %) in stage 4. Abnormal test results in stages, 1, 2, and 3 were seldom related to swallowing difficulties noticed by the patients. In advanced disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage 4), the abnormal results were often considerable, with swallowing difficulties obvious to the patient. Two of 17 patients coughed during or immediately after the test and 3 / 17 patients were unable to complete the test. The degree of swallowing disturbance increased during stress (forced, repetitive swallow). The Hoehn and Yahr score and the results in the ROSS test did not correlate, indicating that swallowing disturbances are due to nondopaminergic degeneration. Silent swallowing impairment may interfere with the nutrition {{and quality of life}} in Parkinson's disease, thus it is of interest to monitor this in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Drooling is an incapacitating {{feature of}} Parkinson's disease. Better {{pathophysiological}} insights {{are needed to}} improve treatment. In this study, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} cause of drooling is multifactorial. We examined 15 patients with Parkinson's disease with distinct diurnal saliva loss ("droolers") and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease without drooling complaints ("nondroolers"). We evaluated all factors that could potentially contribute to drooling: <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> (maximum volume), functional swallowing (assessed with the dysphagia subscale of the Therapy Outcome Measures for rehabilitation specialists), unintentional mouth opening due to hypomimia (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale item), posture (quantified from sagittal photographs), and nose-breathing ability. We also quantified the frequency of spontaneous swallowing during 45 minutes of quiet sitting, using polygraphy. Droolers had more advanced Parkinson's disease than nondroolers (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score 31 vs 22; P=. 014). Droolers also scored significantly worse on all recorded variables except for nose breathing. Swallowing frequency tended to be higher, possibly to compensate for less efficient swallowing. Logistic regression with adjustment for age and disease severity showed that hypomimia correlated best with drooling. Linear regression with hypomimia as the dependent variable identified disease severity, dysphagia, and male sex as significant explanatory factors. Drooling in Parkinson's disease results from multiple risk factors, with hypomimia being the most prominent. When monitored, patients appear to compensate by increasing their swallowing frequency, much like the increased cadence that is used to compensate for stepping akinesia. These findings can provide a rationale for behavioral approaches to treat drooling...|$|E
40|$|Palatal and {{pharyngeal}} sensation {{and motor}} responses, and volitional palatal movement, {{were tested in}} 171 healthy adults and 43 patients with motor neuron disease. In healthy adults palatal and pharyngeal sensation and volitional palatal elevation were present in all; the palatal and pharyngeal motor responses could not be elicited on first testing in two (1. 1 %) and seven (4. 1 %) subjects respectively. Pharyngeal motor responses were more easily elicited in older subjects and palatal responses were more easily elicited in women. Eye watering and retching were the most common accompanying features. In 57 normal subjects tested on five occasions there was considerable variation in the stimulus required to elicit the motor responses within subjects: in none of four subjects (7 %) who initially had absent responses were they always absent. Pharyngeal motor responses were more easily elicited in patients with motor neuron disease than in matched normal subjects; within the motor neuron disease group pharyngeal motor responses elicited by tongue depression {{were associated with the}} symptom of food or drink "going down the wrong way" > 1 /month and a reduction in average volume per swallow (ml) and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> (ml/s). Volitional palatal elevation was absent in five patients (11. 6 %). In six of eight patients with motor neuron disease studied repeatedly (on between two and seven occasions) the palatal and pharyngeal responses were elicited with the same stimulus on each occasion. In healthy adults palatal and pharyngeal sensation and motor responses should be present although considerable variation occurs in the stimulus required. In patients with motor neuron disease features of impaired swallowing are associated with a brisk rather than a depressed pharyngeal response...|$|E
40|$|An IGCC (integrated {{gasification}} combined cycle) plant {{consists of}} a power block and a gasifier block, and a smooth integration of these two parts is important. This work has analyzed the influences of the major design options {{on the performance of}} an IGCC plant. These options include the method of integrating a gas turbine with an air separation unit and the degree of nitrogen supply from the ASU to the gas turbine combustor. Research focus was given to the effect of each option on the gas turbine operating condition along with plant performance. Initially, an analysis adopting an existing gas turbine without any modifications of its components was performed to examine the influence of two design options on the operability of the gas turbine and performance of the entire IGCC plant. It is shown that a high integration degree, where much of the air required at the air separation unit is supplied by the gas turbine compressor, can be a better option considering both the system performance and operation limitation of the gas turbine. The nitrogen supply enhances system performance, but a high supply ratio can only be acceptable in high integration degree designs. Secondly, the modifications of gas turbine components to resume the operating surge margin, such as increasing the maximum compressor pressure ratio by adding a couple of stages and increasing turbine <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity,</b> were simulated and their effects on system performance were examined. Modification can be a good option when a low integration degree is to be adopted, as it provides a considerable power increase.

40|$|The pulse flow {{performance}} of a turbocharger turbine {{is known to be}} different than its corresponding steady flow performance. This often leads to less-than-satisfactory 1 D engine model prediction. In this study, the effectiveness of a 1 D pulse flow turbine model is assessed against experimental data with the aid of 3 D CFD model. The turbine under study is a single-entry variable geometry mixed-flow turbine. The result shows highly comparable pulse flow <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> and actual power characteristics between 1 D and 3 D models. The over-prediction in 1 D actual power magnitude is found to be due to the simplification of combining nThis paper presents a simplified methodology of pulse flow turbine modelling, as an alternative over the meanline integrated methodology outlined in previous work, in order to make its application to engine cycle simulation codes much more straight forward. This is enabled through the development of a bespoke non-adiabatic pressure loss boundary to represent the turbine rotor. In this paper, turbocharger turbine pulse flow performance predictions are presented along with a comparison of computation duration against the previously established integrated meanline method. Plots of prediction deviation indicate that the mass flow rate and actual power predictions from both methods are highly comparable and are reasonably close to experimental data. However, the new boundary condition required significantly lower computational time and rotor geometrical inputs. In addition, the pressure wave propagation in this simplified unsteady turbine model at different pulse frequencies has also been found to be in agreement with data from the literature, thereby supporting the confidence in its ability to simulate the wave action encountered in turbine pulse flow operation. ozzle and rotor stage pressure loss together...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess early oncological and {{functional}} outcomes after transoral laser surgery {{in patients with}} pharyngeal or pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. DESIGN: Inception cohort, with a median follow-up of 24 months. SETTING: Tertiary university center. PATIENTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with pharyngeal or pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T 1, 24 patients; T 2, 28 patients; and T 3, 3 patients) were included. Patients had {{to be eligible for}} open functional surgery, and exposure in suspension micropharyngoscopy had to be possible. INTERVENTIONS: The pharynx and larynx were exposed with a bivalved laryngopharyngoscope, and the resection of the tumor was performed with a carbon dioxide laser coupled to a microscope. Neck dissection was performed in 43 patients. It was not attempted in the other 12 patients for the following reasons: N 0 neck and severe comorbidities (n = 6), microinvasive cancer (n = 3), patient's refusal (n = 1), inoperable N 3 disease (n = 1), and rapid local recurrence (n = 1). Eighteen patients (33 %) received adjuvant radiotherapy: 12 for neck disease and 6 for positive resection margins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local control and overall survival at the median follow-up visit. Evaluation of complications, pain, and rehabilitation of <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity.</b> RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 24 months, the local control rate was 90 %, and the overall survival rate was 78 %. There were 16 early postoperative complications: recurrent aspiration pneumonia (n = 7); laryngeal obstruction, which required tracheotomy (n = 3); severe postoperative hemorrhage (n = 2); and cervical emphysema, which resolved spontaneously (n = 4). Feeding tubes were necessary in 37 patients. They were removed after a median period of 7 days. The median pain score was 4 of 10 during the first postoperative week and 0 of 10 after 4 weeks. The median hospital stay was 13 days (15 days for patients with neck dissection). CONCLUSIONS: Transoral laser surgery for pharyngeal and pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a safe and acceptable therapeutic modality in selected cases. Good local control and avoidance of tracheotomy can be expected in most cases. Oral food intake is immediate, but feeding tubes are required to avoid weight loss during the postoperative period. Frequent early problems include transient postoperative bronchoinhalations and pain...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Extensive {{studies have}} shown that older people are {{negatively}} impacted by impaired eating and nutrition. The abilities to eat, enjoy food, and participate in social activities associated with meals are important aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and recovery after illness. This project aims to (i) describe and analyze relationships between oral health and oral HRQoL, swallowing ability, eating ability, and nutritional risk among older individuals admitted to short-term care; (ii) compare the perceptions that older individuals and staff report on care quality related to oral hygiene and eating; and (iii) study the feasibility and effects of a training program for people with impaired swallowing (i. e., dysphagia). METHODS/DESIGN: This project consists of two parts, which will be performed in five Swedish counties. It will include approximately 400 older individuals and 200 healthcare professionals. Part 1 is a cross-sectional, descriptive study of older people admitted to short-term care. Subjects will be assessed by trained professionals regarding oral health status, oral HRQoL, eating and nutritional risk, and swallowing ability. Swallowing ability will be measured with a teaspoon test and a <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity</b> test (SCT). Furthermore, subjects and staff will complete a questionnaire regarding their perceptions of care quality. Part 2 is a cluster randomized intervention trial with controls. Older participants with dysphagia (i. e., SCT < 10  ml/s, measured in part 1) will be recruited consecutively to either the intervention or control group, depending on where they were admitted for short-term care. At baseline, all subjects will be assessed for oral health status, oral HRQoL, eating and nutritional risk, swallowing ability, and swallowing-related QoL. Then, the intervention group will receive 5  weeks of training with an oral screen for neuromuscular training focused on orofacial and pharyngeal muscles. After completing the intervention, and at six months post-intervention, all assessments will be repeated in both study groups. DISCUSSION: The results will make important contributions to rehabilitation knowledge, including approaches for improving swallowing function, oral health, and food intake and for improving the quality of oral care for older people.

40|$|Anorexia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} modification of eating habits in old age, which may lead to malnutrition and consequent morbidity and mortality in older adults. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated to anorexia {{in a sample of}} Italian older persons living in different settings. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of senile anorexia on nutritional status and on eating habits, as well as on functional status. Observational study in nursing homes, in rehabilitation and acute geriatric wards, and in the community in four Italian regions (Lazio, Sicily, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto). 526 over 65 years old participants were recruited; 218 free-living subjects, 213 from nursing homes, and 96 patients from rehabilitation and acute geriatric wards {{in the context of a}} National Research Project (PRIN) from the Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (2005 - 067913 "Cause e Prevalenza dell'Anoressia senile"). Anthropometric and nutritional evaluation, olfactory, chewing, and <b>swallowing</b> <b>capacity,</b> food preferences, cognitive function, functional status, depression, quality of life, social aspects, prescribed drugs, and evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms and pain. Laboratory parameters included prealbumin, albumin, transferrin, C-reactive protein, mucoprotein, lymphocyte count, as well as neurotransmitters leptin, and ghrelin. Anorexia was considered as ≥ 50 % reduction in food intake vs. a standard meal (using 3 -day "Club Francophone de Gériatrie et Nutrition" form), in absence of oral disorders preventing mastication. The overall prevalence of anorexia was 21. 2 % with higher values among hospitalized patients (34. 1 % women and 27. 2 % men in long-term facilities; 33. 3 % women and 26. 7 % men in rehabilitation and geriatric wards; 3. 3 % women and 11. 3 % men living in the community) and in the oldest persons. Anorexic subjects were significantly less self-sufficient and presented more often a compromised nutritional and cognitive status. Diet composition analyses of anorexic older adults revealed a lower intake of all food groups and a general tendency to a monotonous diet. Anorexia is a frequent condition in older Italians, particularly those hospitalized, with important consequences in the nutritional and functional status. The analysis of dietary components and its quality along with the frequency of intake of single food groups may be useful to plan intervention strategies aiming to improve the nutritional and health status of older adults with anorexia. An early detection of anorexia followed by an adequate intervention in older hospitalized patients to avoid further worsening of clinical and functional status is warranted...|$|E
