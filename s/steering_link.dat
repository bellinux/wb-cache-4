50|$|The HOSSACK front {{suspension}} system consists of 2 wish-bones, an upright and steering linkage. Similar components are found {{on the front of}} all racing cars, the only significant difference being in the up-right which has its geometry rearranged. The wish-bones look and work exactly like their racing car equivalent. The up-right performs the same task as its racing car equivalent but has its axle rotated through 90 degrees and over hung. The <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> does the same job as its name sake in car suspension. There is a handle bar pivot but this carries none of the suspension loading and only has to handle the weight of the rider’s upper half. The spring/damper element can been run in several different positions to achieve different conditions as is also common in the racing car world.|$|E

5000|$|The Tomahawk has an {{independent}} suspension {{on all four}} wheels designed to allow the rider to countersteer and lean into turns like a tilting three-wheeler. There is a hub-center steering style swingarm connected to the outboard side {{of each of the}} two front wheels, with a <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> connected to the handlebar shaft. There is very little lock-to-lock steering range, only about 20° on either side of center, so the turning radius of the Tomahawk is large; [...] "only a little tighter than an SR-71", said Motorcyclists Jeff Karr. A low center of gravity, accomplished by situating the engine as low to ground as possible, is intended to provide greater control at low speeds, and a low saddle allows riders to place both feet on the ground when stopped, for greater stability. The two rear wheels also each have {{an independent}} swingarm, but on the inboard side, along with an inboard chain drive for each wheel. The rider can engage a rear suspension lock, which hydraulically holds the two wheels' relative positions, letting the vehicle stand on its own, without using a side stand.|$|E

40|$|Suspension {{is part of}} {{automotive}} systems, providing both vehicle control and passenger comfort. The knuckle {{is an important part}} within the suspension system, constantly encountering the cyclic loads subjecting it to fatigue failure. This paper presents an evaluation of the fatigue characteristics of a knuckle using multibody simulation (MBS) techniques. Load time history extracted from the MBS is used for stress analysis. An actual road profile of road bumps was used as the input to MBS. The stress fluctuations for fatigue simulations are considered with the road profile. The strain-life method is utilized to assess the fatigue life. The instantaneous stress distributions and maximum principal stress are used for fatigue life predictions. Mesh sensitivity analysis has been performed. The results show that the <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> in the knuckle is found to be the most susceptible region for fatigue failure. The number of times the knuckle can manage a road bump at 40 km/hr is determined to be approximately 371 times with a 50 % certainty of survival. The proposed method of using the loading time history extracted from MBS simulation for fatigue life estimation is found to be very promising for the accurate evaluation of the performance of suspension system components...|$|E

50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, <b>steering</b> <b>links,</b> tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between three environmental factors (ionic strength, pH, and temperature) and antigen-antibody binding kinetics was investigated using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) and molecular modeling approaches. The interaction {{used for this}} analysis is that between the camel antibody fragment cAbLys 3 and lysozyme. Binding kinetics were measured using a Biacore 2000 instrument, at NaCl concentrations between 50 and 500 mM, at pH's between 5 and 10, and at temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C, according to multivariate experimental designs. Variations in kinetic on- and off-rate parameters were up to 400 - and 16 -fold, respectively. Mathematical models that relate log k(on) to experimental conditions were developed. They indicated an influence of all three factors, with a clear dependency between pH and NaCl concentration for their effect on k(on). These models were able to predict on-rate parameters under new experimental conditions. Titration calculations using continuum electrostatics were performed on the crystallographic structures of the isolated and bound proteins to gain structural insight for the on-rate enhancement observed at pH < 6. 5 and low salt concentrations. These calculations rule out electrostatic <b>steering</b> <b>linked</b> to global and/or local charge variations in the molecules as the factor responsible for the on-rate enhancement at low pH. His 111 of cAbLys 3, located at the binding interface, can adopt two side chain orientations with different intramolecular contacts. The results of the calculations suggest an alternative mechanism whereby the conformation of the interfacial His 111 depends on the charge, and these differences in conformation may influence the solvation energy and the subsequent binding kinetics.

40|$|Abstract When {{approaching}} {{a bend in}} the road, a driver looks across to the inside kerb before turning the steering wheel. Eye movements and <b>steering</b> are tightly <b>linked,</b> with the eyes leading, which means that the oculomotor controller can assist the neural centres controlling steering. This optimum coordination is ob-served for all drivers; but despite being the preferred solution to the motor-control problem of successfully steering along a winding road, the question remains as to how crucial such coordinated eye and steering movements are for driving performance. Twenty sub-jects repeatedly drove a simulated stage of the World Rally Championship, aiming to complete the course in the fastest possible time. For the first six repetitions they used the usual coordination of eye movements and steering; for drives 7 – 12 they were instructed to fixate on a small spot in the centre of the screen (centre gaze). Prevention of coordination in this way impaired their performance (drives 6 and 7 compared), dramatically increasing their time taken to complete the course, equivalent to slipping 19 places down the leader board in the actual rally stage. This indicates that the usual pat-tern of eye movements correlated with steering is crucial for driving performance. Further experiments are sug-gested to reveal whether any attentional demand asso-ciated with keeping the eyes still contributes to the loss in performance...|$|R
40|$|Humans use a {{specific}} sequence of reorientation of the eyes, head and body to perform turning and redirections while walking. Gaze (eye and head) rotation {{in a new}} direction of travel precedes body rotation by as much as 1. 5 s and provides a stable reference frame that guides subsequent whole-body redirection. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a visually presented rotation of the external environment can induce whole-body turning lead by gaze redirection in a new travel direction. Five healthy young adults performed a stepping in place task while watching a virtual scene that moved as if they were walking down a hallway, thus providing participants with a perception of forward self motion. While "forward" stepping, the virtual scene would gradually turn around a 90 degrees corner. As a result the turn could be anticipated by the participants. Significant horizontal eye movements and head and body rotation magnitudes were observed in response to the virtual visual turning cue. Onset of eye, head and body redirection revealed a sequenced order and timing of segment rotation that is characteristic of steering behaviour in real world turning situations. The results of this study provide support for the hypothesis that gaze redirection may be an essential subcomponent to <b>steering</b> behaviour. The <b>link</b> between visual redirection and coordinated body turning implies instability when turning may result from visual and/or oculomotor deficits...|$|R

Peugeot's choice of a closed cockpit is possibly intended to allow the 908 to run a larger air restrictor due to rules mandating the use of air conditioning on closed cockpit designs.Peugeot also felt that weight, centre of gravity, and operational drawbacks were able to be overcome by better chassis rigidity and aerodynamics with using a closed cockpit design. The cockpit uses a unique 2 part door system with {{the upper part of}} the door (the window) swinging forward and out with a hinged plate (part of the sidepod) forming the lower part of the door that can be either swung out or removed completely, this was reportedly done to allow the car to conform to current regulations regarding door size.
