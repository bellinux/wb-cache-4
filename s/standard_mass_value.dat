40|$|Latvian National Metrology Centre is {{a public}} {{organization}} with legal liability. Its main task is to ensure uniformity of measurement {{throughout the country and}} provide metrological services to persons and organizations. The Latvian law currently in force is “Law of traceability”. The objective of the law is to defend people’s life, health and environment. In Latvia, there is highest metrological institute: The Latvian National Metrology Centre, State agency. Main tasks of State Agency are to maintain uniformity and traceability of physical units, verification and calibration of measuring instruments and standards (weights etc.). Department of mass measurement of State Agency is a holder of national <b>mass</b> <b>standards.</b> These are 1 kg <b>mass</b> <b>standard</b> in stainless steel and two sets of <b>mass</b> <b>standards</b> (from 1 mg to 500 g). Laboratory performs periodic calibration and statistical analysis of <b>mass</b> <b>standards.</b> The Department of mass measurement ensures traceability between national <b>mass</b> <b>standards</b> (with <b>values</b> derived from the International Prototype of the kilogram) and weights of class E 1 and lower. Once in two years national <b>mass</b> <b>standards</b> are carried to DFM (Dansk Fundamental Metrologi, Denmark) or other laboratory for calibration. Department of mass measurement of State Agency has probably the best mass measurement equipment in Latvia, such as “Sartorius” comparator (high-precision mass measurement instrument). ScalesNet 32 is the software used for data acquisition and analysis. Computer running ScalesNet 32 is connected to both comparator and climate control system of the lab. This equipment allows LNMC to perform calibration of E 1 class weights (most accurate ones). Department of mass measurement of State Agency does participate in various international interlaboratory comparisons schemes: “ 839 EUROMET”, “EUROMET 786 ”, “LNMC (Latvia) -METROSERT (Estonia) - MIKES (Finland) ”, “ 832 EUROMET” and others. At present, the laboratory is planning interlaboratory comparison of mass measurement capability between various Latvian laboratories. Department of mass measurement will be the pilot laboratory of the comparison. Comparisons like this have never been carried out before. This comparison will be first such project in Latvia. We have to adapt existing methods and procedures for our needs or develop new ones. Major complication is that there is strong competition between some of participants. However, small size of Latvia makes transfer of standards less complex and expensive task. Interlaboratory comparisons allow laboratories to validate measurement capability, identify and correct measurement errors, assess technical proficiency and calibration procedures, verify adequacy of laboratory environment, provide evidence of measurement traceability and demonstrate measurement comparability between laboratories...|$|R

Comparing experimental <b>mass</b> <b>values</b> with theoretical calculations provides an important benchmark of how well the role of these interactions is already understood. By investigating differences of experimental binding energies, such as two-neutron separation energies (S 2 n), valuable indications for nuclear-structure studies are provided. The present thesis contributes to these studies providing new high-precision mass measurements especially in the heavy-mass region. Here, nuclear theory is heavily challenged due to the large number of nucleons. The data have been obtained at the Penningtrap mass spectrometer Isoltrap located at the radioactive-ion-beam facility Isolde at Cern.
