5|$|While head of {{production}} at Warner, Hal Wallis considered that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> films – including The Roaring Twenties, Marked Woman and The Sea Wolf – {{were written by}} Rossen. Wallis was very pleased with Rossen's script in 1946 for The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, which was produced by Wallis own company. However, Rossen turned down Wallis's next two films. Both Wallis as producer and Rossen as writer-director wanted to operate as independents, rather than {{under the control of}} a studio.|$|E

He joined the Springfield Redbirds of the Class AAA American Association for 1978, but returned to the major leagues during the 1978 season, earning a 42 record with the St. Louis Cardinals. After one season in St. Louis, López {{was traded to the}} Detroit Tigers with Jerry Morales for Jack Murphy and Bob Sykes.

5|$|The square {{was laid}} out {{to the south of}} Leicester House and {{developed}} in the 1670s. The area was originally entirely residential, with properties laid out in a similar style to nearby Pall Mall. In 1687, {{the northern part of the}} square became part of the new parish of St Anne, Soho. The Jocelyn Sidney, 7th Earl of Leicester took ownership of the property in 1728 and it was briefly the residence of Frederick, Prince of Wales from 1742 until Leicester's death the following year. The poet Matthew Prior lived at what is now No.21 around 1700 and artist William Hogarth resided at No30 between 1733 and 1764, where he produced <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> known works including Gin Lane.

5|$|Throughout their travels {{they studied}} art and visited churches and museums, which appealed to Bauer's eclectic mind. In the evenings {{they went to}} small tavernas to enjoy the ambiance; {{all of which is}} {{recorded}} in the letters they sent home to Bauer's family. Bauer's sketchbooks are full of studies of antique objects and Renaissance art, some of which he used for his illustrations. A portrait of Ghirlandaio by Sandro Botticelli {{is said to be the}} basis for Svanhamnen (The Swan maiden), and Piero della Francesca's work was the inspiration for Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). He also became intrigued by frescoes. He was exuberant in the study of art, but he also became homesick for the quiet serenity of the Swedish forest which resulted in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> winter pictures with white snow, dark woods and the sky glittering with tiny stars.|$|E
5|$|Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced {{arrest on}} a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from {{comments}} made by Irwin about {{the actions of the}} Philadelphia ownership during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring stretch in 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came {{with the end of the}} 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to manage that team for a couple of seasons.|$|E

5|$|Melbourne's poor form {{throughout}} the 2007 season, when they won just five matches, saw the side finish 14th. White brought up his milestone 250th AFL-game in Round 19 {{with a win}} over the Western Bulldogs. His last season with Melbourne was 2008, {{in which he was}} dropped {{for the first time in}} his Melbourne career, despite returning to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> form. His average number of disposals per match (18.5) was the highest of any season in his career. His long-time understudy Mark Jamar assumed White's position as the premier ruckman at Melbourne, allowing Paul Johnson to play the second-ruckman role. It was the first time in 20 years that anyone other than White or Jim Stynes had been the first-choice ruckman at Melbourne for an extended run of matches. Coach Dean Bailey said that 2008 was the most difficult season that White and team-mate Adem Yze had experienced at the club—the side finished bottom and won just three games. Bailey praised both White and Yze on their professionalism and attitude at the end of the season—the pair's last at Melbourne. White played 15games in 2008—his lowest total in a season with Melbourne. He finished his career at Melbourne in Round 22 against Richmond, kicking two goals and having 17possessions. He received 53Brownlow votes throughout his career—47 with Melbourne and six with Fremantle. He reached double-figures in Brownlow votes on three occasions, with his highest being the 15 votes he received in 2004. He received his final Brownlow vote in Round 7, 2008, in Melbourne's win over Fremantle. He received Brownlow votes in nine of his 14AFL seasons.|$|E
