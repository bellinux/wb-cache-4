30|$|However, the {{interference}} and system overhead remains more severe in 5 G UDNs due to dynamic traffic and the random increase or migration of <b>small</b> <b>cells.</b> Current resource allocation algorithms for <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> {{are unable to}} manage poor situations, an urgent problem that requires an innovative solution. Inspired by the method of collaboration between <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> in COMP, a resource coordination approach was proposed in [25] to solve the problem.

30|$|The {{addition}} of <b>small</b> radio <b>cells</b> (pico/micro radio cells) {{is a very}} attractive means to increase network capacity in high traffic areas (so-called traffic hot spots). These <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> need to be complemented by macro cells to provide coverage for all users, {{which leads to the}} so-called HetNets. In addition, it is typically that the <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> will be deployed in a frequency band that is already used for macro cells since spectrum is a scarce and expensive resource. In such a multitier HetNet deployment, the coverage of <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> is rather limited since the transmit power of macro cells is much larger due to the use of directional antennas with rather large antenna height. This leads typically to a very unbalanced load between macro and <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> even if <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> are installed at traffic hot spots.|$|R

30|$|Our {{approach}} {{follows the}} centralized SON (CSON) architecture, {{according to which}} there is a centralized node that oversees operation of all <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> and controls their behavior. In CSON architecture, the centralized node receives inputs from <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> and determines their configuration. Thus, the LTE KPI Prediction Engine and the DFBA Optimization Engine are placed at the centralized node. Since the configuration parameters {{are not going to be}} changed frequently, the proposed solution should not be affected by the latency due to the communication exchange between <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> and the centralized node. Also, the network overhead is low, since the measurement information from the <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> to the central node can be scheduled per best-effort basis. Note that this architecture is compliant with the control plane solution for MDT which is discussed in 3 GPP TR 32.827 [28]. Thus, the main message exchanges in our approach are between user equipments (UEs) and <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> and between <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> and the centralized management node, and all the interfaces needed for implementing our solution are already present in the standard.|$|R

30|$|In Figure 2, {{the total}} {{available}} system resource blocks can be partitioned into C={N_ 1,N_ 2,...,N_L}, where C =L and N_l⊆N denotes {{the set of}} <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> for which the l-th sub-channel is available (i.e., N_l={j∈N|[A]_lj= 1 }). Given a sub-channel, the allocated power is not transferable, i.e., the power cannot be shared among <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> in an arbitrary ratio. For the sub-channels with strong interference, the system throughput will improve if some <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> mute the sub-channels. In this subsection, we resort to the coalition game to determine the sub-channels {{that need to be}} muted. Note that the system interference on the l-th sub-channel is only determined by the <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> in N_l.

25|$|Around this time, {{the first}} proto-mitochondrion was formed. A {{bacterial}} cell related to today's Rickettsia, which had evolved to metabolize oxygen, entered a larger prokaryotic cell, which lacked that capability. Perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed (possibly {{due to the}} evolution of prey defenses). The <b>smaller</b> <b>cell</b> may have tried to parasitize the larger one. In any case, the <b>smaller</b> <b>cell</b> survived inside the larger cell. Using oxygen, it metabolized the larger cell's waste products and derived more energy. Part of this excess energy was returned to the host. The <b>smaller</b> <b>cell</b> replicated inside the larger one. Soon, a stable symbiosis developed between the large <b>cell</b> and the <b>smaller</b> <b>cells</b> inside it. Over time, the host cell acquired some genes from the <b>smaller</b> <b>cells,</b> and the two kinds became dependent on each other: the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller ones, and these, in turn, could not survive without the raw materials provided by the larger cell. The whole cell is now considered a single organism, and the <b>smaller</b> <b>cells</b> are classified as organelles called mitochondria.|$|R

Nevertheless, <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas (including the c-SCLC variant) still comprise 15–20% of all lung cancers, with c-SCLC probably accounting for 4–6%.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{heterogeneous}} networks and <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> {{is likely to}} be a key addition to the fifth generation (5 G) wireless communication standard, the prospect of which has motivated 5 G researchers to investigate the coverage and integration of various <b>small</b> <b>cells.</b> Heterogeneous networks with <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> offer key benefits such as high frequency reuse, huge data rates and low power consumption for mobile nodes. High frequency reuse is particularly important given the exponential growth of data rates and the looming frequency scarcity problem. Another major consideration for 5 G is the energy efficiency as with the exponential growth of demand, power consumption in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector is also expected to significantly increase. While the concept of <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> in heterogeneous networks addresses the frequency scarcity problem to a great extent, unless otherwise carefully managed, a large number of uncoordinated and lightly loaded <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> significantly increase the overall power consumption, contrary to the green communication target of the 5 G standard. In this paper, we focus on an energy efficient resource management and planning system that investigates the impact of growing number of <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> in a macro cell. We present an analytical model for calculating the optimum number of <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> that need to be kept awake at various hours of a day for meeting the quality of service demands from all users.

25|$|Differences in {{moisture}} content between {{the surface and}} the centre (gradient, the chemical potential difference between interface and bulk) move the bound water through the small passageways in the cell wall by diffusion. In comparison with capillary movement, diffusion is a slow process. Diffusion is the generally suggested mechanism for the drying of impermeable hardwoods (Keey et al., 2000). Furthermore, moisture migrates slowly {{due to the fact}} that extractives plug the <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> wall openings in the heartwood. This is why sapwood generally dries faster than heartwood under the same drying conditions.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, in {{this article}} we assume that the {{macrocell}} network is operating in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode while the <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> are (re)-using the macrocell UL resources and operate in FD mode, which means that unused resources by the macrocell can locally be reused within <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> where some nodes can transmit and receive simultaneously in an FD fashion. The use of FD nodes can potentially increase the capacity of <b>small</b> <b>cells,</b> while adhering to the cross-tier interference constraint imposed by the macrocell. Note that the proposed scheme solves the multiplexing loss of HD schemes, the DL/UL switching point optimization required in the classical time division duplex (TDD) [11] underlay at UL FDD. Thus, the macrocell operation is oblivious to the presence of underlaid <b>small</b> <b>cells,</b> which are opportunistic in nature.|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} extra traffic demand of hot-spot (HS) users not {{expected}} in the original network planning, it is desirable to deploy new <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> {{on top of the}} existing heterogeneous network (HetNet) without replanning the overall network.

A reduced-complexity iterative algorithm is devised to solve the joint optimisation problem. The simulation results show that the proposed iterative algorithm significantly outperforms the random deployment of new <b>small</b> <b>cells</b> and achieves performance very close to numerically solving the joint optimisation in terms of minimum user throughput and required number of new <b>small</b> <b>cells,</b> especially for a large number of unexpected HS users...|$|R
