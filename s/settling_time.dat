5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a <b>settling</b> <b>time</b> as little as 10 seconds. The fast <b>settling</b> <b>time</b> was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a corkscrew (a helical path), climbing and turning and then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} this block can be {{dominated}} by either of these considerations, or can be a complex process juggling the interactions of the two. Typical trade-offs are: increasing the bandwidth usually degrades the stability or too much damping for better stability will reduce the speed and increase <b>settling</b> <b>time.</b> Often also the phase-noise is affected.|$|E

25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{a multiple}} of τ is called the <b>settling</b> <b>time,</b> i.e. the time necessary to ensure the signal is within a fixed departure from final value, typically within 10%. The term overshoot refers to the extent the maximum response exceeds final value, and undershoot refers to the extent the response falls below final value for times following the maximum response.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of oscillation about the final value is called ringing. The overshoot is the maximum swing above final value, and clearly increases with μ. Likewise, the undershoot is the minimum swing below final value, again increasing with μ. The <b>settling</b> <b>time</b> {{is the time}} for departures from final value to sink below some specified level, say 10% of final value.|$|E
25|$|Derivative action predicts system {{behavior}} and thus improves <b>settling</b> <b>time</b> {{and stability of}} the system. An ideal derivative is not causal, so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.|$|E

40|$|Single-track {{hard disk}} drive (HDD) seek {{performance}} is measured by <b>settle</b> <b>time,</b> ts, defined as the time from {{the arrival of a}} seek command until the measured position reaches and stays within an acceptable distance from the target track. Models of HDD dynamics are typically nonminimum phase (NMP), which complicates control design focused on <b>settle</b> <b>time</b> performance improvements. Our previous work has shown feedforward dynamic inversion, coupled with an aggressive desired trajectory yd, is capable of achieving high performance <b>settle</b> <b>times</b> when the closed-loop dynamics are time-invariant and accurately modeled. In contrast, we describe an adaptive inversion procedure in this paper which removes the requirement for accurate initial models and tracks the position-variant dynamics present in our Servo Track Writer (STW) experimental apparatus. The proposed indirect adaptive inversion algorithm relies on a recursive least squares (RLS) estimate of the closedloop dynamics. Pre-filtering of the RLS input signals, covariance resetting...|$|R

25|$|Two basic {{requirements}} are regulation (disturbance rejection – {{staying at a}} given setpoint) and command tracking (implementing setpoint changes) – these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and <b>settling</b> <b>time.</b> Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{faced with}} PID {{controllers}} {{is that they}} are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as HVAC systems) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases <b>settling</b> <b>time).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{dependence}} of <b>settling</b> <b>time</b> upon μ is not obvious, and the approximation of a two-pole system probably is not accurate {{enough to make}} any real-world conclusions about feedback {{dependence of}} <b>settling</b> <b>time.</b> However, the asymptotes [...] and [...] clearly impact <b>settling</b> <b>time,</b> and they are controlled by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier, particularly the shorter of the two time constants. That suggests that a specification on <b>settling</b> <b>time</b> must be met by appropriate design of the open-loop amplifier.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} fast {{synchronization}} of directionally coupled chaotic systems under a chained interaction topology. Firstly, by applying finite-time stability theory, it is shown that all chaotic systems can achieve synchronization in finite time {{as long as}} the coupling strength is strong enough. Secondly, it is proved that the <b>settling</b> <b>times</b> are determined by the interaction strength, system parameters and initial conditions of the chaotic systems. Furthermore, it is found that the <b>settling</b> <b>times</b> are mainly dependent on the bounded value and dimension of the coupled chaotic systems when the individual chaotic sub-system is bounded. Finally, illustrative examples and numerical simulations are given to show the correctness of theoretical results...|$|R

50|$|A {{closely related}} {{phenomenon}} is ringing, when, following overshoot, a signal then falls below its steady-state value, and then may bounce back above, taking some <b>time</b> to <b>settle</b> {{close to its}} steady-state value; this latter time is called the <b>settle</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
