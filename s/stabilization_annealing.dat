40|$|Low-activated F 82 H-mod. {{steel plate}} {{material}} was made {{available by the}} Japanese side to the European laboratories, where various tests are performed {{within the framework of}} the Fusion Technology Research Program. The activities of the FZK-IMF I focused among others on the investigation of the creep and creep-rupture strength behavior. The tests were performed on three plates in the reference state (as received = 1040 38 '+ 750 1 h) at temperatures of 450 - 700 C for a period of up to 30000 h. Furthermore, the aging behavior following <b>stabilization</b> <b>annealing</b> (550 / 600 - 5000 h) and the influence of reduced hardening temperatures (950 or 1000 C) were examined. On the basis of the experimental data and in accordance with the design criteria for 400 - 650 C/ 20000 h, minimum values could be indicated for the 1 % time yield limit and the creep-rupture strength. In addition, specimens were tested at 875 C hardening temperature and tests were performed with a preliminary temperature transient to 875 C, during which a two-phase structure of martensite+ferrite was formed. The associated decrease in strength could be quantified. (orig.) 32 refs.

40|$|Following {{the history}} of the {{development}} activities from conventional martensitic 12 % Cr steel, MANET and OPTIFER up to low-activated EUROFER (RAFM steel), the results obtained from experiments on rods of 100 mm diameter and plates of 14 mm shall be presented for a basic characterization. The physical and mechanical properties shall be compared with those of OPTIFER- 1 W and the F 82 H-mod 2 % W steel. To determine the conversion behavior, a continuous cct diagram was plotted. Hardening experiments in the temperature range of 850 - 1120 C illustrated the range of maximum hardness as well as grain size development. The notch impact behavior was described for various heat treatments and sample types at test temperatures ranging from + 60 to - 100 C. Tensile strengths were determined for various heat treatments at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 700 C. Aging due to a long-term heat treatment was investigated by means of <b>stabilization</b> <b>annealing</b> experiments. Creep rupture strength and creeping were investigated in the temperature range of 450 - 650 C. So far, a duration of up to about 15 000 h has been covered by the experiments. (orig.)

40|$|EUROFER 97 - the European {{reference}} {{material for the}} first wall of a DEMO fusion reactor - was produced as 3. 5 t batch of rods and plates. Following {{the history of the}} development activities from conventional martensitic 12 % Cr steel, MANET and OPTIFER up to the low or reduced activation (RAFM) EUROFER steel, results obtained from experiments on specimens from rods (diameter 100 mm) and plates (14 mm) are presented for a basic characterization. Physical and mechanical properties are compared with those of OPTIFER- 1 W and the F 82 H-mod 2 % W steel. The transition behaviour was determined by plotting a continuous TTT (time temperature transition) diagram. In addition, extension coefficients were determined from room temperature up to 1000 C. Hardening tests at temperatures from 850 C to 1120 C illustrated the range of maximum hardness as well as grain size development. Tempering tests and additional annealing experiments from 300 C to 875 C allowed characterizing tempering behaviour and stability. Charpy properties were examined for various heat treatments and specimen types between 60 C and - 100 C. Further, ductility criteria like FATT, DBTT and 68 J were determined. Particular attention was paid to the influence of grain size and O_ 2 content. Tensile strength was measured for several heat treatments between room temperature and 700 C. Long-term ageing was investigated by means of <b>stabilization</b> <b>annealing</b> experiments. These were carried out with various temperature/time combinations including tensile tests. In EUROFER tensile strength was hardly affected by the different heat treatments while the ductility criteria showed only a moderate increase in temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that EUROFER is not susceptible to ageing. Creep and creep rupture properties were investigated in the temperature range of 450 C to 650 C. So far, creep times of up to 15000 h have been covered by the experiments. The status of the test program allows for an extrapolation of the 1 % yield limits and times to rupture to a period of 20000 h. Creep behaviour and stress exponents can be determined reliably for the experimental stress range. However, for the design relevant low stress range (= 100 MPa) up to 550 C creep data are still lacking. Therefore, special creep tests at 500 C and 550 C were started in 2001. They are aimed at the experimental determination of design yield limits (0. 01 - 1 %) and minimum creep rate behaviour.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{chemical}} composition of Mg- 8. 5 at. % Ni- 2. 7 at. %X alloys (X – {{elements of the}} 13 th and 14 th groups) as prospective hydrogen storage was investigated. Experimental alloys were studied in three states: (i) after <b>stabilization</b> <b>anneal,</b> (ii) after <b>stabilization</b> <b>anneal</b> and hydrogen charging, and (iii) after <b>stabilization</b> <b>anneal,</b> hydrogen charging and hydrogen desorption. It was ascertained that a ratio of concentration of X in two principal phases – Mg 2 NiH 4 (-X) and MgH 2 (-X) – was a decreasing function of the ionization potential of X. The stronger the preference of X for Mg 2 NiH 4 -X phase, the higher the hydrogen storage capacity of Mg-Ni-X alloy was. For X = In, the hydrogen storage capacity was slightly higher than the capacity of an un-alloyed binary eutectic Mg-Ni alloy...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{temperature}} dependent thermoelectric properties of sol-gel prepared ZnO and 3 % Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) thin films have been explored. The power factor of GZO films, {{as compared to}} ZnO, is improved by nearly 17 % at high temperature. A <b>stabilization</b> <b>anneal,</b> prior to thermoelectric measurements, in a strongly reducing Ar/H 2 (95 / 5) atmosphere at 500 °C was found to effectively stabilize the chemically derived films, practically eliminating hysteresis during thermoelectric measurements. Subtle changes in the thermoelectric properties of stabilized films have been correlated to oxygen vacancies and excitonic levels that are known to exist in ZnO-based thin films. The role of Ga dopants and defects, formed upon annealing, in driving the observed complex temperature dependence of the thermoelectric properties is discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} literatures have {{demonstrated}} that different heat treatment routes can produce a variety of microstructures in α[*]+[*]β Ti- 6 Al- 4  V (Ti 64) alloys, which strongly affects the static and dynamic properties (Venkatesh et al. 2009; Morita et al. 2005; Semiatin et al. 2003; Ivasishin et al. 2002; Chandler 1996). Typical heat treatment processes of Ti 64 alloy are conducted in α[*]+[*]β region below β transus, including duplex annealing, solution heat treatment and aging (STA), recrystallization annealing, and mill annealing. Unlike the α[*]+[*]β processing, the β annealing of α[*]+[*]β Ti 64 alloy is a less common type of hot working (Chandler 1996; Campbell 2011). The purpose of β annealing is to induce the microstructure of Widmanstatten or acicular α phase to obtain enhanced resistance to fracture, fatigue, and creep, albeit moderately sacrificing strength and ductility {{as compared to the}} microstructure of equiaxed α phase (Campbell 2011; Welsch et al. 1993; Wanhill and Barter 2011; Yoder et al. 1976). The β annealing is done at a temperature only slightly higher than the β transus to prevent excessive grain growth (Ivasishin et al. 2002). Annealing time depends on section thickness and should be long enough to permit complete transformation to β phase, while it should also be held to a minimum to suppress the grain growth of β phase (Donachie 2000; Ivasishin et al. 2002; Davis 1995; Borisova et al. 1975). The β annealing can be followed by passive air cool, although larger sections may need to be fan cooled or even water quenched to prevent the formation of detrimental layer of α phase at grain boundaries (Donachie 2000). In α[*]+[*]β titanium alloys, thermal instability is a function of β phase transformation since, cooling from the annealing temperature, the β phase can transform to the undesirable (brittle) intermediate ω phase (Donachie 2000; Froes 2015; Rajan et al. 2011). To prevent the formation of ω phase, a <b>stabilization</b> <b>anneal</b> is generally given for the α[*]+[*]β titanium alloys (Donachie 2000; Froes 2015). This annealing treatment produces a stable β phase capable of resisting further transformation when exposed to elevated temperatures in service. The α[*]+[*]β Ti 64 alloy that is lean in β can be air cooled from the annealing temperature without impairing their stability (Donachie 2000; Campbell 2008).|$|R
40|$|AbstractEffects of {{annealing}} after/under iron (Fe) ion irradiation on deuterium (D) retention {{behavior in}} tungsten (W) were studied. The D 2 TDS spectra {{as a function}} of heating temperature for 0. 1 dpa damaged W showed that the D retention was clearly decreased as the annealing temperature was increased. In particular, the desorption of D trapped by voids was largely reduced by annealing at 1173 K. The TEM observation indicated that the size of dislocation loops was clearly grown, and its density was decreased by the annealing above 573 K. After annealing at 1173 K, almost all the dislocation loops were recovered. The results of positron annihilation spectroscopy suggested that the density of vacancy-type defects such as voids, was decreased as the annealing temperature was increased, while its size was increased, indicating that the D retention was reduced by the recovery of the voids. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} desorption temperature of D trapped by the voids for damaged W above 0. 3 dpa was shifted toward higher temperature side. These results lead to a conclusion that the D retention behavior is controlled by defect density. The D retention in the samples annealed during irradiation was less than that annealed after irradiation. This result shows that defects would be quickly annihilated before <b>stabilization</b> by <b>annealing</b> during irradiation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe medium Mn steels are a {{topic of}} {{interest}} from both practical and scientific point of view. Many studies were focused on the microstructure characterization, but only some of them addressed the mechanisms of austenite formation and stabilization. Hence, there are still remaining questions regarding {{the link between the}} optimum retained austenite fraction and stability and the austenite formation including both the morphological and kinetics aspects. In this work, different ART annealing treatments were performed on a cold rolled 0. 1 C – 4. 7 Mn (wt. %) steel. SEM and TEM observations as well as XRD and magnetic measurements were done to characterize the resulting microstructures. Microstructure evolution was analyzed as a function of soaking time: precipitation and dissolution of cementite; austenite nucleation, growth and stabilization. The experimental observations were compared with the predictions from thermodynamic calculations. Based on the obtained results, a mechanism of austenite formation and <b>stabilization</b> during ART <b>annealing</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{constitutes a}} thorough {{study of the}} relationship between the chemical stability, aging state and global molecular motion on the one hand, and microscopic local mobility in multi-component systems on the other hand. The objective of the present work was to determine whether annealing a glass below Tg affects its chemical stability and determine if the rate of chemical degradation couples with global relaxation times determined using calorimetery, and/or with T 1 and T 1 rho relaxation times measured using ssNMR. Model compounds chosen for this research were lyophilized aspartame/sucrose and aspartame/trehalose (1 : 10 w/w) formulations. The chemical degradation was assessed at various temperatures using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the impact of annealing on chemical stability. The rate constant for chemical degradation was estimated using stretched time kinetics. The results support the hypothesis that thermal history affects the molecular mobility required for structural relaxation and such effect is critical for chemical stability, that is, a <b>stabilization</b> effect upon <b>annealing</b> is observed...|$|R
40|$|Total joint {{arthroplasty}} is {{a highly}} successful procedure; however, the one major issue that remains is wear of the bearing surfaces and the resultant adverse biological response to wear particles. Many studies of ultra-high molecular weight poly-ethylene have indicated that residual free radicals combined with oxygen result in increased brittleness and reduction of mechanical properties. The development of highly cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with use of irra-diation in inert environments, and subsequent free-radical <b>stabilization</b> by either <b>annealing</b> or remelting, provided a bearing surface {{with the potential for}} significant reduction of wear. There have been several clinical studies that have confirmed, with use of radiographic techniques, this reduction in wear. However, in the recent radiographic study by Currier et al., an unexpected increase in wear was seen in this ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene after seven years in vivo. This troubling observation requires further study. Currier et al. investigated clinically retrieved components of several designs, manufactured from distinct formulations of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, to provide additional data on their in vivo performance. Several important observations were made in both retrieved acetabular cups and retrieved tibial inserts. The range of radiation doses employed is of interest, as this essentially determines the extent of cross-linking and free-radical generation in the unstabilized material. It is notable that only one of twenty-six moderately irradiated (5 -Mrad) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene acetabular liners had an oxidation index of> 0. 1, while eight of twenty-four highly irradiated (> 9 -Mrad) acetabular liners were found to have a peak oxidation inde...|$|R
