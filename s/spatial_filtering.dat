5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Out of plane {{resonators}} lead to {{rotation of}} the beam profile and more stability. The heat generated in the gain medium leads to frequency drift of the cavity, therefore the frequency can be actively stabilized by locking it to unpowered cavity. Similarly the pointing stability of a laser may still be improved by <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> by an optical fibre.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{amplification}} {{system used}} in Nova and other high-power lasers of its era was limited {{in terms of}} power density and pulse length. One {{problem was that the}} amplifier glass responded over a period of time, not instantaneously, and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified. Another problem was that the high power densities led to the same sorts of self-focusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs, but at such a magnitude that even measures like <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> would not be enough, in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air.|$|E

40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) -based brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) {{often use}} <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> to improve signal-to-noise ratio of task-related EEG activities. To obtain robust <b>spatial</b> <b>filters,</b> {{large amounts of}} labeled data, which are often expensive and labor-intensive to obtain, need to be collected in a training procedure before online BCI control. Several studies have recently developed zero-training methods using a session-to-session scenario in order to alleviate this problem. To our knowledge, a state-to-state translation, which applies <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> derived from one state to another, has never been reported. This study proposes a state-to-state, zero-training method to construct <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> for extracting EEG changes induced by motor imagery. Independent component analysis (ICA) was separately applied to the multi-channel EEG in the resting and the motor imagery states to obtain motor-related <b>spatial</b> <b>filters.</b> The resultant <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> were then applied to single-trial EEG to differentiate left- and right-hand imagery movements. On a motor imagery dataset collected from nine subjects, comparable classification accuracies were obtained by using ICA-based <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> derived from the two states (motor imagery: 87. 0 %, resting: 85. 9 %), which were both {{significantly higher than the}} accuracy achieved by using monopolar scalp EEG data (80. 4 %). The proposed method considerably increases the practicality of BCI systems in real-world environments because it is less sensitive to electrode misalignment across different sessions or days and does not require annotated pilot data to derive <b>spatial</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceBrain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim at {{translating}} brain signals, typically ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), into commands {{for external}} devices. <b>Spatial</b> <b>filters</b> are powerful tools for EEG classification, {{able to reduce}} spatial blurring effects. In particular, optimal <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> {{have been designed to}} classify EEG signals based on band power features. Unfortunately, there are other relevant EEG features for which no optimal <b>spatial</b> <b>filter</b> exists. This is the case for Phase Locking Value (PLV) features, which measure the synchronization between 2 EEG channels. Therefore, this paper proposes to create such a pair of optimal <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> for PLV-features. To do so, we optimized a functional measuring the discriminability of PLV-features based on a genetic algorithm. An evaluation of our algorithm on a motor imagery EEG data set showed that using optimized <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> led to higher classification performances, and that combining the resulting PLV features with traditional methods boosts the overall BCI performances...|$|R
25|$|Smoothing, or <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering,</b> is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E
