The welding parameters such as welding power, processing speed, diameter of the welding beam are selected so that the cooling rate during the {{hardening of the material}} is 8000 (K/s). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for welding workpieces (9) made of high temperature resistant superalloys, comprises applying a welding filler material (13) on the workpiece surface by a heat input zone (11) and a <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> for the supply of the filler material into the heat input zone, where the heat input zone and the <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> and/or the workpiece surface (10) are moved relative to each other. The welding parameters such as welding power, processing speed, diameter of the welding beam are selected so that the cooling rate during the hardening of the material is 8000 (K/s). The welding parameters are adjusted related to the welding power and/or the diameter of the heat input zone. The processing speed is 500 mm/min. The welding seam is produced by a layer-wise application of the filler material. The previously applied layer with low layer strength is melted. The heat input zone and the <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> are moved along a welding direction relative to the workpiece surface for each layer, and the welding directions are rotated against each other. The heat input zone and the <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> are moved along a welding direction on a path oscillating around the welding direction relative to the work piece surface. The workpiece comprises a gamma -containing nickel based-superalloy and the filler material is gamma -forming nickel based-superalloy material. A heat treatment is carried out on the application of the filler material. A 300 W-laser or neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser is used, where lambda is equal to 1. 06 mu m. The laser power is 100 - 150 W. The diameter of a laser beam is 600 mu m. A polycrystalline weld seam is obtained. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a welding device for welding of workpieces such as gas turbine blades. USE - Method useful for welding of workpieces.

The first pre-eruption VLP occurs approximately 2  h prior to the first eruption.

The next burst of VLP is at a similar source depth, begins about 10  min prior to the first eruption (P 1) and stops just before the eruption onset (Figs.  4, 5). This VLP tremor seems plausibly related to the first eruption via an advection mechanism and may also relate to later eruptive events (P 2 –P 6). The large VLP event occurring just prior to the P 4 eruption is unlikely to be linked to the P 4 eruption via advection, and hence, other mechanisms for the eruption should be examined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{reports on}} a study {{investigating}} the epidemiology of sporadic cryptosporidiosis in the North West of England and Wales using a Geographical Information System (GIS) to map location of residence of cases. Some 747 reports of cases were made to CDSC North West of which 649 reports were suitable for analysis. Cases were plotted on the maps of water <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> and water quality area boundaries, provided by the two main water utilities. Results It was notable that there were major spatial variations in attack rate across the North West and Wales. The most dramatic example was the large difference between the Greater Manchester conurbation with many reports and Liverpool with none. Given the distribution of previously detected waterborne outbreaks in the region it was initially thought that drinking water source may be an explanation. However, {{an analysis of the}} distribution of cases in the Greater Manchester area showed no correlation with any of five water supplies that serve the conurbation. Conclusions Our study has shown a dramatic variation in the incidence of laboratory confirmed cryptosporidiosis within two regions of the United Kingdom.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a qualitative model of erosion of loose volcaniclastic material on steep slopes of La Fossa cone (Vulcano Island, Italy) that generates small volume debris flows. The loose volcaniclastic cover rests on an almost impermeable substratum, which comprises a fine-grained hydromagmatic tuff. Morphologically, three sectors were distinguished: 1) a water <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> (slopeN 328) where rain water is enriched in mud and {{concentrated in the}} initiation zone; 2) an initiation zone (or source area sensu stricto slope with ~ 308) where debris flows form and; 3) a transport and deposition zone where debris flows deposited levees and terminal lobes (slope ~ 308). Main episodes of erosion of loose volcaniclastic cover and debris flow generation occur in response to thunderstorms. The erosion of tuff from superficial water added {{a significant amount of}} fines (mud fraction) to the initiating flows. Debris flow stoppage on steep slopes was interpreted {{as the result of a}} loss of mass (estimated between 35 % and 53 % of total mass) to form levees. From field and laboratory data the density of debris flows was estimated at about 1950 kg/m 3.

Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water <b>supply</b> <b>zones</b> in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory.

To insure the security of the coal supply, China has begun to build regional strategic coal reserves at some locations, but transportation is still the fundamental way to guaranty supply security. Here, we study China's coal transportation quantitatively with a linear programming method that analyses the direction and volume of China's coal flows with the prerequisite that each province's supply and demand balance is guaranteed. First, we analyse the optimal coal transportation for the status quo coal supply and demand given the bottleneck effects that the Daqin Railway has on China's coal flow; second, we analyse the influence of future shifts in the coal <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> in the future, finding that China's coal flows will also change, which will pressure China to construct railways and ports; and finally, we analyse the possibility of exploiting Yangtze River capacity for coal transportation.

30|$|As the {{monitoring}} results showed extremely high turbidity peaks {{at the beginning}} of the rainy season, in a first step, an intermittently operated slow sand filtration should be installed centrally prior to water distribution to remove suspended solids and thus protect the distribution system. Thus, especially the high turbidity peaks in the rainy season can be prevented from entering the distribution system. In cooperation with Indonesian partners, this step of the water treatment concept was implemented exemplarily for one part of community directly supplied by the first reservoir, namely reservoir Kaligoro. To develop an optimized design, laboratory experiments with local sands were done. Based on the assumption that 195  m 3 /day of water need to be treated to supply the five sub-villages of the <b>supply</b> <b>zone</b> Kaligoro (total input flow in Kaligoro is 6 192  m 3 /day, 3.5  % is used to supply the five sub-villages, 10  % water loss), a total filter bed area of 50  m 2 was calculated. The preliminary design included six filter beds with a size of 25  m 2 each to allow an alternating operation. However, for the current exemplary implementation, only three such filter beds were installed to validate their performance in field operation (Fuchs et al. 2015). The construction of the sand filter in Gunung Kidul was executed by the Indonesian project partners and finished in early 2015 (Fig.  4).|$|E
30|$|In {{many old}} marine basins, {{multiple}} source rocks have developed. These rocks are old, {{with a high}} thermal evolution extent, and have experienced multiple hydrocarbon generations and expulsions.

For example, it is unclear whether the Jingbian gas field of the Ordos Basin contains oil-formed gas from Ordovician shales and carbonate rocks or coal-formed gas from the Carboniferous–Permian coal measure strata (Chen 1994, 2002; Dai et al. 2005 b; Huang et al. 1996; Wang et al. 2009 b; Chen et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012 b) and whether the Lower Paleozoic oil and gas in the Tarim Basin are mainly from the Cambrian or Ordovician strata (Liang et al. 2000; Li et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012; Tian et al. 2012 a, b).
