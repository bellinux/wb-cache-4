40|$|Cats {{that live}} in areas where canine and human leishmaniosis due to Leishmania infantum is endemic may become {{infected}} and may develop anti-Leishmania antibodies: In this study 50 clinically normal and 50 cats with cutaneous and/or systemic signs that lived in an endemic area and had been previously examined for infection by L infantum using PCR in four different tissues were serologically tested {{for the presence of}} anti-Leishmania IgG (IFAT and ELISA) and IgM (IFAT). The aim was to compare the results of IFAT, ELISA and PCR and to investigate the possible associations between seropositivity to Leishmania spp and signalment, living conditions, season of sampling, health status of the cats, and seropositivity to other infectious agents. Low concentrations of anti-Leishmania IgG were detected by IFAT in 10 % of the cats and by ELISA in 1 %, whereas anti-Leishmania IgM were detected by IFAT in 1 %. There was disagreement between the results of IFAT and ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG (P = 0. 039) and between all serological tests and PCR (P < 0. 001). The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests, using PCR as the gold standard, was very low, but ELISA and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM had 100 % specificity. The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests could not be improved by changing the cut-off values. Seropositivity for Leishmania spp was not associated with signalment, living conditions, season of sampling and health status of the cats or with seropositivity to feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae. In conclusion, because of their low sensitivity and very high specificity two of the evaluated <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> (<b>ELISA</b> for anti-Leishmania IgG and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM) may be useless as population screening tests but valuable for diagnosing feline infection by L. infantum.

40|$|My Bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{examination}} of celiac disease in connection to osteoporosis. The aim of the thesis was to specify the level of antidotes against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG in the serum with osteoporosis diagnosed patients, to interpret, {{based on the results}} of the study, possible link between osteoporosis and celiac disease as well as to compare the outcome with scientific data. I focused on the present knowledge of osteoporosis and celiac disease in the first part. As for celiac disease, I described its history and characteristics. I also paid attention to diagnostics of celiac disease with the assistance of laboratory <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> <b>ELISA.</b> I mentioned the free-gluten diet treatment after that. As regards osteoporosis, I described its history, symptoms, forms, perils and complications which the disease causes. I conducted the methodical part of my work in the biochemical haematological laboratory Stafila where I work, with its seat in České Budějovice. As for measurements, I took them in the department of microbiology, where immunologic tests are also taken. I carried out the screening of celiac disease from serum, namely the determination of antidotes against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG, with the aid of ELISA - a sandwich method. I took measurements with 58 osteoporosis diagnosed patients. I obtained the sera thanks to the supervisor of my thesis Mrs. Marie Ládová, who is at the head of an osteological outpatient department in České Budějovice. I stated the serological markers of celiac disease with the assistance of enzymatic immunoanalysis conducted on automatic analyzer Nexgen Four, which was provided by the firm Test-Line. I describe the analyzer, its specification, checking and calibration of the gadget together with determination checks in this part of the thesis. Additionally, there is described the principle of the method ELISA- sandwich, which is non-competitive enzymatic immunoanalysis. At the end of the section there is depicted the methodical procedure of my work, the preparation of working solutions and checks, the preparation and dilution of samples for analysis and working procedure for semiquantitative interpretation with positivity index and for quantitative interpretation U/ml. I continued with my own measurements. while respecting standard operations procedures of the laboratory Stafila, a limited liability company. The results of my measurements are processed in the third part of the thesis. The acquired results are given in a table: quantitative interpretation of the antidote against tTg IgA and IgG (U/ml) level in the sera of the osteoporosis diagnosed patients. Then I presented a graph interpreting the proportional relation of the antidote against tTg IgA and IgG levels in the sera of the osteoporosis diagnosed patients. There are included calibration graphs for tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG and tables of the obtained data of checks for the methods in the results. 3 out of the 58 examined samples of osteoporotic patients were positive, they had the level of antibodies higher than 22 U/ml. One of the samples had marginal figures, which means it had the antidotes against tTg IgA an IgG between 18 and 22 U/ml. Positive results were found with patients born in 1976 and 1978. A patient born in 1962 appeared to have a marginal result. The acquired antidote figures against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG are presented proportionally in the graph 1. 3 out of the 58 measured samples were positive, which represents 5 %, and 1 sample was marginal, which is 2 %. My analysis is based on the availability of the examined material and the potential of our laboratory. Celiac disease is an illness which was not paid much attention to in the past.

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{values of}} seven <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> (<b>ELISAs)</b> {{and of the}} obligatory European Union-approved routine visual meat inspection {{for the detection of}} Taenia saginata cysticercosis were investigated. A total of 793 slaughtered dairy cows were selected in three European Union approved abattoirs in Switzerland, an endemic area (apparent prevalence by enhanced meat inspection up to 4. 5 %) with typically low parasite burdens. ELISAs based on a somatic larval antigen, isoelectric focused somatic larval antigen, larval excretory/secretory antigens, peptide HP 6 - 2, peptide Ts 45 S- 10, pooled peptide solution and a monoclonal antibody antigen capture assay were initially screened. As there is no perfect diagnostic 'gold standard' reference test, the obligatory meat inspection and four selected <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> were further analysed using Bayesian inference to estimate the "true" prevalence and the diagnostic test sensitivities and specificities. The ELISA for specific antibody detection based on excretory/secretory antigens showed highest sensitivity and specificity with 81. 6 % (95 % credible interval: 70 - 92) and 96. 3 % (95 % credible interval: 94 - 99), respectively. The Bayesian model estimated the specificity of the ELISA, based on the synthetic peptide Ts 45 S- 10 as 55. 2 % (95 % credible interval: 46 - 65) and sensitivity as 84. 7 % (95 % credible interval: 82 - 88).

40|$|As a {{high degree}} of {{homology}} exists between the proviral genomes of HTLV-I and HTLV-II, there is significant cross-reactivity. Therefore although detection of HTLV antibodies is characteristic of viral infection, it is not sufficient to confirm the presence of the viral type. Molecular tests used to diagnose the HTLV-I/II viruses are based on investigations of proviral genomic sequences, and allow for an infection to be diagnosed prior to the appearance of any sign or symptom. The HTLV proviral load in infected individuals can be determined using real-time PCR, a faster method with less risk of contamination than simple or nested PCR. We analyzed 63 samples from the Hemope Hospital, of which 33 were from HTLV seropositive individuals and 30 from blood donors, to determine the type of virus and the proviral load. The sensitivity of qualitative PCR in comparison to ELISA was 87. 5 % (95 % IC: 70. 1 - 95. 9 %) and the specificity was 100 % (IC 95 %: 85. 9 - 100. 0 %). The sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR in comparison to the <b>serological</b> <b>test</b> (<b>ELISA)</b> were 100 % (95 % IC: 86. 7 - 100. 0 %) and 96. 67 % (95 % IC: 80. 9 - 99. 8 %) respectively. The proviral load in the seropositive individuals ranged from 13 to 343820 copies/ 106 PBMC cells.

Methodology: H. pylori status in patients was determined by two biopsy based tests (histology and rapid urease test) as invasive tests and by a <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>ELISA</b> IgG) as non-invasive test. Results: The age of the selected 68 patients ranged from 18 - 70 years {{with a mean age}} of 37. 9 ± 14. 15 years. H. pylori was more prevalent among males than females (70. 5 % vs 29. 5 %, p= 0. 020) and among age group (18 -< 30) years. No significant difference was estimated between positive and negative HP cases in residency, work status, marital status, smoking, socioeconomic level and aspirin intake. The most common complaints in the selected patients having endoscopy were: epigastric pain, heart burn, and dyspepsia. A significant correlation was detected between H. pylori and each of age, sex and Diabetes Mellitus. The most prevalent endoscopic findings of the positive H. pylori cases were mild gastritis (84. 1 %). There was a significant difference in gastritis (p= 0. 003) and duodenitis (p= 0. 031) between positive and negative cases for H. pylori histopathology. The prevalence of H. pylori was 60. 29 % by rapid urease test, 64. 7 % by histopathological examination and 67. 6 % by serology among the studied cases. Conclusion: H. pylori-infected patients with upper GI symptoms were found to have more abnormal endoscopic and pathological findings than those without H. pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|For over 10 years {{infectious}} laringotracheitis {{has occurred}} rarely in Vojvodina. In such situations morbidity was 40 % and mortality was 16 %. Drop in egg production was over 30 % and after 4 weeks egg production returned to normal. After {{the disappearance of}} clinical symptoms and after 30 days of quarantine and disinfection of eggs with formaldehyde and 5 % hydrogen peroxide there was no appearance of the disease in hatched chickens. Clinical observation and pathohistology results are valuable proof for diagnosis of ILT. Diagnosis of ILT should be confirmed by virus isolation or applying <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> such as <b>ELISA</b> on sera from diseased chickens...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} of the stomach is associated with gastritis and peptic ulceration and may be causative. A noninvasive test for this organism might be useful in managing some patients with dyspepsia {{without the need for}} further investigation. We have evaluated a new commercially available <b>serological</b> <b>test</b> (Helico-G <b>ELISA,</b> Porton Cambridge, UK) for this infection to assess its diagnostic accuracy in a retrospective study of 115 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. Sixty-three of these patients (55 %) were found to have H. pylori infection and gastritis on histology. A sensitivity of 81 % and specificity of 90 % were obtained. No significant fall in the antibody titres was found in a subgroup of 15 patients who were selected to complete a course of triple therapy despite significant improvement in their dyspepsia score and confirmed eradication of H. pylori organism in 80 % of these patients. We conclude that the test has limited value in aiding clinical decision of managing patients with dyspepsia...|$|R

In the years 2008 – 2010 research concerning the detection and identification of viruses occurring on production plantations of the highbush blueberry located in the central and south-eastern Poland and the cranberry growing on the separate parts of the plantation in the central Poland using the <b>serological</b> <b>ELISA</b> <b>test</b> and PCR technique were performed. The results of the performed <b>serological</b> <b>ELISA</b> <b>test</b> showed the presence on the bushes of various cultivars of the Blueberry shoestring virus (BSSV) and Peach rosette mosaic vi-rus (PRMV) (central and south-eastern Poland) and the Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV) and Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) (central Poland). During the observations carried out on the plantings of the highbush blueberry only the symptoms characteristic for the infec-tion with the BlScV were noted (central Poland). This virus was also detected using DAS-ELISA test in the cranberry plants growing in the separate parts of plantations in the cen-tral region of Poland (Plantation A/W), which did not show any disease symptoms. In Eu-rope {{it is the first}} report on the occurrence of BlScV in the cranberry bushes. What i...|$|R
