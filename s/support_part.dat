5|$|The castle {{is faced}} with red sandstone, and has lead, asphalt and tile roofs. It is mainly in three storeys with a five-storey tower. The {{buildings}} are arranged around a ward with the principal accommodation on the north side. It {{is surrounded by a}} dry moat which is bridged at the gatehouse. To the west of the inner ward are the stables, the coach house, a rectangular bell tower and the kitchens and service area. To the north is the great hall range which consists of 18bays. Behind the entrance to the hall is the circular main tower. At the east end of the gallery wing is the octagonal library tower. The outer walls of the castle have full-height slender turrets at the changes in direction. Corbel tables <b>support</b> <b>part</b> of the battlements. The walls contain arrow slots, and in the gatehouse is a garderobe. The flat roof has a crenellated parapet.|$|E
