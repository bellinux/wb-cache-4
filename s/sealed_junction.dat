The influence of the sensor design on its own characteristics is also examined. It is shown that a solid electrolyte used {{in the form of}} discs with cavities significantly simplifies the design of this type of sensors. A sensor based on La 0. 95 Sr 0. 05 YO 3 electrolyte with fully <b>sealed</b> <b>junction</b> between discs is suitable for the analysis of mixtures with high H- 2 content. It is found that by increasing H 2 content from 10 to 98 % the limiting current increases from 0. 25 to 2. 25 mA (at 750 mV). It is also found that the sensor based on La 0. 95 Sr 0. 05 YO 3 with discs sealed in two points as well as the sensor based on CaZr 0. 9 Sc 0. 1 O 3 with fully <b>sealed</b> <b>junction</b> are suitable for the analysis of mixtures with low H- 2 content (0. 5 - 2 %). For the above cases, the limiting current at 2 % H- 2 reaches 3. 5 and 0. 5 mA (at 750 mV), respectively. CaTi 0. 95 Sc 0. 05 O 3 is not suitable {{to be used as a}} hydrogen sensor. In all the examined systems, steam content does not affect sensors' behavior and high operating temperatures (850 degrees C) increase the range of sensors' hydrogen measuring concentration capacity.

40|$|International audience: The {{formation}} of the first epithelium was an essential step for animal evolution since it has allowed both the coordination {{of the behavior of}} a cell layer, {{and the creation of a}} selective barrier between the internal medium and the outside world. The possibility of coupling the cells in a single layer has allowed morphogenetic events such as tube formation, or gastrulation, to form more complex animal morphologies. The invention of <b>sealed</b> <b>junctions</b> between cells has offered, on the other hand, the possibility to create an asymmetry of nutrients or salts between both sides of the epithelial layer. The creation of an internal medium has led to homeostasis, allowing the evolution of more complex physiological functions, and the emergence of sophisticated animal shapes. During evolution, the origins of the first animals coincided with the invention of several protein complexes, including true cadherins, and the polarity protein complexes. How these complexes regulate the {{formation of}} the apico-lateral border and the adherens junctions is still not fully understood.

40|$|Occludin, the {{putative}} tight junction integral membrane protein, {{is an attractive}} candidate for a protein that forms the actual sealing element of the tight junction. To study the role of occludin {{in the formation of}} the tight <b>junction</b> <b>seal,</b> synthetic peptides (OCC 1 and OCC 2) corresponding to the two putative extracellular domains of occludin were assayed for their ability to alter tight junctions in Xenopus kidney epithelial cell line A 6. Transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular tracer flux measurements indicated that the second extracellular domain peptide (OCC 2) reversibly disrupted the transepithelial permeability barrier at concentrations of < 5 μM. Despite the increased paracellular permeability, there were no changes in gross epithelial cell morphology as determined by scanning EM. The OCC 2 peptide decreased the amount of occludin present at the tight junction, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, as well as decreased total cellular content of occludin, as assessed by Western blot analysis. Pulse-labeling and metabolic chase analysis suggested that this decrease in occludin level could be attributed to an increase in turnover of cellular occludin rather than a decrease in occludin synthesis. The effect on occludin was specific because other tight junction components, ZO- 1, ZO- 2, cingulin, and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, were unaltered by OCC 2 treatment. Therefore, the peptide corresponding to the second extracellular domain of occludin perturbs the tight junction permeability barrier in a very specific manner. The correlation between a decrease in occludin levels and the perturbation of the tight junction permeability barrier provides evidence for a role of occludin {{in the formation of the}} tight <b>junction</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|R

Demyelination (stripping off the insulating sheath) has been widely {{regarded as one of}} the most important mechanisms altering the action potential propagation in many neurological diseases. However, the effective nerve conduction is also thought to require a proper myelin <b>seal</b> through myelin <b>junctions</b> such as tight junctions and adherens junctions. In the present study, we have demonstrated the disruption of myelin junctions in a mouse model (Pmp 22 +/-) of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) with heterozygous deletion of Pmp 22 gene. We observed a robust increase of F-actin in Pmp 22 +/- nerve regions where myelin junctions were disrupted, leading to increased myelin permeability. These abnormalities were present long before segmental demyelination at the late phase of Pmp 22 +/- mice. Moreover, the increase of F-actin levels correlated with an enhanced activity of p 21 -activated kinase (PAK 1), a molecule known to regulate actin polymerization. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK normalized levels of F-actin, and completely prevented the progression of the myelin junction disruption and nerve conduction failure in Pmp 22 +/- mice. Our findings explain how abnormal myelin permeability is caused in HNPP, leading to impaired action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination. We call it "functional demyelination", a novel mechanism upstream to the actual stripping of myelin that is relevant to many demyelinating diseases.

40|$|Mating tactics differ remarkably {{between and}} within species of social Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants) concerning, e. g., mating frequencies, sperm competition, {{and the degree}} of male sperm limitation. Although social Hymenoptera might, therefore, {{potentially}} be ideal model systems for testing sexual selection theory, the dynamics of mating and sperm transfer have rarely been studied in species other than social bees, and basic information needed to draw conclusions about possible sperm competition and female choice is lacking. We investigated sperm transfer in the ant Leptothorax gredleri, a species in which female sexuals attract males by "female calling. " The analysis of 38 female sexuals fixed immediately or up to 7 days after copulation with a single male each revealed that the sperm is transferred into the female bursa copulatrix embedded in a gelatinous mass, presumably a spermatophore. Sperm cells rapidly start to migrate from the tip of the spermatophore towards the spermatheca, but transfer is drastically slowed down by an extreme constriction of the spermathecal duct, through which sperm cells have to pass virtually one by one. This results in the spermatheca being filled only between one and several hours after mating. During this time, the posterior part of the spermatophore <b>seals</b> the <b>junction</b> between bursa copulatrix and spermathecal duct and prevents sperm loss.

There is a sudden increase in permeability of the follicle wall from previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis. This is not due {{to a loss of}} <b>sealing</b> (tight) <b>junctions</b> in the granulosa cell layer, but is probably related to a permeability change in the basement membrane. The transition from the slow growth phase to the rapid growth during vitellogenesis is accompanied by a limited widening of the intercellular channels and the concomitant development of a complex endocytotic apparatus in the ooplasm. The slowing down of yolk deposition during the last day before ovulation is accompanied by a narrowing of the intercellular channel width. The granulosa cells show a high intracellular HRP uptake during intermediary yolk formation. Transcytosis through the granulosa cannot be excluded but is probably a minor pathway at certain stages. The light microscopically detectable uptake of HRP by the oocyte coincides with the start of exogenous vitellogenesis.

40|$|Tight junctions, {{the most}} apical of the {{intercellular}} junctions that connect individual cells in a epithelial sheet, {{are thought to}} form a seal that restricts paracellular and intramembrane diffusion. To analyze the functioning of tight junctions, we generated stable MDCK strain 2 cell lines expressing either full-length or COOH-terminally truncated chicken occludin, the only known transmembrane component of tight junctions. Confocal immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that mutant occludin was incorporated into tight junctions but, in contrast to full-length chicken occludin, exhibited a discontinuous junctional staining pattern and also disrupted the continuous junctional ring formed by endogenous occludin. This rearrangement of occludin was not paralleled by apparent changes in the junctional morphology as seen by thin section electron microscopy nor apparent discontinuities of the junctional strands observed by freeze-fracture. Nevertheless, expression of both wild-type and mutant occludin induced increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). In contrast to TER, particularly the expression of COOH-terminally truncated occludin led to a severalfold increase in paracellular flux of small molecular weight tracers.

ZO- 1 contains a conserved SH 3 -GUK module that is separated by a variable region (unique- 5), which in other MAGUKs has proven regulatory functions. To identify motifs in ZO- 1 critical for its putative scaffolding functions, we focused on the SH 3 -GUK module including unique- 5 (U 5) and unique- 6 (U 6), a motif immediately C-terminal of the GUK domain. In vitro binding studies reveal U 5 is sufficient for occludin binding; U 6 reduces the affinity of this binding. In cultured cells, U 5 is required for targeting ZO- 1 to tight junctions and removal of U 6 results in ectopically displaced junction strands containing the modified ZO- 1, occludin, and claudin on the lateral cell membrane.

40|$|During early development, tight {{junction}} biogenesis and the differentiation {{of the first}} epithelium in the blastocyst is critical for embryonic patterning and organization. Here, we discuss the programme of exactly timed transcription, translation, and post-translational modification of specific junctional proteins that regulates the stepwise membrane assembly of {{tight junction}}s during cleavage in the mouse model. Underlying mechanisms that coordinate these processes are discussed along with newly emerging data from other mammalian species. In the mouse embryo, junction assembly follows the establishment of cell polarity at the 8 -cell stage and is characterized by sequential membrane delivery of JAM- 1, ZO- 1 ?? and Rab 13, cingulin and ZO- 2 followed by ZO- 1 ?+ and occludin. Tight junction assembly occurs over three developmental stages; compaction, first differentiative division and cavitation. Post-translational modification of occludin, the late expression of ZO- 1 ?+ isoform and their intracellular colocalisation may all contribute to the rapid coordinated delivery of these two proteins to the membrane, resulting in the final sealing of the tight junction followed by blastocoel cavitation. This coordinated delivery of these two tight junction-associated proteins may therefore provide a rate limiting step for the <b>sealing</b> of tight <b>junctions</b> and regulated timing of blastocoel cavitation. Taken together, our studies in mouse, human and bovine embryos suggest that defects in the tightly controlled programming of early development may contribute to reduced embryo viability...|$|R

This junction {{is one of the}} most characteristic structural markers of the polarized epithelial cell. Recently, occludin has been identified as an integral transmembrane protein localizing at the tight junction and directly associated with ZO- 1, an undercoat-constitutive cytoplasmic protein. We have investigated occludin expression in conjunction with ZO- 1 in normal epithelia and cancers of human digestive tract by immunostaining with a new antibody raised against human occludin. In the normal simple columnar epithelium, occludin was expressed together with ZO- 1 as a single line at the apical cell border. However, in the esophagus, which has a stratified squamous epithelium, no occludin expression could be detected, but ZO- 1 was expressed in the spinous layer. As for cancers, both occludin and ZO- 1 showed the same expression in differentiated adenocarcinoma cells as in normal epithelium, but in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, the expression of these two proteins was reduced. There was significant correlation between tumor differentiation and expression of these proteins. These results suggest that occludin, together with ZO- 1, is involved in the formation of gland-like structures.

The subcellular localization of the SF/HGF receptor is controversial. In this work, the cell surface distribution of the SF/HGF receptor was studied in vivo in epithelial tissues and in vitro in polarized MDCK monolayers. A panel of monoclonal antibodies against the beta chain of the SF/HGF receptor stained the basolateral but not the apical surface of epithelia lining the lumen of human organs. Radiolabeled or fluorescent-tagged anti- receptor antibodies selectively bound the basolateral cell surface of MDCK cells, which form a polarized monolayer <b>sealed</b> by intercellular <b>junctions,</b> when grown on polycarbonate filters in a two-chamber culture system. The receptor was concentrated around the cell-cell contact zone, showing a distribution pattern overlapping {{with that of the}} cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The basolateral localization of the SF/HGF receptor was confirmed by immunoprecipitation after domain selective cell surface biotinylation. When cells were fully polarized the SF/HGF receptor became resistant to non-ionic detergents, indicating interaction with insoluble component(s). In pulse-chase labeling and surface biotinylation experiments, the newly synthesized receptor was found exclusively at the basolateral surface. We conclude that the SF/HGF receptor is selectively exposed at the basolateral plasma membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells and is targeted after synthesis to that surface by direct delivery from the trans-Golgi network...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tight <b>junctions</b> <b>seal</b> {{the space}} between {{adjacent}} epithelial cells. Mounting evidence suggests that tight junction proteins {{play a key role}} in the pathogenesis of human disease. Claudin is a member of the tight junction protein family, which has 24 members in humans. To regulate cellular function, claudins interact structurally and functionally with membrane and scaffolding proteins via their cytoplasmic domain. In particular, claudin- 2 is known to be a leaky protein that contributes to inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. However, the involvement of claudin- 2 in bacterial infection in the intestine remains unknown. Methods/Principal Findings: We hypothesized that Salmonella elevates the leaky protein claudin- 2 for its own benefit to facilitate bacterial invasion in the colon. Using a Salmonella-colitis mouse model and cultured colonic epithelial cells, we found that pathogenic Salmonella colonization significantly increases the levels of claudin- 2 protein and mRNA in the intestine, but not that of claudin- 3 or claudin- 7 in the colon, in a time-dependent manner. Immunostaining studies showed that the claudin- 2 expression along the crypt-villous axis postinfection. In vitro, Salmonella stimulated claudin- 2 expression in the human intestinal epithelial cell lines SKCO 15 and HT 29 C 19 A. Further analysis by siRNA knockdown revealed that claudin- 2 is associated with the Salmonella-induced elevation of cell permeability. Epithelial cells with claudin- 2 knockdown had significantly less internalized Salmonella than control cells with normal claudin- 2 expression. Inhibitor assay...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tumor microenvironments present {{significant}} {{barriers to}} penetration by antibodies and immunoconjugates. Tumor microenvironments, however, {{are difficult to}} study in vitro. Cells cultured as monolayers exhibit less resistance to therapy than those grown in vivo and an alternative research model more representative of the in vivo tumor is more desirable. SS 1 P is an immunotoxin composed of the Fv portion of a mesothelin-specific antibody fused to a bacterial toxin that is presently undergoing clinical trials in mesothelioma. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we examined how the tumor microenvironment affects the penetration and killing activity of SS 1 P in a new three-dimensional (3 D) spheroid model cultured in vitro using the human mesothelioma cell line (NCI-H 226) and two primary cell lines isolated from the ascites of malignant mesothelioma patients. Mesothelioma cells grown as monolayers or as spheroids expressed comparable levels of mesothelin; however, spheroids were at least 100 times less affected by SS 1 P. To understand this disparity in cytotoxicity, we made fluorescence-labeled SS 1 P molecules and used confocal microscopy to examine {{the time course of}} SS 1 P penetration within spheroids. The penetration was limited after 4 hours. Interestingly, we found {{a significant increase in the}} number of tight junctions in the core area of spheroids by electron microscopy. Expression of E-Cadherin, a protein involved in the assembly and <b>sealing</b> of tight <b>junctions</b> and highly expressed in malignant mesothelioma, was found significantly increased in spheroids as compared to monolayers...|$|R
40|$|Connexin 43 (Cx 43), {{the main}} protein constituting the gap {{junctions}} between astrocytes, {{has previously been}} demonstrated in endothelial cells of somatic vessels where the intercellular coupling that it provides {{plays a role in}} endothelial proliferation and migration. In this study, Cx 43 expression was analysed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells of the cortical plate of 18 -week foetal telencephalon, in adult cerebral cortex and glioma (astrocytomas). The study was carried out by immunocytochemistry utilizing a Cx 43 monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody anti-GLUT 1 (glucose transporter isoform 1) to identify the endothelial cells and to localize Cx 43. Endothelial Cx 43 is differently expressed in the cortical plate, cerebral cortex and astrocytoma. Within the cortical plate and tumour, Cx 43 is highly expressed in microvascular endothelial cells whereas it is virtually absent in the cerebral cortex microvessels. The high expression of the gap junction protein in developing brain, as well as in brain tumours, {{may be related to the}} growth status of the microvessels during brain and tumour angiogenesis. The lack of endothelial Cx 43 in the cerebral cortex is in agreement with the characteristics of the mature brain endothelial cells that are <b>sealed</b> by tight <b>junctions.</b> In conclusion, the results indicate that endothelial Cx 43 expression is developmentally regulated in the normal human brain and suggest that it is controlled by the microenvironment in both normal and tumour-related conditions...|$|R
