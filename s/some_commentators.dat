5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>commentators</b> see the {{conservative}} readings of Forrest Gump as indicants {{of the death}} of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience's historical (self-) consciousness.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>commentators</b> {{consider}} that the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq, due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003–2004. But this is not {{borne out by the}} minutes of OPEC meetings, as no US representative attended in an official capacity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>commentators</b> do {{not believe}} that the {{compliance}} pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour. Regulators all need to establish their positions in this situation, but it is clear that some regulators do still apply the compliance pyramid when the law is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The Hardy Boys {{have gone}} through many {{permutations}} over the years. Beginning in 1959, the books were extensively revised, and <b>some</b> <b>commentators</b> find that the Hardys' characters changed in the process.

5|$|ABA Games is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic {{games in the}} genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and are set in random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent games available, though <b>some</b> <b>commentators,</b> including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.|$|E

5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. <b>Some</b> <b>commentators</b> have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as <b>some</b> <b>commentators</b> prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his match in 1890–91 against Gunsberg, <b>some</b> <b>commentators</b> showed an {{understanding}} of and appreciation for Steinitz's theories. Shortly before the 1894 match with Emanuel Lasker, even the New York Times, which had earlier published attacks on his play and character, paid tribute to his playing record, the importance of his theories, and his sportsmanship in agreeing to the most difficult match of his career despite his previous intention of retiring.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. <b>Some</b> <b>commentators</b> considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|Having won 15 out {{of their}} 18 ODIs leading up {{the start of the}} tournament, the {{defending}} champions Australia were deemed one of the favourites to reach the semi-finals. They had previously won the 1987 and 1999 tournaments. In contrast, <b>some</b> <b>commentators</b> considered it doubtful whether India would qualify for the Super Sixes stage. They had won the competition once, in 1983, but had recently lost an ODI series against West Indies at home, and were defeated heavily in their tour of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 the {{receivers}} {{determined that the}} company was insolvent.
