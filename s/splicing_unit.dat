50|$|The {{majority}} of these twintrons have been characterized within the Euglena chloroplast genome but these elements have also been found in cryptomonad algae (Pyrenomonas salina), and group I intron based twintrons (group I inserted within a group I intron) have been described in Didymium iridis. Since {{the discovery of the}} psbF twintron, several categories of twintrons have been characterized. A twintron can be simple (external intron interrupted by 1 internal intron), or complex (external intron interrupted by multiple internal introns). Most probably, the internal and external introns comprising the twintron element are from the same category; group I internal to group I, group II internal to group II, and group III internal to group III. Mixed twintrons (consisting of introns belonging to different categories) were characterized from the Euglena gracilisrps3 gene in which an internal group II intron is found to interrupt an external group III intron. In Rhodomonas salina (=Pyrenomonas salina) twintrons (nested group II/group III introns) were identified where the internal intron lost its splicing capacity, essentially merging with the outer intron forming one <b>splicing</b> <b>unit.</b> Recently, two novel twintrons have been uncovered within the fungal mitochondrial genome, one at position mS917 of the Cryphonectria parasitica mt-rns gene, where a group ID intron encoding a LAGLIDADG ORF invaded another ORF-less group ID intron. Another twintron complex was detected at position mS1247 of the Chaetomium thermophilumhere mt-rns gene, a group IIA1 intron invaded the open reading frame embedded within a group IC2 intron. The mS1247 twintron represents the first recorded fungal mitochondrial mixed twintron consisting of group II intron as an internal intron and a group I intron as an external intron. In mS1247 twintron, splicing of the internal group IIA1 intron reconstitutes the open reading frame encoded within the group IC2 intron and thus facilitates the expression of the encoded homing endonuclease. The mS1247 twintron encod ORF have been biochemically characterized and the results showed that it is an active homing endonuclease that could potentially mobilize the twintron to rns genes that have not yet been invaded by this mobile composite element.|$|E

Although the mechanisms that govern alternative splicing are being unraveled, {{little is known about}} the evolution of this critical engine of proteome diversity. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis from a sea urchin to humans of the alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>unit</b> encoding the third Ig domain of fibroblast growth factor receptors.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{elements}} required to achieve endogenous levels of COL 1 A 1 expression is important {{to our understanding of}} gene regulation, in general, and for the development of gene therapeutic strategies applicable to the genetic disorder Osteogenesis Imperfecta, in particular. While the human COL 1 A 1 minigene is expressed at levels equivalent to the endogenous gene, little progress has been made towards understanding {{the elements}} required for this expression. ^ Our laboratory has been studying the regulation of the rat COL 1 A 1 gene utilizing two families of transgenes, designated ColCAT and pOBColCAT. We chose to re-derive ColCAT, which relies on the SV 40 t-Ag <b>splicing</b> <b>unit,</b> in a new generation of expression vectors, pOBCAT, to eliminate the problem of cryptic splice site selection. pOBColCAT includes the COL 1 A 1 first exon and most of the first intron and utilizes the COL 1 A 1 splice donor and the SV 40 16 S splice acceptor as the <b>splicing</b> <b>unit.</b> Stable transfection of pOBColCAT into the osteoblastic cell line Pyla results in a 50 - 100 fold increase in CAT activity as compared with ColCAT. This increase probably results from replacing the SV 40 t-Ag <b>splicing</b> <b>unit</b> with a more efficient unit. The potential for transcriptional enhancement from the COL 1 A 1 first intron was addressed by replacing this sequence with the entire SV 40 16 S <b>splicing</b> <b>unit.</b> This new construct was expressed at levels equivalent to pOBColCAT. ^ Despite high levels of activity, pOBColCAT is expressed at lower levels than the endogenous COL 1 A 1 gene suggesting it does not contain all of the essential regulatory elements. To identify addition elements required for high levels of expression, we chose to introduce two major regions of the human COL 1 A 1 minigene into pOBColCAT: the 3 ' End and the minigene Body. Both regions were assessed for transcriptional enhancing activity and for effects on mRNA stability. Analysis of the minigene Body revealed an orientation-independent five fold increase in CAT activity. In contrast the 3 ' End showed a modest 61...|$|E

The energy-absorbing cartridges generally consist {{of a number of}} foam sheets which compress and crush between the containment wall and impact wall to absorb energy from an errant vehicle striking the face of the impact wall, while the deflection and deformation of the impact wall tubes dissipates additional energy to reduce peak decelerations and mitigate the severity of high-energy vehicular impacts.

40|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the evolution of introns within eukaryotic genes. The introns early theory, or “exon theory of genes,” proposes that introns are ancient and that recombination within introns provided new exon structure, and thus new genes. The introns late theory, or “insertional theory of introns,” proposes that ancient genes existed as uninterrupted exons and that introns have been introduced {{during the course of}} evolution. There is still controversy as to how intron–exon structure evolved and whether the majority of introns are ancient or novel. Although there is extensive evidence in support of the introns early theory, phylogenetic comparisons of several genes indicate recent gain and loss of introns within these genes. However, no example has been shown of a protein coding gene, intronless in its ancestral form, which has acquired an intron in a derived form. The mammalian sex determining gene, SRY, is intronless in all mammals studied to date, as is the gene from which it recently evolved. However, we report here comparisons of genomic and cDNA sequences that now provide evidence of a de novo insertion of an intron into the SRY gene of dasyurid marsupials. This recently (approximately 45 million years ago) inserted sequence is not homologous with known transposable elements. Our data demonstrate that introns may be inserted as <b>spliced</b> <b>units</b> within a developmentally crucial gene without disrupting its function...|$|R
40|$|The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is {{alternatively}} spliced {{to produce}} the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS isoforms. By performing deletion mutagenesis on a human Bcl-x minigene, we have identified a novel exonic element that controls {{the use of the}} 5 ′ splice site of Bcl-xS. The proximal portion of this element acts as a repressor and is located downstream of an enhancer. Further mutational analysis provided a detailed topological map of the regulatory activities revealing a sharp transition between enhancer and repressor sequences. Portions of the enhancer can function when transplanted in another alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>unit.</b> Chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays indicate that the silencer element interacts with heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) K, consistent with the presence of putative high affinity sites for this protein. Finally, down-regulation of hnRNP K by RNA interference enhanced splicing to Bcl-xS, an effect seen only when the sequences bound by hnRNP K are present. Our results therefore document a clear role for hnRNP K in preventing the production of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS splice isoform...|$|E

We systematically examined, in the mouse reproductive tract tissues, the mRNA expression of five NCBTs {{as well as the}} five NBCe 1 (Slc 4 a 4) variants NBCe 1 -A through -E, of which NBCe 1 -D and NBCe 1 -E are novel. Cloning of NBCe 1 -D and NBCe 1 -E, both lacking a 27 -nucleotide cassette I, reveals a novel alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>unit</b> in the mouse Slc 4 a 4 gene. Transcripts of Slc 4 a 4 lacking cassette I are expressed in diverse murine tissues as shown by RT-PCR analysis and in diverse tissues of other vertebrate species as shown by blast against GenBank database. Genomic sequence analysis indicates that cassette I of SLC 4 A 4 is conserved in all NCBT genes except for SLC 4 A 5, which presumably lost cassette I during its evolution. Our present study represents an important step towards understanding the molecular physiology of NBCe 1, and presumably other NCBTs...|$|E
40|$|Exon 7 B in the hnRNP A 1 pre-mRNA is {{alternatively}} spliced {{to yield}} A 1 and A 1 (B), two proteins that {{differ in their}} ability to modulate 5 ' splice site selection. Sequencing the murine intron downstream of exon 7 B revealed the existence of several regions of similarity to the corresponding human intron. In vitro splicing assays indicate that an 84 -nt region (CE 6 IO) decreases splicing to the proximal 5 ' splice site in a pre-mRNA carrying the 5 ' splice sites of exon 7 and 7 B. In vivo, the CE 6 IO element promotes exon 7 B skipping in pre-mRNAs expressed from a mini-gene containing the hnRNP A 1 alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>unit.</b> Using oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H cleavage assays, we provide support for the existence of highly stable base pairing interactions between CE 6 IO and the 5 ' splice site region of exon 7 B. Duplex formation occurs in naked pre-mRNA, resists incubation in splicing extracts, and is associated with a reduction in the assembly of U 1 snRNP-dependent complexes to the 5 ' splice site of exon 7 B.

Quality control of spliced veneer in Czech wood based industries is mainly based on ČSN 49   2315 and ČSN 49   2320 standards, which rely on measurement of crack length in finished product. This method has been satisfactorily used since 1985 but requirements of wood based industry has changed a lot in these years. We propose an alternate method for mesurement of tensile strength of spliced veneers. Samples of specified size spliced were taken as mentioned in details and they were subjected to tensile stength measurement. An addtional adhesive tape was used to avoid intra-material fibres disjointing, so that inter-material tensile strength can be measured for spliced veneers.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} of exon 7 B in the hnRNP A 1 pre-mRNA produces mRNAs encoding two proteins: hnRNP A 1 and {{the less}} abundant A 1 B. We have reported the identification of several intron elements that contribute to exon 7 B skipping. In this study, we report the activity of a novel element, conserved element 9 (CE 9), located in the intron downstream of exon 7 B. We show that multiple copies of CE 9 inhibit exon 7 B-exon 8 splicing in vitro. When CE 9 is inserted between two competing 3 ′ splice sites, a single copy of CE 9 decreases splicing to the distal 3 ′ splice site. Our in vivo results also support the conclusion that CE 9 is a splicing modulator. First, inserting multiple copies of CE 9 into an A 1 minigene compromises the production of fully spliced products. Second, one copy of CE 9 stimulates {{the inclusion of a}} short internal exon in a derivative of the human β-globin gene. In this case, in vitro splicing assays suggest that CE 9 decreases splicing of intron 1, an event that improves splicing of intron 2 and decreases skipping of the short internal exon. The ability of CE 9 to act on heterologous substrates, combined with the results of a competition assay, suggest that the activity of CE 9 is mediated by a trans-acting factor. Our results indicate that CE 9 represses the use of the common 3 ′ splice site in the hnRNP A 1 alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cyclotides {{are a new}} {{emerging}} {{family of}} large cyclic polypeptides ({approx} 30 residues long) that share a disulfide-stabilized core (3 disulfide bonds) with an unusual knotted structure (Fig. 1 A) [1]. Cyclotides contrast with other circular polypeptides in {{that they have a}} highly defined three-dimensional structure, and despite their small size, can be considered as miniproteins. Their unique circular backbone topology and knotted arrangement of 3 disulfide bonds makes them exceptionally stable to thermal and enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, their well defined structures have been also associated with a range of biological activities, including uterotonic activity, inhibition of neurotension binding, hemolytic, anti-HIV, insecticidal as well as trypsin inhibitory activity. Altogether, these characteristics make cyclotides ideal candidates to be used as molecular scaffolds for the development of stable peptide drugs [2]. Access to biosynthetic cyclotides using recombinant DNA expression techniques would offer the exciting possibility of producing large combinatorial libraries of highly stable miniproteins using the tools of molecular biology. This would allow the generation of cell-based combinatorial libraries that could be screened inside living cells for their ability to regulate cellular processes. In the present work we describe {{for the first time the}} biosynthesis of the cyclotide Kalata B 1 in E. coli. Our approach is based on the use of an intramolecular version of the native chemical ligation combined with the use of a modified protein <b>splicing</b> <b>unit</b> [3]. In order to accomplish the cyclization of Kalata B 1, the different linear precursors tested in this work (Fig. 1 B) were fused at the N-terminus with a Met residue, and at the C-terminus with an VMA engineered intein (available in the pTXB expression vectors family from New England Biolabs). The Met residue was efficiently removed in vivo in E. coli by an endogenous Met amino peptidase. This in vivo proteolytic event unmasked the required N-terminal Cys. After affinity purification of the corresponding N-terminal Cys Kalata-Intein fusion protein, the cyclization was triggered by addition of 5 % EtSH (Fig. 1 C). Among the different linear precursors that were tested, KC 3 and KC 4 gave the best cyclization yields. The different linear precursors showed also different propensities for in vivo cleavage of the corresponding Kalata-Intein fusion constructs. Thus, meanwhile the KC 4 linear precursor gave only 30 % in vivo cleavage the KC 6 precursor was almost completely cleaved in vivo (> 90 %). The resulting reduced circular Kalata B 1 was oxidatively folded at pH 8. 0 in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) and {sup i}Pr-OH (Fig. 1 D). The folded recombinant Kalata B 1 was characterized by ES-MS, HPLC and 2 D-NMR, and it was shown to be identical to the natural product. Encouraged by this result we decided to explore the possibility of carrying out the cyclization and folding in a single-pot reaction. This was accomplished by treating the purified KC 4 -intein construct with different amounts and ratios of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG). The best cleavage/cyclization of the KC 4 -intein precursor was accomplished using 100 mM of GSH at pH 7. 2, under these conditions the cleavage of the linear KC 4 -intein precursor was almost quantitative in less than 18 h. Optimal conditions for the oxidative folding of reduced Kalata B 1 were obtained using a buffer containing a GSH:GSSG ratio of 4 : 1 at pH 8. 0 in 50 % isopropanol. Hence, the purified KC 4 -intein linear precursor was treated first with 100 mM GSH at pH 7. 2 overnight, then the crude reaction was complemented with isopropanol (50 %) and 12 mM GSSG. After 20 h the reaction was checked by HPLC showing that the major component was the folded Kalata B 1 (Fig. 1 E). The recombinant folded cyclotide was obtained with a yield close to 20 % (based on linear KC 4 -intein precursor). Using this approach we also produced a small library based on the Kalata B 1 scaffold (Fig. 1 F). In summary we report here the first biosynthesis of the cyclotide Kalata B 1 in E. coli. We have also shown that our biosynthetic approach can be used to generate cyclotide-based libraries that could be screened in vitro or in vivo. Future work will focus in the biosynthesis of cyclotide-based libraries in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Cell-cell {{adhesion}} is {{a fundamental}} requirement for all multicellular organisms. The calcium-independent cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF-CAMs) represent a major subgroup. They consist of immunoglobulin folds alone or {{in combination with other}} protein modules, often fibronectin type-III folds. More than 100 IgSF-CAMs have been identified in vertebrates and invertebrates. Most of the IgSF-CAMs are cell surface molecules that are membrane-anchored either by a single transmembrane segment or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Some of the IgSF-CAMs also occur in soluble form, e. g., in the cerebrospinal fluid or in the vitreous fluid of the eye, due to naturally occurring cleavage of the GPI anchor or the membrane-proximal peptide segment. Some IgSF-CAMs, such as NCAM, occur in various forms that are generated by alternative <b>splicing.</b> This <b>unit</b> contains a series of protocols that have been used to study the function of IgSF-CAMs in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that CD 44 isoforms, spliced with variant exons, are heterogeneously glycanated with chondroitin sulphate and heparan sulphate chains. Because such alternative splicing may regulate divergent biological effects of the specific isoforms, we analysed the consequences of this process on the composition and structure of the chondroitin-sulphate chains. Recombinant chimaeras were engineered with and without exons V 3 - 10 or V 3, 8 - 10 and expressed as Ig fusion proteins in COS cells. In addition, the chondroitin sulphates of wild-type isoforms were contrasted with those of isoforms mutated with serine-to-alanine codon substitutions at a putative Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly glycosaminoglycan acceptor site within exon V 3. The chondroitin sulphates contained both 4 - and 6 -sulphated galactosamine residues, although there was a high content of non-sulphated galactosamine-containing repeat <b>units.</b> <b>Splicing</b> of exons V 4 - 7, which contain no Ser-Gly consensus motifs, resulted in increased glycanation with chondroitin-sulphate chains, as well as increased sulphation levels of the polymers. Comparison of wild-type and acceptor-site mutant isoforms showed that chondroitin-sulphate content declined by more than 60 - 80 % in the mutant, indicating that assembly of chondroitin-sulphate chains occurs there, and a general decrease in the sulphation level of the remaining chains was observed. Undersulphation of the recombinant chondroitin sulphates was shown by parallel analyses with native human keratinocyte CD 44 molecules and is most probably an artifact of transient expression in COS cells. Our data indicate that combinatorial exon splicing exerts complex and distal effects on glycanation patterns and structure, which presumably modulate those functions that may be mediated though the chondroitin-sulphate moieties, such as motility and matrix invasion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alternative {{splicing}} is a ubiquitous gene {{regulatory mechanism}} that dramatically increases {{the complexity of}} the proteome. However, the mechanism for regulating alternative splicing is poorly understood, and study of coordinated splicing regulation has been limited to individual cases. To study genome-wide splicing regulation, we integrate many human RNA-seq datasets to identify splicing module, which we define as a set of cassette exons co-regulated by the same splicing factors. Results We have designed a tensor-based approach to identify co-splicing clusters that appear frequently across multiple conditions, thus very likely to represent splicing modules - a <b>unit</b> in the <b>splicing</b> regulatory network. In particular, we model each RNA-seq dataset as a co-splicing network, where the nodes represent exons and the edges are weighted by the correlations between exon inclusion rate profiles. We apply our tensor-based method to the 38 co-splicing networks derived from human RNA-seq datasets and indentify an atlas of frequent co-splicing clusters. We demonstrate that these identified clusters represent potential splicing modules by validating against four biological knowledge databases. The likelihood that a frequent co-splicing cluster is biologically meaningful increases with its recurrence across multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach. Conclusions Co-splicing clusters reveal novel functional groups which cannot be identified by co-expression clusters, particularly they can grant new insights into functions associated with post-transcriptional regulation, and the same exons can dynamically participate in different pathways depending on different conditions and different other exons that are co-spliced. We propose that by identifying <b>splicing</b> module, a <b>unit</b> in the <b>splicing</b> regulatory network can serve as an important step to decipher the splicing code. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein domains {{coordinate}} {{to perform}} multifaceted cellular functions, and domain combinations {{serve as the}} functional building blocks of the cell. The available methods to identify functional domain combinations are limited in their scope, e. g. to the identification of combinations falling within individual proteins or within specific regions in a translated genome. Further effort is needed to identify groups of domains that span across two or more proteins and are linked by a cooperative function. Such functional domain combinations can be useful for protein annotation. Results Using a new computational method, we have identified 114 groups of domains, referred to as domain assembly units (DASSEM units), in the proteome of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The units participate in many important cellular processes such as transcription regulation, translation initiation, and mRNA <b>splicing.</b> Within the <b>units</b> the domains were found to function in a cooperative manner; and each domain contributed to a different aspect of the unit's overall function. The member domains of DASSEM units {{were found to be}} significantly enriched among proteins contained in transcription modules, defined as genes sharing similar expression profiles and presumably similar functions. The observation further confirmed the functional coherence of DASSEM units. The functional linkages of units were found in both functionally characterized and uncharacterized proteins, which enabled the assessment of protein function based on domain composition. Conclusion A new computational method was developed to identify groups of domains that are linked by a common function in the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These groups can either lie within individual proteins or span across different proteins. We propose that the functional linkages among the domains within the DASSEM units {{can be used as a}} non-homology based tool to annotate uncharacterized proteins. </p...|$|R
