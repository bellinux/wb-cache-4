5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written {{as many times as}} necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. <b>Standard</b> <b>tables</b> of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|Equivalent {{narcotic}} depth (END) is {{a commonly}} used {{way of expressing}} the narcotic effect of different breathing gases. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Manual now states that oxygen and nitrogen should be considered equally narcotic. <b>Standard</b> <b>tables,</b> based on relative lipid solubilities, list conversion factors for narcotic effect of other gases. For example, hydrogen at a given pressure has a narcotic effect equivalent to nitrogen at 0.55 times that pressure, so in principle it should be usable at {{more than twice the}} depth. Argon, however, has 2.33 times the narcotic effect of nitrogen, and is a poor choice as a breathing gas for diving (it is used as a drysuit inflation gas, owing to its low thermal conductivity). Some gases have other dangerous effects when breathed at pressure; for example, high-pressure oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity. Although helium is the least intoxicating of the breathing gases, at greater depths it can cause high pressure nervous syndrome, a still mysterious but apparently unrelated phenomenon. Inert gas narcosis is only one factor influencing the choice of gas mixture; the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity, cost, and other factors are also important.|$|E

The {{structure}} of a <b>standard</b> integral <b>table</b> algebra can sometimes {{be determined by the}} multiplicities of the irreducible characters for that table algebra. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} a <b>standard</b> <b>table</b> algebra whose multiplicities are all equal (except for the trivial one) must be commutative. This dissertation seeks to extend the technique of using multiplicities to determine the {{structure of}} <b>standard</b> <b>table</b> algebras. For a commutative <b>standard</b> <b>table</b> algebra, we show that there exists exactly one character with nontrivial multiplicity if and only if the table basis is the wreath product of a two-dimensional subalgebra and an abelian group. Additionally, we show that a noncommutative <b>standard</b> integral <b>table</b> algebra with exactly one character (of degree two) that has nontrivial multiplicity must have one of two structures, both corresponding to a partial wreath product (B, D, C), where D has dimension 6 or 8, where C has dimension 2 or 3, and where the structure constants are explicitly determined by certain parameters that are bounded by a function of the nontrivial multiplicity.
