40|$|Motion {{in depth}} can be {{perceived}} from binocular cues alone, {{yet it is}} unclear whether these cues support <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{in the absence of the}} monocular cues that normally co-occur in natural viewing. We measure threshold contours in space-time for the discrimination of three-dimensional (3 D) motion to determine whether observers use speed to discriminate a test 3 D motion from two identical standards. We compare thresholds for random-dot stereograms (RDS) containing both binocular cues to 3 D motion-interocular velocity difference and changing disparity over time-with performance for dynamic random-dot stereograms (DRDS), which contain only the second cue. Threshold contours are tilted along the axis of constant velocity in space-time for RDS stimuli at slow speeds (0. 5 m/s), evidence for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> However, for higher speeds (1. 5 m/s) and DRDS stimuli, observers rely on the component cues of duration and disparity. In a second experiment, noise of constant velocity is added to the standards to degrade the reliability of these separate components. Again there is evidence for speed tuning for RDS, but not for DRDS. Considerable variation is observed in the ability of individual observers to use the different cues in both experiments, however, in general the results emphasize the importance of interocular velocity difference as a critical cue for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to motion in depth, and suggest that <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to stereomotion from binocular cues is restricted to relatively slow speeds. 16 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have made available reverse phase chromatographic media with a 1. 7 micron particle size {{along with a}} liquid handling system that can operate such columns at much higher pressures. This technology, termed ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), offers significant theoretical advantages in resolution, <b>speed,</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> for analytical determinations, particularly when coupled with mass spectrometers capable of high-speed acquisitions. This paper explores the differences in LC/MS performance by conducting a side-by-side comparison of UPLC for several methods previously optimized for HPLC-based separation and quantification of multiple analytes with maximum throughput. In general, UPLC produced significant improvements in method <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>speed,</b> and resolution. <b>Sensitivity</b> increases with UPLC, which {{were found to be}} analyte-dependent, were as large as 10 - fold and improvements in method speed were as large as 5 - fold under conditions of comparable peak separations. Improvements in chromatographic resolution with UPLC were apparent from generally narrower peak widths and from a separation of diastereomers not possible using HPLC. Overall, the improvements in LC/MS method <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>speed,</b> and resolution provided by UPLC show that further advances can be made in analytical methodology to add significant value to hypothesis-driven research...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Global motion {{processing}} is {{an essential}} part of visual perception involving higher cortical areas. The motion coherence threshold (MCT) is used to evaluate global motion processing. Previous studies have investigated the development of translational optic flow processing in children but no study has yet evaluated MCT for radial optic flow. Previous studies have proposed different channels for processing slow and fast motion. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and maturation of optic flow processing in children and to explore the effect of speed and different types of optic flow stimuli. Methods: A total of 125 children, aged from 6 to 16 years and 24 adults, with normal ocular health, participated. The children and adults were evaluated with optic flow patterns at a relatively fast (5. 48 °/s) and a relatively slow (1. 56 °/s) speed at a Michelson contrast level of 75 %. A pilot study involving four observers was carried out to establish the optimum values for speed and contrast to be used in the main study. A random dot kinematogram stimulus with 100 dots was used in this study. The Observer‟s task was to discriminate rightward and leftward translation, clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation and expanding and contracting radial optic flow patterns. Results: Children showed a reliable improvement in radial MCT with age, at both speeds. Surprisingly, the radial MCT of 16 -year-old children did not reach the adult level, although it was closer to the adult value at the higher speed than at the lower speed (p 0. 05). MCT was similar for a wide range of contrast levels and relatively high speeds in the pilot study. Conclusion: Sensitivity to radial optic flow develops with age. Younger children are poorer at detecting radial optic flow than older children and adults, with development continuing until late childhood. Sensitivity to translational MCT matures earlier. The development of radial MCT also differs with different stimulus <b>speeds.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> to all optic flow patterns is greater at higher <b>speeds.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> to the three optic flow patterns is similar at the higher speed but not at the lower <b>speed.</b> Differences in <b>sensitivity</b> to optic flow at lower and higher speeds, together with the varied development of radial optic flow at these speeds suggests that different motion perception channels are involved in processing slow and fast speeds...|$|R
