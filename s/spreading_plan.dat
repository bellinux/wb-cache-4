Des exigences particulières ont été définies concernant l'auto-surveillance des producteurs de boues de station d'épuration. Afin de renforcer la traçabilité des opérations une méthode a été mise au point par le Cemagref, utilisant à la fois le GPS et un système d'information géographique. Ce système {{permet de}} valider le registre des opérations et de gérer l'ensemble des données nécessaires au suivi. / Regulations concerning sludge spreading have been recently reinforced in France. Each water waste sludge producer has {{to build up}} a spreading schedule which determines the spreading locations in agriculture, according to soil characteristics and environmental hazards. This schedule is submitted for agreement to local authorities. Then, each year, a record of spread areas, sludge quantity, and sludge content analysis will be transmitted to the same authorities. In some cases, GIS is now used for the management of both <b>spreading</b> <b>plan</b> and yearly record. Using a G. I. S. makes easy to compare the effectively spread areas with the planned locations. By using a G. P. S. we are sure to obtain the real location of each spread area, and we may also directly get a standard file that can be easily transferred to G. I. S. This paper defines the necessary requirements concerning G. PS. performance. An 8 channel D. G. P. S. with a real time correction from geostationary satellite was selected. A program has been developed in order to create vectorial files from recorded G. P. S. positions. These files use French coordinates for cartographic positions (Lambert 2). A method for saving associated data was also developed in order to identify each vectorial file and increase information on the work done. Finally, we have defined an organisation that may transfer information between the different people involved in the system. The cost of this system has been compared to total cost of spreading operations and was found very low when shared between all the inhabitants of a city using a waste water plant...|$|E

In addition, the Alaska Simulator {{can be used for}} studying research questions in the context of software project management and other related fields. Thereby, the Alaska Simulator uses a journey as a metaphor for planning a software project. In the context of software project management the simulator can be used to compare traditional rather plan-driven project manage-ment methods with more agile approaches. Instead of pre-planning every-thing in advance agile approaches <b>spread</b> <b>planning</b> activities throughout the project and provide mechanisms for effectively dealing with uncer-tainty. The biggest challenge thereby is to find the right balance between pre-planning activities and keeping options open.

40|$|Government {{policy in}} many {{countries}} has been to promote manure management methods to reduce the negative impacts related to water and air pollution. The central strategy of encouraging manure as a fertiliser rather than treating it as a waste, is under threat from new concerns on public health and especially food quality. Restrictions on manure applications to certain food crops and the stipulation of treatment to 70 °C for 1 h (in the case of manure products) represent barriers {{to the use of}} such material as a useful organic product in the farming and horticultural industries. However, the sensible development of <b>spreading</b> <b>plans</b> in which high and low risk land is identified can enable appropriate and effective treatment for each situation and minimise overall cost. In the high risk situations, processes based on heat treatment remain the most reliable but there still remains the need to ensure a minimum temperature to ensure a satisfactory treatment.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} simulation modelling to help manage agricultural production systems. It describes {{the use of}} a Systems Dynamics complex model to simulating the functioning of pig slurry collective <b>spreading</b> <b>plans</b> in Brittany (Northwestern France), where intensive livestock farming has a well-known harmful environmental impact, namely on groundwater and coastal waters. The simulated plan involves 11 pig farms (encompassing both livestock and crops) located in a zone with excess slurry and 11 land owners located at about 40 km from the former. Individual pig farmers use part of their slurry to fertilise their own crops while they are regularly collected by collectively managed trucks to export their excess slurry to be applied on the remote crop farms. The model dynamically simulates the slurry stock evolutions at the pig farms and the spreading fluxes on crops, both at the pig farms and the remote crop farms. It simulates also several indicators likely to assess the environmental impact of this spreading organization's functioning: gas emissions (ammonia, methane) at slurry storage and application, time/distance spent in slurry transportation and application, excess Nitrogen with potential water pollution risk. It shows also the interaction between the individual farm and the collective organization levels...|$|R

40|$|The French {{legislation}} {{for the management}} of potentially polluted sites requires that " the state of the soils of the site under study" be compared to the state of neighbouring natural soils. That is why diverse institutions try to find local data relating to trace metal concentrations in the soil (often called 'background values'), to use as points of comparison and thereby estimate the contamination level of the studied soil. However, in industrial or urban context, {{it is very difficult to}} find "natural soils" located in the vicinity. More often than not, these assessments can at best be carried out with reference to soils considered to be relatively little-contaminated, namely the closest agricultural soils. In France, a large data collection was carried out on a national scale. These data were provided by analyses made in ploughed topsoils, undertaken mainly within the framework of sewage sludge <b>spreading</b> <b>plans.</b> The data collected on the area of the region Centre have been processed and stratified according to "agricultural districts", territories much less heterogeneous from geological and pedological standpoints than administrative subdivisions.

40|$|Well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas are {{characterized}} by a long natural history. The evolution of the reconstructive techniques and {{the improvement of the}} peri-operative anaestesiologist management of the patient have contributed, over the last few years, to a progressive widening of demolitive surgery. The aims of enlarged surgical treatment in differentiated advanced thyroid carcinomas are to guarantee respiratory and alimentary functions as well as symptomatic benefits, to obtain local control of the disease and the recovery of adjuvant therapeutic options, such as metabolic and conventional radiation. In the present study, 27 patients who underwent enlarged surgery for differentiated thyroid carcinoma involving the superior digestive-aerial ways (SDAW) were treated between January 1992 and December 2002. The following results were achieved: Group 1 (7 patients) : partial resection of the trachea and larynx: 57 % of patients are Not Evidence Disease (NED) at a mean follow-up of 7 years; the other 43 % are Alive With Disease (AWD). Group 2 (4 patients) : total laryngectomy associated with emi-pharyngectomy or oesophagectomy of whom 50 % are NED at a mean follow-up of 6 years. Group 3 (4 patients) : mediastinum dissection in sternotomy of whom 3 patients NED at 7, 8 and 12 years of follow-up, respectively (75 %). Group 4 (12 patients) : latero-cervical, retro-clavear and subclavear dissection, of whom 75 % of cases are NED at a mean follow-up of 5. 1 years. Enlarged surgery is justified by the long natural history of the differentiated histotypes and the advantages it offers to adjuvant therapies. An essential principle, in the case of enlarged thyroid resections, is the modularity. With respect to the loco-regional spread of the disease, the surgeon has to study a treatment plan with a surgical procedure that involves the various elective districts of <b>spreading,</b> <b>planning</b> each surgical step with the entity of demolition and reconstruction being modulated according to the demand...|$|R
