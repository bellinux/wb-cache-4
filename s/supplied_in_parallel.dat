Mainly they differ in how the automata are interconnected and in how the input is supplied. Here we are investigating arrays with a very simple interconnection pattern.

30|$|Substances, {{important}} to health: amino acids such as arginine, glutamine, histidine, taurine, various sulphur and related amino acids, polyamines, omega-fatty acids, numerous vitamins and antioxidants are all {{to a great}} extent supplied to the body from plants. One cannot expect any significant amount of antioxidants to be delivered to the lower level of the gastrointestinal tract, if not carried by plant fibres. It is {{important to}} remember that key nutrients such as omega- 3 fatty acids, glutamine, glutathione and several other nutrients are heat-sensitive and do not tolerate processing or storage to any larger extent. Plant fibres, which have been dried, heated up or micro-waved cannot be expected to contain any larger amounts of these, with this raw and unprocessed foods are needed. It is highly desirable that, whenever possible, the supply of commercial nutrition formulas are complemented by supply of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, as locally produced as ever possible. It is also desirable that several different fibres are <b>supplied</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel,</b> and that both soluble and non-soluble fibres are supplied. For example, oat fibres are mainly metabolized in the proximal colon, while wheat fibres are known to be effective in the distal part of the colon, e.g. the part of colon where most cancers are localized. Oat has mainly shown sepsis-reducing effects while wheat has mainly been effective in cancer prevention.|$|E

Methods In this study we first analyzed chorioallantoic placentation in the prea, Galea spixii, as one of the guinea pig's closest relatives. Material was collected from a breeding group at the University of Mossoró, Brazil, including 18 individuals covering an ontogenetic sequence from initial pregnancy to term. Placentas were investigated by means of histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry (vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin, cytokeration) and proliferation activity (PCNA). Results Placentation in Galea is primarily characterized by an apparent regionalization into labyrinth, trophospongium and subplacenta. It also has associated growing processes with clusters of proliferating trophoblast cells at the placental margin, internally directed projections and a second centre of proliferation in the labyrinth.

Presently, diagnosis of {{the early stages of}} Cu deficiency is unreliable as critical tissue Cu concentrations for tree growth have not been defined. Since wood quality is usually impaired in advance of tree growth, a biochemical test for Cu deficiency was sought for three Eucalyptus species commonly used in plantation forestry (E. globulus Labill., E. grandis Hill ex Maiden and E. urophylla Blake). Foliar Cu requirements for catechol oxidase activity were determined in a glasshouse sand culture study with 10 rates of Cu supply (0, 10 - 15, 10 - 14, 10 - 13, 10 - 12, 10 - 11, 10 - 10, 10 - 9, 10 - 7 and 10 - 5 M). In contrast to shoot dry weight, which only responded to Cu <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> E. urophylla, foliar Cu concentration and catechol oxidase activity, in 140 -day-old seedlings, increased with the addition of Cu in all species.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} two {{specific}} applications of fully-integrated switched-capacitor DC-DC converters, namely wide range operation and two-quadrant operation. For switched-capacitor DC-DC converters to operate efficiently {{over a wide}} input or output voltage range, multiple Voltage Conversion Ratios (VCRs) are required, to counteract the losses associated to its output impedance. To achieve wide range operation, this work proposes to use the Dickson topology as its foundation, transforming it into a wide range topology called the folding Dickson topology. Here, multiple VCRs are achieved through changing the phases of the switches. This operation lumps two or more flying capacitors into a single flying capacitor, which allows the emulation of new VCRs. Furthermore, a small modification to the output stage increases the amount of VCRs even more. These findings were validated through silicon measurements, and boasted an average efficiency of 71 % over an input voltage range from 2. 5 V up to 8 V, {{which is more than}} 4. 5 times the technologies supply voltage. The regularity of this topology allows it to be extended to achieve even higher voltage ranges, at a minimal design overhead. Two-quadrant DC-DC converters on the other hand might alleviate issues that are encountered with getting the ever increasing currents on-chip. <b>In</b> stead of <b>supplying</b> loads <b>in</b> <b>parallel,</b> they are put in stacked voltage domains.

These I/Os need to be placed close to digital circuits to minimize the latency. Simultaneous operation of this large array along with the operation of nearby digital circuits generates noise on the <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> the form of switching noise. The magnitude of this noise can be 100 s of mV. Noise on the chip is also generated by carrier injection into the substrate. We demonstrate the operation of a link with high immunity to supply and substrate noise. A total link power penalty of only 0. 12 dB/ 100 mV of receiver supply noise was observed.

40|$|Industry {{leaders in}} today's global market strive for {{continuous}} improvement {{in order to}} remain competitive. One method used by firms for cutting costs and improving efficiency is Design for Supply Chain (DFSC). The objective of this methodology is to design the <b>supply</b> chain <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> to designing or redesigning a new product. Risk is an inherent element of this DFSC process. Although supply chain risk models and new product development risk models are available, there are few models that consider the combined effect of risk to product development and the supply chain. A gap in the body of knowledge could be filled by a DFSC and risk model that looks at design, supply chain and risk concurrently. This research develops such a model and tests it on two data sets. The most critical risks to incorporate in the model were found through {{a review of the literature}} and a survey of industry experts. The model consists of two components. The first component is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model which makes the DFSC decisions while simultaneously considering time-to-market risk, supplier reliability risk and strategic exposure risk. The results from the MIP are then used in the second model component which is a discrete event simulation. The simulation tests the robustness of the MIP solution for supplier capacity risk and demand risk. When a decision maker is potentially facing either of these risks the simulation shows whether it is best to use an alternative solution or proceed with the MIP solution. The model provides analytical results to be used by decision makers, but also allows decision makers to use their own judgment to select the best option for overall profitability. It is shown that the DFSC model with risk is a powerful decision making tool...|$|R

A conservative estimate shows that demand for feedstock for biorefineries may reach 172 million dry tons over the next decade (2010) and more than 508 million dry tons in 2020 if biomass technology implementation achieves the stated goals. An orderly supply of this large amount of biomass to biorefineries requires new and robust equipment and well-established infrastructure.

The parallel programming more efficient {{by using the}} parallel addressing generator for parallel vector memory (PVM) proposed in this thesis. However, without hiding complexities by cache, the cost of programming is high. To minimize the programming cost, automatic parallel memory address generation is needed to hide the complexities of memory access. This thesis investigates methods for implementing conflict-free vector addressing algorithms on a <b>parallel</b> hardware structure. <b>In</b> particular, match vector addressing requirements extracted from the behaviour model to a prepared parallel memory addressing template, <b>in</b> order to <b>supply</b> data <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> from the main memory to the on-chip vector memory. According to the template and usage of the main and on-chip parallel vector memory, models for data pre-allocation and permutation in scratch pad memories of ASIP can be decided and configured. By exposing the parallel memory access of source code, the memory access flow graph (MFG) will be generated. Then MFG will be used combined with hardware information to match templates in the template library. When it is matched with one template, suited permutation equation will be gained, and the permutation table that include target addresses for data pre-allocation and permutation is created. Thus {{it is possible to}} automatically generate memory address for parallel memory accesses. A tool for achieving the goal mentioned above is created, Permutator, which is implemented in C++ combined with XML. Memory access coding template is selected, as a result that permutation formulas are specified. And then PVM address table could be generated to make the data pre-allocation, so that efficient parallel memory access is possible. The result shows that the memory access complexities is hiden by using Permutator, so that the programming cost is reduced. It works well in the context that each algorithm with its related hardware information is corresponding to a template case, so that extra memory cost is eliminated...|$|R

Traditionally, pallets have been disregarded and perceived {{as a source of}} cost with the single mean to transport products to customers. Lately, actors <b>in</b> <b>supply</b> chains have started to perceive pallets in a total cost approach and, hence, as significant for the overall result of the <b>supply</b> chain. <b>In</b> <b>parallel</b> with an increased attention of the pallets importance on the supply chain performance, a shift towards an increased utilization of pallet pooling systems has been indicated. This is related to the constant increase in raw material prices as well as costs associated with repair, maintenance and recovery of pallets. This study aims to answer two issues. The first issue relates to investigating the pallet logistics process at SCA’s paper mill in Lilla Edet, which includes the mapping of flows to the Danish and Norwegian markets as well as reviewing the design of the pallet warehouse. The second issue concerns evaluating the current inspection control process related to inbound deliveries of pallets. Established standards and routines will be reviewed in order to clarify whether these are complied with. A case study approach has been selected as a method in order to fulfil the aim of this thesis. Since a mixed methods approach is considered useful, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected. Interviews, observations and access to internal documents are the major sources of information. Further, the empirical findings were analysed based on the theoretical framework in order to provide solutions that addressed the stated issues. Improvement suggestions can be grouped in two major measures that should be considered. Firstly, three errors associated with defective pallets are correlated with the temperature. Consequently, during winter months’ pallets should be stored in the pallet warehouse in order to avoid rising defect levels. Secondly, a redesign of the current pallet warehouse should be performed since the current design is not optimal from wooden pallet’s perspective. Further, {{it should be noted that}} an increased information sharing between pallet suppliers and the SCA Edet mill is a huge facilitator for improving the studied issues...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method {{to improve the}} {{available}} battery capacity in electric vehicles by connecting lead-acid batteries with lithium-ion battery <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> to <b>supply</b> power. <b>In</b> addition, this method combines the discharge characteristics of batteries to improve their efficiency and lower their cost for electric vehicles. A lithium-ion battery set is used to connect with N sets of lead-acid batteries <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> The lead-acid battery supplies the initial power. When the lead-acid battery is discharged by the load current until its output voltage drops to the cut-off voltage, the power management unit controls the lead-acid battery and changes it to discharge continuously with a small current. This discharge {{can be achieved by}} connecting the lead-acid battery to a lithium-ion battery <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> to <b>supply</b> the load power or to discharge its current to another lead-acid or lithium-ion battery. Experimental results demonstrates that the available capacity can be improved by up to 30 % of the rated capacity of the lead-acid batteries...|$|R
40|$|Impression {{materials}} are largely used {{to record the}} geometry of hard and soft oral tissue. So the evaluation of their cytotoxicity is a necessary step for determining their biocompatibility. The present study was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Elite Implant (Zhermack, Badia Polesine, Rovigo, Italy), a new elastomeric sterile and radiopaque impression material in comparison with daily used impression materials such as polythethers and vinyl polysiloxanes (3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany). For that purpose, human gingival fibroblasts, cultured in vitro, were exposed directly or indirectly to a new sterile and radioopaque silicone, Elite Implant <b>supplied</b> <b>in</b> 3 different viscosities, heavy, medium and light. The cytotoxicity of one vinyl polysiloxane, Express PuttyFirmer Set, and of two polyethers, Impregum Penta and Permadyne Penta was evaluated <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> At 9, 24 and 48 hours, the cell monolayer, incubated with and without the impression materials, was trypsinized and cells were counted in a haemocytometer. <b>In</b> <b>parallel,</b> human gingival fibroblasts were exposed indirectly by means of fluid extracts of impression materials. The cellular viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Data were analyzed statistically using Student's test...|$|R
