5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played on {{different}} days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} be played on Saturday and <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} {{on behalf of the}} British record industry based on sales of singles in the UK. Since 1997, the chart has been compiled by The Official Charts Company and was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets until 2005, when digital downloads were included in the chart compilation. The UK Singles Chart originated in 1952, when New Musical Express (NME) published the first chart of singles sales. The positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals, from <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday, but pre-1987, the charts were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is {{compiled}} by the Official Charts Company (OCC) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry. In the 2000s the chart week ran from <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday, and the top 40 singles were revealed each Sunday on BBC Radio 1. Before the advent of music downloads, it was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets, but since 2005 permanent downloads have been included in the chart compilation.|$|E

5|$|The UK Singles Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most-downloaded singles in the United Kingdom. During the 2000s, the chart was {{compiled}} by The Official UK Charts Company (OCC) on behalf on the British music industry, and was {{based solely on}} non-subscription music downloads from selected online music stores. It was compiled using weekly sales from <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday, and was published each Wednesday afternoon, {{so as not to}} clash with the Sunday evening announcement of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} Giffnock was furthered in 1905 {{by the arrival}} of the first Glasgow Corporation Tramways tram in the town. The {{addition}} of this tram link and the nearby Whitecraigs railway station helped the popularity of Giffnock as a weekend destination and lead to the opening of Rouken Glen park in 1906 by Archibald Corbett (later Lord Rowallan), the M.P. for Tradeston. The Giffnock tramline was one of Glasgow Corporation Tramways's most profitable routes; up to 15,000 travelled to Giffnock on a <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> visit Rouken Glen.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} inaugural {{run of the}} RTLs {{took place}} on September 18–19, 1976. Regular service on the Empire Corridor began on September 20. Initially, the two trainsets were mostly confined to the New York–Albany shuttle, with a single round-trip each on Saturday and <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> Buffalo. The New York–Montreal Adirondack received Turboliners on March 1, 1977, replacing conventional equipment. By April 1977, Turboliners had displaced conventional equipment on most routes in upstate New York. Exceptions included some New York–Albany trains, {{as well as the}} long-distance Lake Shore Limited and Niagara Rainbow. In 1989, after 12 years of operation, the availability of the fleet was at 90%.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{the effect}} of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} covered and closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E
5|$|The UK Albums Chart is {{a weekly}} record chart based on album sales from <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday in the United Kingdom; during the 1990s, {{a total of}} 216 albums reached number one. Until 1 February 1994, the chart was {{compiled}} each week by Gallup– after this date, it was managed by Millward Brown, who expanded the number of sales figures sampled, and extended the use of electronic point of sale machines. From July 1998 onwards, compilation of the chart was overseen by the Chart Information Network, jointly operated by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the British Association of Record Dealers. Throughout the decade, the chart was based solely on physical album sales, and each week's number one was first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show.|$|E

5|$|The UK Albums Chart {{is based}} on <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday sales of both {{physical}} and digital albums. It is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) {{on behalf of the}} UK music industry, and each week's new number one is first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show. The album chart was first published by Record Mirror in 1956. The record at number one on 25 December that year was the original soundtrack to the 1956 film The King and I, making it the first ever UK Christmas number one album; The King and I soundtrack was also Christmas number one in 1957, the following year. In 1958, the original soundtrack to South Pacific became the second Christmas number one album. Staying {{at the top of the}} album chart for a total of 115 weeks, it was also number one in 1959 and 1960. Soundtracks to the movies The Sound of Music and Grease also became Christmas number ones.|$|E
5|$|The crew of Atlantis had six {{possible}} landing opportunities on Saturday. Managers {{evaluated the}} best three opportunities {{of the day}} to try bring the orbiter home. Saturday's first landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center was waived due to poor weather forecasts, and observed weather violations for the landing criteria. After further evaluating weather patterns around Florida, managers on the ground chose to waive the second opportunity as well, and wait one more day to attempt to get the orbiter into Florida on Sunday. Weather in California had excellent forecasts, so if the attempts on <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> land in Florida were not successful, the shuttle would be able to land at Edwards Air Force Base without weather being an issue.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1926–27, with other {{candidates}} unavailable, Gilligan was chosen to captain an MCC team which toured India; the side was not fully representative and did not play Test matches. In first-class games, he scored three fifties and, bowling infrequently, took ten wickets on the tour. The team, the first to tour India under the colours of the MCC, was very successful. Gilligan left most of the day-to-day organisation to his vice-captain, Raleigh Chichester-Constable, and did not take his speech-making duties particularly seriously. He nevertheless had several issues to deal with. One of his players, Jack Parsons, refused for religious reasons to play in any matches in which play took place on a Sunday; Gilligan threatened to send him home {{but in the end}} he agreed to play on condition that he could leave early on a <b>Sunday</b> <b>to</b> attend religious services. Parsons was also openly critical of racial and social discrimination that he saw. Gilligan intervened at one point when his team's professionals were excluded from some invitations in Calcutta and told their hosts that no-one would attend the functions if the professionals were not included. Both the sporting and social programmes for the tour were demanding, and Gilligan wanted to attend most functions for fear of offending the European or Indian hosts. The members of the team were left exhausted, necessitating the use of reinforcements to their number, including the occasional use of English cricketers who were coaching in India, and on several occasions, the Maharajah of Patiala, {{who was a member of}} the MCC and entitled to play.|$|E
