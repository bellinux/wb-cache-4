The objectives of the research are to identify the types, to describe the realizations, and to analyze the functions <b>of</b> <b>refusals.</b> 	The research applied descriptive-qualitative method. The data were {{in the form of}} utterances spoken by all characters in 12 Years a Slave, while the contexts of the data were the dialogues among the characters. The source of data was 12 Years a Slave movie. The data analysis was conducted by watching the movie; transferring the data into data sheet; identifying the data into the types, realizations, and functions of refusals; applying trustworthiness; and drawing conclusions. To enhance trustworthiness of the data, the data was triangulated by the researcher’s supervisors and fellow linguistic students. 	The results of the research are described as follows. First, there are three types <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> which are {{performed by the}} characters in 12 Years a Slave. The types <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> are direct type, indirect type, and adjuncts to refusals. Indirect type becomes the main type <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> which is performed by the characters. Second, each type <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> has particular realizations. Direct type is realized in the form <b>of</b> non-performative <b>statement.</b> Meanwhile, indirect type is in the form <b>of</b> the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> an alternative, avoidance, excuse/reason/explanation, the attempt to dissuade the interlocutor, and the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> a principle/philosophy. Then, adjuncts to refusals are realized in the form of gratitude/appreciation. Third, there are eight functions <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> found in 12 Years a Slave. The functions <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> include (1) showing a determination in refusing; (2) showing unwillingness to comply with the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; (3) negotiating the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; (4) avoiding a conflict or ending an argument with the refusee; (5) demanding understanding from the refusee; (6) mocking the refusee or the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; (7) implying the unfairness of the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; and (8) showing gratitude to the refusee...|$|R

This research applied descriptive-qualitative and quantitative approach. The data {{were taken from the}} utterances spoken by the family characters in the Orphan movie. The source of the data was the conversations of the characters. The data were collected from the English subtitle of the movie by re-reading the English subtitle, noting the data and categorizing the data into the features. The trustworthiness was achieved by using credibility, dependability and conformability. The result of this research can be concluded as follows. Firstly, there are two types <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> expression which occur in the movie, indirect refusal expression (avoidance, attempt to dissuade interlocutor, reason and explanation, <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> alternative, <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> principle, promise of future acceptance and acceptance that functions as refusal) and direct refusal expression (non-performative). Indirect refusal expression has the highest frequency in the occurrence in the family characters’ conversation especially avoidance strategy. It is used for avoiding a conflict from the interlocutor. Secondly, there are four strategies to employ refusal expression, namely, negative politeness (indicating reluctance, being indirectness, using question and using hedge), positive politeness (giving reason, seek agreement, promise, avoid disagreement and avoid reciprocity), bald on-record (on-record) and off record (giving hints). Negative politeness has the highest occurrence to employ refusal expression.

The research discussed about a sociopragmatics analysis <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> utterance in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and King Arthur movies. The purposes of this research are to describe the ways and to know politeness strategies <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> utterances use in the movies. 	This research is done through qualitative/descriptive research method. The data available for this research are collected through conducting library preliminary research, consulting references to supervisors, selecting references, note-taking from references, watching the movies then identifying the refusal utterances speakers use during the movies. 	The writer while writing this research paper used at least three techniques: editing the entire data gained to make sure if the presentation has been completed or not, clarifying the data to make it simpler towards preparation, and listing the refusal utterances to be identified and grouped {{in order to make}} it more practical to the final presentation. 	The result of the research reveals that there are in general two ways <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> utterances which are used during the movies, namely direct and indirect strategies.

It is also to describe the politeness strategy employed by the characters and to explain the factors of chossing certain strategy in expressing refusal. This research uses pragmatics approach. It is a descriptive qualitative research which applies purposive sampling technique in taking the data. The data of this research are taken from the dialogues in Royal Pains season 1 Episode 1 - 6 which contain refusal expression. They are classified by using Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz’s theory <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> expression. The research shows that there are three findings. First, there are three types <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> expression used by the characters to express refusal, namely direct refusal, indirect refusal, and adjunct to refusal. Direct <b>refusal</b> consisting <b>of</b> non performative <b>statement,</b> namely no and negative willingness/ability; indirect <b>refusal</b> consisting <b>of</b> excuse, reason, or explanation, <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> alternative, <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> principle, and <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> regret, and adjunct to <b>refusal</b> consisting <b>of</b> pause filler. The second finding reveals that there are four types of politeness strategy which are employed by the characters to express refusal. They are bald on-record (be direct), positive politeness (giving reason), negative politeness (questioning, being pessimistic, apologizing, being conventionally indirect and using hedge), and off record (giving hints and using contradiction). The last findings shows that the use of certain strategy is influenced by the factors of relative power, namely legitimate power and expert power, and social distance. The speaker who has legitimate power and expert power tends to express refusal directly. Moreover, the speaker who has close relationship to the hearer will also be influenced to employ direct refusal expression by operating bald on record strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the speech}} act <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> and formulaic {{language}} as focuses of analysis, this thesis aims to explore {{whether or not}} grammatical proficiency and development is distinct from pragmatic proficiency. The {{data were collected from}} 36 Thai EFL learners at three proficiency levels: low intermediate, intermediate and advanced, using four open role-plays. The role-plays were designed to incorporate different combinations of sociolinguistic variables of power and distance, as expounded in Brown and Levinson's politeness theory. The data were analyzed from two perspectives: pragmatic and lexicogrammatical. In the pragmatic analysis, the data were segmented in to refusal moves and interactional function categories. Drawing on politeness theories of face-saving, the analysis focused on a comparison of the learners' use <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> moves, the pragmatic orientation <b>of</b> their <b>refusal</b> moves in refusal episodes and face-saving manoeuvres. The lexico-grammatical features of the data were analyzed in terms of their formulaicity. Sixteen native speakers of English were asked to identify formulaic sequences in the role-play transcription. The formulaic sequences identified were tallied, analyzed in terms of proportion, frequency and variety, and compared across the three proficiency levels. The analyses show that 1) the pragmatic orientation <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> moves <b>of</b> the learners at the three proficiency levels was similar but 2) that the use <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> moves to mitigate the force <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> was slightly different across the levels; 3) the overall language produced by the advanced learners had the highest proportion of formulaic language, but 4) in the lexicalizations <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> the low-inter-mediate learners used more formulaic language than the other two groups. The results indicate that the pragmatic aspects <b>of</b> the learners' <b>refusals</b> seem to be independent of their proficiency level while the way they used formulaic language in the role-plays and in the lexicalizations <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> are related to proficiency level. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{situations in}} which refusal will occur and examined the refusal strategies and corresponding linguistic forms that can be employed to react to various refusal situations in Chinese culture. Since refusal is an act in response to other acts, acts that prompt refusals {{play an important role}} in the choices <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> strategies. Therefore, this paper categorizes situations <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> according to the initiating acts <b>of</b> <b>refusal.</b> Based on 160 video clips collected from five television series, this paper found that refusal is initiated by four types of acts: request, offer, invitation, and suggestion.

40|$|This study explores socio-pragmatic aspects <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> in Korean. Past {{researches}} {{asserted that}} 1) Korean speakers seldom use direct refusal formulas (e. g., Byon 2003; Lyuh 1994; Sohn 1986) and 2) Korean speakers frequently employ <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> regret/apology when refusing (e. g., Byon 2003; Kwon 2004; Lyuh 1994). Upon analysing 133 refusals drawn from Korean drama data, four generalisations are formulated, {{two of which}} are in direct conflict with the findings of past studies. The four generalisations have been further substantiated through survey process of 118 native Korean speakers in Seoul, Korea. Through the use of drama data and reinforcement via surveys, this study proposed that 1) direct refusals (e. g., direct no, negatives willingness/ability) are a common attribute <b>of</b> Korean <b>refusals</b> (showing 23. 8 % of total semantic formulas in the drama data), to a much greater extent than previously thought. 2) <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> regret/apology is not a common strategy employed by native Korean speakers (1. 9 % of total semantic formulas in the drama data) unless a large power and/or distance variable is involved. 3) Positive opinion/feeling (e. g., "I would love to but. [...] ") is also not frequently employed by native Korean speakers. 4) Frequent uses of criticism of the request/requester etc. (15. 3 %) identified in the data were mostly in argumentative contexts and through the results of the survey, we argue that some offrecord strategies are equally strong or stronger than bald-on-record strategies. This study introduces the use of drama as a valuable source of near-natural speech data. To date, the use of drama data in analysing speech acts have been very limited. By analysing drama data, new aspects <b>of</b> Korean <b>refusals</b> have been uncovered. In particular, this study has been found that many <b>of</b> the <b>refusals</b> involve more the augmentation of face threat than its minimisation, unless there is a large power difference and/or a distance to maintain. This is seemingly in contrast to what is assumed in the politeness theory formulated by Brown and Levinson (1987) ...|$|R

For this study, 60 Javanese college learners of EFL (30 male and 30 females) are asked to respond in English for ten various situations of invitations in which they carry out the speech act <b>of</b> <b>refusal.</b> 			 The data, collected from Discourse Completion Task (DCT), are analyzed in terms <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> types, semantic formulas, and the ways <b>of</b> the <b>refusal</b> types and semantic formulas performed by the respondents. The analyzed data basically uses the taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> by Beebe,et. al.

The result of investigation is 600 responses <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> to invitations. Then, the English performance of the male and female respondents is compared to know the differences and similarities in refusals to invitations. 						 The difference <b>of</b> performing the <b>refusal</b> utterances between the male and the females particularly happen in the frequency <b>of</b> using the <b>refusal</b> utterance not in the forms <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> utterance, and generally the difference is not significant. The slight difference also happens in the ways <b>of</b> using the <b>refusal</b> utterances to invitations. These facts affirm that language used by the males and the female are different. 						 The refusal utterances to invitations performed by the male and female respondents in the current study are also compared to the refusal utterances to invitations used by American native speakers in the previous studies of Wannaruk (2005) and Al Eryani (2007). From those comparisons between the respondents as non native speakers, and the Americans as native speakers can be revealed that the cultural issues or values underlie the differences, and it causes a pragmatic transfer.
