5|$|The Marshlink Action Group is a {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 {{in the interests of}} passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all connecting lines have been electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains are now at capacity but there is no additional stock because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E

25|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} are typically, but not always, {{less expensive}} than fixed-rate mortgages. Due to the inherent interest rate risk, long-term fixed rates will tend {{to be higher than}} short-term rates (which are the basis for variable-rate loans and mortgages). The difference in interest rates between <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> loans is known as the yield curve, which generally slopes upward (longer terms are more expensive).

25|$|In {{central nervous}} system structures, the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor is gaining interest as a novel representative of neuroendocrine integration, functioning as {{a major component of}} endocrine influence - specifically the stress response - upon the brain.

Indeed, long-standing observations such as the mood dysregulations typical of Cushing's disease demonstrate the role of corticosteroids in regulating psychologic state; recent advances have demonstrated interactions with norepinephrine and serotonin at the neural level.|$|E
25|$|In a state heavily {{reliant on}} {{continuous}} supply of gas for industrial processing, manufacturing, residential use and electricity generation, the sudden loss of almost 35% of gas supply had immediate social impacts, and significant <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> economic effects.

25|$|Adolescents who misuse alcohol {{can benefit}} from {{interventions}} aimed at risk reduction. For more severe cases an intervention involving parents, guardians, and/or a psychotherapist is recommended. An effective strategy of intervention for adolescents whose binge drinking leads to admission to hospital, e.g. for alcohol poisoning or injury, is manualised brief interventions at the hospital in one to four counseling sessions each lasting 30 to 60 minutes conducted by trained staff. Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing/educating the adolescent of possible negative <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> consequences of drinking is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those goals is also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents.|$|E
25|$|There is {{scientific}} concern that extended spaceflight might {{slow down the}} body's ability to protect itself against diseases. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and cause both <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> damage to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. In particular, it causes 'chromosomal aberrations' in lymphocytes. As these cells {{are central to the}} immune system, any damage weakens the immune system, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active. In space, T-cells (a form of lymphocyte) are less able to reproduce properly, and the T-cells that do reproduce are less able to fight off infection. Over time immunodeficiency results in the rapid spread of infection among crew members, especially in the confined areas of space flight systems.|$|E
25|$|Beyond addiction, both <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> {{nicotine}} exposure {{have not}} been established as dangerous to adults, except among certain vulnerable groups. At high-enough doses, nicotine is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. Nicotine {{as a tool for}} quitting smoking has a good safety history. There is inadequate research to show that nicotine itself is associated with cancer in humans. Nicotine in the form of nicotine replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine is linked to possible birth defects. During pregnancy, there are risks to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing e-liquid, has raised concerns over nicotine overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.|$|E

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that sole application of manure and biochar resulted in significant net CO 2 -C efflux from the soils leading to positive priming of SOC and higher {{proportions of the}} initial C lost through respiration. Co-application of biochar and manure decelerate the decomposition of native SOC, probably through adsorption of labile C and net N immobilization, resulting in significant decrease in net CO 2 -C efflux, and subsequently lead to a negative priming effect of 35 %. The potential of biochar to counteract positive priming of native SOC with negligible or no impact on mineral N availability in the <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>long-terms</b> in these soils require further investigation.|$|R
