25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from <b>swagging</b> buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} aisle wall are three {{monument}}s all of white marble on black marble back plates. One is to Mrs Penelope Cholmeley (died 1821 aged 75 years), {{the sister of}} Montague Chomeley. Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument back plate is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45° cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' <b>swagging</b> attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss {{each side of the}} urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a square-edged stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the <b>swagging</b> is a raised cross. The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808–1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided back plate with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest.|$|E

"He {{does his}} best," [...] says Mr. Franklin, looking innocently at the stout chief, the exemplar of English elegance, who sat <b>swagging</b> {{from one side}} to the other of the carriage, his face as scarlet as his coat--swearing at every other word; ignorant on every point off parade, except the merits of a bottle and the looks of a woman; not of high birth, yet absurdly proud of his no-ancestry; brave as a bulldog; savage, lustful, prodigal, generous; gentle in soft moods; easy of love and laughter; dull of wit; utterly unread; believing his country the first in the world, and he as good a gentleman as any in it. [...] "Yes, he is mighty well for a provincial, upon my word. He was beat at Fort What-d'ye-call-um last year, down by the Thingamy river. What's the name on't, Talmadge?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, {{the term}} <b>swag</b> is still widely {{used to refer}} to a tent or other {{portable}} shelter used for camping or outdoor sleeping. [...] A modern <b>swag</b> is a waterproof canvas sleeping compartment that is sometimes insect-proof. All <b>swags</b> come with a foam mattress, and can comfortably be slept in {{with the addition of a}} pillow and sleeping bag. When rolled up the <b>swag</b> is relatively lightweight and compact, making it ideal for storage and transport. It is typically easy to erect, and roll up can be done quickly. <b>Swags</b> are still heavily used in Australia, by overlanders. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design <b>swags.</b> The modern <b>swag</b> is designed for robustness and is marketed towards those travelling by vehicle [...] - [...] they are too heavy and bulky to be transported long distances on foot. Bushwalkers and hikers would use conventional lightweight tents and sleeping bags. More recently, several camping supply firms have produced readymade bedrolls along the pattern of the original <b>swag,</b> and refer to these as [...] "swags".|$|R

Instead of hunger and dysentery, we shall have sharp shot; and then!--Dumouriez, with force and firm front, looks on from a {{neighbouring}} height; can help only with his wishes, in silence. Lo, the eighteen pieces do bluster and bark, responsive to the bluster of La Lune; and thunder-clouds mount into the air; and echoes roar through all dells, far {{into the depths of}} Argonne Wood (deserted now); and limbs and lives of men fly dissipated, this way and that. Can Brunswick make an impression on them? The dull-bright Seigneurs stand biting their thumbs: these Sansculottes seem not to fly like poultry! Towards noontide a cannon-shot blows Kellermann's horse from under him; there bursts a powder-cart high into the air, with knell heard over all: some <b>swagging</b> and swaying observable;--Brunswick will try! [...] "Camarades," [...] cries Kellermann, [...] "Vive la Patria! Allons vaincre pour elle, Let us conquer." [...] "Live the Fatherland!" [...] rings responsive, to the welkin, like rolling-fire from side to side: our ranks are as firm as rocks; and Brunswick may recross the dell, ineffectual; regain his old position on La Lune; not unbattered by the way. And so, for the length of a September day,--with bluster and bark; with bellow far echoing! The cannonade lasts till sunset; and no impression made. Till an hour after sunset, the few remaining Clocks of the District striking Seven; at this late time of day Brunswick tries again. With not a whit better fortune! He is met by rock-ranks, by shouts of Vive la Patrie; and driven back, not unbattered. Whereupon he ceases; retires 'to the Tavern of La Lune;' and sets to raising a redoute lest he be attacked! ...|$|E
6000|$|Schwerin's Prussians, in that {{preliminary}} struggle {{through the}} mud-tanks (which Winterfeld, I think, {{had happened to}} skirt, and avoid), were hard bested. This, so far as I can learn, was {{the worst of the}} chaos, this preliminary part. Intolerable to human nature, this, or nearly so; even to human nature of the Platt-Teutsch type, improved by Prussian drill. Winterfeld's repulse we saw; Schwerin's own Regiment in it. Various repulses, I perceive, there were,--"fresh regiments from our Second Line" [...] storming in thereupon; till the poor repulsed people [...] "took breath," [...] repented, [...] "and themselves stormed in again," [...] say the Books. Fearful tugging, <b>swagging</b> and swaying is conceivable, in this Sterbohol problem! And after long scanning, I rather judge it was in the wake of that first repulse, and not of some other farther on, that the veteran Schwerin himself got his death. No one times it for us; but the fact is unforgettable; and in the dim whirl of sequences, dimly places itself there. Very certain it is, [...] "at sight of his own regiment in retreat," [...] Feldmarschall Schwerin seized the colors,--as did other Generals, who are not named, that day. Seizes the colors, fiery old man: [...] "HERAN, MEINE KINDER (This way, my sons)!" [...] and rides ahead, along the straight dam again; his [...] "sons" [...] all turning, and with hot repentance following. [...] "On, my children, HERAN!" [...] Five bits of grape-shot, deadly each of them, at once hit the old man; dead he sinks there on his flag; and will never fight more. [...] "HERAN!" [...] storm the others with hot tears; Adjutant von Platen takes the flag; Platen, too, is instantly shot; but another takes it. [...] "HERAN, On!" [...] in wild storm of rage and grief:--in a word, they manage to do the work at Sterbohol, they and the rest. First line, Second line, Infantry, Cavalry (and even the very Horses, I suppose), fighting inexpressibly; conquering one of the worst problems ever seen in War. For the Austrians too, especially their grenadiers there, stood to it toughly, and fought like men;--and [...] "every grenadier that survived of them," [...] as I read afterwards, [...] "got double pay for life." ...|$|E

50|$|Rigging- wire or rod {{used to hold}} up a mast. Since the 1960s {{stainless}} steel wire has become universal in the developed world. Elsewhere galvanized wire or even rope may be used because of its availability and cheapness.3 types of {{stainless steel}} wire are commonly used. Type 1 x 19 is a non-flexible wire used for standing rigging such as stays. Type 7 x 7 is a semi flexible wire used for luff wires in sails, halyards (sometimes plastic coated) trapeze wires and light halyards. Type 7 x 19 is used for all halyards, wire sheets, vangs and strops that must run through a pulley (sheave). The common way of attaching wire is to form a small loop at the end which is fixed in place by clamping a soft metal swage over the free ends. Talurite is a common brand of <b>swagging.</b> The wire loop is then fastened to a rigging screw with a bow shackle to the chain plate. Kevlar rope is sometimes used in place of wire in small sailboats.|$|E

5000|$|A jabot , {{also called}} cascade or tail, is a {{vertical}} pleated piece of window treatment used with festoons or <b>swags</b> {{along the top}} of a window on the inside of a building. The usual purpose of a jabot is to hide the seams between individual <b>swags,</b> though for treatments with only one <b>swag</b> their purpose is simply decorative (unlike most curtains, jabots do not serve to block the passage of light). [...] Visually, they represent a continuation of the <b>swag</b> over the ends of a pole, and are always made of the same decorator fabric on the facing side as the <b>swag</b> itself. Jabots are often lined, however with a different style or color of fabric which is then revealed along its bottom edge with each pleat.|$|R
