40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{significance}} of trade in financial services, and the emphasis placed on trade in financial services during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, this article is the first study of the determinants of intra-industry trade (IIT) in <b>insurance</b> <b>services.</b> The article analyzes and measures the magnitude of IIT in <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> for the United States. The empirical results of the determinants of IIT indicate that foreign direct investment in <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> (FDI) is a significant contributor to the volume of trade in <b>insurance</b> <b>services.</b> These empirical findings confirm the new theoretical trade models that, unlike the traditional trade theory that considered trade and foreign direct investment in <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> as substitutes, trade and FDI complement each other and hence multinational insurance companies are contributing {{to an increase in}} the volume of trade in <b>insurance</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, this study shows that trade intensity between the United States and its trading partners leads to product differentiation in <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> and hence an increase in consumer welfare.
