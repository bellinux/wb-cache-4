40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a physical model study of the Homme Dam <b>spillway</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection. The objectives of the study were to verify the adequacy of the proposed outlet-channel riprap protection, recommend and verify the adequacy of more economical riprap protection, and determine the spillway rating curve. The model study was conducted for the 8 t. Paul District of the Corps of Engineers (COE) at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, University of Minnesota. The study used a 1 -to- 25 -scale model of a center section of the <b>spillway</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel.</b> Two <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection designs were tested. The study showed that the proposed <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection (Design 1) withstood the probable maximum flood (PMF) without damage to the spillway structure and with only minor damage to the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection. A more economical design of the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection (Design 2) was proposed and tested; this design withstood the PMF without damage to the spillway and with only minor damage to the. <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection. The estimated cost savings of implementing Design 2, as compared to Design 1, is $ 206, 000. US Army Corps of Engineers; Barr Engineerin...|$|R
5000|$|In early 1981, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{excavated}} a <b>spillway</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> for the lake, stabilizing it at 2503 ft {{above sea}} level with a volume of [...] In May 1985 a tunnel was excavated to connect Spirit Lake to South Coldwater Creek, which had drained Spirit Lake prior to 1980. The eruption had blocked the outlet of Spirit Lake causing it to rise to dangerous levels. The tunnel allowed excess water from Spirit Lake to drain into Coldwater Lake, and from there into the Toutle River. The landslide dam forming Coldwater Lake was closely monitored until 1998, when its stability was no longer deemed a serious concern.|$|R
500|$|The first {{hydropower}} {{was delivered}} in 1925 with {{the completion of}} the Moccasin Powerhouse, fed by Hetch Hetchy water through the Canyon and Mountain Tunnels. However, the first water deliveries did not reach San Francisco until 1934, eleven years after the completion of O'Shaughnessy Dam and twenty years after groundbreaking of the Hetch Hetchy project. O'Shaughnessy Dam had been designed with adequate foundations and a unique stepped face in order to make possible a future increase in the dam height. This was done in anticipation of rapid growth in the demand for water and hydroelectricity. Indeed, between 1935 and 1938, the dam was raised by a new <b>spillway</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> were constructed to accommodate the increased height and storage capacity, which helped to increase summer generation at downstream powerhouses.|$|R
50|$|Lake Elsinore Valley, and the San Jacinto Basin that is its tributary, is a {{partially}} closed drainage basin, {{part of the}} Great Basin Divide. Its watershed is normally endorheic, but sometimes flows into the Santa Ana River watershed during periods of high water following heavy rainfall or snow melt. It discharges water through the Elsinore <b>Spillway</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>outlet</b> to Temescal Creek when the lake reaches the level of that outlet at 1,255 ft (383 m). Temescal Creek, flows through Warm Springs Valley and Walker Canyon into the Temescal Wash, which in turn flows through the northern Elsinore Trough to the Santa Ana River in such conditions. In recent years, efforts to maintain the lake at a stable high level have made these flows occur more frequently and for greater duration during the year.|$|R

40|$|Tarbela dam {{is one of}} {{the largest}} earth filled dam in the world used for power {{generation}} and irrigation purposes. Like all reservoirs the sediments inflow in the Tarbela reservoir has resulted in reduction in water storage capacity and is also causing damage to the tunnels, power generating units and ultimately to the plant equipment. This numerical study was performed to predict the flow patterns and characteristics in Tarbela dam. Tunnel 3 and 4 inlets; originally on the bed level were raised in the 3 -D model and meshed. Analysis was performed using multiphase flow (water and air) for maximum inflow in the reservoir, i. e., considering summer season and discharging water through different locations, i. e., tunnels and spillways. Pressure, velocities, flow rate and free surface height results obtained were found in good agreement with the analytical and existing results where available. Results show uneven discharge through each gate due to maximum velocity near exits and overall stagnant phenomena of water within the reservoir. Maximum velocity was observed along the <b>spillways</b> <b>outlet.</b> Strong vortex motion was observed near the <b>spillways</b> <b>outlet</b> and tunnel inlets. New design of Tunnel 3 and 4 were suggested to WAPDA in order to decrease the sediment inflow and improvements in design of the spillways were suggested...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to model if {{hydraulically}} suitable habitats for juvenile and spawning grayling could be created by morphological restoration alone in the Bjurfors Övre hydropower <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> in the Ume River Basin. The study was done by 2 D modelling with HEC-RAS using hourly water flow and level data collected during the period 20160521 - 20161029. Suitable water depth and velocity values for larvae and spawning grayling were collected from literature. Environmental measures for the Bjurfors Övre <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> were designed based on the morphology in <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> with documented reproducing grayling populations and large habitat diversities. The <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> at present morphology and after morphological modifications were modelled at different flow scenarios (0 - 369 m 3 /s) and areas of suitable water velocities and depths before and after proposed measures were compared. Results show that suitable velocity areas would increase with a factor of between 1, 03 - 1, 81 and the suitable depth areas with a factor of 2, 34 - 19, 09 and that suitable depths may be the major limiting factor in current conditions. Results also show that zero-flow events at Bjurfors Övre hydropower plant create unsuitable velocities for larvae and spawning grayling and that the frequency and duration of such events could be more limiting than the mere occurrence of such events. The study indicates that the morphological restoration in hydropeaking <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> could improve the availability of habitats with suitability water depth and velocity not only for larvae and spawning grayling, but for other lotic organisms. The study also showed that HEC-RAS modelling is a potential resource effective way to assess to what extent certain proposed environmental measures may create suitable water depths and velocities in hydropeaking <b>outlet</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After over 16 {{years of}} service at the inner walls of a steel {{absorber}} and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> in wet FGD system, the rubber lining was subjected to examinations. A series of impedance spectra for the pre-vulcanized soft rubber lining based on chlorobutyl rubber (CIIR) were recorded. Rubber lining samples taken from the absorber bottom, which had {{been in contact with}} the washer sump solution, exhibited properties similar to those of new rubber lining samples not exposed to the corrosive environment. Rubber lining samples taken from the absorber upper part and from the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> showed significant damage, and so deterioration in their protective properties, in comparison with the new lining. Also the results of tensile strength and hardness tests carried out on rubber samples taken from various parts of the absorber and the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> are presented...|$|R

30|$|Outburst floods {{triggered}} by wave overtopping. When snow/ice/rock avalanches enter a glacial lake, {{the water level}} rises and the lake surface generates displacement waves; the superimposed surges submerge the moraine dam crest, extrude the unstable dam body, and the overflowing water initiates the breach of the moraine dam without incision of the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel.</b> Rainstorms and glacier meltwater can also cause the water level to rise and the flow rate to increase (Kershaw et al. 2005). When {{the strength of the}} water that escapes from the lake and the incision of the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> exceed a certain threshold, glacial lake outburst occurs.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of ponds on dissolved oxygen in small rivers of Berry (France). Water temperature and oxygen saturation {{are two major}} indicators of water quality in surface hydrology. Geographical and cartographic studies about ponds of Central France did no exist until now. During two years, we measured dissolved oxygen using a hand oximeter upstream and downstream of three ponds in {{the headwaters of the}} Loire basin. Our results show that oxygen saturation depends on equipments located before and behind the dam, and upstream and downstream: <b>spillways,</b> <b>outlets</b> with a monk, diversion channel, artificial reoxygenation weirs and so on. In some cases (low water quality upstream, existence of weir), relative and absolute saturation of dissolved oxygen increases downstream of ponds...|$|R

50|$|A set of {{outlet works}} is a device used to release and {{regulate}} water flow from a dam. Such devices usually consist {{of one or}} more pipes or tunnels through the embankment of the dam, directing water usually under high pressure to the river downstream. These structures are usually used when river flow exceeds the capacity of the power plant or diversion capacity of the dam, but do not have flows high enough to warrant the use of the dam spillways. They may also be utilized when river flows must be bypassed due to maintenance work in the power station or diversion gates. Although similar in purpose to <b>spillways,</b> <b>outlet</b> works provide a more controlled release to meet downstream flow requirements.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{quantify}} both experimentally and theoretically the scaling behavior between interface displacement {{and excess}} {{pressure drop in}} a microfluidic comparator.

For an <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> width to depth ratio r= 3, the authors experimentally determine the scaling exponent to be 0. 60 ± 0. 01, which is in excellent agreement with theory. In general, the authors find the scaling exponent to increase from 0. 51 for square channels (r= 1) to 0. 93 for very wide channels (r> 100).
