The Unit will link ILCA's forage {{agronomy}} section (genetic resources FLAG and networks) and national seed production programmes across sub-Saharan Africa. The Unit will help bridge the gap between demand and supply by undertaking the initial seed multiplication of promising forage accessions (pasture grasses, legumes and browse) which countries can then bulk up for distribution to farmers. African nationals involved in such activities will receive training. Through ILCA's inforrnation and documentation services, the <b>Seed</b> <b>Unit</b> will keep workers abreast of the latest developments in seed technology. It will also provide a forum for workshops and coordination for regional activities in applied seed research, production, storage and supply.

This follows a $ 3. 2 million grant from the Swiss Development Cooperation Agency. The new forage <b>seed</b> <b>unit</b> will have laboratory, warehouse and seed processing facilities and will be linked to ILCA's genebank. The unit will also be linked to national seed production programmes across sub-Saharan Africa, which will be provided with a guaranteed supply of seed. Another important role for the unit will be to undertake the initial seed multiplication for promising forage accessions. By doing this ILCA hopes {{to bridge the gap between}} supply and demand when farmers are in the early stages of adopting new germplasm lines. The new facilities will also be used to assist with the introduction and propagation of forage seed from other international agricultural research centres. Forage seed supplies are seen as vitally important to livestock development and ILCA believe the new unit will help to overcome the current problem where seed supplies cannot keep pace with demand.

40|$|Wildfires play a {{significant}} role in many different elements of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. In recent years, prescribed fires have started being used more often as a fuel reduction tool, and also as silvicultural treatment to help the regeneration and health improvement of stands. Apart from the fact that fire may alter microsite conditions, very little is known about the impact of prescribed burning on natural regeneration or plant species renewal in Mediterranean pine forests. Likewise, knowledge about the influence of seedling predators on post-fire regeneration is still scarce. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of seedling predation on recruitment in earlier stages after prescribed burnings in three pine stands in Central Spain: a pure stand of Pinus nigra; a mixed stand of Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster and a mixed stand P. nigra with P. pinaster. In situ we superficially sowed seeds from two different species. In the sowing experiment, we tested two different seed provenances (drier and more humid spanish regions) for each species. In all, 60 plots (30 burned, 30 unburned) per site, with 10 <b>seeding</b> <b>units</b> per plot and more than 20, 000 seeds, were used in the whole study. Seedling predation was evaluated by replicating the <b>seeding</b> <b>units</b> inside and outside a wire cage as protection for rodents and birds. Our results showed that prescribed fires alter initial seedling predation intensity: predation was significantly higher in the seedlings grown in the plots affected by prescribed fire. The individuals sown before the fire passed showed slightly more predation than those sown after fire passage. Provenances did not appear as an important predation drive.

40|$|Polylaminin (polyLM) is a non-covalent acid-induced nano- and micro-structured polymer of {{the protein}} laminin {{displaying}} distinguished biological properties. Polylaminin stimulates neuritogenesis beyond the levels achieved by ordinary laminin {{and has been}} shown to promote axonal regeneration in animal models of spinal cord injury. Here we used confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize its three-dimensional structure. Renderization of confocal optical slices of immunostained polyLM revealed the aspect of a loose flocculated meshwork, which was homogeneously stained by the antibody. On the other hand, an ordinary matrix obtained upon adsorption of laminin in neutral pH (LM) was constituted of bulky protein aggregates whose interior was not accessible to the same anti-laminin antibody. SEM and AFM analyses revealed that the <b>seed</b> <b>unit</b> of polyLM was a flat polygon formed in solution whereas the seed structure of LM was highly heterogeneous, intercalating rod-like, spherical and thin spread lamellar deposits. As polyLM was visualized at progressively increasing magnifications, we observed that the morphology of the polymer was alike independently of the magnification used for the observation. A search for the Hausdorff dimension in images of the two matrices showed that polyLM, but not LM, presented fractal dimensions of 1. 55, 1. 62 and 1. 70 after 1, 8 and 12 hours of adsorption, respectively.

The factors were three planting dates (4 th of November, 4 th of December 2013 and 3 th of January 2014) and four planting densities (8, 12, 16 and 18 plant/m 2). The results showed that planting dates significantly affected on phenology, yield and its components, seed filling rate and periods while the effect of plant density on seed filling period was not significant. Comparison of sigmoid equation coefficients showed that seed filling rates in three planting dates were different. The highest seed filling rate was obtained in 3 th of January and the lowest at November 4, planting dates. The effect of planting date on seed filling duration was also significant, {{but it was not}} on plant density.

Presentation and interpretation of simulation results can be significantly enhanced through the linking of models with software that allows spatial visualization. Many users of crop simulation models, however, are located in institutions in developing countries where resources are particularly limited. Computer software to perform a variety of spatial analyses was written, which can be run on modest hardware without the need for costly third-party software. The software is an integral part of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), a comprehensive crop simulation model and data system, but can also be run in a stand-alone mode. Users can run spatial simulation experiments and then analyze the results using (i) a geostatistical module to interpolate maps and produce probability surfaces from a network of data points and (ii) a utility that calculates agronomic and economic output statistics from model simulations and maps the results as polygons. The suite of modules, which runs on an IBM-compatible personal computer, interfaces with some widely used third-party GIS software, and the mapping facility enables users to export and import images to a number of common file formats.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} effect of the 10 -year long civil war in Sierra Leone on rice genetic resources, using farmers and their seed systems in three selected districts as reference points. The war disrupted all forms of production and development in the country and like other sectors of the economy, agricultural production and the conservation of plant genetic resources at the farm level was severely affected. It emerged that farmers’ effectiveness to cultivate and manage their seed systems and the options to grow rice under insecure conditions were disrupted at different levels in the three districts studied. However, the general consequence of the war in all of the districts was that farmers lost considerable amounts of their seed stocks. Total losses for some rice varieties was averted because of the occurrence of a number of varieties in more than one village in the same region, which was a result of farmers seed exchange systems, and also due to farmer movement during the war. The majority of the varieties that were reported lost were actually “dispersed” in the regions, indicating good options for post-war recovery. There was little evidence that the genetic composition of rice varieties were significantly altered {{as a consequence of the}} war, except for the total loss of upland varieties in one of the districts. The varieties that had the highest survival were those that had wider pre-war distribution, showed plasticity in growing habits wherein they demonstrated the potential to grow in both agro-ecosystems and in the different districts, and the fact that they existed in many different forms. Statistical analysis showed a clear distinction between upland and lowland varieties, which demonstrated the effectiveness of farmer selection with regard to the two production ecosystems. This was different for the periods defined as pre-war and post-war. Pre-war varieties were less well defined in this respect. Further to this, there was evidence of a change in rice genetic resources between the pre-war and post-war situations, which was demonstrated in the number of varieties for each of the two ecosystems. Despite these changes, and the losses in seed stocks as a consequence of the war, genetic diversity increased in post-war rice varieties. AFLP results indicated that rice varieties in Sierra Leone possess different levels of intra-variety variation, which makes it difficult to identify homogenous genotypes at the <b>seed</b> <b>unit</b> level. This was attributed to genetic exchanges caused by farmers’ practices of growing different varieties in mixtures. The variation however does not alter the profile of inter-variety genetic differences, which remains large enough to distinguish one variety from the other. It demonstrates that the genetic composition of rice varieties remains distinct from one another, and that variety names in Sierra Leone are good indicators for genetic diversity of rice at the farm level...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} <b>seed</b> metering <b>unit</b> {{was designed}} and mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as seed metering shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and seed metering shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of seed metering shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated <b>seed</b> metering <b>unit</b> (FSMU).

40|$|The Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC), {{created in}} 1971 and based in Taiwan, was {{originally}} {{the brainchild of}} the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). From the beginning, the fundamental goal of AVRDC has been to increase the production and quality of vegetables through improved varieties, increased disease and pest resistance/tolerance, increased heat tolerance and better cultural practices. Research concentrated initially on six vegetables: tomato, soy bean, mungbean, sweet potato, white potato and Chinese cabbage. Sweet potato and white potato were later dropped from the research programme and replaced {{over a period of}} time by three other major crops: pepper, alliums (onion, shallot, garlic) and eggplant. Genetic resources AVRDC collects and stores as many cultivars of its mandated crops as possible. Its Genetic Resources and <b>Seed</b> <b>Unit</b> (GRSU), constructed in 1984, is a large cold-storage facility capable of keeping some varieties of seed viable for as long as a century. By September 1995, GRSU had a total of 37, 938 accessions of its principal crops and 5, 404 accessions of non-prinicipal but regionally important crops. The unit holds the world's base collection of mungbean and pepper. The material provides a broad genetic base for vegetable breeding and safety backups against the risk of a limited and highly uniform gene pool. Requests for seed samples of material in the collections as well as information about breeding lines are regularly received. Ongoing research aims to establish sets of core collections and to generate information that will lead to better management of vegetable genetic resources. This includes the use of statistical, cytological, biochemical, and molecular tools in the analysis of genetic diversity and genetic changes at different phases of germplasm maintenance. The germplasm is made available to researchers. One of AVRDC's major achievements is the development of tomato varieties that yield well under hot, humid conditions. A rich source of vitamin C, tomato is a popular cash crop for small farmers and home gardeners throughout much of the world. The principal problems with tomato in the hot, humid tropics are poor fruit set and disease. The challenge for AVRDC's tomato breeders was to combine heat tolerance and disease resistance with desirable culture and eating characteristics. Today the GRSU's active collection of cultivated tomato and wild relatives is one of the largest in the world. Application of biotechnology Molecular techniques are used to understand the biology of the principal vegetables at the molecular level, in order to genetically engineer varieties that might otherwise take years to complete using conventional plant breeding methods. Biotechnology has assisted AVRDC plant breeders to produce mungbean varieties which are highly resistant to bruchids, a major pest of stored beans throughout the world. Current activities include tissue culture and transformation, pest and stress control, quality improvement and genetic mapping. Biotechnological research is one of the primary areas in which AVRDC collaborates with universities worldwide. Spreading the word To bring AVRDC closer to its partners and respond more effectively to differences in needs and capabilities among regions, the Center has established regional networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Southern Africa. In 1992 AVRDC signed an agreement with the Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research (SACCAR). to be the executing agency for the Collaborative Network for Vegetable Research and Development in Southern Africa (CONVERDS). There are ten participating countries in the region: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The network is based at Horti, Tengeru near Arusha, Tanzama. Through its International Cooperation Programme, AVRDC assists in strengthening and enhancing national vegetable research and development capacity through information and communication services, collaborative research, technology transfer and institution building. AVRDC has recognized the very important role it can play in the development of human resources for vegetable research and extension, both through its training programmes and through the development of training materials. The Center's aim is to create a critical mass of well-trained and motivated researchers within the national agricultural programmes of developing countries themselves. Good information exchange is also vital to the development of national capacity. The Center operates a Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) service for national programmes. It produces and publishes commodity-specific quarterly updates which, abstracted from the latest worldwide horticultural information sources on these commodities, are available at no charge from AVRDC. Copies of selected articles from the SDI listings can be obtained on request. In addition a Tropical Vegetable Information Service (TVIS) project has established a computer retrieval system using the software MINISIS. The AVRDC library is a major repository of information on vegetable improvement and the Center is a leading publisher and distributor of vegetable research information. Publications from the Office of Publications and Communications (OPC) are distributed to more than 600 libraries and to individuals in 160 countries.

40|$|The use of {{coated seed}} to {{establish}} crops {{is not a}} novel practice. Seed coatings have been used on small seeded crops to improve the handling ability by making the <b>seed</b> <b>unit</b> larger and heavier. Producers can therefore calibrate their sowing equipment more efficiently and wind will not cause as much drift at sowing. Seed coating can have an added benefit for leguminous crops if the symbiotic inoculant (Rhizobium) {{is added to the}} coating. This saves the producer time and allows peace of mind that inoculation was done by trained professionals. Other than the inoculation, there are some other constituents in the seed coating that can have benefits to the plant. It can, however, be theorized that added nutrients or pesticides will be beneficial to the plants only if these nutrients are deficient in the growth medium or when pests are present. This study evaluated the effect of seed coating on the life stages of germination, emergence and survival, seedling growth and ultimate yield of mature lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) plants, comparing the results with non-coated seed. Two cultivars were used in the evaluation, SA Standard and SuperCuf, to determine if the effects would be similar, or would genetic differences between the cultivar play a significant role. These life stages (germination, emergence and seedling growth) were chosen due to the importance of these stages to the success of establishment. Fast and uniform germination will result in a uniform stand with strong competition against weed infestation. The effect of growth medium on the emergence of seedlings and the interaction between the seed coating and the growth medium was important to determine to identify limitations in the use of seed coating. Changes in the growth of seedlings in terms of some physio-morphological characteristics will assist in identifying parameters influenced by the coating. It was, however, essential to not only do these trials under ideal agricultural conditions, but to identify if similar results would be obtained from stressed conditions, such as salinity, which is a growing concern for crop production areas. The question of whether seed coating will influence the ultimate production of the crop could then be answered. It was found that the method in which germination is tested can have a significant outcome for the results obtained. When the Jacobsen apparatus was compared with the use of petri dishes, using specification according to ISTA, {{it was found that the}} water movement in the Jacobsen apparatus overcomes concentrated nutrient conditions, especially for SuperCuf. Under saline conditions the coated SA Standard seed had higher germination than the non-coated seed, therefore overcoming inhibitions imposed by the salinity. It is clear that the coating influences germination of lucerne and the interaction with the seed environment is significant. It is also clear that the genetic differences between cultivars are significant and results should not be applied across all lucerne cultivars. When the emergence percentage had been determined in different growth media, namely a commercial growth media, a sandy loam soil and silica medium, it was found that the emergence was influenced by the media. Even though the emergence of seedlings are mostly determined by the nutrients in the cotyledons, some growing conditions did cause lower emergence for non-coated SA Standard seeds and was overcome by the use of coated seed. When the growing conditions were manipulated with saline irrigation it was found that coated SuperCuf had a higher emergence % than the non-coated treatments when irrigated with the 750 μS. cm- 1 water. From the data collected from this trial, it can be concluded that, even though the use of seed coating does not always influence the emergence of lucerne seedlings, seed coating does have an influence on the emergence, but it is dependent on the growth medium quality in terms of nutrient composition and salinity. Similar to the germination trial, the genetic influence of the different cultivars was noticeable. To determine the differences caused by seed coating to the physio-morphological characteristics (stem height, leaf area etc.) of lucerne, a pot trial was conducted using different irrigation treatments, municipal water (180 μS. cm- 1), 500 and 750 μS. cm- 1 water, created with NaCl. It was found that the physio-morphological characteristics were highly correlated, i. e. the stem height, leaf area, number of leaves and dry matter production changed in relation to each other. There were, however, differences in this correlation coated and non-coated seed treatments, when irrigated with 500 μS. cm- 1 water. For the seedlings grown from coated seed, the correlation between shoot dry matter yield and the other parameters were low, while the seedlings growth from non-coated seed, leaf area was not correlated with the other parameters. It was concluded that the tolerance mechanism for salinity for plants irrigated with 500 μS. cm- 1 water, caused more differences than the other water treatments. Taking into consideration that coating influences the germination and emergence of lucerne and that the two cultivars react differently to the seed coating, the yields obtained from field trials could then be interpreted if differences were observed. Three field trials were established, namely a trial established in autumn (established in 2009) and second trial established in spring (established in 2010) which were sown at 25 kg. ha- 1, while a third trial established spring (established in 2010) was sown at 5 different sowing densities, namely 80 %, 90 %, 100 %, 110 % and 120 % of recommended sowing density (25 kg. ha- 1). It was found that the pasture stands established with SA Standard, did not show many differences between the coated and non-coated seed treatments and were mostly restricted to the second growing season, where the non-coated seed treatments had significantly higher dry matter yield than the coated seed treatments. Stands established with SuperCuf, displayed more variation between the seed treatments and the non-coated seed treatments had higher yields in the first season. It was, however, found that the stands established with coated SuperCuf seed had lower stem: leaf ratio’s, indicating that a better quality fodder can be produced from coated seed. The data from the sowing density trial showed very little difference between the yields of the stands established with coated and non-coated SA Standard seed. Differences were, however, observed between seed treatments at 90 % and 120 % of the recommended sowing density, where the stands established with non-coated seed had higher yields than the stands established with coated seed. It can be concluded that under these trial conditions, the use of coated seed had very little influence on the yield of the lucerne stands. The observed differences suggest that the lucerne growth under these few conditions, the stands established from non-coated seed had better yield, but the stands established from coated seed had better quality. It is, however, more likely that there will be no differences between the seed treatments. Data from the sowing density trial also led to the conclusion that stands established at 20 % less seed will not result in lower yields if the stand establishment is successful. The similarity between the seed treatments and the sowing densities suggests that the number of plants per area were the same, caused by seedling mortality during the high growth rate in the early growing stage, or the morphological characteristics, such as number of stems per plant and number of leaves per stem, adapted to result in similar yields and quality.

40|$|Pulse {{crops in}} Bangladesh are mainly low-input rainfed crops with {{broadcast}} sowing. Since the 1990 s, rotary tillage two-wheel tractors (2 WT) have largely replaced animal draft for crop establishment. However, rotary tillage causes excessive evaporation from seedbeds in rapidly-drying soils. Therefore 2 WT-based minimum tillage (MT) options were explored to optimize seedbed moisture for lentil and chickpea establishment. Two types of 2 WT-mounted <b>seeding</b> <b>units</b> were manufactured, a strip tiller retaining rotary blades only {{in front of}} the tynes and a tyne seeder in which the rotary tiller shaft is removed. In some soil types, seedling emergence and grain yields of lentil and chickpea with these seeders matched those with broadcasting. In wet soils, the minimal soil disturbance with MT resulted in anaerobic conditions around seedling roots thereby limiting root growth and nodulation. In clay soils with rapid surface drying traction was inadequate for tyne tillage and strip tillage could not adequately penetrate rice paddy hardpans to allow adequate growth of seedling roots. Potential solutions to these limitations are under test so that 2 WT-based MT can be adapted for more timely and economic sowing of crops, including pulses, in smallholder plots and to achieve the agronomic benefits of line sowing over broadcast sowing...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Sugarcane, a plant which {{sugar is}} {{extracted}} from, is planted in vast areas with {{hot and humid}} climate. Brazil is the largest producer of sugarcane in the world. The next five major producers, in decreasing order, are India, China, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico. Sugarcane is a tropical, perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems, typically three to four meters high and about 5 cm in diameter. The total area under sugarcane plantation in Iran (Khozestan Province) is about 80, 000 hectares with an average yield of 100 tons per hectare. To increase the yield per unit of land and reduce production costs and move toward sustainable agriculture, mechanization of agricultural operations seems inevitable. Planters {{are the most important}} of farm machinery among the mechanization equipment. Sugarcane cultivation is done both by hand and machine. Hand planting operations is laborious and painstaking work and work efficiency is so low and culture costs are so high. In Iran farms, the sugarcane plantation process is carried out manually by the farmers. Considering the climatic conditions, the agricultural soil composition and constitution, and the different plantation pattern used in Iran, the imported planting machines are not suitable for the farming conditions in the country. Moreover, the domestically produced machines, which are mostly based on the imported versions, do not provide adequate performance. Therefore, fabrication of a machine, capable of continuously lifting the sugarcane scions from a container and sending them to a dropper pipe, uniformly and in conformance with the climatic conditions of the sugarcane farms in the country, is of great importance. Materials and Methods In this research, initially, a field study was carried out to identify the problems and shortcomings of imported and copied planting machines in sugarcane farms, such as jamming of the scions conveying mechanism and the existence of unplanted sections in the farm. Subsequently, a new compound <b>seeding</b> <b>unit</b> with unique capabilities for solving the above mentioned problems was fabricated, with the aim of application in sugarcane planting machines. The various components of the system include: 1 - Tank split in two pieces and connected to each other by two hinges through the middle and it can adjust to different angles. 2 - Tube fall for cuttings scions. 3 - Two rows of chain on a conveyor screwed on belt. 4 - Number of 9 cups (channels) to receive and transmit cutting scions from the tank and guided them to the falls duct. 5 - 18 pcs of metal preservative, the chain screwed to conveyor. 6 - Four Number of gears on two shafts in order to drive the conveyor chain. 7 - Two shafts, one on top and one another {{on the bottom of the}} anchor-conveyors chain. 8 - The mechanism of driven Endless belt as a mobile bed to showing the steady rate of falling the scions from the fallen channel. 9 - Two variable speeds electromotor to provide the movement of complex distributer and planter’s mobile bed belt. 10 - Controlling mechanism of falling number of scion. After preparing and manufacturing the different machine’s pieces, they were installed on the chassis and then different units were prepared and the machine are run. Results and Discussion Therefore, fabrication of a mechanism, capable of continuously lifting the sugarcane scions from a container and sending them to a dropper pipe, uniformly and in conformance with the conditions of the sugarcane farms is of great importance. In the new mechanism, as opposed to the existing <b>seeding</b> <b>units</b> in which the seeding operation is performed lengthwise, planting of the scions is performed in a widthwise pattern. Using the manufactured machine had a great effect on method of tillage and planting. The farm field was changed to a smooth surface in tillage then in planting the scions with installing the two diagonal plate the soil putted on scions and the made furrows for irrigating. Conclusions This mechanism reduces the number of planted scions per hectare, results in a more uniform planting and growth of the scions, and reduces the number of machine trips in the farm, increasing the planter productivity. The <b>seeding</b> <b>unit</b> was fabricated and is presently ready for use in the sugarcane planters...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Rapid tiller {{and root}} {{production}} can improve seedling survival and benefit stand establishment of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in commercial seed fields. Environmental conditions after establishment and inherent morphological factors combine {{to reduce the}} commercially harvested yield below the theoretical potential yield. These studies were conducted {{to determine if the}} growth retardant paclobutrazol and KCl could favor maximum seed yields of the cultivar Ovation under field conditions. In addition, effects of paclobutrazol and P on seedling development were examined in a growth chamber. Paclobutrazol increased seed yields in both first- and second-year stands in each of three climatically different years. Yield increases were primarily due to increased numbers of spikes per unit area during the wet year of 1984 and to increaseed numbers of seeds per spike in the dry years of 1985 and 1986. <b>Seeds</b> per <b>unit</b> area and harvest indices increased and thousand seed weights (TSW) decreased in all three years. KC 1 applications were intended to offset the anticipated paclobutrazol-induced TSW reductions. Positive fertilizer effects were due to Cl rather than K. Chloride fertilizer salts tended to increase seed yields, <b>seeds</b> per <b>unit</b> area, and TSW in 1984 and significantly increased yields, <b>seeds</b> per <b>unit</b> area and TSW in 1985. Severe drought masked possible Cl effects in 1986. The effects of Cl were thought to be due to its influence on N form taken up by the plant. Paclobutrazol reduced shoot and root weights but did not affect the shoot:root ratios of 90 -day old growth chamber grown seedlings. Plant growth in height was reduced within two days of application, which suggested the dependence of seedlings on continual gibberellin production. Phosphorus increased the shoot weights of 90 -day old seedlings, but did not affect root weights. Significant interactions were observed on the numbers of leaves and tillers per plant within 9 and 16 days of treatment applications, respectively. Paclobutrazol increased numbers of leaves and tillers per plant, but only at the high P rate. The reduced root growth caused by paclobutrazol and the immobile nature of P in the soil may account for the interaction effects...|$|R
