5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle <b>ships</b> were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged <b>ships,</b> suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make <b>ships</b> hard to see. Suggestively, of the <b>ships</b> that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle <b>ships</b> sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle <b>ships</b> were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the <b>ships</b> painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged <b>ships,</b> 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged <b>ships,</b> making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ships</b> were {{sometimes}} camouflaged in classical times. Mediterranean pirate <b>ships</b> {{were sometimes}} painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout <b>ships</b> were painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. <b>Ships</b> were sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their <b>ships,</b> whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ships</b> were {{incorporated}} into the 1939 Plan Z for the re-equipment and expansion of the Kriegsmarine; while an aircraft carrier, H-class battleships and smaller <b>ships</b> engaged convoy escorts, one or more O-class <b>ships</b> would attack the merchant <b>ships.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{the fleet}} sent by Darius {{consisted}} of 600 triremes. There {{is no indication}} in the historical sources of how many transport <b>ships</b> accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport <b>ships</b> accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC. Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of <b>ships</b> as reasonable; {{it has been suggested}} either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport <b>ships,</b> or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.|$|E
5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian <b>ships</b> was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own <b>ships.</b> On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek <b>ships</b> pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the <b>ships</b> at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker <b>ships</b> of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two <b>ships</b> available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their <b>ships</b> out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by <b>ships</b> deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Rodney was escorting a {{fleet of}} supply <b>ships</b> to relieve the Spanish siege of Gibraltar with {{a fleet of}} about twenty <b>ships</b> of the line when he {{encountered}} Lángara's squadron south of Cape St. Vincent. When Lángara saw {{the size of the}} British fleet, he attempted to make for the safety of Cádiz, but the copper-sheathed British <b>ships</b> chased his fleet down. In a running battle that lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four Spanish <b>ships,</b> including Lángara's flagship. Two other <b>ships</b> were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some Spanish sources indicate they were retaken by their Spanish crews, while Rodney's report indicates the <b>ships</b> were grounded and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His <b>ships</b> spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian <b>ships</b> were spotted the next morning and the Japanese <b>ships</b> opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian <b>ships</b> could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his <b>ships</b> as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E
5|$|After Germany's {{defeat and}} {{the signing of}} the Armistice in November 1918, Grosser Kurfürst and most of the capital <b>ships</b> of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The <b>ships</b> were {{disarmed}} and limited to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the <b>ships.</b> Unlike her sister <b>ships,</b> Grosser Kurfürst was raised in 1938 for scrapping and subsequently broken up in Rosyth.|$|E

40|$|Understanding <b>Shipping</b> Management {{requires}} {{a thorough understanding}} of the <b>Shipping</b> Industry Structure. This book provides this knowledge base and should be seen in conjunction with two other books: <b>Shipping</b> and Design Innovation in <b>Shipping.</b> <b>Shipping</b> Industry Structure was intended as the first part of a book on <b>shipping</b> management; the second part should discuss the different management domains in <b>shipping,</b> such as strategy, finance, investment and risk, marketing, operations, organisation and information.

5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital <b>ships</b> of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The <b>ships</b> were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the <b>ships.</b> Unlike most of the other scuttled <b>ships,</b> Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still on the bottom of the harbour.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} for increasing the size and number of their capital <b>ships.</b> Wilson's plan for a world-leading set of capital <b>ships</b> led to a Japanese counter-programme, and a plan by the British to build sufficient <b>ships</b> to maintain a navy superior to either. American isolationist feeling and the economic concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval Treaty (also known as the Five-Power treaty), and limitations on the use of submarines. The Treaty prescribed a ratio of 5:5:3:1:1 for capital <b>ships</b> between treaty nations. The treaty recognized the U.S. Navy as being equal to the Royal Navy with 525,000 tons of capital <b>ships</b> and 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and the Japanese as the third power. Many older <b>ships</b> were scrapped by the five nations to meet the treaty limitations, and new building of capital <b>ships</b> limited.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} fleet, the Wittelsbach class <b>ships</b> were {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron, where they replaced the older Brandenburg-class <b>ships.</b> Like the Kaiser Friedrich III-class <b>ships,</b> the Wittelsbachs were withdrawn from active service after the advent of the dreadnoughts. The five <b>ships</b> were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They {{were assigned to}} the IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. However, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service by 1916. They were used as training <b>ships,</b> with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot <b>ships</b> for minesweepers. By 1922, all of the <b>ships</b> had been broken up for scrap, with the exception of Zähringen. She was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1926–27. RAF bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E

50|$|Some {{companies}} in the U.S. mainland still treat Guam as a foreign country and refuse to sell and <b>ship</b> items to Guam.

5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the <b>ships</b> as soon as the <b>ships</b> reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the <b>ships</b> never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the <b>ships</b> would then find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|After the {{deployment}} in the North pacific, the battle group was {{deployed in the}} South China Sea. As part of India's Look East policy, the <b>ships</b> visited the Shanghai port on 13 June 2012, for a five-day goodwill tour. INS Shakti served as the fuel and logistics tanker to the three destroyers. The <b>ships</b> left the port on 17 June 2012. Before leaving the port, the <b>ships</b> conducted routine passage exercise with the People's Liberation Army Navy.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 <b>ships</b> and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 <b>ships</b> in commission, 6,000 men, and the <b>ships</b> and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was unprepared to fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E

The four Nassau-class <b>ships</b> took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916; they suffered only a handful of secondary battery hits and limited casualties. In early 1918 Rheinland and Westfalen were sent to Finland to support the White Finns in their civil war, but Rheinland ran aground off the Åland Islands in April and was severely damaged.
