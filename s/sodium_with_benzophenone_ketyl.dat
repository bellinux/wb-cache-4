This low energy emission band was identified as the fluorescence of the <b>ketyl</b> radical of <b>benzophenone,</b> which is formed {{as the result of a}} hydrogen atom abstraction reaction of the triplet excited benzophenone from the alkyl groups of the surface of the reversed silicas. Such emission does not exist for benzophenone adsorbed onto 60 A pore silica. Room temperature phosphorescence was obtained in argon purged samples for all the surfaces under use. The decay times of the benzophenone emission vary greatly with the alkylation of the silica surface when compared with "normal" silica surface. A lifetime distributions analysis has shown that the shortest lifetimes for the benzophenone emission exist in the former case.

40|$|PART I: A general {{method for}} the {{measurement}} of absolute rate constants for the termination of photochemically produced organic free radicals in solution has been developed. Radicals are generated in the cavity of an EPR spectrometer by high intensity UT irradiation of a suitable sample; an EPR spectrum is obtained from the steady-state concentration of intermediate radicals. The (second-order) decay of the EPR signal with time is followed after irradiation is abruptly stopped by mechanical means. Many such decay curves are averaged by computer. From the averaged decay curve plus a measurement of the steady-state radical concentration (by electronic double integration), absolute rate constants for radical termination are obtained. Rate constants as fast as diffusion-controlled may be determined by this technique. PART II: Using the flash photolysis technique, the self-termination rate constants of <b>benzophenone</b> <b>ketyl,</b> 4, 4 '-dichlorobenzophenone ketyl, and 4, 4 '-dimethoxybenzophenone ketyl radicals were measured {{in a series of}} eight alkanes. These rate constants were all at least about 0. 5 times, but clearly less than, the corresponding theoretical diffusion-controlled rate constants. Rate variations with solvent were satisfactorily accounted for by the theory of the effect of diffusion coefficient on an observed bimolecular rate constant. There was no significant rate variation with ketyl radical. Thus, the widely different self-termination rate constants of the above ketyl radicals that have been measured in other solvents are due to substituent-dependent solvent effects. In benzene, these substituent effects may be due to charge-transfer complexing between radical and solvent...|$|R

Relative to reduction with Na metal, the following enthalpies of reduction (kcal mol(- 1)) are reported: benzophenone = - 38. 5, Cr(CO) (2) (PEt(3)) C 5 H 5 = - 54. 3, Cr(CO) (2) (PPh(3)) C 5 H 5 = - 59. 8, 1 / 2 [Mo(CO) (3) C(5) Me(5) ](2) = - 59. 9, 1 / 2 [W(CO) (3) C 5 H 5](2) = - 61. 7, 1 / 2 [Mo(CO) (3) C 5 H 5](2) = - 63. 5, Cr(CO) (2) (P(OMe) (3)) C 5 H 5 = - 64. 4, 1 / 2 [C 5 H 5 (Co) (3) Mo-Cr(CO) (3) C 5 H 5] = - 66. 1, 1 / 2 [Cr(CO) (3) C 5 H 5](2) = - 68. 2, Cr(CO) (3) C(5) Me(5) = - 72. 3, Cr(CO) (3) C 5 H 5 = - 75. 6, 1 / 2 Co(2) (CO) (8) = - 77. 9. The {{value for the}} enthalpy of reduction of benzophenone is 14. 5 kcal mol(- 1) more exothermic than recent literature data. The enthalpies of electron transfer and proton transfer between NaCr(CO) (2) C 5 H 5 and other chromium radicals and hydrides have been measured and span about 20 kcal mol(- 1). These measurements are used in thermochemical cycles to calculate enthalpies of H atom transfer. The role of substituents in determining enthalpies {{of reaction}} relevant to electrochemical and pK(a) measurement enthalpies of reaction is discussed. The heat of hydrogenation of Mn- 2 (CO) (10) has been determined using calorimetrically determined enthalpies of H atom transfer. The heat of hydrogenation, + 4 kcal mol(- 1) in THF, allows estimation of the Mn-H bond strength = 68 kcal mol(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports the}} use of benzophenone, a very well {{characterized}} probe, to study new hosts (i. e., modified celluloses grafted with alkyl chains bearing 12 carbon atoms) by surface esterification. Laser-induced room temperature luminescence of air-equilibrated or argon-purged solid powdered samples of benzophenone adsorbed onto the two modified celluloses, which will be named C 12 - 1500 and C 12 - 1700, revealed {{the existence of a}} vibrationally structured phosphorescence emission of benzophenone in the case where ethanol was used for sample preparation, while a nonstructured emission of benzophenone exists when water was used instead of ethanol. The decay times of the benzophenone emission vary greatly with the solvent used for sample preparation and do not change with the alkylation degree in the range of 1500 – 1700 micromoles of alkyl chains per gram of cellulose. When water was used as a solvent for sample preparation, the shortest lifetime for the benzophenone emission was observed; this result is similar to the case of benzophenone adsorbed onto the “normal” microcrystalline cellulose surface, with this latter case previously reported by Vieira Ferreira et al. in 1995. This is due to the more efficient hydrogen abstraction reaction from the glycoside rings of cellulose when compared with hydrogen abstraction from the alkyl chains of the modified celluloses. Triplet-triplet transient absorption of benzophenone was obtained in both cases and is the predominant absorption immediately after laser pulse, while <b>benzophenone</b> <b>ketyl</b> radical formation occurs in a microsecond time scale both for normal and modified celluloses...|$|R
