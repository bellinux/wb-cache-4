5000|$|As the United States {{has made}} its {{cultural}} presence in the Dominican Republic, Dominicans have fostered cultural resistance towards the hegemonic process. For Third World cultures, an antidote for this oppression is nationalism, which promotes culture and curbs overvaluation of the foreign nation that is influencing the <b>subordinate</b> <b>culture.</b> For the Dominicans, baseball plays this crucial role of resistance. This nationalism is indoctrinated in the print media of the country. Sports pages take {{the voice of the}} pro-Dominican/anti-American nationalist by focusing on the successes of the Dominican player, not the MLB team that they play for. Dominican players engulfed in the MLB system have also been observed to demonstrate cultural resistance in other ways. [...] "Foot dragging" [...] by Dominican athletes playing underneath American managers have occurred where the players throw games in order to defame their manager. Other occasions of players resisting American hegemony include the refusal to respond to interviews in English while in the Dominican Republic. Many Dominican players return during the winter to play winter baseball as a way of showing gratitude to their fans. These fans, hailing from the same villages and towns as these professional athletes, cheer for these hometown heroes no matter what team they play for. This fan base is perceived by these returning athletes as a more appreciative audience than they experience in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Employee {{engagement}} {{has become}} an important measure of employee performance {{and it has been}} linked to higher overall firm performance outcomes. Studies have shown that employee engagement may be impacted by both organizational culture and ethical workplace climate. For example, organizational culture is deep rooted and depending on the cultural dimensions most highly emphasized within a company, may have positive or negative impacts on employee performance indicators such as employee engagement. Whereas culture is deep rooted and does not easily change, climate is more fluid and can ebb and flow with different instances on-going within the organization. In addition, researchers have come to understand that workplace climate can be impacted relating to ethical issues and a measure of ethical workplace climate (EWC) has emerged to measure perceptions of employees relating to EWC. However, most studies only look at culture or climate, but not the two together, or specifically with employee engagement. This study examines employee perceptions of culture, ethical workplace climate, and employee engagement in a case study with employees in health care. The study findings show that the positive culture type and climate type identified can be associated with positive levels of employee engagement. Specifically, employees perceived a clan culture type to have an overall positive impact employee engagement. Findings about employee perceived climate type indicate that employees perceive a social climate type is associated with a positive link to higher employee engagement levels. In addition, employee perceived engagement within the department measured moderately positive, consistent with its relationship with the perceived dominant and <b>subordinate</b> <b>culture</b> and climate type influences...|$|E

40|$|Negotiating Cultural Identity {{through the}} Arts: The African Cultural Memory Youth Arts Festival (ACMYAF) {{examines}} {{ways in which}} African cultural memory, {{and the extent to}} which the arts based approaches benefited the cultural identity socialisation experiences of young people of African migrant descent. Arts were used to explore the identities of a group of youth of African descent, as a means to developing understanding of the issues relating to their bicultural socialisation and ways in which Arts-based strategies could be used to address them towards bicultural competence. Bicultural competence implies the ability to function successfully in both the dominant and <b>subordinate</b> <b>culture.</b> The research project was motivated by the fact that Australian youth of African descent experience psycho-social challenges to their cultural identity development. Quite often this includes a denigration of their African cultures and identities through monocultural and exclusive cultural practises of Eurocentric Australia. And yet the young people involved in this study carry with them embodied knowledge and memories from African culture acquired through cultural socialisation prior to arrival in Australia as well as in ‘African’ homes in Australia, through parental cultural education and transmission. Such knowledge and cultural values play a significant role in identity formation and self-concept of the African descendant youth in Australia. Accordingly the festival was organised as an aesthetic and educative theatrical event using the Ujamaa circle and the African centred pedagogy theory, Participatory action research and Performance as a research Inquiry for the project. A participatory approach, through educative dialogue and performance enabled the participants to reveal their own embodied knowledge about African cultural memory leading to an educative exploration of its relevance through theatrical events. The process also enabled the participants to recall and document their cultural memories and subsequently reflect on their significance to identity negotiation and construction. The methodological research process became a Bicultural Socialisation Education Program (BSEP) because it enabled the participants through the theatrical events to integrate both subordinate and dominant cultural ideas towards self-affirming epistemologies and achieve a positive self-concept of themselves. It is the study’s conclusion that the festival, as a third space, enabled the participants to explore African cultural memory educatively by enacting art forms and dialogue that informed their African Australian identities. Furthermore, the methodological approach enabled the participants to reveal factors that influenced their bicultural socialisation experience, namely: visibility, racism, criminal stereotyping, alienation and specific issues relating to intergenerational relations. These factors present ongoing psycho-social challenges to the participants and in turn influence their bicultural socialisation experience and self-concept. The methodological approach was effective in enabling the participants, as a group of diverse African identities to develop an African Australian sensibility and to become conscious of their own agency in mobilising African cultural memory in an Australian context, towards bicultural competence...|$|E

40|$|For {{at least}} a decade, {{scholars}} examining colonial influences on the material culture of indigenous populations in the ancient Mediterranean have found recourse {{in the concept of}} hybridity. These investigators have recognized that in situations where different cultural groups meet and mix, artifactual and behavioral traits from both the dominant and the <b>subordinate</b> <b>cultures</b> mix, too. Those traits – what might, in other arenas of discourse, be called “memes” – are subsequently given new and localized meanings. The result is something that is neither one culture nor the other, but rather is new and different, something “in between”: a hybrid. This paper examines archaic and classical Thasos as a colonial context in which individuals belonging to different ethnic groups met and negotiated a wide variety of political, economic, and social relationships. Rather than looking at material of a strictly archaeological nature, such as grave goods or domestic assemblages, the subject of this paper will be an application of hybridity theory to Thasian visual arts. A series of relief sculptures found at Thasos shows that the artists who produced them were aware of – and open to – ideas and styles from across the Aegean and beyond, but they were not constrained to rote copying of those ideas. Hybridity therefore offers a powerful interpretative tool for understanding how Thasians adopted and adapted outside influences to suit their own needs, meanings, and society...|$|R

This paper seeks to overcome three main theoretical shortcomings of the LMX theory as documented in past research. First, that the LMX theory does not describe the exchange process sufficiently, and second, that it does not capture the cross-cultural influences on supervisor–subordinate exchanges. This paper deals with these weaknesses by providing a comprehensive description of supervisor–subordinate exchanges across cultures using two theoretical frameworks, Fiske’s relational theory and Triandis’s cultural syndromes. A third problem with the LMX theory is that it assumes all close relationships between supervisors and subordinates to be beneficial for the organisation. However, a stream of research has emerged that documents the downside of close relationships between supervisors and their subordinates. Utilising a recent cross-cultural framework on cronyism, this paper sheds light on the dysfunctional organisational consequences of close relationships between supervisors and their <b>subordinates</b> across <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

They select, legitimize, marginalize and are open to contestation and resistance.

40|$|This thesis {{discovers that}} {{a form of}} caseflow {{management}} was practised by Official Referees in England more than 70 years before the Woolf reforms. It also describes an innovative concept of judicial sponsorship of settlement at an early interlocutory stage. For its time it was revolutionary. Such process created a distinct <b>subordinate</b> judicial <b>culture</b> which promoted economy and expedition {{in the management of}} complex technical cases. This culture was facilitated by the referees' subordinate function as officers of the High Court and the type of casework undertaken. The essential elements of my theory of rudimentary micro caseflow management emerge from a study of the methods used by Sir Francis Newbolt K. C. These are analysed and discussed by way of a literature review, qualitative and quantitative analysis. I conclude that this form of rudimentary caseflow management and judicial settlement process made the court more efficient. This process, identified as Newbolt's "Scheme," is traced from its inception through the judicial activities of Newbolt and other referees who followed this approach whether actively or passively. Having traced the origin and reasons for such officers this study considers the senior and subordinate judicial figures involved, their influence and encouragement as to the employment of innovative interlocutory techniques. Contemporaneous records including reports and correspondence are analysed in considering these innovations. The analysis is supported by the results of a quantitative study of Judicial Statistics between 1919 and 1970 and other contemporaneous judicial records including the referees' notebooks and judicial time records known as Minute Books. A number of conclusions are drawn which suggest a correlation between such techniques and levels of efficiency providing an interesting comparison for those interested in wider questions of civil justice reform...|$|R

In particular, we examine the extent to which upward influence behavior is congruent with the value dimensions proposed in the established values research {{and the extent to which}} the U.

A model of cross-cultural influence behavior is developed to synthesize the present state of our knowledge in cross-cultural upward influence, and to provide a framework for identifying issues requiring further investigation. We conclude by proposing a set of cross-cultural research questions identified in the model. 3 It is well recognized in studies of managerial behavior that a manager's effectiveness highly depends upon his/her success in dealing with interpersonal relationships. An effective manager should be able to "manage " not only his/her subordinates and co-workers but also superiors. In other words, to effectively accomplish work through interpersonal networks, managers must succeed in influencing the behavior of others, including their superiors (Pfeffer, 1992; Schilit, 1986).

40|$|My {{research}} {{begins with}} {{the premise that the}} dilemmas of long-term care homes are rooted in the dilemmas of modernity. Habermas (1984; 1987) contends that modern societies are comprised of two basic spheres of social life – the lifeworld and the system. The communicatively-produced lifeworld represents the social interactions of individuals and groups in everyday life. The system, by contrast, is the realm of formal, functional and instrumental rationality. According to Habermas, certain social pathologies result when the structures and patterns of the system encroach upon, displace and even destroy the social life of the lifeworld. I argue the lifeworlds of long-term care homes have become colonized by bureaucratic, disciplinary and scientific discourses – products of the system – that both control and exclude the experiences and forms of knowledge held by those who live and work {{on the front lines of}} struggle. Today, it is widely agreed that deep changes are desperately needed to help long-term care homes progress from dehumanizing, institutional approaches to care and services toward approaches that are more humane and life-affirming. This evolution is known as the ‘culture change movement’. Some proponents of culture change say that long-term care is a broken system, but I argue the chief problem is that long-term care is treated as a system and that systems-thinking and instrumental rationalities have invaded the lifeworld of long-term care like a parasite. Increasingly, we have applied systems-thinking to places of everyday living where people are often treated as either inanimate objects or robots, which must follow predetermined schedules, routines and practices. The task of healing and renewing the lifeworld of long-term care calls for a turn away from the system and toward human action and discourse, where meaningful decisions are made by people, individually and collectively, within a real community. The decolonization of long-term care requires us to break free of the expert discourses that structure and perpetuate it, and to seek, instead, alternative sources of knowledge, those which have been excluded or <b>subordinated.</b> <b>Culture</b> change calls for a revitalization of the public sphere (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2005); that is, a returning of inclusive networks of communication among actual participants who share their life experiences as they work together toward a better tomorrow. My dissertation describes one long-term care and retirement living organization’s journey to decolonize its culture of service delivery, moving from an institutional model of care to approaches that are more relational and life-affirming. This culture change, guided by critical participatory action research (CPAR) (Kemmis & McTaggart, 1988; 2005), engaged residents, family members and team member as my research partners. Our research is about the personal and organizational transformations experienced as Schlegel Villages, a long-term care and retirement living organization located in southern Ontario, embarked upon a culture change process guided by CPAR within its 12 communities. The purpose of my research is to partner with members of Schlegel Villages in the collaborative planning, facilitation, documentation, and critique of a culture change process guided by CPAR. Describing our journey, which spanned 4 ½ years, my dissertation is divided into four parts: Part I: Setting the Stage; Part II: Reconnaissance; Part III: Continued CPAR; and Part IV: Critical Reflections. Part I builds a bridge from my theoretical perspective to my methodology and substantive area of research, illuminating connections between critical social theory, CPAR and culture change in long-term care. I also introduce my research partners from Schlegel Villages and share the story (based on my interpretation) of how I initially partnered with a small group of senior leaders within the organization to explore the possibilities of embarking on a collaborative culture change journey. In Part II, I describe two initial CPAR cycles of critical self-reflection. First, I weave my narrative as a long-term care professional with the culture change literature as I conduct a reconnaissance into my researcher-self (Cycle 1, 2009). Then, I describe Schlegel Villages’ collaborative reconnaissance (Cycle 2, 2009), conducted at an employee retreat in which 140 team members engaged in collaborative learning, discussion, consciousness-raising, and critique regarding the realities of the organizational culture at that time. With the strong support garnered through this reconnaissance, I describe how my partners and I decided to adopt a strengths-based action research methodology and organizational development strategy known as Appreciative Inquiry (AI) (Cooperrider & Whitney, & Stavros, 2008) to guide us in developing shared aspirations for the future. Following this reconnaissance, Part III describes our continued CPAR process. Each chapter describes a CPAR cycle representing approximately one year of Schlegel Villages’ culture change journey, from Cycle 3 in 2010 to Cycle 6 in 2013. In each cycle, as my partners and I worked to strengthen Schlegel Villages’ collective communicative power, the Villages worked to promote a set of eight aspirations. While reflection played an important role in each CPAR cycle, in Part IV, I offer a series of summative critical reflections on our journey, ranging from practical to methodological to theoretical. First, I describe our final CPAR cycle (Cycle 7, 2014); a cycle of collaborative reflection and critique regarding the process and impacts of Schlegel Villages’ culture change journey, which concluded at a Research Reflection Retreat. At this retreat, my partners and I drew upon our own experiences as well as data from in-depth, individual interviews and other sources. Overall, we concluded that through our CPAR culture change process, we opened a space for communicative action, strengthened Schlegel Villages’ collective communicative capacity, made strides in achieving our shared aspirations, and contributed to broader social action by sharing our culture change stories and engaging with people beyond Schlegel Villages. Part IV continues with two final chapters of a more theoretical nature in which I share my researcher-reflections on the overall CPAR process alongside those of my partners in a multi-vocal style aimed at the continued democratization of the research endeavor. First, using the processual requirements of Habermas’ communicative action as a framework (i. e., discourse ethics), I offer reflections on culture change guided by CPAR from a practical perspective by exploring key differences between communicatively-driven and expert-driven culture change, while offering clear and compelling support for the former. Secondly, I offer critical reflections on a culture change process guided by CPAR from a methodological and theoretical perspective, concluding that CPAR is indeed a powerful strategy for the aims of culture change. However, I describe how CPAR could be strengthened through a few post-structural modifications based on Foucault’s (1995; 2000) power/knowledge theme. Reflecting on Schlegel Villages’ CPAR culture change discourse, I describe how organizations can better harness the positive and productive features of power to co-produce new knowledge, which in turn produces even greater power and promotes the greatest prospect for change and transformation...|$|R
