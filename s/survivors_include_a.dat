40|$|Valved {{conduits}} made {{by incorporating}} Bjork-Shiley {{tilting disc valve}} prostheses in woven 'dacron ' arterial grafts {{have been used to}} bridge discontinuity between the right ventricle and the distal pulmonary arteries in 9 patients. Age at operation varied between I 2 days and I 2 years. Five patients had persistent truncus arteriosus, 3 had pulmonary atresia, and I had d-transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and subpulmonary stenosis. The only deaths have been in 2 desperately ill infants under 3 months of age. <b>Survivors</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> 2 -month-old infant with truncus arteriosus. Clinically the reconstructions continue to function satisfactorily afterfollow-up periods of up to i 8 months, without identifiable evidence of valve dysfunction or pulmonary embolism. The use of valved conduits to bridge discontinuities between the right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary arteries (Arai et al., I 965; Rastelli et al., I 965) has made possible surgical repair of various complex cardiac malformations, including pulmonary atresia, transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and subpulmonary stenosis, and truncus arteriosus. Allografts of the ascending aorta, incorporating the aortic valve and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, have most commonly been used as conduits, though imperfections of these grafts have led to the use of composite grafts of synthetic material incorporating a variety of valve mechanisms (Kouchoukos et al., I 971; Miki, Tatemichi, and Noguchi, I 97 I). In I 97 I we began using the Bjork-Shiley tilting disc aortic valve prosthesis 1 incorporated in 'dacron' 2 vascular grafts 3 to establish right ven-tricle to pulmonary artery continuity in such patients, a method also used by Cooley and his associates (in discussion of Fernandez et al., 1972) ...|$|E
