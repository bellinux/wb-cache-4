The entrance facade is asymmetrical, with a tall arcaded entrance projecting out from the house on the south-west corner.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E

5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
