500|$|Early on in {{practice}} two, Will Stevens became the second Manor driver {{to make contact}} with the barriers, damaging his car. Teammate Rossi was limited to only three laps of running as his team spent most of the session repairing the damage from the shunt in first practice, he eventually finished almost 14 seconds down on Daniil Kvyat, who topped the session with a time of 1:46.142.
