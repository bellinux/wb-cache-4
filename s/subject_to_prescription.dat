40|$|Observational {{studies have}} given {{conflicting}} results {{about the effect}} of statins in preventing dementia and cognitive decline. Moreover, observational studies are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>prescription</b> bias, making it hard to draw definite conclusions from them. Randomized controlled trials are therefore the preferred study design to investigate the association between statins and cognition. Here we present detailed cognitive outcomes from the randomized placebo-controlled PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Cognitive function was assessed repeatedly in all 5, 804 PROSPER participants at six different time points during the study using four neuropsychological performance tests. After a mean follow-up period of 42 months, no difference in cognitive decline at any of the cognitive domains was found in subjects treated with pravastatin compared to placebo (all p > 0. 05). Pravastatin treatment in old age did not affect cognitive decline during a 3 year follow-up period. Employing statin therapy in the elderly in an attempt to prevent cognitive decline therefore seems to be futile. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|The general goal of {{the paper}} is to show the normative/deontic nature of conventions. Conventions are {{traditionally}} defined as regularity of behavior based on expectations evolved to solve coordination problems [14]. The thesis we defend is that the cognitive attitude of expectations is not only characterized by an anticipatory representation (belief) of a future state of affairs but is coupled with a motivational component (a goal on this state). The possible convergence between beliefs and corresponding goals allows the identification {{of positive and negative}} expectations. We argue that in positive expectations (differently from the negative ones) lies implicitly an influencing act aimed at prescribing that the expected event will be realized. We consider conventions as analyzed in Game Theory as regularity of behavior based on positive expectations. These conventions entail the deontic component of prescription. Each agent prescribes (and is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>prescription)</b> conformity to the convention to the others (prescription to do). This is a possible route to the spontaneous emergence of Social Norms. However we hypothesize, differently, that negative expectations too can sustain conventions. Even “bad habits ” share a deontic component but is characterized by the socio-cognitive structure of permission (entitlement to do). We argue that with this analysis is possible to explain the self-organizing and stabilizing effect of conventions that create an equilibrium noxious for all the participants and individually more costly than the individual benefit...|$|E
40|$|The thesis argues that, {{contrary}} to previous {{analyses of the}} topic, Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) must be understood as an assemblage of interconnected software projects, rather than being a singular entity. It also argues that a detailed understanding of these projects' production activities is {{necessary in order to}} gain an adequate understanding of the wider FLOSS phenomenon. In order to address these omissions in existing treatments of the topic, the thesis presents the results of a detailed, long-term, ethnographic study of a FLOSS project, the analysis of which is informed by actor-network and assemblage theory. In doing so, the material components of GNOME are a major focus, including the project's code, its communications and development infrastructure, and the role of contributors' bodies in their production activities. These aspects of the project are shown <b>to</b> be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> various territorialising activities which seek to establish it and its products as having particular characteristics, and which also generate the project as a definite, delineated entity. These shared material aspects of the project are also argued to be crucial to participants' abilities to associate and collaborate with one another, and are shown <b>to</b> be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> normative <b>prescriptions</b> and political contests. The thesis makes the case that the study of FLOSS is able to inform a more general sociological understanding of the consequences and possibilities associated with digital technologies and goods...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{oxygen therapy}} (LTOT) {{at home is}} an {{established}} treatment, which is potentially <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> inappropriate <b>prescription.</b> This retrospective study aims to identify the determinants of inappropriate prescription through the analysis of existing prescribing information for LTOT and routes of supply within the Northern area of the Emilia-Romagna Region. We selected all first time prescriptions for LTOT released in 2009 in the provinces of Modena, Parma, Piacenza and Reggio Emilia. A specific questionnaire with data collection through an electronic database allowed to analyze both organizational / administrative and clinical variables related <b>to</b> LTOT <b>prescription.</b> We analyzed a total of 364 prescriptions: 62 from Modena, 96 from Parma, 73 from Reggio Emilia, and 133 from Piacenza. The data collected highlighted several differences in the prescribing process between the four provinces. Among the most frequently omitted information in the prescription we identified: a) values of PaO 2 and PaCO 2 (absent in more than 90 % of prescriptions dispensed at the AUSL Modena, while present in about 70 % of prescriptions in Parma and in almost all of those of Piacenza and Reggio Emilia); b) differential information on oxygen flow at night or during exercise (absent in the prescriptions from Parma, Modena and Piacenza and present in more than 60 % of prescriptions from Reggio Emilia); c) indications concerning the follow-up (not covered in the prescriptions from Modena and Parma). Finally, definition of the diagnosis that justifies the need for prescription of LTOT is often missing or incomplete. Therefore {{the results of the}} study have allowed the identification of some factors of inappropriateness both on the clinical side and on the management side.

40|$|Evaluation of {{controlled}} prescriptions with {{a diagnosis of}} surgical intervention Objective: Drugs <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> control (DSC) are commonly used in the preoperative, per-operative and postoperative periods. In this study, details of DSC use, that are required to be prescribed <b>to</b> green <b>prescriptions</b> (GP) or red pre-scriptions (RP), for a surgical diagnosis were evaluated. Material and Methods: Controlled drug prescriptions (CDP) between January to December 2009 were investigated in {{the archives of the}} Istanbul Local Health Authority. 660 CDPs indicating a surgical diagnosis were retrospectively evaluated and those prescribed by surgical departments (SD) were compared to those written by internal medicine departments (ID). Results: SD physicians prescribed 72. 7 % of CDPs and 89. 5 % of prescriptions were for GP, and 10. 5 % were for RP. The physicians of SD were found to prescribe more RP than ID physicians. Most of the CDPs were written for women (58. 8 %) and mostly in private hospitals (40. 9 %). Among all the physicians, orthopedic surgeons prescribed these drugs the most (20. 9 %). Tramadol was the most common drug found in CDPs (55. 5 %). Conclusion: DSCs, which have difficult prescription procedures, are used frequently in surgical interventions. The study shows that not only SD physicians, but also ID physicians prefer CDP. The study provides important clues to the usage patterns of DSCs. Recently evolving health care systems including prescriptions should use these findings obtained from the study.

40|$|Newly enfranchised voters, rowdy {{political}} campaigns, and {{the emergence}} of two major national political parties characterized American politics from 1824 to 1856, an era known as the Second Party System. During this same time, however, women remained disenfranchised, and they were increasingly <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> gender <b>prescriptions</b> that told them that their place was in the home. As the nation’s political culture became its popular culture, then, how did women respond? Political histories and women’s histories alike long overlooked this question. When historians finally began to study women’s political history, many still minimized women’s roles in partisan politics, arguing that women were involved only in benevolent reform associations or that they were much more involved with the Whigs than with the Democrats. I challenge this view. This thesis argues that women were indeed Democrats, and that they played an important and continuous role in the Democratic Party throughout the Second Party System. To do so, women had to negotiate between gender prescriptions, which varied wildly, and local Democratic leaders, who allowed or denied access to party events based on their own beliefs about women’s place in politics. Though these conditions certainly discouraged many Democratic women from participating in politics, many others sewed banners, baked cakes, marched in parades, wrote, and even spoke on behalf of the Democrats, despite this complex social and political landscape. This speaks to the depth of Democratic women’s partisan loyalties and their continuous role in politics throughout the Second Party System.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to predict the base curve of the {{spectacle}} correction of patients in order to minimize their aniseikonia. We hypothesized that in order to correct the patient’s aniseikonia, we can manipulate the base curve of the <b>subject’s</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>to</b> change the magnification, without ultimately altering the prescription. Methods: Ten female adults with spherical equivalent of ≥ 1 D anisometropia, and visual acuity of 20 / 25 or greater corrected vision, were studied. The participants were evaluated for anisometropia while wearing their habitual spectacles (i. e. non-size lens) and reassessed 4 weeks later (± 2 weeks). A-scan ultrasound biometry and keratometry measurement were determined at first visit. Ocular history, visual acuity, refraction, stereopsis at near, and aniseikonia subjective symptoms was evaluated at each visit. Aniseikonia amount was measured by the Brecher test and Aniseikonia Inspector Software test for both spectacles and with contact lenses.
