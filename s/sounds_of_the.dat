5|$|In {{order to}} {{represent}} the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Frederick {{thought the}} <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle were either an outpost {{skirmish}} or the Croats, who apparently started their days with regular firing of their weapons.

5|$|According to K.C. Aryan, {{the number}} of Matrikas is {{determined}} {{in the structure of}} the Devanagari alphabet. First is the (A) group which contains the vowels, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (Saptamatrikas) correspond to the seven consonant groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added to it, the eight mother goddesses (Ashtamatrikas) are obtained. The Shaktas hold that the Mothers preside over impurities (mala) and over <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language. The Mothers were identified with fourteen vowels plus the anusarva and visarga– making their number sixteen.|$|E
5|$|Early American {{alternative}} bands such as Dream Syndicate, R.E.M., The Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with {{folk music}} and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. {{was the most}} immediately successful; its debut album, Murmur (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers. One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as The Velvet Underground.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians {{had spent}} the night of 23/24 April in their pits {{listening}} to the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position forward of the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing fighters.|$|E

5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E
5|$|Very low {{sounds are}} also {{produced}} in various species of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea and Neuroptera. These low sounds are simply the sounds {{made by the}} insect's movement. Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insect moving are amplified {{and can be used}} to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in Hemiptera, such as the corixids (water boatmen), are known to communicate via underwater sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Boone informs Locke he {{is tired}} of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Wever {{began the}} season {{remaining}} with Fort Lauderdale. He had a 73 {{record and a}} 2.00 ERA in 12 games before being promoted to the Nashville <b>Sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern League, the Yankees' AA affiliate. With Nashville, he had a 52 record and 2.05 ERA in nine appearances. Wever's pitching coach in Nashville was Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the confidence to pitch in the majors, and spent his time in Nashville working on that aspect of Wever's game. The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All-Star team, thanks to 11 wins and 116 strikeouts {{through the end of}} June. He improved to a 16-6 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 191 strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Wever up to the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Ocean Software ported {{the game}} to home gaming systems, {{including}} the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems, the graphics and <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ports differ from the original arcade version. Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format. The Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory. The Amiga and Atari ST versions {{are one of the}} few games to use the Trojan Light Gun. In developing the Amiga conversion, the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics, pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them. Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version. He kept the graphical detail of the backgrounds simple to allow for more action in the foreground. Taking into account the system's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware, Stones designed {{the game to}} handle a large number of on-screen sprites. In 2005, Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2, personal computer and Xbox.|$|E
