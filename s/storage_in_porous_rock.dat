40|$|After {{the last}} years had seen {{the lowest level of}} {{exploration}} activities, the year 2001 marked a distinct increase of exploration activities. This became quite visible in the number of completed exploration wells and in the extent of seismic surveys. Two of four new-field wildcats were completed in 2001, however without success. One of the three additional exploration wells (new-pool test and new-tectonic block) found gas. In production drilling nine of twelve wells were successful. Footage increased by near 25 % compared to the preceding year and amounted to 54 030 metres. Seen in the light of history since 1945, this value marks the last but one rank compared to the last rank of the previous year. The rise of footage was achieved exclusively by exploration drilling. Footage of production drilling was slightly down. In geophysical prospecting the activities in 3 D seismics reached the same level as in times of maximum seismic activities. The total area of 2400 square kilometres even exceeded the previous maximum. The main contribution was delivered by only one offshore survey in the German North Sea. 2 D seismic was rather low and amounted to 450 kilometres in total. The license area for oil and gas exploration was reduced even further. As in previous years several expired licences were not extended and in some cases parts of the licence areas were relinquished. One licence around the city of Bremen was newly awarded. Two licences were awarded due to reorganisation of licence areas respectively due to adaptation to frontiers. In the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen three smaller licence areas were newly awarded aiming at producing gas from abandoned coal mines. German oil production could increase to 3. 44 million metric tons due to the increase in production from the oil field Mittelplate to 1. 6 million tons. In all other fields oil production decreased because of normal decline in production. Total remaining proven and probable oil reserves are reduced by 3 million tons to 46. 8 million tons. Contrary to the trend of {{the last years}} the total remaining proven and probable natural gas reserves (raw gas) dropped by 34. 4 billion cubic metres to 342. 9 billion cubic metres due to production and the reassessment of existing fields. Reserve figures were 9 % below the value of the preceding year. The gas production amounted to 21. 5 billion cubic metres and equals the previous year value. The growth <b>in</b> underground gas <b>storage</b> continued. As <b>in</b> the preceding year 23 gas <b>storage</b> facilities <b>in</b> <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> and 19 gas <b>storage</b> facilities <b>in</b> salt caverns were in operation. The working gas volume increased by 0. 5 billion cubic metres to 19. 1 billion cubic metres. At present it is planned to raise the working gas volume by 4. 4 billion cubic metres by building new storage facilities respectively by extension of existing facilities. (orig.)

40|$|Underground rocks {{usually have}} complex pore {{system with a}} variety of pore types and a wide range of pore size. The effects of pore {{structure}} on elastic wave attenuation cannot be neglected. We investigated the pore structure effects on P-wave scattering attenuation in dry rocks by pore-scale modeling based on the wave theory and the similarity principle. Our modeling results indicate that pore size, pore shape (such as aspect ratio), and pore density are important factors influencing P-wave scattering attenuation <b>in</b> <b>porous</b> <b>rocks,</b> and can explain the variation of scattering attenuation at the same porosity. From the perspective of scattering attenuation, <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> can safely suit to the long wavelength assumption when the ratio of wavelength to pore size is larger than 15. Under the long wavelength condition, the scattering attenuation coefficient increases as a power function as the pore density increases, and it increases exponentially with the increase in aspect ratio. For a certain porosity, rocks with smaller aspect ratio and/or larger pore size have stronger scattering attenuation. When the pore aspect ratio is larger than 0. 5, the variation of scattering attenuation at the same porosity is dominantly caused by pore size and almost independent of the pore aspect ratio.

40|$|Understanding {{the physics}} of {{three-phase}} (gas, oil and water) displacements <b>in</b> <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> is crucial for predicting petroleum recovery and the migration of non-aqueous phase liquids contaminated in soils. Topological properties of <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> and interactions of fluids within these rocks control how three fluid phases flow together in pore space. The effort made in the 1990 s using 2 D glass micro models of simplistic porous system helped significantly understand the physics and mechanisms of three-phase fluid interactions <b>in</b> <b>porous</b> media. However, no study has been reported so far to {{examine the effect of}} the three-dimensional topological properties of a <b>porous</b> <b>rock</b> on characteristics of three-phase fluids. 	This thesis presents a study that combines the 3 D imaging and 3 D computational analysis to characterise qualitatively and quantitatively the three-phase fluids (oil, water and gas) at different spreading conditions <b>in</b> a <b>porous</b> <b>rock.</b> It attempts to answer whether or not the intermediate oil phase in a gas-oil-water system is spatially connected within an actual <b>porous</b> <b>rock</b> through oil films. An innovative experimental approach was used to visualise 3 D distributions of three-phase (gas, oil and water) using a high resolution micro-CT. A methodology used to align and subtract two sets of tomograms of the same rock being dry and partially saturated is presented. This methodology allows extracting and delineating 3 D information of oil, water and gas <b>in</b> a <b>porous</b> <b>rock</b> which provides a qualitative description of the configurations and distributions of three phases regardless of the uncertainty associated to pores topology. A sophisticated segmentation algorithm was used to perform a quantitative analysis of the gas-oil-water distributions obtained from the micro-CT images.
