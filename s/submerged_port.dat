Marine archaeol-ogy has made tremendous progress in India. Over the years, the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, in collaboration with other Government agencies has undertaken the exploration and excava-tion of <b>submerged</b> <b>ports</b> and shipwrecks at Dwarka, Bet Dwarka, Somnath, Vijaydurg, Goa and Lakshadweep on the west coast; and Poompuhar and Mahabalipuram {{on the east coast}} of India. Further, onshore explorations have also been carried out at various places along both coasts of India to locate ports, trading centres and structures related to maritime activities. These findings from various sites in India, confirm her rich submerged cultural heritage, conservation of which is a prime necessity. A modest beginning has been made in this direction and more thrust is required before this submerged heritage is destroyed owing to intense activity along the coast, resulting from globalisation and rapid industrialisation. This article provides an overview of developments in Indian marine archaeology, and describes a few important sites and their archaeological significance.

The prediction of the temperature reduction in the near field of the buoyant jet is a problem of environmental concern. The mechanics of a vertical axisymmetric buoyant jet in shallow water is theoretically and experimentally investigated. Four flow regimes with distinct hydrodynamic properties are discerned in the vicinity of the jet: the buoyant jet region, the surface impingement region, the internal hydraulic jump, and the stratified counterflow region. An analytical framework is formulated for each region. The coupling of the solutions of the four regions yields a prediction of the near field stability as well as the temperature reduction of the buoyant discharge. It is found that the near field of the buoyant jet is stable only for a range of jet densimetric Froude numbers and submergences. A theoretical solution is given for the stability criterion and the dilution of an unstable buoyant jet. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the theory. The experimental results are compared to the theoretical predictions. Good agreement is obtained. Also issued as a M. S. thesis in the Department of Civil Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technolog...|$|R
