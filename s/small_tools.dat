5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing <b>small</b> <b>tools,</b> although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E

25|$|<b>Small</b> <b>tools</b> {{production}} {{was just a}} start; the item that set him apart was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

500|$|... 64 {{individual}} graves, comprising 59 {{per cent}} of the total in the cemetery, were found to contain artefacts. Certain types of artefact can help to identify {{the gender of the}} occupants; male graves, for instance, tend to contain weapons and tools, while female ones are associated with jewellery, shears and chatelaines (belt hooks) which were used to suspend keys or <b>small</b> <b>tools.</b> 34 of the graves contained such gender-specific goods, of which 19 were associated with females and 15 with males. The female graves seem to have been predominantly located in the north and west of the cemetery and the males in the south and east. It is possible that the paired graves may have been those of spouses, a pattern that is apparent from Saxon cemeteries elsewhere in the country.|$|E

2500|$|Colter, Hancock, and Dixon {{ventured into}} the {{wilderness}} with 20 beaver traps, a two-year supply of ammunition, and numerous other <b>small</b> <b>tools</b> gifted {{to them by the}} expedition such as knives, rope, hatchets, and personal utensils. The exact route of the trapping party is not known. It is speculated that unfriendly Blackfeet in the region of the Lower Missouri and a lack of horses forced the company to seek their fortunes in the tributaries of the less-prosperous Yellowstone Valley, a region inhabited by the friendlier Crows. The dangers of the narrow and rapid Yellowstone River, and the absence of game may explain the quick dissolution of the trapping party. After reaching a point where the Gallatin, Jefferson and Madison Rivers meet, known today as Three Forks, Montana, the trio managed to maintain their partnership for only about two months. [...] There is much speculation as to where the party, at that point only consisting of Colter and Hancock following a falling out with Dixon, spent the winter of 1806-1807. However, Wyoming historian J.K. Rollinson asserted in a personal letter that he had met the stepson of one of Colter’s companions, mostly likely Hancock’s as Dixon is known to have left the region for Wisconsin in 1827. This stepson, Dave Fleming, accompanied his stepfather on a hunting trip to Clark’s Fork Canyon as a boy, and was informed that his stepfather had made camp in this exact spot while trapping with Colter many years earlier. Fleming reportedly remembered and passed on this detail as his stepfather asserted that during winter of 1806-1807, Colter had grown restless with taking shelter and ascended the canyon into the Sunlight Basin of modern-day Wyoming, which would make him the first known white man to have ever entered this region.|$|E

30|$|Compared {{with the}} large {{polishing}} <b>tool,</b> the <b>small</b> polishing <b>tool</b> {{used in this study}} has many advantages [12]. The <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> can follow the freeform surface with relatively large curvature, while large tool cannot polish the freeform surface with curvature smaller than its radius. The <b>small</b> <b>tool</b> can redress the error of local surface, while a large tool may polish the nearby surface when it polishes a local surface. The small can also operate at greater pressure and velocity than a large tool; therefore, it can remove the material in a rapid manner. In the case of manufacturing one single piece, <b>small</b> polishing <b>tool</b> has a higher polishing efficiency.|$|R

He also sent toys, sewing materials, <b>small</b> <b>tools</b> for the younger children, and other things that I have forgotten.

6000|$|On the {{following}} morning we visited the unfinished temple. The outer walls were of slabs of stone neatly chiselled, but badly mortared with felspathic clay and pounded slate, instead of lime; the partition walls were of clay, shaped in moulds of wood; parallel planks, four feet asunder, being placed in the intended position of the walls, and left open above, the composition was placed in these boxes, {{a little at a}} time, and rammed down by the feet of many men, who walked round and round the narrow enclosure, singing, and also using rammers of heavy wood. The outer work was of good hard timber, of Magnolia ("Pendre-kun" [...] of the Lepchas) land oak ("Sokka"). The common [...] "Ban," [...] or Lepcha knife, supplied the place of axe, saw, adze, and plane; and the graving work was executed with <b>small</b> <b>tools,</b> chiefly on Toon (Cedrela), a very soft wood (the [...] "Simal-kun" [...] of the Lepchas).|$|E
6000|$|You have {{a lump of}} greyish {{clay and}} a saucer of water and certain <b>small</b> <b>tools</b> of wood (for which I cannot {{discover}} the slightest use in the world) given you, and Euphemia puts on a very winning bib. Then, moistening the clay until it acquires sufficient plasticity, and incidentally splashing your cuffs and coat-sleeves with an agreeably light tinted mud, you set to work. At first people are a little disgusted at the apparent dirtiness of the employment, and also perhaps rather diffident. The eldest lady says weakly deprecatory things, and the feeblest male is jocular after his wont. But it is remarkable how soon the charm of this delightful occupation seizes hold of you. For really the sensations of moulding this plastic matter into shape are wonderfully and quite unaccountably pleasing. It is ever so much easier than drawing things--"anyone can do it," [...] as the advertisement people say--and the work {{is so much more}} substantial in its effects. Technical questions arise. In moulding a head, do you take a lump and fine it down, or do you dab on the features after the main knob of it is shaped? ...|$|E
60|$|Case-hardening is {{the name}} given to a simple process, by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel. <b>Small</b> <b>tools,</b> fish-hooks, and keys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are {{fashioned}} first, and case-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, {{because it is the}} cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel is hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel, combines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of case-hardening, is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated, until the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated three or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of steel, is hardened by quenching it in water. In default of prussiate of potash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is a very imperfect substitute. To make animal charcoal, take a scrap of leather, hide, hoof, horn, flesh, blood--anything, in fact, that has animal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire, and powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of this charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first placed near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should be allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break open the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.|$|E

50|$|The Arctic <b>Small</b> <b>Tool</b> {{tradition}} (ASTt) was a broad cultural {{entity that}} developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, {{and on the}} eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2500 BC. ASTt groups were the first human occupants of Arctic Canada and Greenland. This was a terrestrial entity that had a highly distinctive toolkit based on microblade technology. Typically tool types include scrapers, burins and side and end blades used in composite arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Many researchers also assume that it was Arctic <b>Small</b> <b>Tool</b> populations who first introduced the bow and arrow to the Arctic. ASTt camps are often found along coasts and streams, {{to take advantage of}} seal or salmon populations. While some of the groups were fairly nomadic, more permanent, sod-roofed homes have also been identified from Arctic <b>Small</b> <b>Tool</b> tradition sites.|$|R
