It just blows my mind. I remember when Admiral Ming Chang {{got a call from a}} reporter one day, and he was recounting that the reporter asked him if he was a U.S. citizen. He says, Yes he was. 'Were you born here?' 'No, I came to the United States in 1950 sic (actually 1946) as a young boy from Shanghai.' 'And <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> do to get your citizenship?'

At that point the Yismach Moshe admonished him saying {{that we have no}} understanding of the greatness of Korach. In fact, added the Yismach Moshe, he himself was a gilgul from that [...] "Dor HaMidbar" [...] (generation of the desert) and had not been sure whom to follow, since this seemed to be a valid argument between the two greatest men of the generation. His grandson then asked him, [...] "If <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> do and how did you save yourself?" [...] The Yismach Moshe answered, [...] "Not wanting {{to be part of the}} machlokes (argument) I ran into my tent and closed the entrance tightly.

5000|$|We had {{women and}} children, old men, young boys. So, you know, it's hard to say. I think initially, {{the reason that}} we were doing this was they were trying to find foreign fighters. commanders were trying to prove {{that there were a lot}} of foreign fighters in Fallujah. So, mainly, that's what we were going for, but most of them really didn't have I.D.'s but maybe half of them had I.D.'s. Very few of them had foreign I.D.'s. There were people working with me who would—in an effort to sort of cook the books, you know they would find a Koran on the guy and the Koran was printed in Algeria, and they would mark him down as an Algerian, or you know guys would come in with a black shirt and khaki pants and they would say, well, this is the Hezbollah uniform and they would mark him down as a Lebanese, which was ridiculous, but—you know...

Tony needed to be prompted as to who I was and what we had agreed but we set a meeting up to discuss. I was playing RU for Old Edwardians (Old Eds) at the time in a suburb of Jhb called Houghton.
