500|$|In December 1983, Jerôme Dahan and Laurent Boutonnat, two friends, {{composed}} {{a song called}} [...] "Maman a tort", about lesbian love between a girl committed to a mental hospital and her nurse. To find a performer, they held a casting. A girl aged 15–16 was initially chosen to perform the song, before being rejected because she {{was too young to}} sing its sexually ambiguous lyrics. Boutonnat then decided to ask one of his friends, Mylène Gautier, to sing the track. Both composers have said that they thought Gautier seemed psychotic and thus was the ideal person to record the track. Boutonnat said: [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her, with her triangular face, I realized that this would be her and nobody else. She looked crazy, it was perfect." [...] After they decided to work with her, Gautier took the pseudonym of Farmer, as a tribute to actress Frances Farmer.|$|E
500|$|Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse {{but still}} {{went through the}} normal {{audition}} channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the A {{graphics}} department hired Craig Braun and Associates {{to design}} the album cover for their third album. [...] "I recognized {{it to be a}} great logo as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it", says Richard. The logo was used on every Carpenters album thereafter; Richard said it was done [...] "to keep things consistent". The logo did not appear on the front cover of Passage but a small version appeared on the back cover.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think he's lovely," [...] said Anne reproachfully. [...] "He is so very sympathetic. He didn't mind {{how much}} I talked--he {{seemed to like}} it. I {{felt that he was}} a kindred spirit <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But indeed I did {{not wish}} you a {{pleasant}} walk; I never thought of such a thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to him <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not--Oh! You were not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped, I would have jumped out and run after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," [...] cried his wife, [...] "what are {{you talking}} of? Why, he has four or five {{thousand}} a year, and very likely more." [...] Then addressing her daughter, [...] "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! <b>I</b> remember, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him, {{when he first came}} into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1993, Smith began another [...] {{relationship}} with Kelly Bates {{while she was}} only 14 years old, having met her while she was babysitting for friends. Approximately two years later, when she left school, Bates moved in with Smith {{at his home in}} Furnival Road, Gorton. She had concealed the relationship from her parents. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two began living together: [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Smith the hairs {{on the back of my}} neck went up. I tried everything I could to get Kelly Anne away from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was nine}} years old, Richards had the His Dark Materials books read to her by her mother, feeling that she could [...] "be her". After she saw the stage {{adaption}} at the National Theatre, she says she [...] "just wanted to be Lyra". [...] Philip Pullman, author of the books, said, [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Dakota's screen test, I realised that the search was over." [...] Chris Weitz, the director, added that Richards [...] "made {{what should have been}} an extremely difficult decision quite easy." [...] The Golden Compass with Richards as Lyra was released worldwide in December 2007 and grossed $372 million.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was a tough}} fight getting upstairs. We {{searched the}} bedroom areas {{and it was very}} hot, we knew {{immediately}} that no-one could have survived the fire. We began to feel around the walls and discovered him lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. I would say he had been in bed and tried to escape. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it's difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever." [...] – (Fire Officer) ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in Tucson, the Earp posse spotted Stilwell and other Cowboys. [...] "Almost the first men we {{met on the}} {{platform}} there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth", Virgil later told the San Francisco Examiner. [...] "They fell back into the crowd <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> had an escort, and the boys {{took me to the}} hotel to supper." [...] Watched over by the well-armed Wyatt and his posse, Virgil and Allie had dinner in Tucson at Porter's Hotel, then reboarded the train.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} person, I'm sure, Captain Gills,' replied Mr Toots, 'I haven't the least idea. But {{coming to the}} door, I found him waiting there; and he said was I coming back again, and I said yes; and he said did I know you, and I said, yes, I had the {{pleasure}} of your acquaintance--you had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance, after some persuasion; and he said, if that was the case, would I say to you what I have said, about existing circumstances and coming prepared, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you, would <b>I</b> ask you to step round the corner, if it was only for one minute, on most important business, to Mr Brogley's the Broker's. Now, I tell you what, Captain Gills--whatever it is, I am convinced it's very important; and if you like to step round, now, I'll wait here till you come back.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Cox was {{detained}} in 1977: [...] When they came, I was preparing an {{issue on the}} birthday of the queen of Holland. I made them wait until I was finished, then I called Maud to let her know. I {{looked out the window}} and saw a (Ford) Falcon and a Peugeot with a sunroof, with the driver who looked like a Mexican bandido, with crossed bandoliers. They took me to Coordinación Federal through the basement, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> arrived, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a big swastika on the wall. They put me in a cell, without clothes, a kind of tube. It was a very strong experience. I did not know it at the time, but when they detained me, there was strong international pressure. I had my contacts. Tex Harris, who was a super guy, a diplomat from the USA who had been sent by Jimmy Carter and Patricia Derian, did a lot of work to free me.|$|R
2500|$|Harras also commented, [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{the sketch}} by Walter [...] and heard Louise's take on him, I {{knew we had}} the {{character}} I wanted. Jackson [...] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's." [...] Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: [...] "The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe {{there was even a}} character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern." [...] Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: [...] "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels {{at the end of one}} of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I? I forgave you as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> how {{the land}} really lay." [...] And perhaps he had; his {{instinct}} {{had always been}} to forgive the beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew how}} it was as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "Well, I believe we could get hold of an American missionary, and the Palestrina's ready." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{was here}} {{about eight years}} ago I was coming up in a car of the {{elevated}} road. Very few people were in that car, and on one end of it there was no one, except on the opposite seat, where sat a man about fifty years old, with a most winning face and an elegant eye--a beautiful eye; and I took him from his dress to be a master mechanic, a man who had a vocation. He had with him a very fine little child of about four or five years. I was watching the affection which existed between those two. I judged he was the grandfather, perhaps. It was really a pretty child, and I was admiring her, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> was admiring her he began to notice me.|$|R
60|$|I {{found that}} Hartford was all alive with trade, and that wages were high, {{because there are}} there two {{factories}} for the manufacture of arms. Colt's pistols come from Hartford, as also do Sharpe's rifles. Wherever arms can be prepared, or gunpowder; where clothes or blankets fit for soldiers can be made, or tents or standards, or things appertaining {{in any way to}} warfare, there trade was still brisk. No being is more costly in his requirements than a soldier, and no soldier so costly as the American. He must eat and drink of the best, and have good boots and warm bedding, and good shelter. There were during the Christmas of 1861 above half a million of soldiers so to be provided--the President, in his message made in December to Congress, declared the number to be above six hundred thousand--and therefore in such places as Hartford trade was very brisk. I went over the rifle factory, and was shown everything, but I do not know that I brought away much with me that was worth any reader's attention. The best of rifles, I have no doubt, were being made with the greatest rapidity, and all were sent to the army <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> finished. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> some murderous-looking weapons, with swords attached to them instead of bayonets, but have since been told by soldiers that the old-fashioned bayonet is thought to be more serviceable.|$|R
2500|$|Wyatt and his deputies had {{initially}} planned to travel {{only as far}} as Benson, but when they learned that Stilwell and others were looking for Virgil, they remained with Virgil and Allie through to Tucson. The men were well armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two cartridge belts. Allie wore Virgil's pistol belt during the journey so it would be handy. Virgil told the San Francisco Examiner two months later that upon getting off the train in Tucson, [...] "Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth." [...] "They fell back into the crowd <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> had an escort, and the boys took me to the hotel to supper." [...] Guarded by his brothers and the deputies, Virgil and Allie had dinner at Porter's Hotel in Tucson. Their guards helped them board the train for California, and once they were safely seated, kept a watch for the Cowboys.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mabel is like you, as {{you used}} to be," [...] he observed. [...] "It struck me as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her; but {{when she began to}} talk there was a difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{them they}} sprang {{out of sight}} behind some trees, and this morning, when they caught sight of Mary, they hurried off in the {{direction}} of Haven Point." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} there but a few minutes when the boat from without came slowly in between the rocks; and almost as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, its {{progress}} was suddenly stopped by a sunken bar.|$|E
60|$|When we {{presently}} {{got under}} way and went poking down the broad Ohio, I became a new being, {{and the subject of}} my own admiration. I was a traveler! A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before. I had an exultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes which I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such a glorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I was able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had hardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, when we stopped at villages and wood-yards, I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the boiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank. If they did not seem to discover me, I presently sneezed to attract their attention, or moved to a position where they could not help seeing me. And <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> knew they <b>saw</b> me <b>I</b> gaped and stretched, and gave other signs of being mightily bored with traveling.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in Tucson, the Earp posse spotted Stilwell and other Cowboys. [...] "Almost the first men we {{met on the}} {{platform}} there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth", Virgil later told the San Francisco Examiner. [...] "They fell back into the crowd <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> had an escort, and the boys {{took me to the}} hotel to supper." [...] Watched over by the well-armed Wyatt and his posse, Virgil and Allie had dinner in Tucson at Porter's Hotel, then reboarded the train. As the train pulled away from the station, gunfire was heard. Witnesses said they saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone. Wyatt later told his biographers that he saw Frank Stilwell, and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton, armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar. When Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell stumbled, allowing Wyatt to catch him. Wyatt later claimed he shot Stilwell as he attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away.|$|R
6000|$|... “Now, Friday,” says I, {{laying down}} the {{discharged}} pieces, and {{taking up the}} musket which was yet loaded, “follow me,” which he did {{with a great deal}} of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> perceived they <b>saw</b> me, <b>I</b> shouted <b>as</b> loud <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, and bade Friday do so too, and running <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers who were just going to work with him had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running about forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and I thought he had killed them all, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them all fall of a heap into the boat, though <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, after all, you weren't successful. You {{need not}} tell me {{anything}} about that--I knew it as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you this morning. But I will ask you to answer one thing: Is the decision final?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt the}} swing of it as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it," [...] said Vesey. [...] "Hurrah for old Calloway! He's done the Japs and every paper in town that prints {{literature}} instead of news. Take a look at that." ...|$|E

"Now, Friday," [...] said I, {{laying down}} the {{discharged}} pieces, and {{taking up the}} musket, which was yet loaden, [...] "follow me," [...] said I; which he did, with a deal of courage; upon which I rushed, out of the wood, and shewed myself, and Friday close at my foot: <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> perceived they <b>saw</b> me, <b>I</b> shouted <b>as</b> loud <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, and bade Friday do so too; and running <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, which by the way was not very fast, being loaded with arms <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between {{the place where they}} sat and the sea; the two butchers, who were just going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running about forty yards to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed them all; for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them all fall on an heap into the boat; though <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> two of them up again quickly: however, he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down {{in the bottom of the}} boat, as if he had been dead.|$|R
6000|$|I turned away--I felt {{indeed that}} I couldn't stay. She {{kept me from}} going to the hotel, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> might meet Linda coming back, which I was far from wishing to do, and showed me another way into the road. Then she turned round to meet her {{daughter}} and {{spend the rest of}} the morning there with her, spend it before the bright blue lake and the snowy crests of the Alps. When I reached Stresa again I found my young man had gone off to Milan--to see the cathedral, the servant said--leaving a message for me to the effect that, as he shouldn't be back for a day or two, though there were numerous trains, he had taken a few clothes. The next day I received telegram-notice that he had determined to go on to Venice and begged I would forward the rest of his luggage. [...] "Please don't come after me," [...] this missive added; [...] "I want to be alone; I shall do no harm." [...] That sounded pathetic to me, in the light of what I knew, and I was glad to leave him to his own devices. He proceeded to Venice and I re-crossed the Alps. For several weeks after this I expected to discover that he had rejoined Mrs. Pallant; but when we met that November in Paris <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> he had nothing to hide from me save indeed the secret of what our extraordinary friend had said to him. This he concealed from me then and has concealed ever since. He returned to America before Christmas--when I felt the crisis over. I've never again seen the wronger of my youth. About a year after our more recent adventure her daughter Linda married, in London, a young Englishman the heir to a large fortune, a fortune acquired by his father in some prosaic but flourishing industry. Mrs. Gimingham's admired photographs--such is Linda's present name--may be obtained from the principal stationers. I am convinced her mother was sincere. My nephew has not even yet changed his state, my sister at last thinks it high time. I put before her <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> next <b>saw</b> her the incidents here recorded, and--such is the inconsequence of women--nothing can exceed her reprobation of Louisa Pallant.|$|R
