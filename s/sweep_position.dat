50|$|The F-14's {{fuselage}} {{and wings}} {{allow it to}} climb faster than the F-4, while the twin-tail arrangement offers better stability. The F-14 is equipped with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling cannon mounted {{on the left side}} (unlike the Phantom, which was not equipped with an internal gun in the US Navy), and can carry AIM-54 Phoenix, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-9 Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles. The twin engines are housed in widely spaced nacelles. The flat area of the fuselage between the nacelles is used to contain fuel and avionics systems, such as the wing-sweep mechanism and flight controls, as well as weaponry since the wings were not used for carrying ordnance. By itself, the fuselage provides approximately 40 to 60 percent of the F-14's aerodynamic lifting surface depending on the wing <b>sweep</b> <b>position.</b> The lifting body characteristics of the fuselage allowed one F-14 to safely land after suffering a mid-air collision that sheared off {{more than half of the}} plane's right wing in 1991.|$|E

Four general aviation aircraft were chosen, i. e., a Cessna 172, Cessna 210, Cessna 441, and a 19 passenger commuter concept, to provide a range in flight velocity, engine horsepower, and gross weight.

40|$|The {{development}} of B- 1 aircraft rigid wind tunnel data {{for use in}} subsequent tasks of the Airloads Research Study is described. Data from the Rockwell International external structural loads data bank were used to generate coefficients of rigid airload shear, bending moment, and torsion at specific component reference stations or both symmetric and asymmetric loadings. Component stations include the movable wing, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and forward and aft fuselages.

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of B- 1 aircraft flight loads data {{for use in}} subsequent tasks of the Airloads Research Study is described. The basic intent is to utilize data acquired during B- 1 aircraft tests, analyze these data {{beyond the scope of}} Air Force requirements, and prepare research reports that will add to the technology base for future large flexible aircraft. Flight test data obtained during the airloads survey program included condition-describing parameters, surface pressures, strain gage outputs, and loads derived from pressure and strain gauges. Descriptions of the instrumentation, data processing, and flight load survey program are included. Data from windup-turn and steady yaw maneuvers cover a Mach number range from 0. 7 to 2. 0 for a wing <b>sweep</b> <b>position</b> of 67. 5 deg...|$|E
40|$|An {{aeroelastic}} {{analysis of}} the B- 1 aircraft was generated using the FLEXSTAB computer program. Relatively simple aerodynamic and structural models were employed. Theoretical wing and horizontal stabilizer airloads were compared to wind tunnel predictions and flight data measured during quasi-steady pitch maneuvers at Mach numbers of 0. 85 and 1. 2 with the wing in the 67. 5 degree full aft <b>sweep</b> <b>position.</b> The basic objective was to evaluate {{the usefulness of the}} FLEXSTAB program for pre-flight airloads analysis of large flexible aircraft. Significant aeroelastic increments were noted between rigid and flexible vehicle results. FLEXSTAB predicted airloads for the outer wing panel were in good agreement with measured data for both rigid airloads and elastic increments. FLEXSTAB results for the horizontal stabilizer were useful for defining general aeroelastic trends, but absolute load levels were not well predicted due to theoretical limitations and difficulties encountered in modelling the complex B- 1 configuration. Overall, the FLEXSTAB program is viewed as a useful integrated tool for static aeroelastic analysis in support of flight programs...|$|E

The V-shape morphing wings consist of a wing configuration that has two panels, an out-of-plane dihedral section and a horizontal section. An analysis of the aircraft turning dynamics shows that by manipulating the dihedral angles, of the V-shape wings, either by symmetric or asymmetric wing shape changes, can affect the turning capabilities of an aircraft to perform {{a variety of different}} missions depending on the importance of each of the turning performance measurements.
