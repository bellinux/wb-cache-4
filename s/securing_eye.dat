60|$|Only {{when she}} {{was alone in the}} train, <b>secure</b> from all <b>eyes,</b> did she give way to desperate weeping. The white smoke rolling past the windows was not more {{evanescent}} than her joy had been. For she had no illusions--it was over! From first to last--not quite a year! But even at this moment, not for all the world would she have been without her love, gone to its grave, like a dead child that evermore would be touching her breast with its wistful fingers.|$|R

He meditated what should be the language of his letter, which was not likely to be <b>secure</b> from the <b>eyes</b> of the few who could read it; and finally decided that English was the tongue known to the fewest readers, who, if they knew letters at all, were sure to be acquainted with French and Latin.|$|R
50|$|An orbital implant {{is placed}} after {{removal of the}} eye to restore volume to the eye socket and enhance {{movement}} or motility of an ocular prosthesis and eyelids. The eyeball is a slightly elongated sphere with a diameter of approximately 24 millimetres. To avoid a sunken appearance to the eye socket, an implant approximating this volume can be placed into {{the space of the}} removed <b>eye,</b> <b>secured,</b> and covered with Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva (the mucous membrane covering the natural sclera). Implants can be made of many materials with the most common being plastic, hydroxylapatite, metal alloy or glass.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a complete suite of in vitro and in vivo characterizations of an unpowered, biocompatible, parylene-based micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) pressure sensor for intraocular pressure (IOP) sensing. In situ mechanical {{responses of the}} sensors facilitate real-time pressure readouts without power consumption/ transduction. Two types of IOP sensors (high-sensitivity and needle-implantable) have been fabricated and characterized. In vitro and in vivo testing results have successfully demonstrated that the high-sensitivity IOP sensors can achieve mmHg-sensitivity pressure responses both on-bench and inside an enucleated porcine eye, while the needle-implantable IOP sensors can be implanted into a porcine eye through a needle and <b>secured</b> inside the <b>eye.</b> Using this new IOP sensor paradigm we can realize unpowered, real-time, faithful, and convenient IOP monitoring in glaucoma patients...|$|R
60|$|These {{three groups}} sat round the fire eyeing each other drily, {{and waiting for}} supper. Only one among them, one of the gentlemen {{belonging}} to the party of three, made advances towards conversation. Throwing out his lines for the Chief of the important tribe, while addressing himself to his own companions, he remarked, {{in a tone of}} voice which included all the company if they chose to be included, that {{it had been a long}} day, and that he felt for the ladies. That he feared one of the young ladies was not a strong or accustomed traveller, and had been over-fatigued two or three hours ago. That he had observed, from his station in the rear, that she sat her mule as if she were exhausted. That he had, twice or thrice afterwards, done himself the honour of inquiring of one of the guides, when he fell behind, how the lady did. That he had been enchanted to learn that she had recovered her spirits, and that it had been but a passing discomfort. That he trusted (by this time he had <b>secured</b> the <b>eyes</b> of the Chief, and addressed him) he might be permitted to express his hope that she was now none the worse, and that she would not regret having made the journey.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} no other place in the house so <b>secure</b> from prying <b>eyes</b> as this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would not see it. Why should he watch the hideous {{corruption}} of his soul? He kept his youth--that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh--those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} of an encircling silicone band through a rectus muscle {{is a rare}} postoperative complication associated with scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. In this present study, we describe what {{we believe to be}} the first reported case of a patient who experienced postoperative {{migration of}} an encircling silicone band through the rectus muscle, despite the band being surgically secured to the sclera in a scleral tunnel. A 58 -year-old man presented with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in his left eye. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the placement of an encircling silicone band, and the patient’s retina was successfully reattached. One year postoperatively, the encircling band became exposed on the nasal side of the conjunctiva next to the limbus without any symptoms. Two weeks later, the exposed encircling band was surgically removed without any complications. The findings of this study show that even when an encircling silicone band is surgically <b>secured</b> around the <b>eye,</b> periodic and careful postoperative follow-up examinations should be performed to ensure no migration of the band...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, striped bass {{populations in the}} Chesapeake Bay were healthy and Lefty Kreh pursued them {{on a regular basis}} along the lower Eastern shore of the bay. He and his fishing {{partners}} faced a rather common issue with the big streamer flies of the time—feathers fouling around the hook. Saddle hackles <b>secured</b> near the <b>eye</b> of the hook, as was the common practice of the time, had a tendency to twist and foul around the hook bend during retrieves. [...] Fouled flies rarely deceived the wily striped bass. Lefty’s goal as he put it was: [...] "I'm going to design a fly that won't foul on the cast! It will have a fish shape, but can be made in many lengths. You can vary the color combinations; it will also swim well but when lifted for the back cast it will be sleek and have little air-resistance." [...] The original Deceiver was all white and mimicked the prolific smelt that the Chesapeake Bay stripers foraged on.|$|R

"This is the way," [...] {{said the}} little girl; [...] "follow me, gin ye please, sir, but tak tent to your feet;" [...] and, with the daring agility which custom had {{rendered}} easy, she {{vanished from the}} platform on which she stood, and, by notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into the chasm which it overhung. Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security, prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall, his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side {{in a situation that}} appeared equally romantic and precarious. They were nearly opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered, and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool which received its fall. Both these tremendous points--the first shoot, namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was eddying and boiling in the other. They were so near this grand phenomenon that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the incessant roar. But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully narrow dimensions and uncertain footing. The upper end of the tree rested on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was <b>secured,</b> Morton's <b>eye</b> could not discover where. From behind the same projection glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth. When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his farther passage.|$|R
40|$|Smartphones, {{and other}} similar devices, are ideal for private activities: They are carried on the body and can be {{physically}} <b>secured</b> from prying <b>eyes.</b> They work anywhere. And they are not typically shared among family members or classmates, making them perfect for searching and exploring sensitive information — both via web search or through social information seeking. This paper validates these intuitions empirically, and builds on these observations to investigate the expression of sensitive information needs, such as inquiring about unplanned pregnancies, among users of mobile devices. We examine a large set of queries from the United States (4. 2 million), submitted to Yahoo! Answers, and compare these to the 6. 7 million queries submitted to Yahoo! search. Focusing on community question answering allows much richer analysis of the way information needs are expressed, setting our work apart form previous studies. For the first time, we empirically show that people prefer to express sensitive needs on mobile devices, as this manifests at both the lexical level and the semantic level, using a pre-defined taxonomy of topics. Further, we find that preference for mobile devices for sensitive topics holds true even when controlling for age and gender, which is facilitated by the large sample of users in our study (1. 5 million). In particular, we show that young users, especially females, {{are more likely to}} inquire on sensitive issues, {{and are more likely to}} do this from locations distant from their common place of web access. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date of mobile social information seeking, and is unique in terms of demographic diversity, the granularity of information needs examined, and the analysis of the location-dependence of sensitive information needs...|$|R
60|$|This is a Creature so officious, that 'twill {{be known}} to every one {{at one time}} or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will be intruding it self in every ones company, and so proud and {{aspiring}} withall, that it fears not to trample on the best, and affects {{nothing so much as a}} Crown; feeds and lives very high, and that makes it so saucy, as to pull any one by the ears that comes in its way, and will never be quiet till it has drawn blood: it is troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches his head, as knowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief against it, and that makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower place, and run behind a mans back, though it go very much against the hair; which ill conditions of it having made it better known then trusted, would exempt me from making any further description of it, did not my faithful Mercury, my Microscope, bring me other information of it. For this has discovered to me, by means of a very bright light cast on it, that it is a Creature of a very odd shape; it has a head shap'd like that exprest in 35. Scheme marked with A, which seems almost Conical, but is a little flatted on the upper and under sides, at the biggest part of which, on either side behind the head (as it were, being the place where other Creatures ears stand) are placed its two black shining goggle eyes BB, looking backwards, and fenced round with several small cilia, or hairs that incompass it, so that it seems this Creature has no very good foresight: It does not seem to have any eye-lids, and therefore perhaps its eyes were so placed, that it might the better cleanse them with its fore-legs; and perhaps this may be the reason, why they so much avoid and run from the light behind them, for being made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair, and thence probably their eye having a great aperture, the open and clear light, especially that of the Sun, must needs very much offend them; to <b>secure</b> these <b>eyes</b> from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it passes, it has two horns that grow before it, in the place where one would have thought the eyes should be; each of these CC hath four joynts, which are fringed, as 'twere, with small brisles, from which to the tip of its snout D, the head seems very round and tapering, ending in a very sharp nose D, which seems to have a small hole, and to be the passage through which he sucks the blood. Now whereas if it be plac'd on its back, with its belly upwards, as it is in the 35. Scheme, it seems in several Positions to have a resemblance of chaps, or jaws, as is represented in the Figure by EE, yet in other postures those dark strokes disappear; and having kept several of them in a box for two or three dayes, so that for all that time they had nothing to feed on, I found, upon letting one creep on my hand, that it immediately fell to sucking, and did neither seem to thrust its nose very deep into the skin, nor to open any kind of mouth, but I could plainly perceive a small current of blood, which came directly from its snout, and past into its belly; and about A there seem'd a contrivance, somewhat resembling a Pump, pair of Bellows, or Heart, for by a very swift systole and diastole the blood seem'd drawn from the nose, and forced into the body. It did not seem at all, though I viewed it a good while as it was sucking, to thrust more of its nose into the skin then the very snout D, nor did it cause the least discernable pain, and yet the blood seem'd to run through its head very quick and freely, so that it seems there is no part of the skin but the blood is dispers'd into, nay, even into the cuticula; for had it thrust its whole nose in from D to CC, it would not have amounted to the supposed thickness of that tegument, the length of the nose being not more then a three hundredth part of an inch. It has six legs, covered with a very transparent shell, and joynted exactly like a Crab's, or Lobster's; each leg is divided into six parts by these joynts, and those have here and there several small hairs; and at the end of each leg it has two claws, very properly adapted for its peculiar use, being thereby inabled to walk very securely both on the skin and hair; and indeed this contrivance of the feet is very curious, and could not be made more commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these requisite motions, of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head, then it is: for, by having the lesser claw (a) set so much short of the bigger (b) when it walks on the skin the shorter touches not, and then the feet are the same with those of a Mite, and several other small Insects, but by means of the small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round, and so with both claws take hold of a hair, in the manner represented in the Figure, the long transparent Cylinder FFF, being a Man's hair held by it.|$|R
