This correlation is widely interpreted as evidence that short-run inflation is determined by supply-side factors; however, we study whether, in addition to the inflation rate, monetary environment and aggregate demand explain this correlation. Using producer price index data, we show, first, that the positive and significant effect of relative-price change asymmetries on inflation is not robust with respect to various <b>indicators</b> of asymmetry. <b>Second,</b> <b>indicators</b> of aggregate demand and monetary environment affect the measures of asymmetries, which raises doubt about whether they can be interpreted as pure supply-side indicators. Third, in addition to the indirect effect via measures of asymmetries, demand and monetary factors directly affect inflation. Thus, we reject the claim that the recent disinflation/deflation period can be understood as primarily a supply-side phenomenon.

Because radios were costly {{and there were}} fewer radio users, {{it might be the}} case that no one else nearby used the same channel. A transmit and receive crystal had to be ordered for the desired channel frequency, then the radio had to be tuned or aligned to work on the channel. 12-volt mobile, tube-type radios drew several amperes on standby and tens-of-amperes on transmit. Equipment worked ideally when new. The performance of vacuum tubes gradually degraded over time.

40|$|The {{key issue}} is why {{one should be}} {{interested}} in biotechnology indicators and why {{we are interested in}} collecting them. From the OECD point of view, we are largely interested in them from a policy perspective. There are also two other reasons for collecting indicators. One is because they are very much of interest to academics who can use indicators to develop a longterm or deeper understanding of how economies are structured and how economies can change. <b>Second,</b> <b>indicators</b> are of interest to private investors who can use the information to guide their investment decisions in one particular technology or another. But many of the indicators for investors come too late. This has always been a problem for us because the investment community really wants to know what is happening right now and by the time our indicators are published we are usually several years too late. From a public policy perspective, we are still really in the world of expectations when we talk about biotechnology, particularly modern biotechnology. I think we are all familiar with these type of expectations, and variations of them show up in many difFerent reports from all around the world.

30|$|In {{addition}} to material flow and stock analyses, {{it is also}} important to quantitatively analyze the environmental efficiency of a city in order to assess the sustainability of a city’s metabolism (Zhang et al. 2015). Huppes and Ishikawa (2007) classified environmental efficiency into the following four indicators: (1) environmental productivity (i.e., production or consumption value per unit of environmental impact), (2) environmental intensity (i.e., environmental impact per unit of production or consumption value), (3) environmental improvement cost (i.e., cost per unit of environmental improvement), and (4) environmental cost-effectiveness (i.e., environmental improvement per unit of cost). In an environmental efficiency analysis based on the indicators shown above, for example, Browne et al. (2009) considered the <b>second</b> <b>indicator,</b> environmental intensity, and estimated the ratio of waste discharge to product consumption in Limerick, Ireland. In addition, Zhang et al.

However, these studies did not consider desirable outputs (GDP, etc.) generated by production activity and the factor inputs required the production activity and they did not analyze economic efficiency based on the input–output data.|$|E
40|$|Oak (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) is {{the most}} {{important}} species in French forestry. This wood is purchased by a great variety of firms, with prices that can range on a scale from 1 to 100. The main determinant of wood use is its quality and this depends on {{the presence or absence of}} defects in the wood. There is a great diversity of defects, but their importance for estimation of wood quality is not well-known. We have formulated a methodology for measuring the severity of defects in the final use of the wood. The measurement is based on two complementary indicators. The first one evaluated the drop in price caused by the presence of defects on individual logs sold during German sales of felled logs. As prices are linked not only to the severity of defects and as we did not come across a complete range of users or defects during this sale, a <b>second</b> <b>indicator</b> was constructed to complement the first one.
