Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

5000|$|But now let's try {{assuming}} that the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false. In order for a conditional to be false, the antecedent condition must be true while the consequent is false. So to assume the falsity of the sentence: [...] "if this <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true, then 'Germany borders China' is true," [...] we must assume that [...] "this <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true" [...] (the antecedent condition), and [...] "it is not true that Germany borders China" [...] (the consequent). Notice, though, that in assuming the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> false, we must assume that the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true.

500|$|The most noted {{prerogative}} {{power that}} affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements: the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi. Pardons may eliminate the [...] "pains, penalties and punishments" [...] from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised {{on the advice of}} the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations, a limited form of pardon where the <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof, as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley. Granting nolle prosequi is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales (or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) {{in the name of the}} crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not reviewable by the courts, as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents, and does not count as an acquittal; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date.|$|E
