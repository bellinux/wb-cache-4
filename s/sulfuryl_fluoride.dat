50|$|<b>Sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a greenhouse gas which is about 4000-5000 times more efficient in trapping infrared radiation (per kg) than carbon dioxide (per kg). It is important to note, however, that amounts of <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> released into the atmosphere (about 2000 metric tons per yr) are far lower than the amounts of CO2 released by hydrocarbon-burning vehicles, industry, and other processes (about 30 billion metric tons per year).

50|$|Inhalation of <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> is {{hazardous}} and {{may result}} in respiratory irritation, pulmonary edema, nausea, abdominal pain, central nervous system depression, numbness in the extremities, muscle twitching, seizures, and death. These high exposures occurred when people entered into structures illegally during fumigation or after insufficient aeration. Epidemiological studies showed that fumigation workers who used <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> showed neurological effects, which included reduced performance on cognitive tests and pattern memory tests, and reduced olfactory function.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> is unreactive toward molten sodium metal. [...] Similarly it is slow to hydrolyze, but {{eventually}} converts to sulfur trioxide.|$|E
5000|$|An {{inorganic}} nonaqueous solvent is {{a solvent}} other than water, {{that is not}} an organic compound. Common examples are liquid ammonia, liquid sulfur dioxide, sulfuryl chloride and <b>sulfuryl</b> chloride <b>fluoride,</b> phosphoryl chloride, dinitrogen tetroxide, antimony trichloride, bromine pentafluoride, hydrogen fluoride, pure sulfuric acid and other inorganic acids. These solvents are used in chemical research and industry for reactions that cannot occur in aqueous solutions or require a special environment.|$|R
50|$|Selenoyl {{fluoride}} is more reactive {{than its}} analogon <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride.</b> It {{is easier to}} hydrolyse and to reduce. It may react violently upon contact with ammonia.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 {{an elderly}} couple was exposed to <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> in their house already cleared for reentry.While the {{fumigation}} company opened windows and doors, and aerated the house with fans, <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> level was not measured. It was not detected when the air was sampled 12 days after aeration. The couple experienced weakness, nausea and shortness of breath that evening.

No. 81824- 1-AA) being more recently introduced gradually as its use is approved by individual states (in Florida circa 2004, but not in California until October 2006, for example). <b>Sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> has been marketed as a post-harvest fumigant for dry fruits, nuts, and grains under the trade name ProFume (U.S. EPA Reg. No. 62719- 376-AA). Most recently Drexel Chemical Company has registered Master Fume (EPA Reg. No. 19713-596-AA) for the structural market, competing against Vikane and Zythor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concentration}} is continuously monitored and maintained at the specified level using electronic equipment. Possible leakages are also checked by low range electronic detectors. Reentry {{to the home}} is allowed when the concentration level is at or below 5 ppm. <b>Sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> is colorless, and odorless however, during the fumigation process, a warning agent called chloropicrin is first released into the building {{to ensure that no}} occupants remain. Tent fumigation is the most effective treatment for the extermination of known and unknown infestations of wood-destroying insects. Heat is the only other approved method for whole structure treatment for termites in California. [...] <b>Sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> provides no protection from future infestations, although heavy re-infestation can take several years since drywood termites have slower growing colonies than ground termites.|$|E
50|$|In severe infestations a {{structure}} may be tented and fumigated with <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride.</b> This generally kills all the termites in the structure. Less extreme spot treatments {{can be made}} by drilling into the gallery and injecting pesticide, such as pyrethroids or imidacloprid. A gel bait containing hydramethylnon has been effective in experiments.|$|E
50|$|Chalcogens: Sulfur forms oxohalides in {{oxidation}} state +4, such as thionyl chloride, SOCl2 and {{oxidation state}} +6, such as <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride,</b> SO2F2, sulfuryl chloride, SO2Cl2, and thionyl tetrafluoride, SOF4. All are easily hydrolyzed. Indeed, thionyl chloride {{can be used}} as a dehydration agent as the water molecules are converted into gaseous products, leaving behind the anhydrous solid chloride.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> (also spelled sulphuryl fluoride) is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula SO2F2. It is an easily condensed gas and has properties {{more similar to}} sulfur hexafluoride than sulfuryl chloride, being resistant to hydrolysis even up to 150 °C. It is neurotoxic and a potent greenhouse gas, but is widely used as a fumigant insecticide to control termites.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, a 24-year-old man who {{allegedly}} entered an apartment {{that was being}} fumigated in Fremont, California to commit a burglary was exposed to <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> and chloropicrin and died shortly thereafter.

5000|$|Chloropicrin was {{manufactured}} {{for use as}} {{poison gas}} in World War I. In agriculture, chloropicrin is injected into soil prior to planting a crop in order to fumigate soil. Chloropicrin affects {{a broad spectrum of}} fungi, microbes, insects. It is commonly used as a stand alone treatment or in combination / co-formulation with methyl bromide and 1,3-Dichloropropene.Chloropicrin is used as an indicator and repellent while fumigating residences for insects with <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> which is an odorless gas.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can also}} be formed by heating sulfur hexafluoride with air to 400°. [...] This can happen when inhaling through a lit cigarette. Or the {{reaction}} of silver difluoride with thionyl fluoride at 200 degrees. [...] Another way to form it is by electrolyzing hydrogen fluoride with a solution of sulfur dioxide, which also made oxygen difluoride and <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride.</b> [...] Also thionyl chloride or thionyl fluoride electrolyzed with hydrogen fluoride produced even more of the gas.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{developed}} by the Dow Chemical Company, <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> is in widespread use as a structural fumigant insecticide to control drywood termites, particularly in warm-weather portions of the southwestern and southeastern United States and in Hawaii. Less commonly, {{it can also be}} used to control rodents, powderpost beetles, deathwatch beetles, bark beetles, and bedbugs. Its use has increased as a replacement for methyl bromide, which was phased out because of harm to the ozone layer. It is an alternative to the use of phosphine, which is acutely toxic.|$|E
5000|$|During application, the {{building}} is enclosed and filled with the gas {{for a period of}} time, usually at least 16-18 hours, sometimes as long as 72 hours. The building must then be ventilated, generally for at least 6 hours, before occupants can return. California regulations are such that the tent will be on for three to five days, which includes ventilation. In the US, <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride</b> must be transported in a vehicle marked with [...] "Inhalation Hazard 2" [...] placards. Most states require a license or certification for the individual applying the fumigant.|$|E

5000|$|In Europe the {{biocidal}} products {{are divided into}} different product types (PT), based on their intended use. These product types, 22 in total under the BPR, are grouped into four main groups, namely disinfectants, preservatives, pest control, and other {{biocidal products}}. For example, the main group [...] "disinfectants" [...] contains products {{to be used for}} human hygiene (PT 1) and veterinary hygiene (PT 3), main group [...] "preservatives" [...] contains wood preservatives (PT 8), the main group [...] "for pest control" [...] contains rodenticides (PT 14) and repellents and attractants (PT 19), while the main group [...] "other biocidal products" [...] contains antifouling products (PT 21). It should noted that one active substance can be used in several product types, such as for example <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>fluoride,</b> which is approved for use as a wood preservative (PT 8) as well as an insecticide (PT 18).|$|E
