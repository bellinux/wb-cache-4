50|$|The {{emulsion}} {{is attached}} to the film base with a transparent adhesive called the <b>subbing</b> <b>layer.</b> On the back of the base is a layer called the anti-halation backing, which usually contains absorber dyes or a thin layer of silver or carbon (called rem-jet on color negative stocks). Without this coating, light not absorbed by the emulsion and passing into the base would be partly reflected back at the outer surface of the base, re-exposing the emulsion in less focused form and thereby creating halos around bright points and edges in the image. The anti-halation backing can also serve to reduce static buildup, which could be a significant problem with early black-and-white films. The film, running through a motion picture camera at 12 in (early silent speed) to 18 in (sound speed) per second, could build up enough static electricity to cause sparks bright enough to record their own forms on the film; anti-halation backing solved this problem.|$|E

40|$|Sub bottom {{profilers}} {{are commonly}} used as mapping tool for the seafloor and sub-bottom structure in the upper few meters of the seafloor. Their recent enhanced performance in terms of resolution adds the potential to classify the sediment layers as well. In this research, the seabed surface and <b>sub</b> <b>layers</b> classification are investigated using model based techniques. The remote sediment classification technique of the seabed surface is achieved by matching the back scatter measurements to the predicted backscatter intensity of the model. The model simulates the returned signals of a monostatic sub bottom profiler operating at 100 kHz. The back scattering strength in the angle domain is estimated using the APL-UW backscattering model. The matching procedure was applied on averaged echo envelopes performed by Hilbert transform. The averaging process is essential to reduce the stochastic variability of the acquired data. The <b>sub</b> <b>layers</b> data was obtained by operating frequencies of (5, 10 and 15 kHz). The layer classification was achieved by estimating the geoacoustic parameters such as reflectivity and impedance contrast. Two techniques were investigated based on a reflectivity model. The first technique is an extension work of D. Simons [11] which aims to estimate the reflection coefficients via the received and transmitted energy ratio. The second technique is an implementation of a similar approach but applies the attenuation on the received frequency components {{in place of the}} nominal components. Both models accounted for energy propagation and its corresponding geometrical and sediment attenuation losses. The classification techniques were carried out to a dataset that was acquired in the Baltic Sea near Rostock in 2004. The acquired dataset is characterized by various bottom types such as mud, sand and coarse sediments. The general description of the acquired areas was used as a reference for the final results. Due to the lack of core samples, the classification was evaluated by comparing the results of the backscatter to the energy model. The results were consistent with the general description of the dataset. However, the matching process of the backscatter model is a cumbersome and very sensible to the envelope averaging technique. Averaging the reflected signals from the soft sediments has to ensure to preserve the surficial and volume back scatter information. On the other hand, at rough surfaces, the late arrivals are likely to be irregular reflections or noise that has to be averaged to avoid ambiguous results. The initial results of <b>sub</b> <b>layers</b> reflection models were consistent with the data description. However, due to the high resolution of the sub bottom profile, the computation procedure can easily fail by missing <b>sub</b> <b>layers.</b> In order to reduce the probability of missing layers, an overlapping window concept was implemented, where the reflection coefficients are estimated at shorter intervals. The methods investigated here leaves room for further optimization through model adjustment such as signal interference, backscatters and error propagation. GeomaticsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of fatigue cracks at fasteners in the <b>sub</b> <b>layers</b> of multi-layered aircraft structures can be problematic using conventional nondestructive testing methods. In this thesis {{the sensitivity of}} low frequency guided ultrasonic waves to detect these defects is studied. Guided ultrasonic waves typically have energy distributed through the thickness of such structures and allow for defect detection in all sub-layers, but have wavelengths larger than commonly used in bulk wave ultrasonic testing. The model aerospace multi-layered structure investigated consists of two aluminium plate strips adhesively bonded using a paste adhesive with a fastener hole. Guided waves were excited by placing piezoelectric (PZT) transducers {{on the surface of}} the structure. Experimentally the wave propagation and scattering was measured using a laser interferometer. The wave propagation was studied numerically using Semi-Analytical Finite-Element (SAFE) calculations and 3 D Finite Element (FE) simulations. Thickness and width mode shapes of the guided waves were identified from the SAFE simulations. By placing PZT discs across the width of the structure the excited exural wave modes could be controlled to an extent. The thickness mode shapes of these waves are similar to those in a large multi-layered plate structure. 3 D FE simulations predict a similar amplitude change due to a defect in these structures. Fatigue crack growth monitoring on tensile specimens was realized, measuring the amplitude at a single point. The measured changes in the amplitude of the ultrasonic signal due to a defect agree well with 3 D FE simulations. These investigations found that using low frequency guided ultrasonic waves defects through the thickness of a hidden <b>sub</b> <b>layer</b> can be detected from measurements on the undamaged, accessible layer...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{problems}} {{to be addressed in}} wireless sensor networks is the issues related to cross layer communication. Cross layer architecture shares the information across the layer, ensuring Quality of Services (QoS). With this shared information, MAC protocol adapts effective functionality maintenance such as route selection on changeable sensor network environment. However, time slot assignment and neighbour route selection time duration for cross layer have not been carried out. The time varying physical layer communication over cross layer causes high traffic load in the sensor network. Though, the traffic load was reduced using cross layer optimization procedure, the computational cost is high. To improve communication efficacy in the sensor network, a self-determined time slot based Cross-Layered Neighbour Route Discovery (C-LNRD) method is presented in this paper. In the presented work, the initial process is to discover the route in the sensor network using Dynamic Source Routing based Medium Access Control (MAC) <b>sub</b> <b>layers.</b> This process considers MAC layer operation with dynamic route neighbour table discovery. Then, the discovered route path for packet communication employs Broad Route Distributed Time Slot Assignment method on Cross-Layered Sensor Network system.
