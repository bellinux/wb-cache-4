5|$|The GHRS was a {{spectrograph}} {{designed to}} operate in the ultraviolet. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000. Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the University of California, <b>San</b> <b>Diego,</b> <b>and</b> Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS.|$|E
5|$|Yorktown {{stood out}} of Callao on 4 March 1892, steamed northward via <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> <b>and</b> San Francisco, and {{eventually}} arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California.

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1913, Yorktown conducted local operations out of <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> <b>and</b> San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of Mexican ports: Mazatlán, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, Yorktown served in Mexican waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, Yorktown continued her routine of patrols off Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego.|$|E

On December30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> <b>and</b> Poway supported the extension of SR56 to SR67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city. There are no plans to construct the portion of SR56 east of I-15.
