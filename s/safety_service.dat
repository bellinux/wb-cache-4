2500|$|On 1 July 1992, the Traffic <b>Safety</b> <b>Service</b> of the Ministry of Transport was {{merged with}} the Police. Up until that time, the Ministry of Transport and local councils had been {{responsible}} for traffic law enforcement. In 2001, the Police re-established a specialist road policing branch known as the Highway Patrol. Today the Police are responsible for enforcing traffic law, while local councils enforce parking regulations. In 2010, after some calls to split traffic enforcement again from standard police duties, {{it was decided that}} it would remain part of their duties, partly due to the public having shown [...] "enormous support" [...] for it remaining this way.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{differences}} of operation characters between ATC service and manufacturing industry, this paper researched {{the implication of}} <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> capability of ATC service by combining the latest implication of process capability and safety. And this paper established the elemental composition system made of <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> capability of ATC service, which is composed of 4 second-level elements and 15 third-level index. The 4 second-level index includes personnel capability, equipment capability, environmental capability and management capability. Considering the fuzziness of each index, the value of services capability of ATC service was confirmed by fuzzymatter- element analysis method and entropy weighting method. With evaluating ATC service of ATM division by this <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> capability model, it was indicated that this ATM division possessed strong <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> capability, personnel capability. Equipment capability was stronger than environment capability. It was conformed to the fact. The evidences showed that this <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> capability model for ATC service is practical, feasible, and conformed {{to the level of}} actual <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> capability of ATC service...|$|R

40|$|After the {{avalanche}} winter of 1999 in Switzerland, which caused 17  deaths and damage of over CHF  600  mill. in buildings and on roads, the project IFKIS, {{aimed at improving}} the basics of organizational measures (closure of roads, evacuation etc.) in avalanche risk management, was initiated. The three main parts of the project were {{the development of a}} compulsory checklist for avalanche <b>safety</b> <b>services,</b> a modular education and training course program and an information system for <b>safety</b> <b>services.</b> The information system was developed in order to improve both the information flux between the national centre for avalanche forecasting, the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF, and the local <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> {{on the one hand and}} the communication between avalanche <b>safety</b> <b>services</b> in the communities on the other hand. The results of this project make a valuable contribution to strengthening organizational measures in avalanche risk management and to closing the gaps, which became apparent during {{the avalanche}} winter of 1999. They are not restricted to snow avalanches but can also be adapted for dealing with other natural hazard processes and catastrophes...|$|R
