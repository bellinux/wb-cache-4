On a time-domain plot, a <b>sferic</b> may appear as a single high-amplitude spike in the time-domain data.

Since the attenuation of VLF waves is smaller for west- to east propagation and during the night, thunderstorm activity up to distances of about 10000 km can be observed for signals arriving from the west during night time conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Lightning {{discharges}} radiate {{the bulk}} of their electromagnetic energy in the very low frequency (VLF, 3 - 30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3 - 3000 Hz) bands. This energy, contained in impulse-like signals called radio atmospherics or sferics, is guided for long distances by multiple reflections from the ground and lower ionosphere. This suggests that observed <b>sferic</b> waveforms radiated from lightning and received at long distances (> 1000 kin) from the source stroke contain information {{about the state of the}} ionosphere along the propagation path. The focus of this work is on the extraction of nighttime D region electron densities (in the altitude range of •- 70 - 95 km) from observed VLF sferics. In order to accurately interpret observed <b>sferic</b> characteristics, we develop a model of <b>sferic</b> propagation which is based on an existing frequency domain subionospheric VLF propagation code. The model shows that the spectral characteristics of VLF sferics depend primarily on the propagation path averaged ionospheric D region electron density profile, covering the range of electron densities from [...] • l 0 ø to l 03 cm- 3 To infer the D region density from observed VLF sferics, we find the electron density profile that produces a modeled <b>sferic</b> spectrum that most closely matches an observed <b>sferic</b> spectrum.

40|$|We aim {{to provide}} a novel {{approach}} to processing and interpretation of natural fields electromagnetic (EM) data through automated interpretation of <b>sferic</b> source parameters provided by the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). Accurate <b>sferic</b> time stamps obtained from WWLLN are hypothesised to improve signal to noise ratios (SNR) through precisely controlled extraction of sferics with amplitudes both above and below observed noise levels in time series audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) measurements. Averaging of extracted data of equal source moment increases signal {{in proportion to the}} square root of the number of averages whilst decreasing noise since data between <b>sferic</b> events is inconsequential and can be discarded. Knowledge of source characteristics allows further improvements to data quality to be achieved through discrimination of <b>sferic</b> sources that do not meet the required assumptions of AMT. Since <b>sferic</b> propagation occurs primarily along great circle paths, antipodal sferics propagating around the reverse side of the earth can in principle be extracted for inclusion as additional signal. These increases in SNR afford reduced measurement time and an increase in data quality, leading to more cost effective exploration. Use of source information is unique amongst existing approaches to time domain AMT. The existing approaches are often limited in application to signals with amplitudes well above the noise level. ARMIT sensors developed at RMIT are sensitive to natural EM fields generated by world wide lightning activity and can measure up to 40 sferics per second.

40|$|Abstract. Observations of {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) radio atmospherics (sferics), the transient electromagnetic fields radiated by lightning discharges, are {{used to determine the}} current moment waveforms of vertical lightning discharges. In order to extract this information the propagation of radio atmospherics from source to receiver must be modeled accurately, especially in view of the important role played by the D and E regions of the ionosphere at these long (> 200 km) wavelengths. We model broadband ELF <b>sferic</b> waveforms by adapting a single-frequency ELF propagation code to calculate an ELF propagation impulse response under the assumption of horizontal ionospheric homogeneity, with which we extract the source lightning current waveform from an observed ELF <b>sferic</b> waveform using a deconvolution method based on linear regularization. Tests on modeled sferics indicate that the method is accurate and relatively insensitive to noise, and we demonstrate the application of the technique with a sprite-associated <b>sferic.</b> Since ELF sferics can often be observed many thousands of kilometers from the source discharge, the technique developed here represents a powerful new method of remotely sensing lightning current waveforms. 1...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thunderstorms {{and prior}} grass pollen counts were {{investigated}} {{as predictors of}} daily hospital admissions for asthma in England. This study was motivated by reports {{in the literature of}} spectacular asthma epidemics associated with thunderstorms, particularly in the grass pollen season. METHODS: Asthma admissions for two age groups (0 - 14 years and 15 and over) were measured using the Hospital Episodes System (HES) in the 14 regional health authorities (RHAs) in England. Thunderstorms were measured daily in each RHA using densities of sferics (lightning flashes). Relative asthma excesses for moderate positive and exceptionally high <b>sferic</b> densities, with or without previous high grass pollen counts, were measured using log linear autoregression [...] allowing for weekly, seasonal, and longer term background variation [...] and pooled over RHAs by calculating geometric means. RESULTS: Relative risks from all RHAs were pooled to form geometric means. Exceptional <b>sferic</b> densities were associated with a relative excess risk of around 25 % in both age groups. Moderate <b>sferic</b> densities were associated with a smaller excess, statistically significant in the two age groups taken together. In five RHAs in which grass pollen counts were available, high pollen counts for the previous five days were associated with an amplification of the excess associated with thunderstorms. CONCLUSION: Very large <b>sferic</b> densities are associated with moderate rises in hospital admissions for acute asthma. However, typical thunderstorm days are not associated with spectacular asthma epidemics of the scale previously reported in the literature. Thunderstorm-associated excesses are amplified after a run of high pollen counts. ...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{technique}} {{to estimate the}} distance of the lightning strikes d with a single VLF electromagnetic wave receiver at a single station is described. The technique is based on the recording of oscillatory waveforms of the electric fields of sferics. Even though the process of estimating d using the waveform is a rather classical one, a novel and simple procedure for finding d is proposed in this paper. The procedure adopted provides two independent estimates of {{the distance of the}} stroke. The accuracy of measurements has been improved by employing high speed (333 ns sampling rate) signal processing techniques. GPS time is used as the reference time, which enables us to compare the calculated distances of the lightning strikes, by both methods, with those calculated from the data obtained by the World-Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), which uses a multi-station technique. The estimated distances of the lightning strikes (77), whose times correlated, ranged from ~ 3000 &ndash; 16 250 km.

Wave {{normal and}} Poynting vector {{measurements}} from the Cassini radio and plasma wave instrument (RPWS) {{are used to}} examine the propagation characteristics of various plasma waves during the Earth flyby on August 18, 1999. Using the five-channel waveform receiver (WFR), the wave normal vector is determined using the Means method for a lightning-induced whistler, equatorial chorus, and a series of low-frequency emissions observed while Cassini was in the magnetosheath. The Poynting vector for these emissions is also calculated from the five components measured by the WFR. The propagation characteristics of the lightning-induced whistler were found to be consistent with the whistler wave mode of propagation, with propagation antiparallel to the magnetic field (southward) at Cassini.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to use radio emissions from lightning, known as `radio atmospherics' or `sferics', to study the temporal and spatial variation of the lower ionosphere, a layer of ionized atmosphere beginning at ∼ 70 km altitude (D-region). Very Low Frequency (VLF, 3 - 30 kHz) radio waves are a useful diagnostic for lower ionospheric monitoring due to their reflection from this region and global propagation. Traditionally, the lower ionosphere has been sensed using single-frequency VLF transmitters allowing for analysis of a single propagation path, as {{there are only a}} small number of transmitters. A lightning stroke, however, releases an intense amount of impulsive broadband VLF radio energy in the form of a <b>sferic,</b> which propagates through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Lightning is globally distributed and very frequent, so a <b>sferic</b> is therefore also a useful diagnostic of the D-region. This is true both for ambient or quiet conditions, and for ionospheric perturbations such as solar flare x-ray bursts. Lightning strokes effectively act as separate VLF transmitting sources. As such, they uniquely provide the ability to add a spatial component to ionospheric remote sensing, in addition to their broadband signature which cannot be achieved with man-made transmitters. We describe the methods of processing in detail. As an example, we analyze a solar flare during which time there is a significant change in magnitude and frequency content of sferics. This disturbance varies with distance from the source, as well as time. We describe the methods of processing in detail, and show results at Palmer Station, Antarctica for both a quiet and active solar day. M. S...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{temporal}} {{variability of}} the nighttime D region is well known, but its inaccessibility {{means that the}} time scales, magnitudes, and sources for that variability are not well understood. We probed the ionospheric D region by measuring the high-power broadband very low frequency (VLF) signals launched by lightning and propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. We analyzed broadband <b>sferic</b> data of July and August 2005 recorded by our sensors located near Duke University by comparing measured <b>sferic</b> spectra to model results and extracted the height of an assumed exponential electron density profile for each measurement. The measured nighttime D region electron density profile heights showed large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and relatively stable behaviors on others. The measured hourly average heights in 260 h ranged between 82. 0 and 87. 2 km, with a mean value of 84. 9 km and {{a standard deviation of}} 1. 1 km. The maximum variation in the 5 h period was around just above 4. 0 km and the maximum variation in the 1 h period was around 1. 3 km, with sharper gradients observed over shorter time periods. We also observed spatial variability as large as 2. 0 km over 5 ° latitudes on some nights and no spatial variability on others. On some nights, the temporal variability exhibited a close correlation with the occurrence rate of lightning discharges under the probed region. This suggests that the direct energy coupling between lightning discharges and lower ionosphere can be a significant source of the D region variability. However, on other nights, the measured height temporal variability showed weak to no correlation with local lightning, displaced lightning (as would be expected for lightning-induced electron precipitation), or geomagnetic activities. These measurements suggest that nighttime D region variability may be driven by many sources. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|E
40|$|The high power, {{broadband}} {{very low}} frequency (VLF, 3 [...] 30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3 [...] 3000 Hz) electromagnetic waves generated by lightning discharges and propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide {{can be used to}} measure the average electron density profile of the lower ionosphere (D region) across the wave propagation path due to several reflections by the upper boundary (lower ionosphere) of the waveguide. This capability makes it possible to frequently and even continuously monitor the D region electron density profile variations over geographically large regions, which are measurements that are essentially impossible by other means. These guided waves, usually called atmospherics (or sferics for short), are recorded by our sensors located near Duke University. The purpose of this work is to develop and implement algorithms to derive the variations of D region electron density profile which is modeled by two parameters (one is height and another is sharpness), by comparing the recorded <b>sferic</b> spectra to a series of model simulated <b>sferic</b> spectra from using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) code. In order to understand the time scales, magnitudes and sources for the midlatitude nighttime D region variations, we analyzed the <b>sferic</b> data of July and August 2005, and extracted both the height and sharpness of the D region electron density profile. The heights show large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and the relatively stable behavior on others. Statistical calculations indicate that the hourly average heights during the two months range between 82. 0 km and 87. 2 km with a mean value of 84. 9 km and a standard deviation of 1. 1 km. We also observed spatial variations of height as large as 2. 0 km over 5 degrees latitudes on some nights, and no spatial variation on others. In addition, the measured height variations exhibited close correlations with local lightning occurrence rate on some nights but no correlation with local lightning or displaced lightning on others. The nighttime profile sharpness during 2. 5 hours in two different nights was calculated, and the results were compared to the equivalent sharpness derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) models. Both the absolute values and variation trends in IRI models are different from those in broadband measurements. Based on <b>sferic</b> data similar to those for nighttime, we also measured the daytime D region electron density profile variations in July and August 2005 near Duke University. As expected, the solar radiation is the dominant but not the only determinant source for the daytime D region profile height temporal variations. The observed quiet time heights showed close correlations with solar zenith angle changes but unexpected spatial variations not linked to the solar zenith angle were also observed on some days, with 15 % of days exhibiting regional differences larger than 0. 5 km. During the solar flare, the induced height change was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the X-ray fluxes. During the rising and decaying phases of the solar flare, the height changes correlated more consistently with the short (wavelength 0. 5 - 4 Å), rather than the long (wavelength 1 - 8 Å) X-ray flux changes. The daytime profile sharpness during morning, noontime and afternoon periods in three different days and for the solar zenith angle range 20 to 75 degrees was calculated. These broadband measured results were compared to narrowband VLF measurements, IRI models and Faraday rotation base IRI models (called FIRI). The estimated sharpness from all these sources was more consistent when the solar zenith angle was small than when it was large. By applying the nighttime and daytime measurement techniques, we also derived the D region variations during sunrise and sunset periods. The measurements showed that both the electron density profile height and sharpness decrease during the sunrise period while increase during the sunset period. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are {{impulsive}} (similar to 1 ms) but intense {{sources of}} gamma-rays associated with lightning activity and typically detected via low orbiting spacecrafts. We present the first catalog of precise (< 30 km error) TGF source locations, determined via ground-based detection of ELF/VLF radio atmospherics (or sferics) from lightning discharges, which enables precise geolocation of lightning locations. We present {{the distribution of}} source-tonadir distances, established due to effects of Compton scattering on the escaping photons. We find that TGFs occur in coincidence with the lightning discharge, but with a few ms variance, and that a detectable <b>sferic</b> at long distances is nearly always present. The properties of TGF-associated sferics and their connection to multiple-peak TGFs are highly variable and inconsistent, and are classified into two categories...|$|E
