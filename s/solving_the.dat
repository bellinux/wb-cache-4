5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent <b>solving</b> <b>the</b> problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. This is known as parallel slowdown.|$|E
