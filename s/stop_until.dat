5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|Earnhardt, {{who began}} {{the race in}} thirty-second, had moved up ten {{positions}} to twenty-second by lap 22. Two laps later, Bowyer passed Montoya for second position. Scott Speed spun sideways and collided with the wall four laps later, causing the first caution of the race. On lap 28, Robby Gordon moved into the lead for one lap, delaying his pit <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> lap 29. Once the race resumed, Bowyer regained the lead followed by McMurray in second. McMurray led the next lap, but Bowyer reclaimed the lead on lap 32. Three laps later, Kyle Busch, in seventh place, collided with the wall, but escaped with minor damage. A collision involving Ambrose and Menard occurred on lap 39 and prompted the second caution.|$|E

5|$|The French {{opened fire}} on the forts of Salé at 10:00a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated {{instantly}} with forty batteries of artillery weapons. An hour into the confrontation, the batteries in Salé were destroyed, and the artillery in Rabat were damaged to a level that they became almost useless. The French fire intensified, but at 3:30p.m., the damaged batteries {{were removed from the}} city by Moroccan forces; however, resistance did not <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> 5:00p.m. Sané and Gomer, lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle, while Henri IV continued its barrage on the city until 7:00a.m. the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Citadel was {{the last}} German {{strategic}} offensive on the Eastern Front, {{and one of the}} largest battles in history, involving more than four million men. By the time the Wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 July 1943, the Soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one. Walther Model was in command of the northern pincer, with the Ninth Army, while Manstein's Army Group South formed the southern pincer. Both armies were slowed as the tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared Soviet defensive lines. After five days of fighting Model's advance was stopped, with the Ninth Panzers suffering 25,000 casualties. By 13 July Model's forces were being drawn away towards Orel, where the Soviet army had launched Operation Kutuzov. Manstein's forces were able to penetrate the Soviet lines, causing heavy casualties. He reached, but did not enter or capture, Prokhorovka, his first major objective, on 11 July, inflicting serious Soviet losses in the resulting Battle of Prokhorovka. However, on 13 July Hitler called off the failed Kursk offensive; the Allies had landed in Sicily, so he issued the order for a withdrawal. Manstein protested; he felt that the Soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in the area, and {{he did not want to}} <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> all his own reserves had been committed. Hitler, however, insisted on calling off the operation. Although Soviet casualties were indeed heavy, modern historians discount the possibility of a successful German continuation of the offensive.|$|E

The Ulvin area received a station, at first named Ulvin and later Morskogen. It featured a passing loop and served as a <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> 1 June 1980. The entire line from Eidsvoll to Hamar originally ran entirely without tunnels.|$|E
25|$|The {{tentative}} deal {{to develop}} the $6.2 billion Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador was negotiated by the Progressive Conservative government in November 2010. The Liberal Party opposes the deal, saying it is bad for the province because it will increase the province's debt and will see electricity rates increase for consumers.

During that time the architects, in collaboration with teachers and students from the Bauhaus, designed the interiors and furniture of the main building. They also recommended to Benscheidt various designers for the publicity campaign of Fagus. From 1923 to 1925, the architects were also {{working on a new}} expansion, but this never took place.

25|$|The western {{defenses}} were {{pierced by}} two gates: the Lenba (the main gate) and a secondary one, {{closer to the}} beach. By that stage there were scarcely 300 Spaniards left, most of which had no fireams. Carleill ordered Sergeant-Major Powell to assault the secondary gate with a storming party, while the lieutenant-general led {{the rest of his}} men towards the Lenba. Both English columns broke into a run and charged at the push of pike. Following a mingled fierce hand-to-hand fight, the Spanish were swept on through both gates and then melted away, after which neither column met with any serious opposition. The stormers did not <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> the two English columns met in the Plaza.|$|E

Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.|$|E

25|$|HTP is {{normally}} stable until {{it comes in}} contact with a catalyst. It then expands 5,000 times in volume extremely rapidly, acting as an oxidiser, generating large volumes of steam and oxygen. The oxygen is combined with kerosene fuel in the torpedo engine to propel the missile {{at a very high}} speed and greater range than conventional torpedoes. Investigators concluded that the leaking HTP had catalytically decomposed when it came in contact with copper commonly found in the bronze and brass used to manufacture Kursks torpedo tubes. The resulting overpressure ruptured the torpedo's kerosene fuel tank and caused an explosion that was registered as a weak seismic event on detectors hundreds of kilometres away. Once the HTP begins oxidizing, it is impossible to <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> the fuel is exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Wilder took 18-year-old Sheryl Bonaventura captive in Grand Junction, Colorado, on March 29. They {{were seen}} {{together}} at a diner in Silverton where they told staff they were heading for Las Vegas with a stop in Durango on the way. The next day they were seen at the Four Corners Monument, after which Wilder checked into the Page Boy Motel in Page, Arizona. Wilder shot and stabbed Bonaventura to death around March 31 near the Kanab River in Utah, but her body was not found until May 3. Wilder also killed 17-year-old Michelle Korfman, an aspiring model, who disappeared from a Seventeen magazine cover model competition at the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas on April 1. A photograph was taken of Wilder stalking her at the competition. Her body remained undiscovered near a southern California roadside rest <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> May 11, and was not identified until mid-June via dental X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Chemotaxis {{is defined}} as a passage of an {{organism}} toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In D. discoideum, the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and <b>stop</b> <b>until</b> the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.|$|E
