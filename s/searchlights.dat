5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, {{in the hope of}} reducing the risk of being seen in enemy <b>searchlights</b> or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using <b>searchlights.</b> The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against <b>searchlights,</b> but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, the castle's defences {{had become}} {{obsolete}} once again {{due to the}} development of torpedo boats and superior breech-loading guns. In response, five 6-pounder quick-firing guns and <b>searchlights</b> were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and, between 1899 and 1901, the east battery was converted to hold breech-loading guns at a cost of £16,670.|$|E
5|$|Commandos {{on board}} would then {{disembark}} and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations, <b>searchlights</b> and gun emplacements. The destroyer {{would then be}} blown up. At {{the same time the}} RAF would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them failed because of heavy clouds and fog and very few bombers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Searchlight</b> was, consequently, {{divided into}} three main bodies: <b>Searchlight</b> magazine, the monthly anti-fascist and anti-racist magazine; <b>Searchlight</b> Information Services (SIS), a {{research}} and investigatory body which briefs governments, politicians, journalists, and the police; and, finally, <b>Searchlight</b> Educational Trust (SET), a charity devoted to teaching the negative aspects of racism and fascism. SIS and SET later joined the Hope not Hate campaign and are no longer associated with <b>Searchlight</b> magazine.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1940 the battalion, {{along with}} all other RE <b>searchlight</b> units, was {{transferred}} to the Royal Artillery (RA), becoming 73rd (Kent Fortress) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment, and its AA companies were termed <b>searchlight</b> (S/L) [...] batteries.|$|R

5|$|The GDR {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} security measures along its Baltic coastline to hinder escape attempts. Camping and access to boats was severely limited and 27 watchtowers were built along the Baltic coastline. If a suspected escape attempt was spotted, high-speed patrol boats would be dispatched to intercept the fugitives. Armed patrols equipped with powerful mobile <b>searchlights</b> monitored the beaches.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Air Force mobilized on 28August 1939, {{three days}} before Germany {{attacked}} Poland and initiated World War II, with 96fighter and 121observation aircraft; by some accounts the country possessed only eight antiaircraft <b>searchlights.</b> Of the 21units of the Swiss Air Force, only three were judged combat-ready and five were not yet equipped with aircraft. The Air Force relied on 40single-seat interceptors for first-line air defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap <b>searchlights</b> which were shot {{out as soon}} as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E

50|$|<b>Searchlight</b> BBS is a {{bulletin}} board system (BBS) developed in 1985 by Frank LaRosa for the TRS-80. LaRosa formed a company, <b>Searchlight</b> Software, through which he marketed and sold <b>Searchlight</b> BBS. In 1987, LaRosa expanded the software and sold it as shareware written for the PC in Pascal (using Turbo Pascal). The features of <b>Searchlight</b> BBS included a full screen text editor, a remote DOS shell, and file transfer via the XMODEM protocol. <b>Searchlight</b> BBS rapidly grew in popularity, and appeared frequently in Boardwatch magazine and at BBS conventions across the United States. Eventually, <b>Searchlight</b> BBS supported FidoNet, ZMODEM, Internet e-mail and telnet connectivity.|$|R
5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types. These were sometimes placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture. <b>Searchlights</b> were installed at the coast to illuminate the sea surface and the beaches for artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|Z39s sensor suite {{included}} a FuMO 21 radar, which {{was placed on}} the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the foremast <b>searchlights.</b> She also had several other radars, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on her masthead, and a FuMO 63 Hohentwei. She also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray deflector.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown {{scraping}} the bottom twice. Each time she was able to pull free, and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness. They had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01:22 the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined <b>searchlights</b> of both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented, the canvas cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the <b>searchlights.</b> A SS-6 sonar was fitted in June 1940, but proved to be ineffectual.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commemorative}} ceremony on the 25th {{anniversary of the}} massacre in 2014, the city of Montreal entrusted the technical aspect of the ceremony to the multimedia production company Moment Factory, who installed fourteen <b>searchlights</b> representing the 14 victims of the massacre on the esplanade of Mount Royal. The light beams turned skyward first appeared shortly after four o'clock, the hour when the attack had started 25 years earlier.|$|E

50|$|It {{was based}} on the use of a {{powerful}} carbon-arc <b>searchlight</b> to dazzle and confuse enemy troops. A demonstration had shown that the use of a vehicle mounted <b>searchlight</b> both disoriented the units facing it and masked activities behind the <b>searchlight.</b>|$|R
5|$|On both ships, {{two more}} quadruple sets of 1.1in guns were added {{in place of}} two <b>searchlights</b> amidships. After she was torpedoed in 1942, North Carolina had these removed and ten quadruple sets of 40mm guns added. Fourteen were present by June 1943, while a fifteenth mount was added {{on top of the}} third main turret that November. Washington {{retained}} its six 1.1in quads until the middle of 1943, when ten quad 40mm guns replaced them. By August, she had fifteen. The two ships carried these through to the close of the war.|$|E
5|$|One of Speer's first {{commissions}} after Troost's {{death was}} the Zeppelinfeld stadium—the Nürnberg parade grounds seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda masterpiece Triumph of the Will. This huge work {{was able to}} hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, {{many of whom were}} overweight. Speer surrounded the site with 130 anti-aircraft <b>searchlights.</b> Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that stood the test of time.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{could see}} no ships other than seven or eight burning MLs. He then {{realised}} that the landing places at the Old Mole and {{the entrance to the}} basin had both been recaptured by the Germans. There was nothing more they could do for the Commandos, so they headed out to sea. On their way they were continuously illuminated by German <b>searchlights</b> and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing ML 270, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats.|$|E

5|$|Szent István {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several <b>searchlights</b> were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk {{in front of the}} mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E
5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat <b>searchlights.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Germans had around 5,000 {{troops in}} the {{immediate}} area of St Nazaire. The port was defended by the 280th Naval Artillery Battalion {{under the command of}} Kapitän zur See Edo Dieckmann. The battalion was composed of 28 guns of various calibres from 75mm to 280mm railway guns, all positioned to guard the coastal approaches. The heavy guns were supplemented by the guns and <b>searchlights</b> of the 22nd Naval Flak Brigade under the command of Kapitän zur See Karl-Konrad Mecke.|$|E
50|$|A secret trial (the 'Newark Experiment' in April 1941) having {{shown that}} women were capable of {{operating}} heavy <b>searchlight</b> equipment and coping with conditions on the often desolate <b>searchlight</b> sites, members of the ATS began training at Rhyl to replace male personnel in <b>searchlight</b> regiments. At first they were employed in <b>searchlight</b> Troop headquarters, but in July 1942 the 26th (London Electrical Engineers) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment, Royal Artillery became the first 'Mixed' regiment, with seven Troops of ATS women posted to it, forming the whole of 301 Battery and half of 339 Battery. In October that year the all-women 301 Battery {{was transferred to the}} new 93rd (Mixed) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment, the last <b>searchlight</b> regiment formed during World War II, which by August 1943 comprised about 1500 women out of an establishment of 1674. Many other <b>searchlight</b> and anti-aircraft regiments on Home Defence followed, freeing men aged under 30 of medical category A1 for transfer to the infantry. Several Heavy Anti-Aircraft regiments deployed to North West Europe with 21st Army Group in 1944-45 were 'Mixed' regiments.|$|R
50|$|All TA <b>searchlight</b> {{units were}} {{transferred}} to the Royal Artillery (RA) in August 1940, the two 6th Essex units being designated 64th (Essex Regiment) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment, RA (TA), and 65th (Essex Regiment) <b>Searchlight</b> Regiment, RA (TA) respectively. They retained their Essex Regiment cap badges and buttons.|$|R
