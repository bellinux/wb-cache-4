5|$|The {{majority}} of the 65 numbered tombs in the Valley of the Kings {{can be considered as}} minor tombs, either because at present they have yielded little information or because the results of their investigations were only poorly recorded by their explorers. Some have received very little attention or were only cursorily noted. Most of these tombs are small, often consisting of only a single burial chamber accessed by a shaft or staircase with a corridor or a series of corridors leading to the chamber. But some are larger, multiple-chambered tombs. These minor tombs served various purposes: some were intended for burials of lesser royalty or private burials, some contained animal burials, and others apparently never received a primary burial. In many cases these tombs also served secondary functions, and later intrusive material has been found related to these <b>secondary</b> <b>activities.</b> While some of these tombs have been open since antiquity, the majority were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries during the height of exploration in the valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from <b>secondary</b> <b>activities.</b> Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

It had its offices at a Luftwaffe barracks built during the German {{occupation}} and its aircraft based in a German hangar {{from the same}} period.

30|$|If {{the student}} chooses {{to carry out}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> on his tour, the system of models simulates, after the choice of the type of activity, the place in which the same one can be undertaken. For {{simulating}} the choice dimension related to the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> spatial distribution, a hierarchical Logit model is proposed, in which there are two alternatives at the higher hierarchical level: the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> carried out inside the university area, the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> undertaken outside the university area (Fig.  1). On the lower hierarchical level are located the traffic zones in which the campus and urban area have been separated. As a rough guide, the university area has been separated in N traffic zones, while the urban area in M traffic zones. Further zones could be considered outside the urban area.|$|R

In another joint-venture with the Lotus Group which was closed in December 2008, Youngman assembled Lotus and Europestar branded cars in Guangdong for the Domestic Chinese and export market.

With the Lotus joint venture, Youngman is engaged in <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> as the exclusive importer of American automotive brand ZAP!.

25|$|During the 1980s, the Japanese economy shifted its {{emphasis}} from primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> (notably agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) to processing, with telecommunications and computers becoming increasingly vital. Information {{became an important}} resource and product, central to wealth and power. The rise of an information-based economy was led by major research in highly sophisticated technology, such as advanced computers. The selling and use of information became very beneficial to the economy. Tokyo became a major financial center, {{home to some of}} the world's major banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and the world's largest stock exchange, the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Even here, however, the recession took its toll. In 1992, the Nikkei 225 stock average began the year at 23,000 points, but fell to 14,000 points in mid-August before leveling off at 17,000 {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Military gliders {{were used}} mainly during the Second World War for {{carrying}} troops and heavy equipment (see Glider infantry) to a combat zone. These aircraft were towed {{into the air}} and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g. C-47 Dakota, or by bombers that had been relegated to <b>secondary</b> <b>activities,</b> e.g. Short Stirling. Once released from the tow near the target, they landed as close to the target as possible. The advantage over paratroopers were that heavy equipment could be landed and that the troops were quickly assembled rather than being dispersed over a drop zone. The gliders were treated as disposable leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood, though a few were retrieved and re-used. By the time of the Korean War, transport aircraft had also become larger and more efficient so that even light tanks could be dropped by parachute, causing gliders to fall out of favor.|$|E

30|$|The {{systematic}} utilities for {{the different}} traffic zones are expressed {{as a function of}} an indicator of availability, varying according to the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> and place in which is made, inside or outside the campus. Specifically, as indicators of availability for the inside zones the same variable considered in the primary destination choice model are used, while for the outside zones some additional variables are defined. In particular, if the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> effected outside the campus is to study with other students, the indicator is represented by the number of university students living in the zone; if the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> is entertainment, accompaniment of person or personal business, the indicator is represented by the number of employees in the private and public services in the zone.|$|R
50|$|Secondary time is {{the time}} spent on <b>secondary</b> or side <b>activities.</b> When {{drinking}} coffee while working, drinking coffee would be the <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> and would be considered necessary time even though the primary activity, working, would be classified as contracted time. Unlike primary time, secondary time does not necessarily add up to 24 hours each day because there {{may not always be}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>activity.</b> It is also important to note that including secondary time may make it appear that a person spends more than 24 hours a day on activities due to the overlapping nature primary and secondary time.|$|R
500|$|The game {{does not}} {{explicitly}} have a story, {{but has a}} narrative line that connects the disparate worlds. There are 17 worlds, each with unique characters, a single primary goal, and <b>secondary</b> <b>activities.</b> In [...] "Lamp Lighting", the player activates lights while flying past silhouettes, and each light adds a new layer of music. The player flies {{through a series of}} color-changing circles to access the next world. In Sponge Land, an underwater world, the player gathers fish to swim alongside the Long Mover. The player can collect seeds in the Kite Village. Another level lets the player create shapes in the sky by flying past stars. The worlds are presented in flat colors with no outlines, and all worlds are unlocked {{from the beginning of the}} game. The credits roll once a hidden multicolored serpent is freed from each level.|$|E
500|$|A third {{problem is}} the {{complexity}} of domestic labor and the issues of separating unpaid work categories. Time use studies now take multitasking issues into account, separating primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>activities.</b> However, not all studies do this, and even those that do may {{not take into account}} [...] "the fact that frequently several tasks are done simultaneously, that tasks overlap, and that the boundaries between work and relationships are often unclear.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} overall. The Edge reviewer greatly enjoyed the deceptively simple Bravely and Default mechanics despite a run time they described as [...] "bloated". Fitch likewise enjoyed the gameplay mechanics, but found the social elements {{to be less}} successful despite not actively irritating him. Moore praised the battle system {{and implementation of the}} Job system, although the latter necessitated grinding to unlock its full value. He also praised the ability to adjust encounter rates and battle speed, and positively noted the social features as engaging <b>secondary</b> <b>activities.</b> Marchiafava found that the battle and Job systems held up throughout the entire game, and like Moore found the social systems enjoyable. Nair was positive about the depth and strategy the gameplay opened up, despite criticizing the amount of options increasing {{the amount of time spent}} in battle. Both Evans and Robertson praised the battle system and general gameplay, with Robertson calling the former innovative within the genre. Riendeau found that the battle system's depth and quality gave her feelings of elation when she successfully killed opponents, but also saw the need to grind for experience emerging during the later stages of the game negatively impacted the experience. Parkin referred to the Bravely and Default systems as the game's [...] "central - and brilliant - conceit". Fuller, while finding the microtransactions a [...] "waste of money", he greatly enjoyed the battle mechanics and multiple user-friendly features. Halestorm shared the positive opinions of other reviewers on the battle system, alongside praising the game's amount and quality of content. Many reviewers positively compared the gameplay and style to earlier Final Fantasy games. Multiple western reviewers commented negatively on the repetitive late-game section.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the {{changing}} nature of American federal labor law has made the Mackay Radio doctrine pernicious. When Mackay Radio was announced in 1938, unions were allowed to engage in many kinds of <b>secondary</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>activities</b> are actions directed at businesses and individuals not directly connected to the labor dispute. These include secondary picketing, sympathy strikes, [...] "hot cargo" [...] strikes (continuing to work but refusing to handle products which come from the struck business), secondary boycotts, and picketing of a struck employer's suppliers or customers. The closed shop was also legal at the time, helping unions ensure that only workers who were bound by union rules were hired. But the Taft-Hartley Act (enacted in 1947) and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act, enacted in 1959) outlawed these tactics. Under the federal labor law legal regime which existed in 1937, the hiring of permanent replacement workers was not necessarily destructive of the collective bargaining relationship. But under the post-1959 labor law regime, Mackay Radio has turned (as some scholars conclude) collective bargaining into collective begging.|$|E
2500|$|Mchinji is {{described}} as [...] "dirt poor" [...] by The Times. Harvesting rain-fed agriculture is the main occupation in Mchinji, with groundnuts, tobacco, soya and casava beans being the primary cash crops. Maize, yams, velvet beans and pumpkin are prominent food crops. During the dry season, <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> are pursued, such as brick-making, beer brewing, bicycle repair and carpentry. Due to a food shortage partially caused by the region's many droughts and partially caused by poor government planning, a UNDP rural development program was established in Mchinji.
