The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians have a different conception of time, often estimating dates by comparisons with the occurrence of other events.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{arguments}} of the `reference- dependent' theory of consumer choice we assume that a retailer's discount of a manufacturer's <b>suggested</b> retail price changes consumers' demand. We can show that the producer benefits from <b>suggesting</b> a retail price. If consumers are additionally sufficiently `loss averse', e. g. consumers' disappointment from higher than <b>suggested</b> retail prices is sufficiently high, the producer can force the retailer to take the <b>suggested</b> price in equilibrium and thus capture some of the retailer's profits.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} <b>suggested</b> prices in the Dutch retail market for gasoline. <b>Suggested</b> prices are announced by large oil companies with the suggestion that retailers follow them. There {{are at least two}} competing rationales for the existence of <b>suggested</b> prices: they may either help retailers translate changes in international gasoline spot market prices into retail prices, or they may coordinate retail prices. We show that there is, next to the international spot market prices, additional information in <b>suggested</b> prices that explains retail prices. Therefore, we conclude that <b>suggested</b> prices help to coordinate retail prices. gasoline markets, collusion, price setting, <b>suggested</b> prices...|$|R

50|$|Since Anna O.'s {{treatment}} in the 1800s, current research has <b>suggested</b> many illnesses she might have suffered from. Many believe that the illness was not psychological as Freud <b>suggested</b> but either neurological or organic. Medical researcher Elizabeth Thornton, after interviewing many of Freud's early patients, <b>suggested</b> that Anna O. had suffered from tuberculous meningitis. Others have <b>suggested</b> it was encephalitis, a form of brain inflammation. Many have also <b>suggested</b> that she suffered from a form of temporal lobe epilepsy since many of her symptoms, including imagined smells, are common symptoms of types of epilepsy.|$|R
5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence <b>suggests</b> it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist <b>suggests</b> the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence <b>suggests</b> a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E
