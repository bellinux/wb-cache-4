5000|$|Eli Terry {{possibly}} {{made three}} tower clocks. His first, made entirely of wood, {{was a gift}} to the 1832 Terryville congregational church. Terry donated most of the funds to build this church, and his final donation was his famous clock tower movement. In 1964 the church burned to the ground, ironically, the only piece of the church spared was the clock dial, which was supposedly untouched by the fire. according to a local [...] "The dial was spared, sold to an antique dealer, and is probably still in existence." [...] Eli Terry donated another clock movement to Plymouth Congregational church, which was rebuilt from the beams of the old church in 1833, or 1834. Terry also donated most of the funds for this church. The Plymouth congregational church clock movement is a different design than the Terryville clock. The Plymouth clock is still working today, now powered by electricity (because the pendulum, was inaccurate, and sometimes caused the clock to stop), and gravity (the clock has large weights with a multi-step pulley system, that goes up into the steeple, back down through a shaft in the walls, past the meeting room, and below the basement by a few feet, a total of about 50 feet, to keep time for about nine to ten days), it is the last working Eli terry tower clock, wound every Sunday, before, or after Sunday mass. It {{is believed to be the}} last working wooden movement tower clock. Terry also supposedly donated another movement to the Thomaston Congregational church. The Thomaston congregational church movement oddly consists of three metal gears, along with wooden gears in the mix. The Thomaston congregational church clock was removed in 1977, and was donated to the American Clock and Watch Museum in Bristol. There it was working for a number of years until recently; for it needs slight restoration. The Thomaston church clock was replaced by an all gravity metal escapement, built by Seth Thomas factory in the late 1800s. It is believed that Terry donated the Thomaston clock, however, Seth Thomas helped Terry in its design. The Terryville clock was a single movement clock, unlike the Thomaston and Plymouth clocks, which have a frame on top of the movement, to hold different <b>shaped</b> <b>gears</b> and fans, and rely on two movements, Plymouth has a wooden, and brass movement, Thomaston had a wooden, and a wooden movement. The new Seth Thomas church movement is visible to the public in the entrance lobby of the Thoamston Congregational Church.|$|E

Analysis of static technological dimensional pitch size chain of wheels being cut is performed.

40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> process. <b>Gear</b> <b>shaping</b> is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> machine. To predict cutting forces in <b>gear</b> <b>shaping,</b> the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in <b>gear</b> <b>shaping,</b> the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in <b>gear</b> <b>shaping.</b> The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{machining}} methods, such as <b>gear</b> hobbing, <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> and <b>gear</b> milling, etc, {{are commonly}} used for cutting machining of gear tooth profile, which cannot meet huge machining demand of gears to a certain extent.

In the seventh mode shape, interfaces between pads 2 and 3, 4 and 5 remains fixed and interfaces between pads 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis causing every single pad to execute motion in accordance to first mode shape. The eight mode <b>shape</b> of draft <b>gear</b> is oscillation of all draft pad interfaces about lateral (z) axis. This oscillation results in fifth mode shape for all pads.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} <b>gear</b> <b>shape.</b> <b>Gears</b> are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The gear hobbing process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of gear hobbing and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of gear hobbing. Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R
