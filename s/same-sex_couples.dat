5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to <b>same-sex</b> <b>couples,</b> weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of <b>same-sex</b> <b>couples</b> adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by <b>same-sex</b> <b>couples</b> had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by <b>same-sex</b> <b>couples</b> was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), <b>same-sex</b> <b>couples</b> could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E
