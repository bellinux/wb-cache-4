25|$|The Pelagornithidae had {{extremely}} thin-walled bones widely pneumatized {{with the}} air sac extensions of the lungs. Most limb bone fossils are very much crushed for that reason. In life, the thin bones and extensive pneumatization enabled the birds to achieve large size while remaining below critical wing loadings. Though 25kg/m2 (5lb/ft2) {{is regarded as the}} maximum wing loading for powered bird flight, there is evidence that bony-toothed birds used dynamic soaring flight almost exclusively: the proximal end of the humerus had an elongated diagonal shape that could hardly have allowed for the movement necessary for the typical flapping flight of birds; their weight thus cannot be easily estimated. The attachment positions for the muscles responsible for holding the upper arm <b>straightly</b> outstretched were particularly well-developed, and altogether the anatomy seems to allow for an ability of holding the wings rigidly at the glenoid joint unmatched by any other known bird. This is especially prominent in the Neogene pelagornithids, and less developed in the older Paleogene forms. The sternum had the deep and short shape typical of dynamic soarers, and bony outgrowths at the keel's forward margin securely anchored the furcula.|$|E
25|$|Foch, {{claiming}} that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig {{would have preferred to}} have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch’s demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was “almost insubordinate” in asking Haig whether he or “Marechal Foch” was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig’s command train that evening and concurred with the decision. Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticised but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng’s attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army’s attack on Currie’s advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be “a desperate enterprise” for the BEF to overreach itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he “spoke to Foch quite <b>straightly,</b> and let him understand that I was responsible for the handling of the British forces”. Foch {{had little choice but to}} agree, and interfered little with Haig’s decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig’s command.|$|E
60|$|They {{sent for}} him at once, and Ralegh <b>straightly</b> taxed him with it. Sir Lewis as <b>straightly</b> {{admitted}} it, and when King thereupon charged him with deceit he showed no anger, but only the profoundest grief. He sank into a chair, and took {{his head in his}} hands.|$|E

60|$|Dartrey {{laid his}} hand upon his guest's shoulder. In his sombre dinner garb, with low, turned-down collar and flowing black tie, his grey-black beard {{cut to a}} point, his high forehead, his <b>straightly</b> brushed-back hair, which still betrayed its {{tendency}} to natural curls, he looked {{a great deal more}} like an artist of the dreamy and aesthetic type than a man who had elaborated a new system of life and government.|$|E
6000|$|They {{decided to}} ask Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson what {{consequences}} would {{in his opinion}} follow a withdrawal. They visited him at ten o'clock at night, and put the question <b>straightly.</b> Thus appealed to, the Governor declared that in that event 'loyalists' would be disgusted and discouraged; the results as regards the Dutch would be grave, many, if not most, would very likely rise, believing us to be afraid ... and {{the effect on the}} natives, of whom there are some 750,000 in Natal and Zululand, might be disastrous.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{fingered the}} letter, {{lingering}} {{over it and}} scrutinizing the writing {{in a way that}} was not his wont. How characteristic, was his thought, as he studied the boyish scrawl--clear to read, painfully, clear, but none the less boyish. The clearness of it reminded him of her face, of her cleanly stencilled brows, her <b>straightly</b> chiselled nose, the very clearness of the gaze of her eyes, the firmly yet delicately moulded lips, and the throat, neither fragile nor robust, but--but just right, he concluded, an adequate and beautiful pillar for so shapely a burden.|$|E
60|$|When the waggon had creaked {{to the top}} of the rise, for, of course, {{there was}} no road, and the Kaffirs were {{beginning}} to unyoke the hungry oxen, Rachel, who was riding with her father, sprang from her horse and ran to it to help her mother to descend. She was now a tall young woman, full of health and vigour, strong and <b>straightly</b> shaped. Mrs. Dove, frail, delicate, grey-haired, placed her foot upon the disselboom and hesitated, for to her the ground seemed far off, and the heels of the cattle very near.|$|E
60|$|Let {{those who}} would blame them pause awhile. Why not? They had kept the faith. They had denied {{themselves}} and run <b>straightly</b> down the path of duty. But the compacts of life end with life. No man may bargain for the beyond; even the marriage service shrinks from it. And now that hope had gone and life was at its extremest ebb, why should they not take their joy before they passed to the land where, perchance, such things will be forgotten? So it seemed to them; if indeed they were any longer capable of reason.|$|E

Have you seen him with your own eyes, or do you repeat from hearsay? Speak, man, or you stand on the penance-stool in the chapter-house this very hour!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was older}} than Ralph by some three or four years. Her face was round but worn, and {{expressed}} that tolerant but anxious good humor which is the special attribute of elder sisters in large families. Her pleasant brown eyes resembled Ralph's, save in expression, for whereas he seemed to look <b>straightly</b> and keenly at one object, {{she appeared to be}} in the habit of considering everything from many different points of view. This made her appear his elder by more years than existed in fact between them. Her gaze rested {{for a moment or two}} upon the rook. She then said, without any preface: ...|$|E
60|$|Then secondly--you are to {{note that}} with all the certain rightness of its {{material}} fact, this sculpture still is the Sculpture of a Dream. Ilaria is dressed as she was in life. But she never lay so on her pillow! nor so, in her grave. Those straight folds, <b>straightly</b> laid as a snowdrift, are impossible; known by the Master to be so--chiseled with a hand as steady as an iron beam, and as true as a ray of light--in defiance of your law of Gravity to the Earth. That law prevailed on her shroud, and prevails on her dust: but not on herself, nor on the Vision of her.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} I heard a woman's cry of distress. Glancing round {{the stem of}} the tree, I {{perceived}} that it proceeded from the young and elegant lady before mentioned, whom, in our interest concerning the road- waterer, we had forgotten. She was riding her machine steadily and <b>straightly</b> through a drenching shower {{of water from the}} hose. She appeared to be too paralysed either to get off or turn her wheel aside. Every instant she was becoming wetter, while the man with the hose, who was either drunk or blind, continued to pour water upon her with utter indifference. A dozen voices yelled imprecations upon him, but he took no heed whatever.|$|E
60|$|His {{struggle}} with his temper {{had gone on}} steadily, and he hoped he had won a final victory over it. Mr. Porson had been unwearied in his kindnesses, and often took Ned for {{an hour in the}} evening in order to push him forward, and although he avoided talking about his home life the boy felt that he could, in case of need, pour out his heart to him; but, indeed, things had gone better at home. Mrs. Sankey was just as indisposed as ever to take any share whatever in the trouble of housekeeping, but as Abijah was perfectly capable of keeping the house in order without her instructions things went on smoothly and <b>straightly</b> in this respect.|$|E
60|$|Gradually, charmed {{like the}} simple people about him, Stephen became {{lost in the}} fascination of the scene. Suddenly confronted at a booth in a public fair with {{the heir to the}} English throne, who but one of her own kind might have carried it off so well, have been so {{complete}} a mistress of herself? Since, save for a heightened color, Virginia gave no sign of excitement. Undismayed, forgetful of the admiring crowd, unconscious of their stares until--until the very strength of his gaze had compelled her own. Such had been the prophecy within him. Nor did he wonder because, in that multitude of faces, her eyes had flown so <b>straightly</b> homeward to his.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would much}} rather that he had spoken wrathfully, when I <b>straightly</b> gave him my opinion of the boy, who is growing up an ill-conditioned cub. It {{would have been more}} honest. I hate to see a man smile, when I know that he would fain swear. I like my cousin Celia, and I like her little {{daughter}} Ciceley, who takes after her, and not after John Dormay; but I would that the fellow lived {{on the other side of}} England. He is out of his place here, and, though men do not speak against him in my presence, knowing that he is a sort of kinsman, I have never heard one say a good word for him.|$|E

60|$|Katharine laughed, {{with more}} gayety, {{as it seemed}} to Mary, than she could {{properly}} account for. What was she laughing at? At them, presumably. Katharine had risen, and was glancing hither and thither, at the presses and the cupboards, and all the machinery of the office, as if she included them all in her rather malicious amusement, which caused Mary to keep her eyes on her <b>straightly</b> and rather fiercely, {{as if she were}} a gay-plumed, mischievous bird, who might light on the topmost bough and pick off the ruddiest cherry, without any warning. Two women less like each other could scarcely be imagined, Ralph thought, looking from one to the other. Next moment, he too, rose, and nodding to Mary, as Katharine said good-bye, opened the door for her, and followed her out.|$|E
60|$|Laughter lurked in {{the mouth}} corners and eye-corners, and there were cheek lines about the mouth {{that would seem to}} have been formed by laughter. Equally strong, however, every line of the face that meant blended things carried a notice of surety. Dick Forrest was sure-- sure, when his hand reached out for any object on his desk, that the hand would <b>straightly</b> attain the object without a fumble or a miss of a {{fraction}} of an inch; sure, when his brain leaped the high places of the hog cholera text, that it was not missing a point; sure, from his balanced body in the revolving desk-chair to the balanced back-head of him; sure, in heart and brain, of life and work, of all he possessed, and of himself.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strange}} drive. For Denham it was without {{exception}} the most unpleasant he had ever taken. His only wish was to go as <b>straightly</b> and quickly as possible to Cheyne Walk; but it soon appeared that Mrs. Hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by interposing various errands of her own. She stopped the carriage at post-offices, and coffee-shops, and shops of inscrutable dignity where the aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends; and, catching sight of the dome of St. Paul's above the irregular spires of Ludgate Hill, she pulled the cord impulsively, and gave directions that Anderson should drive them there. But Anderson had reasons of his own for discouraging afternoon worship, and kept his horse's nose obstinately towards the west. After some minutes, Mrs. Hilbery realized the situation, and accepted it good-humoredly, apologizing to Ralph for his disappointment.|$|E

And if thou wilt have an answer, here it is, put <b>straightly,</b> as thy question. Charmion, outside the matter of my duty and my vows, thou art naught to me!--nor for all thy tender glances will my heart beat one pulse more fast! Hardly art thou now my friend--for, of a truth, I scarce can trust thee. But, once more: beware!

6000|$|The view of {{the cathedral}} from the rear is, as usual, very fine. A small garden behind it masks its base; but you descend the hill to a large place de foire, {{adjacent}} to a fine old public promenade which is known as Les Jacobins, a sort of miniature Tuileries, where I strolled {{for a while in}} rectangular alleys destitute of herbage and received a deeper impression of vanished things. The cathedral, on the pedestal of its hill, looks considerably farther than the fair-ground and the Jacobins, between the rather bare poles of whose <b>straightly</b> planted trees you may admire it at a convenient distance. I admired it till I thought I should remember it (better than the event has proved), and then I wandered away and looked at another curious old church, Notre-Dame-de-la-Couture. This sacred edifice made a picture for ten minutes, but the picture has faded now. I reconstruct a yellowish-brown façade and a portal fretted with early sculptures; but the ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would if}} I could omit {{one thing that}} I must tell you here, because it goes {{so close to the}} very core of all this book has to convey. I wish I could leave it out altogether. I wish I could simplify my story by {{smoothing}} out this wrinkle at least and obliterating a thing that was at once very real and very ugly. You see I had at last struggled up to a sustaining idea, to a conception of work and duty to which I could surely give my life. I had escaped from my pit so far. And it was natural that now with something to give I should turn not merely for consolation and service but for help and fellowship to that dear human being across the seas who had offered them to me so <b>straightly</b> and sweetly. All that is brave and good and as you would have me, is it not? Only, dear son, that is not all the truth.|$|E
60|$|For two {{or three}} hours longer the moon poured its light through the empty air. Unbroken by clouds it fell <b>straightly,</b> and lay almost like a chill white frost over the sea and the earth. During these hours the silence was not broken, and the only {{movement}} was caused by the movement of trees and branches which stirred slightly, and then the shadows that lay across the white spaces of the land moved too. In this profound silence one sound only was audible, the sound of a slight but continuous breathing which never ceased, although it never rose and never fell. It continued after the birds had begun to flutter from branch to branch, and could be heard behind the first thin notes of their voices. It continued all through the hours when the east whitened, and grew red, and a faint blue tinged the sky, but when the sun rose it ceased, and gave place to other sounds.|$|E

Whence, then, come those images of fear rising on the horizon of the soul like some untimely moon upon a midday sky? Who grants them power to stalk so lifelike from Memory's halls, and, pointing to their wounds, thus confront the Present with the Past? Are they, then, messengers? Does the half-death of sleep give them foothold in our brains, and thus upknit the cut thread of human kinship? That was Cæsar's self, I tell thee, who but now stood at my side and murmured through his muffled robe warning words of which the memory is lost to me.
