40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{experimental}} results for monitoring long distance WDM communication links using a line monitoring system suitable for legacy optically amplified long-haul undersea systems. This monitoring system {{is based on}} setting up a simple, passive, low cost high-loss optical loopback circuit at each repeater that provides {{a connection between the}} existing anti-directional undersea fibres, and can be used to define fault location. Fault location is achieved by transmitting a short pulse <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> along with the WDM data signals where a portion of the overall signal is attenuated and returned to the transmit terminal by the loopback circuit. A special receiver is used at the terminal to extract the weakly returned <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> where each <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> is received at different times corresponding to different optical repeaters. Therefore, the degradation in any repeater appears on its corresponding <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> level. We use a recirculating loop to simulate a 4600 km fibre link, on which a high-loss loopback supervisory system is implemented. Successful monitoring is accomplished through the production of an appropriate <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> at the terminal that is detected and identified in a satisfactory time period after passing through up to 45 dB attenuation in the loopback circuit. © 2012 Elsevier B.

50|$|This {{was also}} an in-band system but, instead of using multifrequency signals for digits, it used four 35 ms pulses of tone, {{separated}} by 35 ms of silence, to represent digits in four-bit binary code, with 2400 Hz as a '0' and 2040 Hz as a '1'. The <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> used the same two frequencies, but each <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal</b> started with both tones together (for 150 ms) followed, without a gap, by a long (350 ms) or short (100 ms) period of a single tone of 2400 Hz or 2040 Hz.

40|$|<b>Supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to make low-dimensional data representations, like those learned by mixture and topic models, more interpretable and useful. We propose a framework for training latent variable models that explicitly balances two goals: recovery of faithful generative explanations of high-dimensional data, and accurate prediction of associated semantic labels. Existing approaches fail to achieve these goals due to an incomplete treatment of a fundamental asymmetry: the intended application is always predicting labels from data, not data from labels. Our prediction-constrained objective for training generative models coherently integrates loss-based <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> while enabling effective semi-supervised learning from partially labeled data. We derive learning algorithms for semi-supervised mixture and topic models using stochastic gradient descent with automatic differentiation.

50|$|Line {{signaling}} {{is concerned}} with conveying information {{on the state of}} the line or channel, such as on-hook, off-hook (answer supervision and disconnect supervision, together referred to as supervision), ringing current (alerting), and recall. In the middle 20th century, supervision signals on long-distance trunks in North America were usually inband, for example at 2600 Hz, necessitating a notch filter to prevent interference.

40|$|To achieve fast link failure {{detection}} in all-optical networks, monitoring-cycles (m-cycles) {{are introduced}} at the optical layer {{to reduce the}} number of required monitoring devices (or monitors). Each m-cycle is equipped with a monitor and a pair of optical transceivers to transmit an optical <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal.</b> A set of m-cycles can be found to form a cycle cover of the network. If a link fails, optical <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> inside the m-cycles passing through this link will be disrupted, and the corresponding monitors will alarm due to Loss of Light (LoL). This gives an alarm code to localize the failed link. The accuracy of the failure localization is measured by localization degree, and the amount of monitoring resources required is measured by the number of cycles/monitors, cover length, and monitoring wavelength requirement. The best known m-cycle construction algorithm HST [11] adopts a spanning tree-based approach. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm M 2 -CYCLE to construct a cycle cover consisting of a set of minimum-length m-cycles (or m 2 -cycles). We prove that M 2 -CYCLE achieves the same localization degree as the spanning tree-based approach, but requires less amount of monitoring resources no matter how the spanning tree is generated. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis, and show that the monitoring resources required by M 2 -CYCLE are dramatically cut down. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} studies a principal-supervisor-agent model in which a privately informed supervisor is susceptible to collusion. We explore how the supervisory information helps the principal to extract information rent from the agent when the informational asymmetry between the supervisor and agent results in inefficient collusion on their part. The optimal collusion-proof mechanism is such that the principal receives expected payoff that {{is as high as}} in the direct supervision benchmark in which the principal publicly observes the <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal.</b> Under some parameters, the principal can extract more rent from the agent, and the equilibrium is more efficient. The second chapter analyzes an informed principal problem in which the principal privately observes the <b>supervisory</b> <b>signal.</b> The principal 2 ̆ 7 s expected payoff is strictly higher than the case in which the signal is publicly observed. This is a common feature of the independent type cases, except that this result holds even if preferences are quasi-linear. Unlike in the independent case, efficiency is constrained by the principal 2 ̆ 7 s incentive problem. The third chapter considers a collusion formation process in which the supervisor proposes the side mechanism. We show that the informed principal problem within the coalition does not affect the optimal design of the grand mechanism. We then consider the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to exit once she obtains new information. The principal {{can take advantage of the}} implicit information revealed by the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s exit decision. The direct supervision benchmark outcome can be attained by a simple mechanism if the coalition cannot write a contract based on the exit decision, or the principal can publicly observe the timing of the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s exit decision. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Engineering {{approaches}} to stereo typically use explicit {{search for the}} best matching between left and right sub-windows, which involves a high cost of search and unstable performance {{in the presence of}} binocular inconsistency and weak texture. The brain does not seem to conduct explicit search in the V 1 and V 2 cortex. But the mechanisms that the brain employs to integrate binocular disparity into 3 -D perception is still largely a mystery. The work presented in this paper focuses on an important issue of integrated stereo: How the same cortex can perform recognition and perception by generating a topographic disparity-tuning map using top-down connections. As top-down connections with objectclass <b>supervisory</b> <b>signals</b> result in topographic class maps, the model presented here clarifies that stereo can be processed by a unified in-place internal representation. ...|$|R

We consequently learn to predict shape in an emergent canonical (view-agnostic) frame along with a corresponding pose predictor.

We also demonstrate the applicability of our framework in a realistic setting which {{is beyond the scope}} of existing techniques: using a training dataset comprised of online product images where the underlying shape and pose are unknown.

Similar to comparison-based sorting algorithms, we propose to extract features from all frame pairs and aggregate them to predict the correct order. As sorting shuffled image sequence requires {{an understanding of the}} statistical temporal structure of images, training with such a proxy task allows us to learn rich and generalizable visual representation.
