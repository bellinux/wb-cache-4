40|$|An {{air drop}} test program was {{conducted}} {{as part of}} the development of a decelerator subsystem for recovering the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster. This development test program consisted of six drops performed over the period from June 1977 to September 1978 at a parachute test center in California. The testing concerned a 48, 000 -lb drop test vehicle released from the B- 52 mothership. The drop test program is described and pertinent test results are discussed. Data include <b>snatch</b> <b>loads,</b> inflation characteristics, peak inflation and disreef loads, and drag performance. Performance characteristics of the drogue parachute and the main parachute are established...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{nonlinear}} model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for a winch servo motor to overcome the sudden peak tension in the lifting wire caused by a lumped-mass payload {{at the beginning of}} a lifting off or a lowering operation. The crane-wire-payload system is modeled in 3 degrees of freedom with the Newton-Euler approach. Direct multiple shooting and real-time iteration (RTI) scheme are employed to provide feedback control input to the winch servo. Simulations are implemented with MATLAB and CaSADi toolkit. By well tuning the weighting matrices, the NMPC controller can reduce the <b>snatch</b> <b>loads</b> in the lifting wire and the winch loads simultaneously. A comparative study with a PID controller is conducted to verify its performance...|$|R
40|$|All real {{physical}} structures, when {{subjected to}} loads or displacements, behave dynamically. The additional inertia forces, from Newton’s second law, are {{equal to the}} mass times the acceleration. If the loads or displacements are applied very slowly then the inertia forces can be neglected and a static load analysis can be justified. Hence, dynamic analysis is a simple extension of static analysis. Many developments {{have been carried out}} {{in order to try to}} quantify the effects produced by dynamic loading. Examples of structures where it is particularly important to consider dynamic loading effects are the construction of tall buildings, long bridges under wind-loading conditions and buildings in earthquake zones, etc. Typical situations where it is necessary to consider more precisely the response produced by dynamic loading are vibrations due to equipment or machinery, impact load produced by traffic, <b>snatch</b> <b>loading</b> of cranes, impulsive load produced by blasts, earthquakes or explosions. So it is very important to study the dynamic nature of structures. ...|$|R

5000|$|Cochran, by now a Lieutenant Colonel, and John R. Alison (former deputy {{commander}} of the 75th Fighter Squadron) were picked by General Hap Arnold as co-commanders of the 1st USAAF Air Commando Group. [...] (While there an informal agreement existed between Cochran and Alison over who was effectively Commander Cochran and Deputy Commander Alison, this arrangement was unofficial. To this day, USAF records indicate Col Cochran and Col Alison as 'co-commanders'.) The 1st Air Commando, among other missions, was assigned the task of supporting Allied Long Range Penetration Groups, of the British Army's Chindits, invading Japanese-held Burma. Some of these forces were designated to fly in by towed gliders; all required resupply by regular airdrops during their missions, as well as air support. Under Cochran's command, the 1st Air Commando's C-47 pilots perfected the tactic of <b>snatching</b> <b>loaded</b> gliders from small areas of ground cleared of jungle vegetation into the air using stretchable nylon ropes, all while flying at 15 to 30 feet using breaks in the jungle canopy.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} experimental {{measurements of}} the interaction of a taut moored floating body, representing a wave energy converter in survivability mode, with extreme waves. Focussed wave groups, based initially on NewWave theory, are used to generate the extreme waves, with crest amplitude exceeding the mooring׳s design capacity. Two data sets are presented and discussed. In the first the influence of wave steepness on model response and mooring load is investigated using non-breaking focussed wave groups. In the second the influence of wave breaking location is investigated using a plunging breaking wave. Both data sets exhibit <b>snatch</b> <b>loading</b> as {{the extension of the}} mooring is exceeded. The magnitude of this loading is not found to be strongly dependent on wave steepness, while the following motion response of the body is. Breaking location has a much greater effect than wave steepness on the magnitude of the mooring load, while significant influence of the body motion and displacement on the mooring load is demonstrated. Evidence is provided that the use of individual focussed wave groups is inadequate to assess fully the extreme loads experienced by a taut moored WEC due to the demonstrated dependence of mooring load on the body׳s motion and displacement...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of mooring cables for marine structures is scale-dependent, and perfect dynamic similitude between full-scale prototypes and small-scale physical model tests {{is difficult to}} achieve. The best possible scaling is here sought {{by means of a}} specific set of dimensionless parameters, and the model accuracy is also evaluated by two alternative sets of dimensionless parameters. A special feature of the presented experiment is that a chain was scaled to have correct propagation celerity for longitudinal elastic waves, thus providing perfect geometrical and dynamic scaling in vacuum, which is unique. The scaling error due to incorrect Reynolds number seemed to be of minor importance. The 33 m experimental chain could then be considered a scaled 76 mm stud chain with the length 1240 m, i. e., at the length scale of 1 : 37. 6. Due to the correct elastic scale, the physical model was able to reproduce the effect of <b>snatch</b> <b>loads</b> giving rise to tensional shock waves propagating along the cable. The results from the experiment were used to validate the newly developed cable-dynamics code, MooDy, which utilises a discontinuous Galerkin FEM formulation. The validation of MooDy proved to be successful for the presented experiments. The experimental data is made available here for validation of other numerical codes by publishing digitised time series of two of the experiments...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Kettlebell lifting {{has gained}} {{increased}} popularity {{as both a}} form of resistance training and as a sport, despite the paucity of literature validating its use as a training tool. Kettlebell sport requires participants to complete the kettlebell snatch continuously over prolonged periods of time. Kettlebell sport and weightlifting involve similar exercises, however, their traditional uses suggest they are better suited to training different fitness qualities. This study examined the three-dimensional ground reaction force (GRF) and force applied to the kettlebell over a 6 min kettlebell snatch set in 12 kettlebell-trained males. METHODS: During this set, VICON was used to record the kettlebell trajectory with nine infrared cameras while the GRF of each leg was recorded with a separate AMTI force plate. Over {{the course of the}} set, an average of 13. 9 ± 3. 3 repetitions per minute were performed with a 24 kg kettlebell. Significance was evaluated with a two-way ANOVA and paired t-tests, whilst Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s F (ESF) and Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s D (ESD) were used to determine the magnitude. RESULTS: The applied force at the point of maximum acceleration was 814 ± 75 N and 885 ± 86 N for the downwards and upwards phases, respectively. The absolute peak resultant bilateral GRF was 1, 746 ± 217 N and 1, 768 ± 242 N for the downwards and upwards phases, respectively. Bilateral GRF of the first and last 14 repetitions was found to be similar, however {{there was a significant difference}} in the peak applied force (F (1. 11) = 7. 42, p = 0. 02, ESF = 0. 45). Unilateral GRF was found have a significant difference for the absolute anterior-posterior (F (1. 11) = 885. 15, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, ESF = 7) and medio-lateral force vectors (F (1. 11) = 5. 31, p = 0. 042, ESF = 0. 67). DISCUSSION: Over the course of a single repetition there were significant differences in the GRF and applied force at multiple points of the kettlebells trajectory. The kettlebell <b>snatch</b> <b>loads</b> each leg differently throughout a repetition and performing the kettlebell snatch for 6 min will result in a reduction in peak applied force...|$|R

40|$|A 40 -foot (12. 2 meter) nominal-diameter disk-gap-band {{parachute}} was flight tested {{as part of}} the NASA Supersonic Planetary Entry Decelerator Program (SPED-I). The test parachute was ejected by a deployment mortar from an instrumented payload at {{an altitude}} of 140, 000 feet (42. 5 kilometers). The payload was at a Mach number of 1. 91 and the dynamic pressure was 11. 6 pounds per square foot (555 newtons per square meter) at the time the parachute deployment mortar was fired. The parachute reached suspension line stretch in 0. 43 second with a resultant <b>snatch</b> force <b>loading</b> of 1990 pounds (8850 newtons). The maximum parachute opening load of 6500 pounds (28, 910 newtons) came 0. 61 second later at a total elapsed time from mortar firing of 1. 04 seconds. The first full inflation occurred at 1. 12 seconds and stable inflation was achieved at approximately 1. 60 seconds. The parachute had an average axial-force coefficient of 0. 53 during the deceleration period. During the steady-state descent portion of the flight test, the average effective drag coefficient was also 0. 53 and pitch-yaw oscillations of the canopy averaged less than 10 degrees in the altitude region above 100, 000 feet (30. 5 meters) ...|$|R

A deployment mortar ejected the test parachute when the payload was at a Mach number of 1. 56 and a dynamic pressure of 11. 4 lb/sq ft (546 newtons per m 2) at an altitude of 127, 500 feet (38. 86 km). The parachute reached suspension line stretch in 0. 37 second resulting in a <b>snatch</b> force <b>loading</b> of 1270 pounds (5650 N). Canopy inflation began 0. 10 second after line stretch. A delay in the opening process occurred and was apparently due to a momentary interference of the glass-fiber shroud used in packing the parachute bag in the mortar. Continuous canopy inflation began 0. 73 second after initiation of deployment and 0. 21 second later full inflation was attained for a total elapsed time from mortar fire of 0. 94 second. The maximum opening load of 3915 pounds (17, 400 newtons) occurred at the time the canopy was first fully opened. The parachute exhibited an average drag coefficient of 0. 52 during the deceleration period and pitch-yaw oscillations of the canopy were less than 5 degrees.

40|$|A 40 -foot-nominal-diameter (12. 2 meter) disk-gap-band {{parachute}} was flight tested {{as part of}} the NASA Supersonic Planetary Entry Decelerator (SPED-I) Program. The test parachute was deployed from an instrumented payload {{by means}} of a deployment mortar when the payload was at an altitude of 158, 500 feet (48. 2 kilometers), a Mach number of 2. 72, and a free-stream dynamic pressure of 9. 7 pounds per foot(exp 2) (465 newtons per meter(exp 2)). Suspension line stretch occurred 0. 46 second after mortar firing and the resulting <b>snatch</b> force <b>loading</b> was - 8. lg. The maximum acceleration experienced by the payload due to parachute opening was - 27. 2 g at 0. 50 second after the snatch force peak for a total elapsed time from mortar firing of 0. 96 second. Canopy-shape variations occurred during the higher Mach number portion of the flight test (M greater than 1. 4) and the payload was subjected to large amplitude oscillatory loads. A calculated average nominal axial-force coefficient ranged from about 0. 25 immediately after the first canopy opening to about 0. 50 as the canopy attained a steady inflated shape. One gore of the test parachute was damaged when the deployment bag with mortar lid passed through it from behind approximately 2 seconds after deployment was initiated. Although the canopy damage caused by the deployment bag penetration had no apparent effect on the functional capability of the test parachute, it may have affected parachute performance since the average effective drag coefficient of 0. 48 was 9 percent less than that of a previously tested parachute of the same configuration...|$|R
