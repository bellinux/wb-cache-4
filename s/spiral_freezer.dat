50|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} Georgie Pie factory {{was located}} in Manukau City, Auckland. This automated factory replaced the original one, which operated out of Favona Road (behind Progressive Enterprises Head Office). The new facility was designed to support the continued local and international expansion of the brand. It was capable of producing more than 6,000 pies per hour. The pies were snap frozen (in a <b>spiral</b> <b>freezer)</b> in a raw state and distributed to stores, where they were freshly baked using impinger (conveyor) ovens. Upon its opening, the factory was the second largest investment for Progressive Enterprises.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} {{continued to}} expand over the years, Patties began distribution in Melbourne in 1986, and in 1995 exporting to New Zealand. In 1993, Patties launched Arriba, a Mexican food range. In 1996, after pastry sales grew, Patties sold its bread business to Sunicrust {{in order to}} concentrate on pastry products. Demand for pastry products continued to grow, resulting in significant expansions to the factory. In 1998, a two million dollar plant renovation and extension took place, including installation of a <b>spiral</b> <b>freezer.</b> In 2000, a new parallel manufacturing line, capable of making all pasties, sausage rolls and finger foods, was installed, substantially increasing capacity.|$|E
40|$|Cultured Macrobrachium rosenbergii (Scampi, about 30 g each) in {{headless}} shell-on {{form was}} {{individually quick frozen}} in a <b>spiral</b> <b>freezer.</b> The frozen samples were glazed and packed in polythene bags, which were further packed in master carton and stored at - 18 °C. Samples were drawn at regular intervals and subjected to biochemical, bacteriological and organoleptic analysis to study its storage characteristics. The data on the above parameters showed that the samples were in prime acceptable condition when stored up to 23 weeks. No appreciable change in colour and odour was noticed in the raw muscle. Afterwards, organoleptic evaluation of the cooked muscle revealed slight change in the flavour. Texture also appeared little tougher. These changes in organoleptic characters were well supported by the biochemical bacteriological changes in the muscle...|$|E

Its product portfolio includes piston compressors, screw compressors, chillers, tunnel <b>freezers,</b> carton and <b>spiral</b> <b>freezers,</b> industrial ice generators, valves and valve sets, driers, and exhaust ventilators.|$|R
40|$|Beaufort Fisheries Incorporated, a {{manufacturer}} of traditional menhaden fish products (meal, oil, solubles), is currently diversifying its product line into other seafood areas. The acquisition and installation of a <b>spiral</b> <b>freezer</b> with a capacity of processing in excess of 6000 lbs/hr and a freezer with storage of more than 1, 000, 000 lbs of finished product are major steps in this endeavor. This project is a feasibility study for reduction of waste load and water use in current processing operations: it also explores future business uses for the new processing/freezer facility. The plant was initially surveyed to identify sources of solids loss as well as water use patterns. Methods were suggested to reduce or recover and reuse process water and solids from the plant. A conceptual design was proposed for the recovery system and integrated into the existing meal and oil operations. Costs and payback for the pollution prevention system were evaluated. Waste streams from a whole frozen fish factory are primarily associated with washing of whole fish prior to sorting and inspection operations. Considerabl...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, Evaluation the effect of Rosmarinus officinalis and Thymus vulgaris {{extracts}} on the stability of poly unsaturated fatty acids in frozen Silver carp minced. Treatments include: Treatment 1 - Control: frozen meat packaged in conventional Treatment 2 : Frozen Silver carp minced+Thyme 300 mg/kg in normal packaging Treatment 3 : Frozen Silver carp minced+Rosemary 200 mg/kg in normal packaging Treatment 4 : Frozen Silver carp minced+Rosemary compound (100 mg/kg) and Thyme (100 mg/kg) in normal packaging After rapid freezing of samples in the <b>spiral</b> <b>freezer</b> by individual quick freezing method, to maintain the cold temperature (- 18) °C were transferred. Sampling and measurements to determine the fatty acid profile of the zero phase beginning {{in the first month}} and then every ten days, and 15 days in the second month of the third month after the monthly test. Identifying, defining and measuring the fatty acid profile by gas chromatography was performed. In this study, levels of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in three experimental and one control were identified as follows: A: saturated fatty acids: Meristic C 14 : 0 /Palmitic C 16 : 0 /Hepta decaenoic C 17 : 0 /Stearic C 18 : 0 /Arashidic C 20 : 0 /B:Mono unsaturated fatty acids: palmitoleic C 16 : 1 -W 7 /Oleic C 18 : 1 -W 9 /Gadoleic C 20 : 1 -W 9 C:Poly unsaturated fatty acids: Linoleic C 18 : 2 -W 6 /α-Linolenic C 18 : 3 -W 3 D:High unsaturated fatty acids: Arachidonic C 20 : 4 -W 6 Eicosapentaenoic acid C 20 : 5 -EPA/W 3 Docosahexaenoic C 22 : 6 -DHA/W 3 Results {{of this study was to}} determine, Thyme and rosemary extracts containing silver carp minced stored in freezing conditions, Stability of different types of fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, poly-unsaturated fatty acids, omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids are. So that none of the fatty acids measured were not significant 100...|$|E
