40|$|Both {{industry}} and private households have profited substantially from the liberalisation {{of the electricity}} markets, the former, however, to a significantly greater extent than the latter, which points at different competition intensities in the two markets. The favourable development of electricity prices compared to an alternative scenario without liberalisation nevertheless should not obscure the fact that competition and regulatory authorities have {{so far not been}} able to sustainably implement "workable" competition in the Austrian electricity markets, in spite of ongoing positive developments aiming to invigorate competition {{in the wake of the}} crumbling of the politically encouraged <b>supplier</b> <b>cartel</b> made up of EnergieAllianz and Verbundgesellschaft. Due to unresolved homemade structural problems, liberalisation has left incumbent electricity suppliers largely unchallenged in their position as local monopolists. This unsatisfactory situation has been further exacerbated by a substantial increase in market concentration caused by horizontal and vertical mergers of public utilities and the delayed implementation of legal "unbundling", i. e., the separation of network operation and electricity supply. The liberalisation dividend expected from opening the energy markets thus is in serious trouble of being thwarted. Wettbewerb Wettbewerbspolitik Strommarkt Marktliberalisierung Österreich...|$|E
40|$|Coal has {{for many}} years been {{considered}} as a resource {{of the past and}} as a result its importance has been underestimated. Yet coal still is the main pillar for generating electricity in most countries: A quarter of the worldwide primary energy consumption is provided by coal. While the world's largest coal producers, China, the USA and India, are {{at the same time the}} largest consumers of coal. Smaller producers and consumers of coal engage extensively in international trade. In particular the seaborne coal trade has increased significantly since the 1990 's. In the past two years prices of import coal also have increased considerably. In September 2008, importers in Europe had to pay prices of more than 200 US dollars per ton, a price level many times higher than the historical average. In this context, fears have increasingly been voiced that the international coal market - analogous to the oil market which continues to be dominated by the OPEC-might witness the emergence of a <b>supplier</b> <b>cartel,</b> a "COAL-PEC". A strong tendency towards the concentration of companies has in fact been observed in the international coal market in the past years. Increased prices could have resulted from the use of market power. Drivers for the price increase were the strong rise in demand, in particular from China and India, capacity bottlenecks in production and shipment as well as a lack of investments. In the future a tight market and high coal prices have to be expected. Coal, Energy, Market structure, Simulation model...|$|E
40|$|Procurement {{practices}} {{are affected by}} uncertainty regarding suppliers' costs, the nature of competition among suppliers, and uncertainty regarding possible collusion among suppliers. Buyers dissatisfied with bids of incumbent suppliers can cancel their procurements and resolicit bids after qualifying additional <b>suppliers.</b> Recent <b>cartel</b> cases show that cartels devote considerable attention to avoiding such resistance from buyers. We show that in a procurement setting {{with the potential for}} buyer resistance, the payoff to firms from forming a cartel exceeds that from merging. Thus, firms considering a merger may have an incentive to collude instead. We discuss implications for antitrust and merger policy...|$|R
40|$|Procurement {{practices}} {{are affected by}} the nature of competition among suppliers and by uncertainty about whether suppliers are colluding. A buyer that is dissatisfied with the bids of incumbent bidders, perhaps based on suspicions of collusion, can cancel the procurement and then resolicit bids after qualifying additional <b>suppliers.</b> Recent <b>cartel</b> cases show that cartels devote considerable attention to avoiding such resistance from buyers. We show that in a procurement setting with the potential for buyer resistance, the payoff to a cartel exceeds that of a merged entity. This is consistent with the firm behavior described in the landmark Addyston Pipe antitrust case, where the firms had the option to merge but chose, in the face of buyer resistance, to organize as a cartel instead. ∗The authors thank the Human Capital Foundatio...|$|R
40|$|While private {{actions for}} damages against price-cartels by direct and {{indirect}} customers receive much attention, it is largely unresolved to what extent other groups that are negatively affected may claim compensation. This paper focuses on {{probably the most important}} one: suppliers to a downstream sellers' cartel. The paper shows graphically and analytically that <b>cartel</b> <b>suppliers</b> are negatively affected by the conspiracy depending on three effects: a direct quantity, a price and a cost effect. The article then examines whether suppliers are entitled to claim ensuing losses as damages in the US and the EU, with exemplary looks at England and Germany, thereby delineating the boundaries of the right to damages in different legal systems. We find that, while the majority view in the US denies standing, the emerging position in the EU, considering also recent case law and the forthcoming Damages Directive, allows for approving <b>cartel</b> <b>supplier</b> damage claims. We argue that this can indeed be justified in view of the different institutional context and the goals assigned to the right to damages in the EU. The Annex complements our result that supplier damage claims are practically viable by showing how supplier damages can be estimated econometrically with an adjusted residual demand model...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic {{version of}} {{discrete}} choice theory {{is presented in}} order to enable the explicit analysis {{of the interaction between}} the micro- and the macro-level of social systems. <b>Suppliers</b> in a <b>cartel</b> market face a social dilemma. They are modelled as boundedly rational decision makers with limited foresight. A stimulus-response mechanism leads to an ergodic, time-discrete Markov-chain with a discrete state space. The resulting market dynamics exhibits a specific time-pattern of cartelisation and de-cartelisation. Most of the time, a cartel which significantly rations output is in existence. This happens though there is a permanent temptation to free ride. ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s GDP {{growth rates}} {{gradually}} declined {{from a peak}} of 6.5% in 1970 until contracting 7.5% in 1975 and 1976. Switzerland became increasingly dependent on oil imported from its main <b>supplier,</b> the OPEC <b>cartel.</b> The 1973 international oil crisis caused Switzerland's energy consumption to decrease in the years from 1973 to 1977. In 1974 there were three nationwide car-free Sundays when private transport was prohibited {{as a result of the}} oil supply shock. From 1977 onwards GDP grew, although Switzerland was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis which resulted in a short-term decrease in Switzerland's energy consumption [...]|$|R
40|$|Victims of {{antitrust}} violations {{can recover}} damages in court. Yet, the quan-ti cation of antitrust damages {{and to whom}} they accrue is often complex. An illegal price increase somewhere {{in the chain of}} production percolates through to the other layers in a sequence of partial pass-ons. The resulting reductions in sales and input demands lead to additional harm to downstream (in) direct purchasers and upstream <b>suppliers</b> to the <b>cartel,</b> respectively. Nevertheless, U. S. civil antitrust litigation is almost exclusively concerned with direct pur-chaser claims for (treble) damages calculated {{on the basis of the}} overcharge. Similar best practice rules are emerging in Europe. In this paper, we show that the direct purchaser overcharge bears no structural relation to the true harm inicted by a cartel on all of its direct and indirect purchasers and sellers in the chain of production.

40|$|While the {{original}} justification of the antidumping {{laws in the}} industrial economies was to protect domestic consumers against predation by foreign suppliers, by the early 1990 s the laws and their use had evolved {{so much that the}} opposite concern arose. Rather than attacking anti‐ competitive behavior, dumping complaints by domestic firms were being used to facilitate collusion among <b>suppliers</b> and enforce <b>cartel</b> arrangements. This paper examines the predation and anti‐competitiveness issues {{from the perspective of the}} “new users ” of antidumping—the major emerging economies for which antidumping is now a major tool in the trade policy arsenal. We examine these concerns in light of important ways in which the world economy and international trading system have been changing since the early 1990 s, including more firms and more countries participating in international trade, but also more extensive links among suppliers and consumers through multinational firm activity and vertical specialization.

5000|$|The Martinez Familia, {{who started}} off selling {{marijuana}} and cocaine, started shipping drugs around Latin America, North America and Europe {{as early as}} 1985, {{with the help of}} Cali Cartel. They would use the Port of San Juan and buy ships to transport their merchandise to Caribbean islands and other countries. They supplied drug dealers such as Frank Lucas, Ñetas, Latin Kings, Ismael Zambada Garcia, Kevin luwenski, Zoe Pound and many others. They started becoming a <b>supplier</b> when Cali <b>Cartel</b> cut their ties with them in the 1990s. The mafia then hired a chemist from Spain to start making coke for them. They reportedly started making $750 million - $1.billion from international drug deals, extortion and loan sharking. They soon began having issues with the Mexican cartel known as Gulf Cartel who asked for $35 million for their help in making deals in Mexico. The Gulf Cartel soon started blackmailing the Puerto Rican Mafia, which resulted in the kidnapping and killing of several members of the Gulf Cartel.|$|R
2500|$|By the 1980s, García Ábrego began {{incorporating}} cocaine {{into the}} drug trafficking operations, {{and started to}} {{have the upper hand}} on what was now considered the Gulf Cartel, the greatest criminal dynasty in the US-Mexico border. By negotiating with the Cali Cartel, García Ábrego was able to secure 50% of the shipment out of Colombia as payment for delivery, instead of the $1,500 USD per kilogram they were previously receiving. This renegotiation, however, forced Garcia Ábrego to guarantee the product’s arrival from Colombia to its destination. Instead, he created warehouses along the Mexican’s northern border to preserve hundreds of tons of cocaine; this allowed him to create a new distribution network and increase his political influence. In addition to trafficking drugs, García Ábrego would ship cash to be laundered, in the millions. Around 1994, it was estimated that the Gulf Cartel handled as much as [...] "one-third of all cocaine shipments" [...] into the United States from the Cali <b>Cartel</b> <b>suppliers.</b> During the 1990s, the PGR, the Mexican attorney general's office, estimated that the Gulf Cartel was [...] "worth over $10 billion US dollars." ...|$|R
