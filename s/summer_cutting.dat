50|$|The NCHA World Championship Futurity (NCHA Futurity), {{hosted by}} the National Cutting Horse Association, is the debut event for 3-year-old cutting horses, and the first jewel in the NCHA Triple Crown, which also {{includes}} the annual NCHA Super Stakes held in April, and the NCHA Derby held during the NCHA <b>Summer</b> <b>Cutting</b> Spectacular. The Futurity is held at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum in Fort Worth, Texas, {{which has been the}} venue for the Futurity since its inaugural event in 1962. The total Futurity purse in 2014 was $3.8 Million. Phil Hanson of Weatherford, Texas riding Classy CD Cat won the Open Championship and $200,000 in prize money plus other prizes that included a custom western saddle, a Jim Reno bronze trophy, boots, a leather recliner, and a gold buckle.|$|E

50|$|In {{favorable}} {{conditions in}} the garden, S. officinalis can grow to a substantial size (1 square metre or more), {{but a number of}} cultivars are more compact. As such they are valued as small ornamental flowering shrubs, rather than for their herbal properties. Some provide low ground cover, especially in sunny dry environments. Like many herbs they can be killed by a cold wet winter, especially if the soil is not well drained. But they are easily propagated from <b>summer</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and some cultivars are produced from seeds.|$|R

40|$|Drymis brasiliensis Miers is a specie of the Winteraceae family, {{commonly}} known as cataia or pepper bark. This research was carried out with the aim to study the rooting of semihardwood cuttings, subjected to different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA), collected in four seasons of the year (autumn, winter, spring and <b>summer).</b> <b>Cuttings</b> were prepared with 10 - 12 cm length, keeping two halved leaves. Bases of cuttings were treated as follows: control (100 % water), 0; 500; 1500; 3000; 4500 and 6000 mg L- 1 IBA. One hundred and twenty after the planting the following variables were assessed: rooting percentage, number of roots per cutting, length of roots per cutting, cutting callus percentage, cuttings with new shoots and number of cuttings that maintained the initial leaves. The indolebutyric acid is not recommended for rooting of Drimys brasiliensis cuttings.

50|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 20th century, the Forest of Birse {{was largely}} treated as an {{extension}} of the two estates which shared the hunting rights, as the older, common uses, such as <b>summer</b> grazing, peat <b>cutting</b> and timber had largely fallen into disuse. However, in the 1970s the regeneration of woodland in part of the forest and the felling of a small area of mature woodland by Dunecht estate raised awareness of the ancient common rights held by all the inhabitants of Birse parish, as the use of timber was one of these common rights.|$|R

60|$|Ellis did hold out. The {{elderberries}} {{tried to}} hold out too, but they were {{no match for the}} lad's perseverance. It was a hard piece of work, however, and Ellis never forgot it. Week after week he toiled in the hot <b>summer</b> sun, digging, <b>cutting,</b> and dragging out roots. The job seemed endless, and his progress each day was discouragingly slow. He had expected to get through in a month, but he soon found it would take two. Frequently Timothy Robinson wandered by and looked at the increasing pile of roots and the slowly extending stretch of cleared land. But he never spoke to Ellis and made no comment on the matter to anybody.|$|R
40|$|Manipulation {{of cutting}} {{schedule}} {{is the primary}} technique by which growers can affect forage yield and quality. However, {{it is not always}} clear what alfalfa growth stage will produce dairy-quality hay without unduly sacrificing yield. Field research was conducted to quantify the relationship between alfalfa maturity and yield and forage quality under intermountain conditions. First cutting yield increased 80 pounds per day (averaged over two years, two alfalfa varieties, and two locations). Forage quality declined, averaging a 0. 33 percentage point increase in ADF (0. 22 percentage point decrease in mN), 0. 3 percentage point increase in NDF, and 0. 2 percentage point decline in CP per day. The yield increase and quality decrease were significantly more rapidly for second cutting. This underscores the trouble growers often experience producing dairy-quality hay in mid <b>summer</b> (second <b>cutting).</b> Given the difficulty in producing dairy-quality alfalfa for all cuttings throughout the year, an alternative cutting strategy is suggested. The best approach may be to alter the order in which fields are cut from cutting to cutting. The intent is to target specific fields and cuttings for the dairy market while aiming to maximize the yield of other fields...|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 1941 he {{was arrested}} by the Nazi authorities. He was incarcerated until April 1942 at Møllergata 19, and from 24 April 1942 to the war's end on 8 May 1945 he was imprisoned at Grini {{concentration}} camp. In the summer of 1942 both Gabrielsen and Lindbäck-Larsen {{were part of the}} so-called Forest Gang (Skogsgjengen) at Grini, which spent the <b>summer</b> days <b>cutting</b> down trees near the camp. The forestry work allowed easy access to food hidden in the woods by sympathizers, and messages could be smuggled in and out with little difficulty, making the Forest Gang the most popular assignment at Grini. During his time at Grini Gabrielsen also took part in secret debating meetings organized by journalists amongst the prisoners, where various aspects of the organizing of post-war Norway was discussed. Amongst the issues Gabrielsen discussed with fellow Grini inmates was the post-war reconstruction of Finnmark, most of the county having been laid waste during the German retreat in Northern Norway in 1944 - 1945. One important question with regards to the future reconstruction was whether or not the devastated areas should be rebuilt like they were organized before the war, or if they should be reformed with the future development in mind. With only the single exception of Finnkongkjeila in Gamvik the reconstruction ended up following the old pre-war population patterns.|$|R
