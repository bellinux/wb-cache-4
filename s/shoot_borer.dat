25|$|When {{fruit and}} <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> larvae feed on Bt brinjal plants, they ingest the Bt protein Cry1Ac along with plant tissue. In the insect gut, which is {{alkaline}} with a pH >9.5, the protein is solubilized and activated by gut proteases. The Bt protein binds to specific receptor proteins {{present in the}} insect membrane, resulting in pore formation in the membranes. This leads to disruption of digestive processes, paralysis, and subsequent death of the fruit and <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> larvae.|$|E
25|$|Bt brinjal is a {{transgenic}} aubergine {{that contains}} a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis.

25|$|The Bt brinjal is a {{suite of}} {{transgenic}} brinjals (also known as an eggplant or aubergine) created by inserting a crystal protein gene (Cry1Ac) from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into the genome of various brinjal cultivars. The insertion of the gene, along with other genetic elements such as promoters, terminators and an antibiotic resistance marker gene into the brinjal plant is accomplished using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. The Bt brinjal has been developed to give resistance against lepidopteron insects, in particular the Brinjal Fruit and <b>Shoot</b> <b>Borer</b> (Leucinodes orbonalis)(FSB). Mahyco, an Indian seed company based in Jalna, Maharashtra, has developed the Bt brinjal.|$|E

40|$|Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) {{is a very}} {{important}} source of income for more than 200, 000 farmer households in Vietnam. The present cashew productivity in Vietnam is low and unstable, and pest damage is partly responsible for this. Cashew farmers rely on pesticides to minimize the damage, resulting in adverse impacts on farm environment and farmers’ health. Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp) are effective biocontrol agents of a range of cashew insect pests in several cashew-growing countries, and these ants are widely distributed in Vietnam. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential of weaver ants in cashew orchards in Vietnam. Field surveys and field experiment were conducted in five cashew orchards from July 2006 to January 2008 in Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces, Vietnam. Based on the field surveys, the most important pests that damage flushing foliar and floral shoots and young cashew fruits and nuts were mosquito bugs, brown <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> and fruit-nut borers. The damage caused by each of these pests was significantly lower on trees with weaver ants compared with trees without the ants, showing that the ants were able to keep these pest damages under the control threshold. Regular monitoring of the field experiment showed that weaver ants were similar to insecticides for controlling mosquito bugs, blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> fruit-nut borers, leaf rollers, and leaf miners. Aphids did not become major pests in plot with weaver ants. To manage insect pest assemblage in cashew orchards, an integrated pest management using weaver ants as a major component is discussed...|$|R

25|$|Many controversies {{surround}} {{the development and}} release of genetically modified foods, ranging from human safety and environmental impacts to ethical concerns such as corporate control of the food supply and intellectual property rights. The brinjal is an important food crop for India, and the potential commercialization of a genetically modified variety has drawn support and criticism. Although {{it is a major}} food crop in India, brinjal production is relatively low with fruit and <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> infestation a major constraint to yield. Proponents of the technology believe the Bt brinjal will have positive effects for the Indian economy and the health of the farmers. Field trials conducted on research-managed farms carried out by Mahyco and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research suggested a 42% pesticide reduction and a doubling of the yield was possible. The economic gain for consumers, developers and farmers was estimated to potentially be US$108 million per year with an additional $3–4 million saved due to health benefits associated with decreased pesticide use.|$|E

Seedling survival a year after planting showed high mortality under high shaded gap (3 - 8 % photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)). At 51 weeks after planting, final stem height and root collar diameter were highly significant under low shaded gaps. Increased number of shoots and shoot lenghts were observed under low shade (50 - 78 % PAR). Increased flushing was seen in all shade regimes during the rainy period. This study illustrates that low shaded gap openings favour seeding survival, stem and shoot growth, and number of shoots.
