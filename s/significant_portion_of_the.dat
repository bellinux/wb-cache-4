5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E

Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. A <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent.

The stream also flows through an urban area in Moosic. Its headwaters are near Yostville. However, only a few square miles of the watershed is urban.

A <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film is dedicated {{to a series of}} unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure.|$|E
5|$|The Sami {{were not}} the only people subject to repressions. Thousands of people were sent to Kola in the 1930s–1950s, and in 2007 over two {{thousand}} people—descendants of those forcibly sent here—still live on the peninsula. A <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization. Prisoner labor was often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} is triggered when Detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with Judge Daniel Phelan following the acquittal of D'Angelo Barksdale for murder after a key witness changes her story. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness {{has probably been}} intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D'Angelo's uncle, Avon Barksdale, having recognized several faces at the trial, most notably Avon's second-in-command, Stringer Bell. He also tells Phelan {{that no one is}} investigating Barksdale's criminal activity, which includes a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's drug trade and several unsolved homicides.|$|E
5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet. They will feed {{from a variety of}} sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
5|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game {{is spent}} sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail {{is driven by}} wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a {{tailwind}} behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of}} a sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E

5|$|Binary stars form a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total {{population}} of stellar systems, with {{up to half of}} all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Dennis claimed {{at least}} 88 lives: 56 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, 15 in the U.S. and 1 in Jamaica. Total damages are {{estimated}} at US$4–6billion, including $2.23billion in the United States {{and the rest}} in the Caribbean. Dennis was most damaging to Cuba, where the storm wiped out a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citrus crop. As the storm struck {{near the end of}} Cuba's dry season, farmers were not yet prepared for the heavy rainfall brought by the storm. In the United States, Dennis drew comparison with Hurricane Ivan of the previous year, but it was both smaller and weaker than Ivan at landfall and caused significantly fewer damages, partly because the region had not yet fully rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{capitulation}} in November 1918, Derfflinger was interned with a <b>significant</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, {{with the}} guard ships of the Royal Navy out on maneuvers, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered that the fleet be scuttled. The resulting scuttling of the German fleet saw some 66 vessels {{of various types}} sunk. Among those was Derfflinger, which sank at 14:45. The ship was raised in 1939 to be broken up for scrap metal, but the outbreak of World War II intervened. The ship, which remained capsized, was anchored off the island of Risa until 1946, at which point she was sent to Faslane Port, where she was broken up. The ship's bell was delivered to the German Federal Navy on 30 August 1965.|$|E
