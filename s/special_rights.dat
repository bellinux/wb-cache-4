According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an indigenous group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more indigenous to Xinjiang than the Han, and have no <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> to the land under the law. The People's Republic has presided over the migration into Xinjiang of millions of Han, who dominate the region economically and politically.|$|E

25|$|However, {{during the}} 1860s, under Tsar Alexander II, {{it was decided}} that legal {{equality}} between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> of the higher estates of the realm were abolished, a modern parliament based on universal suffrage was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.|$|E

They also became rent-seeking and sought protection of their <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> and advantages. According to paintings of the era, they were also permitted to grow beards. Consequently, the formerly strict rules of succession became open to interpretation. While they advanced their own power, the Janissaries also helped to keep the system from changing in other progressive ways, and according to some scholars the corps was most responsible for the political stagnation of Istanbul.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>special</b> <b>right</b> {{triangle}} is a {{right triangle}} with some regular feature that makes calculations on the triangle easier, or for which simple formulas exist. For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45°-45°-90°. This is called an [...] "angle-based" [...] right triangle. A [...] "side-based" [...] right triangle {{is one in which}} the lengths of the sides form ratios of whole numbers, such as 3 : 4 : 5, or of other special numbers such as the golden ratio. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these <b>special</b> <b>right</b> triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without resorting to more advanced methods.|$|R

25|$|After {{privatization}} the Portuguese government owned 500 golden {{shares in}} PT, which carried <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> over the company's management decisions and blocked any one shareholder from holding more than 10% of voting rights within the company.

Portugal argued that the shares were in the public interest. A case brought before the European Court of Justice by the Commission to force the government to cede its shares resulted in the announcement of their abolition in July 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the issue}} of the Constitution and its {{provisions}} was also brought up by several politicians within the government itself. Lim Keng Yaik of the Gerakan party, which by now had joined Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition, asked for a re-examination of the social contract so that a Bangsa Malaysia (literally 'Malaysian race' or 'Malaysian nation' in the Malay language) could be achieved. The social contract is the Constitution's provisions with regard to the different races' privileges—those who defend it and Article 153 often define the social contract as providing the Indians and Chinese with citizenship in exchange for the Malays' <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> or ketuanan Melayu.|$|E
25|$|In Syria {{the right}} {{belongs to the}} {{paternal}} male cousin alone and the maternal male cousin has no <b>special</b> <b>rights.</b> The custom is however less frequent in big cities such as Damascus and Aleppo. Patai reports that in the decades preceding 1962 the right was often ignored among the Syrian urban middle class. Among the upper classes {{it appeared to be}} again more common, as certain leading families protected their wealth and status by reserving daughters for their cousins, though sons had more freedom of choice. This situation was also loosening at the time of Patai's work. This holds also among the Syrian Turks and Kurds. But the Syrian Circassians hold cousin marriage absolutely forbidden, similar to the Circassians of the Caucasus.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to increase taxes}} for paying the Ottoman Empire's debts to foreign creditors sparked an outrage in the Balkan provinces, which culminated in the Great Eastern Crisis and ultimately the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) that provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire's Balkan territories, with the subsequent Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The war, however, was disastrous for the already struggling Ottoman economy and the Ottoman Public Debt Administration was established in 1881, which gave {{the control of the}} Ottoman state revenues to foreign creditors. This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> to the OPDA for collecting various types of tax and customs revenues. During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niș and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.|$|E

In Italy they were able to take in the ancient ruins again; this time he purchased several photographs, mostly of the ruins, which began his immense collection of folios with archival material sufficient for the documentation used in the completion of future paintings. In January 1876, he rented a studio in Rome. The family returned to London in April, visiting the Parisian Salon on their way back. In London he regularly met with fellow-artist Emil Fuchs.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} grievances of the Malays, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew held {{a meeting with}} the various Malay organisations on July 19 and this angered UNMO as it was not given an {{invitation}} to attend this meeting. In this meeting Lee had assured the Malays that they will be given ample opportunities for the Malays to be educated and trained with sufficient skills for them to compete effectively with the non-Malays in the country. However, PM Lee refused to promise the granting of <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> for the Malays. This meeting did satisfy some of the Malay community leaders and agitated some that the needs and pleas of the Malays were not being heard. The Singapore Malayan National Committee was one of the groups that was present during this meeting and seems not convinced by PM Lee’s promises and thus in order to rally the support of the Malays to go against the PAP government, leaflets containing rumours of the Chinese in Singapore trying to kill the Malays were published and distributed throughout the island on 20 July 1964. The spread of such information was also carried out during the procession of the Prophet Mohammad birthday celebration which triggered the riots.|$|E
