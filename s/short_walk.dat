5|$|The {{first major}} {{rebuilding}} of the venue took place {{ahead of the}} 1962 season, when the wooden stands were torn and replaced with concrete stands on both long sides.

The new stands were taken into use on 3 May 1962. Floodlighting was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches {{to be held at}} the venue. An all-weather running track was subsequently also laid. On 1 December 1988, Lerkendal Station opened, allowing train passengers a <b>short</b> <b>walk</b> to the stadium.

5|$|The {{family moved}} from Alford {{to the heart}} of London in 1605 when Anne was 15, where her father was given the {{position}} of vicar of the Church of Saint Martin's in the Vintry. Here his expression of puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of pastors. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of Saint Pancras, several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week. In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer to home and became rector of Saint Margaret's on New Fish Street, only a <b>short</b> <b>walk</b> from Saint Martin in the Vintry. He was at a high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} exact {{enumeration}} study of short SAWs in two {{as well as}} three dimensions that addresses the question, `what is the <b>shortest</b> <b>walk</b> for which {{the existence of a}}ll the three phases - coil, globule and the theta - could be demonstrated'. Even though we could easily demonstrate the coil and the globule phases from Free Energy considerations, we could demonstrate the existence of a theta phase only by using a scaling form for the distribution of gyration radius. That even such <b>short</b> <b>walks</b> have a scaling behavior is an unexpected result of this work. Comment: Three page RevTeX 4 double column manuscript with four. eps figure...|$|R
