5|$|Yet {{again in}} Spring 1992, the CSU and UC systems were facing {{another round of}} severe budget cuts and {{dramatic}} student fee increases by the state government. Still a second time, SDSU President Thomas Day took the same deep and narrow approach for budget cuts for SDSU, but this time proposed elimination of not only full time faculty professors, but of entire majors such as Aerospace Engineering. In and attempt to alleviate fears of students in those majors, a large meeting by President Day was planned in the student center with hundreds of students and teachers. However, meeting quickly turned angry and chaotic with an overcapacity crowd pressing against the glass windows outside. Following the meeting, students feeling betrayed a 2nd time after 1991, about a dozen students held a temporary occupation of President Day's office.

The study is based on <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> ‟ drawings of themselves in a typical classroom situation and four open questions. Data was collected from 104 freshman science <b>student</b> <b>teachers,</b> and evaluated based on the basic tenets of Grounded Theory. Applying Grounded Theory led to a framework of categorising the <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> ‟ beliefs in three categories: (I) Beliefs about Classroom Organisation, (II) Beliefs about Teaching Objectives, and (III) Epistemological Beliefs. All three categories were expanded to a dimension between more traditional beliefs and beliefs in line with modern educational theory.

Data were collected from multiple sources, including (1) interviews with <b>student</b> <b>teachers,</b> cooperating teachers and university supervisors, (2) observations of <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> at their work, (3) written journals kept by informants and (4) artifacts such as student work.

Among these are economic and family considerations, a desire to make a difference with children and a guest for personal fulfillment. (2) The relationships older <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> form with their cooperating teachers and supervisors are complex. They can be benign, destructive, supportive or mentoring. (3) Non-traditional age <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> demonstrated these characteristics during their student teaching: perseverance, flexibility, self-doubt and the ability to draw upon previous life experiences. (4) Non-traditional age <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> placed a high and, to them, unexpected value on mentorship. (5) There were frequently tensions between the expectations of cooperating teachers and university supervisors and the realities of performance by the <b>student</b> <b>teachers.</b> Cooperating teachers and supervisors tended to expect more expertise in pedagogy from the older <b>student</b> <b>teachers,</b> on the basis of age alone, than they would from younger <b>student</b> <b>teachers,</b> even though the older <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> were novices in education.
