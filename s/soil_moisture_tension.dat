For example, needle ice, seen in cold soil, occurs via capillary action. The first major contributions {{to the study of}} needle ice, or simply, frost heaving were made by Stephen Taber (1929) and Gunnar Beskow (1935), who independently aimed to understand soil freezing. Taber’s initial work was related to understanding how the size of pores within the ground influenced the amount of frost heave. He also discovered that frost heave is favorable for crystal growth and that a gradient of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>tension</b> drives water upward toward the freezing front {{near the top of the}} ground. In Beskow’s studies, he defined this <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>tension</b> as “capillary pressure” (and soil water as “capillary water”). Beskow determined that the soil type and effective stress on the soil particles influenced frost heave, where effective stress is the sum of pressure from above ground and the capillary pressure.|$|E

This device typically consists of a glass or plastic tube with a porous ceramic cup, and is filled with water. The top of the tube has either a built-in vacuum gauge or a rubber cap used with a portable puncture tensiometer instrument, which uses a hypodermic needle to measure the pressure inside the tensiometer. The tensiometer is buried in the soil, and a hand pump is used to pull a partial vacuum. As water is pulled out of the soil by plants and evaporation, the vacuum inside the tube increases. As water is added to the soil, the vacuum inside the tube pulls moisture from the soil and decreases. As the water in tensiometer is considered to be equilibrium with the soil water, the gauge reading of the tensiometer represents the matric potential of the soil.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to characterize the aeration status of two sites representing typical regions for the agricultural production of Lower Austria (Wieselburg and Fuchsenbigl) on the basis of results obtained in the frame of the multilateral Austrian-Czech-Hungarian-Polish-Slovak project on 'Assessment of Structure in Agricultural Soils' sponsored by the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research. The paper comprises results of measurements of different soil aeration properties such as: oxygen diffusion rate (ODR), redox potential (Eh), relative gas diffusion coefficient (DD 0), air permeability (k) and activity of soil dehydrogenase. Undisturbed soil cores were tested in the range of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>tension</b> from 0 hPa (pF 0) to 500 hPa (pF 2. 7). Statistical analysis of relationships between tested parameters were performed...|$|E
30|$|Field {{campaign}} FC 2 (14  days after {{manure application}} on pasture “East”) {{was conducted on}} a sunny day between 11 : 30 and 15 : 30. A rain event had been forecasted for this afternoon, and when it did not occur, we intended to use the FC as a dry weather reference. In the 12  days before FC 2, a total of 67.9  mm of rain was recorded. The last rain fell 17.5  h before FC 2. Outflow at “Shaft” was moderately stable during FC 2, and the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>tension</b> of the upmost soil layer indicates near water-saturation of the soil (Fig.  3). Regarding the stable hydraulic conditions, EEQ values found at “Shaft” were unexpectedly high. The estrogenic activity may originate from cowpats and cow urine, since the grazing period had just ended a day before. Another possible explanation is that estrogens from manure application bound to soil particles were released due to the water-saturation of the soil, which is usually combined with anaerobic conditions.|$|E
40|$|Rising water {{costs and}} concern for {{groundwater}} contamination are driving growers to improve irrigation and fertilization efficiency. A tentative Best Management Practice (BMP) for nitrogen fertilization of watermelon, a high water and nitrogen fertilizer use crop, has been developed, but needs further field verification. Information from tensiometers is used to schedule irrigations and watermelon petiole nitrate levels at critical growth stages are used to recommend rates of nitrogen fertilizer to apply {{with the objective of}} producing economic yields while limiting conditions which favor nitrate leaching to groundwater. In 1991, a field experiment consisting of a complete 3 x 4 factorial arrangement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>tensions,</b> - 12, - 7 and - 4 kPa, and 60, 214 315 and 500 kg N/ha, respectively, applied through a subsurface trickle irrigation system to watermelon was conducted on a Casa Grande sandy loam at the Maricopa Agricultural Center. Petioles were sampled from the youngest mature leaf beginning at the 3 - 4 leaf stage and then at major growth stages until first harvest. Harvested melons were weighed and soluble solids, dry matter and N uptake were determined on two representative melons from each experimental unit. An estimate of vine dry matter and N uptake was also determined. Soil samples were taken at 30 cm depth intervals to 1. 2 m and analyzed for extractable N. A trench profile method was used to determine root distribution patterns for the three <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> treatments receiving optimum N. Petiole nitrate levels were highly responsive to N fertilizer treatments and accurately quantified visual observations of crop N status. Petiole nitrate results also indicated that the preliminary tissue nitrate test was adequate in assisting with a nitrogen management program though minor modifications were necessary. Marketable yield showed a tension x N interaction with a ridge of maximum yield occurring from high soil water tension and low N to low soil water tension and high N with yield reductions {{on either side of the}} ridge. Yield estimates along the ridge ranged from 101 Mg/ha (45. 4 ton /ac) at - 8 kPa tension and 280 kg N/ha to 105 Mg/ha (47. 3 ton /ac) at - 4. 4 kPa tension and 376 kg N/ha. A cost return analysis determined that maximum economic returns were $ 12, 059 /ha when 311 kg N/ha were applied in conjunction with - 6 kPa soil tension (145 cm water). Unaccounted for N, as determined by an N balance method indicated large amounts of N were unaccounted for when high rates of N were applied under wet soil conditions. N loss was concluded to be due to either leaching and/or denitrification under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{biomarker}} {{analysis has}} proven valuable in testing {{the hypothesis that}} attributes of the extant microbiota can directly reflect the occurrence of contaminant biodegradation. Two past research efforts have demonstrated this utility and are described here. A 4. 5 m vertical core was obtained from a diesel fuel oil contamination plume. Core material was assayed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and bacterial membrane phospholipids (PLFA) via a single solvent extraction. Microbial viable biomass and the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacterial PLFA biomarkers were found to be significantly correlated with TPH concentration. The core TPH profile also revealed two distinct areas where the average TPH level of 3000 μg g- 1 fell to near detection limits. Both areas were characterized by a three-fold decrease in the hexadecane/pristane ratio, indicating alkane biodegradation, and a distinct PLFA profile that showed a close similarity to the uncontaminated surface soil. Low-order, incomplete detonations can deposit hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX) into training range surface soils. Since surface soils are exposed to temporal and diurnal moisture cycles, we investigated the effect two very different <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>tensions</b> had on the in situ microbiota and RDX biodegradation. Saturated soils were characterized by rapid RDX biodegradation, 4 day half-life, a decrease in number of species detected and increase in PLFA biomarkers for Gram-negative proteobacteria (n 16 : 1 ω 7 c, n 18 : 1 ω 9 c, and n 18 : 1 ω 7 c) and Gram-positive firmicutes (i 15 : 0 and a 15 : 0). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of endpoint microbial communities indicated a shift from 18 to 36 % firmicutes, the loss of gamma-proteobacteria and the emergence of alpha-proteobacteria. These two past research efforts demonstrated the utility of the lipid biomarker analysis in identifying microbial community characteristics that were associated with two very different soil contaminants. Lipid biomarkers defined areas of TPH biodegradation and identified community shifts as a result of soil conditions that affected explosives fate. Information like this can be used to enhance the predictive power of ecological models such as the Army Training and Testing Area Carrying Capacity for munitions model [ATTACC]...|$|R
40|$|A new {{solution}} satisfying Richards' {{equation is}} derived. The solution, {{which may be}} applied for infiltration or capillary rise, is valid for the condition of an arbitrary <b>moisture</b> <b>tension</b> imposed at the soil surface. When written {{in terms of the}} <b>moisture</b> <b>tension,</b> the new result is very simple, being derived in terms of a similarity variable. The solution applies when the form of the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> characteristic curve is a particular weighted integral of the gradient of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Thus, if the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> characteristic curve is selected a priori, then this condition determines the hydraulic conductivity. The converse of this statement also applies. The cumulative infiltration derived from the solution is of the form of the Green-Ampt infiltration equation; however, {{there is no need to}} assume a steep wetting front as Green and Ampt did. Finally, using the correspondence between Richards' equation and the convection-dispersion equation with a non-linear solute adsorption isotherm, a new exact solution for adsorptive solute transport is derived...|$|R
