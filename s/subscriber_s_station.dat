40|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of communication protocols in broadband {{fixed wireless access}} (BFWA) networks needs the accurate description of the statistical properties of the packet error process. In BFWA networks mainly operating above 20 GHz, a clear line-of-sight (LOS) path is necessary between the base stations (BS) and the <b>subscribers</b> (<b>S).</b> Rain attenuation is the dominant fading mechanism at these frequencies. In this paper, a Markovbased method to estimate the packet loss rate (PLR) performance over a dynamically, due to propagation, varying LOS BFWA channel is presented and tested against simulation results. The proposed method {{is based on the}} firstorder Markovian modeling of the rain attenuation process. The proposed method can serve as a {{performance evaluation}} tool of various modulation and coding schemes (MCS) and is also applicable even when adaptive fade mitigation techniques are employed in the BFWA network. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a study aimed at investigating several habitability and ergonomic {{issues associated with}} the internal environment of totally enclosed motor propelled survival craft (TEMPSC). Numerous anthropometric and structural measures were taken to highlight and investigate various issues of subjects while simulating operation of the coxswain 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>station</b> The experiment was designed to establish the impact of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on habitability and ergonomics in the coxswain station by examining the anthropometric measures of subjects in various clothing ensembles (i. e. levels of PPE) and how they may impact the performance of tasks associated with normal TEMPSC operation (i. e. fastening seatbelts, interacting with the coxswain 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>station,</b> etc.). Select subjects were also examined in the passenger area {{to determine the effect}} of varying levels of PPE on available space (e. g. leg room) and task performance (e. g. seat belt fastening) The {{results of this study suggest}} that PPE, general increase in the size of individuals (due to changing anthropometrics and the requirement of marine abandonment suits), and interior lifeboat design can have a direct impact on the operation and habitability of lifeboats, especially over the long periods of occupancy that are typical of operations in remote northern regions.
