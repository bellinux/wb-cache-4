5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E

40|$|Many {{state public}} utility {{commissions}} (PUCs) {{have started to}} require electric utilities to consider environmental and other externalities in their planning processes. To date <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> has been applied exclusively to the evaluation of new sources of electricity. More comprehensive approaches to <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> would include requiring the utility to dispatch both new and existing generating units according to <b>social</b> <b>cost,</b> or requiring electricity consumers {{to pay a price}} for electricity that reflects its full <b>social</b> <b>cost.</b> Using estimates of external costs taken from the literature, this study contrasts the implications of these three different approaches for utility decision making, electricity prices, demand for electricity and other fuels and the net emissions of selected pollutants for a Maryland utility. We find that applying <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> at the investment stage only may lead to reduced investment in new resources, increased use of existing generation resources and higher emissions of key pollutants. Applying <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> to dispatch generally leads to increased levels of investment in clean technologies, lower levels of emissions and only moderate price increases. Also, <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> of electricity generally has a small impact on consumer demand for natural gas. ...|$|R

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an alternative}} way of specifying the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> function for transportation services. This paper formulates the transportation cost {{function as a}} <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> minimization problem {{in the presence of}} congestion phenomena. This <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> function has an advantage in terms of assessing the cost structure of various transportation modes in a unified manner. In addition, the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> function has a structure that can yield precise information about the structures of other cost functions such as a marginal <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> function and a marginal supplier cost function. This paper illustrates those advantages with the analysis to derive the specific expressions of the various cost functions for highway uses, and for public transit services. Especially, this analysis pinpoints on identifying the difference in the structures of cost functions for the two modes. ...|$|R

In the hybrid model, each of n users is using a mixed strategy to ship its unsplittable traffic over a network consisting of m parallel links.

To evaluate Nash equilibria, we introduce Quadratic <b>Social</b> <b>Cost</b> as {{the sum of the}} expectations of the latencies incurred by the squares of the accumulated traffics. This modeling is unlike the KP model, where <b>Social</b> <b>Cost</b> [26] is the expectation of the maximum latency incurred by the accumulated traffics; but it is like the W model since Quadratic <b>Social</b> <b>Cost</b> can be expressed as a weighted sum of Expected Individual Costs.

Among our findings we expose the counter-intuitive phenomenon that “ignorance is bliss”: Bayesian ignorance may substantially improve the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of selfish agents.

Finally, we present quantitative estimates of the <b>Social</b> <b>Cost</b> of Carbon that use our disentangling {{of different types of}} inequality aversion. We use two integrated assessment models (FUND and RICE) for our numerical exercise to get more robust findings. Our results suggest that inequality considerations lead to a higher (lower) SCC values in high (low) income regions relative to an efficiency based approach, but that the effect is less strong than found in previous studies that use equity weighting. Our central estimate is that the <b>Social</b> <b>Cost</b> of Carbon increases roughly by a factor of 2. 5 from a US perspective when our disentangled equity weighting approach is used...|$|R
