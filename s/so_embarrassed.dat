5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services.

The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E
5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

25|$|Already in 1883, Eckenfelder had {{exhibited}} his Überschwemmung im Neckarthal (Flooding in the Neckar Valley) at {{the international}} art exhibition in the Glaspalast in Munich. Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria purchased his painting Pferde vor dem Pflug (Ploughing Horses) in 1888 and Eckenfelder was {{for the first time}} mentioned in the specialist press. The prince regent took a lively interest in the artistic life of Munich and through such acquisitions supported young artists not only financially, but also with the renown they entailed. He often visited painters in their studios. When he paid his first such visit to Eckenfelder, it was a cold day and the artist was wrapped up against the cold and wearing thick winter slippers; Eckenfelder was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> that soon after he formed the habit of wearing dress shoes and a suit with no smock when working. He maintained this habit until late in life.|$|E

Just before the battle, Jackson was delighted to receive a letter about {{the birth of his}} daughter, Julia Laura Jackson, on November 23. Also before the battle, Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, Lee's dashing and well-dressed cavalry commander, {{presented}} to Jackson a fine general's frock coat that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in Richmond. Jackson's previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements, its buttons removed by admiring ladies. Jackson asked his staff to thank Stuart, saying that although the coat was too handsome for him, he would cherish it as a souvenir. His staff insisted that he wear it to dinner, which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb. Jackson was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for months.|$|E

500|$|Before Mulan, American singer Donny Osmond had {{auditioned for}} the lead role of Hercules in Hercules, a role {{for which he was}} {{ultimately}} not cast because the directors felt that is voice sounded [...] "too old" [...] and [...] "too deep" [...] for the character. Osmond later revealed in an interview with People that he was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by his Hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely. A few months later, Disney contacted Osmond with interest in casting him as the singing voice of Shang after comparing his audition tapes to BD Wong and determining that both actors have [...] "very similar voices." [...] In one scene, Osmond's character, Shang, is hit in the stomach while singing [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You". In order to sound as realistic as possible, Osmond punched himself in the stomach several times while recording the song.|$|E

She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

The company would go out together to watch other shows and performers, including Lotte Lenya and Ethel Merman.|$|E

They're always about love, the pain and anguish of it. But the way I've always written is from observation. They're about what I see other people going through. If the songs were about me I'd be <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> I don't think I'd be able to walk out the front door." [...] She went on to say: [...] "the optimistic songs reveal a bit more of me because that's how I feel. I'm definitely a 'glass is half full' kind of a person." [...] Many of her lyrics do not specify the gender of their subjects and she frequently uses the word [...] "you" [...] rather than a gender pronoun.|$|E
60|$|Sir Edward and Lady Moseley saw the {{attention}} of the Duke with the greatest pleasure.

The latter consideration had great weight in inducing her to cultivate an acquaintance <b>so</b> <b>embarrassing</b> on many accounts.|$|R
50|$|Dana Andrews portrays an American radio {{correspondent}} {{reporting from}} within Nazi Germany, whose principal {{source of information}} is an elderly philatelist.

2500|$|Brady was {{selected}} with pick #199, a compensatory pick, {{in the sixth}} round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

Brady was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> that he briefly left the family home during the sixth round, and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. When the Patriots notified him that he would be drafted Brady was grateful that, he later said, he would not [...] "have to be an insurance salesman". According to Michael Holley's book Patriot Reign, the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay, both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein. Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his subsequent success, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time.|$|E

Frederick Simms, a major investor from Britain insisted that Daimler be brought back into the company. British investor industrialist Frederick Simms was <b>so</b> <b>embarrassed</b> that Daimler and Maybach's car had beaten the DMG entries that he made it a condition of his 350,000 mark purchase of a Phoenix engine license, which would stabilize the corporation's finances, that Daimler, now aged sixty, should return to DMG. Gottlieb Daimler received 200,000 goldmarks in shares, plus a 100,000 bonus. Simms received the right to use the name [...] "Daimler" [...] as his brand name for the engines. In 1895, the year DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, Maybach returned as chief engineer, receiving 30,000 shares.|$|E

Examples from the south of France include five cases of a charivari victim's firing on his accusers: these incidents resulted in two people being blinded and three killed.
