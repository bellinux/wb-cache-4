5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near a misty loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The Doctor has to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird. Accepting his rightful inheritance and responsibility, Jamie bids a reluctant farewell to the Doctor and Zoe to remain with Fiona as the new Laird.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, in {{contrast}} to classical mechanics, it is unavoidable that performing a measurement on the system generally changes its state. More precisely: After measuring an observable A, the system will be in an eigenstate of A; thus the state has changed, unless the system was already in that eigenstate. This expresses a kind of logical consistency: If we measure A twice in the same run of the experiment, the measurements being directly consecutive in time, then they will produce the same results. This has <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> consequences, however, as follows.|$|E
25|$|In September Musquito was escorting a small convoy off {{the north}} coast of Cuba when at daybreak she sighted <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> vessels. When it became {{apparent}} that the vessels were frigates and that they were not answering private signals, Musquito signaled to her charges that they should flee; She herself made for Puerto Padre, with the frigates in pursuit. She crossed the bar and anchored just inside. However, when the pursuers crossed the bar and anchored some 300 to 400 yards away, she surrendered. Her captors were the Spanish frigates Medea (44 guns), Esmerelda (34 guns), and Santa Clara (34 guns).|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he got up to <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E

25|$|In {{obedience}} to the Books of Destiny, <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods {{were believed to be}} duly propitiated... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.|$|E
25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E
500|$|According to Sukhdev Sandhu of The Telegraph, [...] "Let Me In doesn't need {{to exist}} unless, that is, {{the very notion}} of Swedish cinema is strange and {{unpalatable}} to you… What's missing is the alluring otherness of Let the Right One In. That film's brittle textures and haunted ambiance seemed in <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> way to have sprung organically from the nation in which it was set.

500|$|One {{prominent}} {{proponent of}} a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky.

[...] Though cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that [...] "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the American {{broadcast}} of Jesus: The Complete Story were also mixed. While some reviewers described {{the show as}} fascinating and reverent, others were more negative. Writing for The Orlando Sentinel, Hal Boedeker agreed that the computer imaging was spectacular, but {{that the rest of}} the show was a [...] "hodgepodge" [...] that [...] " [...] off on <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> tangents". Eric Mink of The Daily News stated that the show relied too heavily on exaggeration and that it was [...] "sloppy with facts", while Ann Rodgers-Melnick of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described it as [...] "uneven but vivid".|$|E
500|$|Production {{started again}} {{later that year}} when the {{producers}} hired the relatively unknown British television director Peter Webber to head the project, despite his not having directed a feature film before. Tucker and Paterson already knew Webber from several earlier projects; the director discovered the project by accident after visiting their office, where he noticed a poster of Vermeer's work and began discussing it. Webber read the script and described it as being [...] "... about creativity and the link between art and money and power and sex in <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> unholy mixture." [...] Characterising it as a [...] "coming of age" [...] story with a [...] "fascinating dark undertow," [...] Webber deliberately did not read the book prior to filming, {{as he was concerned}} about being influenced by it, opting instead to rely on the script and the period.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} spring 1636 the {{minister}} of Newtown (later renamed Cambridge), Thomas Shepard, began a correspondence with Boston minister John Cotton, and in his letters Shepard notified Cotton of his concern about Cotton's theology, and of <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> opinions circulating {{among the members of}} the Boston church. Cotton, who advocated that God's free grace was the only path to salvation, differed from all of the colony's other ministers, who felt that sanctification (works) was a necessary ingredient to salvation. When Wheelwright arrived in the colony, he became a firm ally of Cotton in these theological differences. Opinions that were first shared in private correspondence soon began to find their way into Shepard's sermons to his Newtown congregation. This [...] "pulpit aggression" [...] did not go unnoticed by Wheelwright, and soon his own sermons began taking a critical view of the [...] "covenant of works" [...] being preached by Shepard.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and then a little debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously. [...] small footprint, fast startup, and clean interface." ...|$|E
500|$|The Conservatives {{did well}} in Atlantic Canada, gaining two seats in Newfoundland and nine in Nova Scotia, and {{sweeping}} Prince Edward Island's four seats. However, in Quebec, they gained only five seats as the province returned 62Liberals. The Tories gained 29seats in Ontario. Howe was defeated by Fisher, and told the media that <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> disease was sweeping the country, but as for him, {{he was going to}} bed. The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba, and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would get at least one more seat than the Liberals so they could get out of an appalling situation. As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada, Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated, [...] "Allister, how does the architect feel?"

500|$|Four of the album's tracks {{would later}} be {{included}} {{as part of the}} Notes from the Past compilation in 2007. Tell All Your Friends was performed live in its entirety at Bamboozle 2011. In a 2011 interview with CMJ, Adam Lazzara and John Nolan chose the album's final track ("Head Club") as their least-favorite Taking Back Sunday song. To celebrate Tell All Your Friends 10th anniversary, the band toured the U.S. in October and November 2012 with support from Bayside. In November the album charted on the Billboard Vinyl Albums chart, peaking at number 8. In June 2013, the band released a live acoustic version of the album and a companion film, TAYF10 Acoustic. The recordings were made in Los Angeles and Chicago. In September, the band performed two electric versions of the album in New Jersey. TAYF10 Acoustic and TAYF10: Live from Starland Ballroom were released as a double-DVD set in December, and TAYF10 Acoustic was released on vinyl. In 2014, Cooper said that Warner Bros. wanted the group to re-record Tell All Your Friends during the Taking Back Sunday (2011) sessions; Cooper replied to them, [...] "Are you nuts?" [...] In 2015, Lazzara said that he disliked his vocals on the album: [...] "I was just yelling everything hoping it fit in there somehow, trying to paint with <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> color".|$|E
500|$|Agent Broyles {{discovers that}} the army did {{classified}} experiments in Edina called [...] "Project Elephant", {{but most of the}} records are gone. The team brings the body, along with a butterfly Walter found in the town and thought Astrid would like, back to the lab in Boston. They discover that both have transformed into deformed versions of themselves. Peter and Olivia go back to Edina to talk with the sheriff and try to locate the owner of the truck. Meanwhile, back in the lab, Walter tries to remember why the case feels so familiar. Throughout the episode Walter had been humming <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> melody, and he and Astrid realize he might previously have worked on the project with the army. The melody was a memory trick Walter used to remind himself where he stored the experiment files so many years ago. The experiment was done by the army in the late 1970s to test how electromagnetic pulses can camouflage soldiers and was conducted on the townspeople; the army was unaware of the long-term effects of the study until it was too late, and the people were stuck in a deformed state. The [...] "hum" [...] hides their deformities from the human eye through a massive electromagnetic pulse that runs through the town, and once they leave and are out of the pulse's reach, their true deformities show.|$|E
500|$|Shaunna Murphy of Entertainment Weekly criticized [...] "Britney's {{complete}} lack of verbal audience interaction [...] and her obviously diminished dancing ability" [...] but also added that [...] "with her slim waist, her dangerously toned legs, and most importantly her engaged, wide-eyed smile, [...] looked happy {{to be there with}} us—the crucial element that has been missing from so many Britney shows of late." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing— or at least tweaking— the past. [...] Spears manipulates pop's virgin-whore complex better than just about anyone, and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of 'Don’t Let Me Be the Last to Know' [...] felt true to the sweep of her career— she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club's heat or into literal thin air." [...] Matt Kivel of Variety commented, [...] "Though visually impressive, the show lacked a truly engaging human quality. Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment, lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself. With her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks, she appeared onstage as <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> blend of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Kraftwerk's Ralf and Florian." [...] However, Jam! Canoe considered the show was [...] "best described as Janet Jackson-like." ...|$|E
