2500|$|During the 2010 Olympics, Weir {{became the}} center of an animal rights {{controversy}} by wearing fox fur on his <b>skating</b> <b>costume</b> at that event. He received attacks from the animal rights groups Friends of Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). When the protests escalated to threats of violence against him, Weir announced he would remove the fur from his costume, although he continued to defend wearing fur as a [...] "personal choice," [...] later noting that the activists managed to overlook the fact that all ice skaters wore leather boots. Threats from animal rights activists also forced Weir to alter his housing arrangements for the Olympics in Vancouver. He had intended to stay in a Vancouver hotel, but for security reasons, chose to stay at the secure Olympic Village, sharing a suite with fellow American figure skater Tanith Belbin.|$|E

50|$|Kerrigan's Olympic skating outfits were {{designed}} by noted fashion designer Vera Wang. Along with Christian Lacroix's designs for Surya Bonaly in 1992, Wang's designs marked a new trend for couture designs in figure skating.

Kerrigan's 1994 Olympic dresses were also designed by Wang. She wore another white dress trimmed with black velvet bands and sheer black sleeves for the original program, and a champagne-colored dress set with 11,500 rhinestones for the free skate.

50|$|Skating {{was popular}} in the 1880s in Ottawa. Ottawans would skate on the Rideau and Ottawa rivers and the Rideau Canal, and at covered rinks such as the Royal and Dey's Rink. As in Montreal, <b>costume</b> <b>skating</b> carnivals were {{highlights}} of the social scene.|$|R
500|$|... “One of the {{principal}} points of attraction in both winter and summer is the Victoria Skating Rink, in Dominion Square. This extensive building is used during the milder {{months of the year}} for horticultural shows, concerts and miscellaneous gatherings. In the winter the doors of this place are thronged with a crowd of sleighs and sleigh drivers, while inside, skaters and spectators form a living, moving panorama, pleasant to look upon. The place is lighted by gas, and men and women, old and young, with a plentiful sprinkling of children, on skates, are practicing all sorts of gyrations. The ladies are prettily and appropriately dressed in <b>skating</b> <b>costumes,</b> {{and some of them are}} proficient in the art of skating. The spectators sit or stand on a raised lege around the ice parallelogram, while the skaters dart off, singly or in pairs, executing quadrilles, waltzes, curves, straight lines, letters, labyrinths, and every conceivable figure. Now and then some one comes to grief in the surging, moving throng; but is quickly on his or her feet again, the ice and water shaken off, and the zigzag resumed. Children skate; boys and girls; ladies and gentlemen, and even dignified military officers. Some skate well, some medium, some shockingly ill; but all skate, or essay to do so. It is the grand Montrealese pastime, and though the ice is sloppy, and the air chill and heavy with moisture, everybody has a good time.” ...|$|R
50|$|Along the way {{he broke}} the record for miles skated in one day by skating 120 miles (139.121 kilometers) {{non-stop}} from Breckenridge, Texas into Dallas, Texas. He headed North and was given a parade in Chicago followed by Playboy Bunnies <b>skating</b> in <b>costume</b> to greet the mayor of Chicago, Jane Byrne. (Dorothy Stratten, Playboy's Playmate of the Month for August 1979 and Playmate of the Year for 1980, appeared uncredited in the movie, Americathon as a stage dancer.) He headed East again through Columbus, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He fell {{for the first time}} in the dangerous curve fronting the Pennsylvania restaurant, Noah's Ark, on a hill where you can view several States. With only minor injuries he headed to Washington, DC where he spent the day with Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, presenting him with a pair of roller skates.|$|R
50|$|The city quickly {{realized}} {{that in order to}} make money they would need to have more events than just speed skating, family <b>skates</b> and <b>costume</b> parties to make money. They decided that since hockey was a relatively new game, it could catch on in Pittsburgh. Sometime between the Queen's game and November 1896, the Casino's management decided to organize two leagues at the rink; an inter-scholastic league for high schools, and a senior ice hockey amateur league named the Western Pennsylvania League. The league played its first season in 1896-97 at the Casino, with four teams - the Pittsburgh Athletic Club (PAC), the Duquesne Country & Athletic Club (or Pittsburgh Duquesne), Western University of Pennsylvania (the University of Pittsburgh today) and a team known as Pittsburgh, or the 'Casino' team. The PAC was managed by Charles S. Miller, who became the league's president.|$|R
50|$|The {{high energy}} show {{features}} {{a bevy of}} 1950s and 1960s rock and roll classics, performed on stage by the cast. The campy sci-fi setting consists of silvered space suit costumes and space ship sets concealing keyboards and drums. The robot, Ariel, is performed by an actor on roller <b>skates,</b> with a <b>costume</b> reminiscent of the original movie's Robby the Robot. The show's dialogue is largely adapted from well-known passages from Shakespeare. There is a part for narrator on pre-recorded video which was played in the original production by Magnus Pyke and in the London production by the noted astronomer and TV personality Sir Patrick Moore. A cast album was released in 1990 by Virgin Records.|$|R
5000|$|In Batman & Robin (1997), Batman {{produces}} a bat-credit card from his utility belt {{which has an}} expiration date of [...] "Forever". This film also added pop-out ice <b>skates</b> to the <b>costumes</b> boots. The basic Batsuit of this film is also noticeably more blue than black in color tone, including the ellipse around the bat symbol instead of the yellow ellipsed bat symbol from the last three films. A second, more elaborately detailed costume (a silvery Arctic version) is worn by [...] "Batman" [...] during the films climax against Mr. Freeze, which {{is identical to the}} prototype [...] "Sonar Suit" [...] from Batman Forever, but with silver accents. As in Batman Forever, the basic Batsuit of this film also features nipples and an enlarged codpiece.|$|R
