40|$|An {{experimental}} setup {{was proposed}} {{for evaluating the}} thermal shielding efficiency of intumescent coatings. In particular, a cone calorimeter as heater source was coupled with a thermocouple as detector of the temperature of steel plates coated with intumescent coatings. According to ENV 13381 - 4 test procedure, the heating curves of the setup was measured by plate thermocouple and compared with ISO 834 standard curve. Meanwhile, the comparison was also made between temperature profiles of <b>blank</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> at different heat fluxes and unprotected steel elements under ISO fire. The possible correlation between bench scale and large scale test was hence discussed. Several factors (heat flux, distance to cone heater, coating thickness, sample size, edge effect and heat insulator) were deeply investigated and discussed: significant relationships between these parameters and the thermal protective properties of the intumescent coating were evidenced; furthermore a fully developed intumescent char could be obtained by controlling the aforementioned parameters. As a conclusion, the proposed bench-scale test {{was found to be}} comparable to the large scale test only in the early heating stage...|$|R
40|$|Laser-based {{ultrasonic}} (LBU) measurement shows {{great promise}} for on-line monitoring of weld quality in tailor-welded blanks. Tailor-welded <b>blanks</b> are <b>steel</b> <b>blanks</b> made from <b>plates</b> of differing thickness and/or properties butt-welded together; {{they are used}} in automobile manufacturing to produce body, frame, and closure panels. LBU uses a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound and a continuous wave (CW) laser interferometer to detect the ultrasound {{at the point of}} interrogation to perform ultrasonic inspection. LBU enables in-process measurements since there is no sensor contact or near-contact with the workpiece. The authors are using laser-generated plate (Lamb) waves to propagate from one plate into the weld nugget as a means of detecting defects. A persistent problem in the analysis of Lamb wave signatures in experimental data is the fact that several different modes appear simultaneously in the signal. The modes overlap in both frequency and time domains. Attempts to separate the overlapping Lamb wave signatures by conventional signal processing methods have been unsatisfactory. This paper reports an exciting alternative to conventional methods. Severely overlapping Lamb waves are found to be readily separable by Bayesian parameter estimation. The authors have used a linear-chirped Gaussian-windowed sinusoid as a model of the Lamb wave mode. For signatures captured in laser ultrasonic data in tailor-welded blanks, this has led to straightforward separation of multiple modes. Furthermore, the resulting parameter sets for the different modes reveal crucial characterizing features of the properties of the workpiece...|$|R

This paper reports the results of the investigation of a number of inspection architectures based on processing of signals from selected plate waves, which are either reflected from or transmitted through the weld zone. Bayesian parameter estimation and wavelet analysis (both continuous and discrete) have shown that the LBU time-series signal is readily separable into components that provide distinguishing features which describe weld quality. The authors anticipate that, in an on-line industrial application, these measurements can be implemented just downstream from the weld cell. Then the weld quality data can be fed back to control critical weld parameters or alert the operator of a problem requiring maintenance. Internal weld defects and deviations from the desired surface profile can then be corrected before defective parts are produced...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Human {{hands are}} {{excellent}} in performing sensory and motor function. We have hypothesized that blood {{flow of the}} hand is dynamically regulated by sympathetic outflow during concentrated finger perception. To identify this hypothesis, we measured radial blood flow (RBF), radial vascular conductance (RVC), heart rate (HR), and arterial blood pressure (AP) during Braille reading performed under the blind condition in nine healthy subjects. The subjects were instructed to read a flat plate with raised letters (Braille reading) for 30 s by the forefinger, and to touch a <b>blank</b> <b>plate</b> as control for the Braille discrimination procedure. Results: HR and AP slightly increased during Braille reading but remained unchanged during the touching of the <b>blank</b> <b>plate.</b> RBF and RVC were reduced during the Braille character discrimination task (decreased by - 46 % and - 49 %, respectively). Furthermore, the changes in RBF and RVC were much greater during the Braille character discrimination task than during the touching of the <b>blank</b> <b>plate</b> (decreased by - 20 % and - 20 %, respectively). Conclusions: These results {{have suggested that the}} distribution of blood flow to the hand is modulated via sympathetic nerve activity during concentrated finger perception...|$|R

Since the mechanical properties of ultra high strength steel are remarkably high, it has become a major setback for forming process and this has led lead to the development of special forming technique for ultra high strength steel called Hot Stamping. In hot stamping, the ultra high strength <b>steel</b> <b>blank</b> is heated to its austenization temperature of about 900 - 950 ◦C inside the furnace. Then, the heated blank is transferred to the tool where forming takes place and simultaneously quench the blank inside the tool. As the tool dwells, the microstructure of the blank becomes fully martensite thus giving the final part strength of up to 1500 MPa. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the Hot Stamping Process, a numerical model of heat transfer need to be developed to simulate the temperature changes of the blank as well as validate the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of the blank and tool contact surface as a function of distance and time.
