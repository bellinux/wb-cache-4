5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small <b>spark</b> <b>was</b> <b>required</b> to ignite a rebellion.|$|R

50|$|The {{autoignition}} temperature or kindling {{point of a}} substance is the lowest temperature at which it spontaneously ignites in normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or <b>spark.</b> This temperature <b>is</b> <b>required</b> to supply the activation energy needed for combustion.

5000|$|Ignition {{systems that}} fire a plug in a {{cylinder}} on its exhaust stroke {{are referred to}} as a [...] "wasted spark" [...] ignition system; as the spark ignites nothing and so <b>is</b> 'wasted'. Wasted <b>spark</b> systems <b>are</b> generally used as a production economy as half the number of coils <b>are</b> <b>required</b> (which consequently have to fire twice as many times), e.g. a four-cylinder four-stroke engine (with a single plug per cylinder) requires only 2 coils alternately firing every 180° of crankshaft rotation, each coil firing every 360° crank rotation to fire all four cylinders. In the 16 Valve Twin <b>Spark</b> 4 coils <b>are</b> <b>required</b> by the eight plugs, so production economy was unlikely to be a factor in the adoption of a wasted spark system.|$|R

5000|$|In February 1998, the National Education Goals Panel convened {{national}} leadership {{to address the}} importance of schools being ready for all children. The panel identified ten keys to a ready school (The National Education Goals Panel, 1998) in recognition that ready children must attend schools that are ready for them. In 2006, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF) Supporting Partnerships to Assure Ready Kids (SPARK) elected to advance the ready school agenda through their Pathways to Ready Schools. All <b>SPARK</b> recipients <b>were</b> <b>required</b> {{to develop a plan}} to address the school readiness concept within their overall SPARK plan. To address the concept of a ready school, the Sisters of Charity Foundation of Canton, the Ohio Department of Education (ODE), Office of Early Learning and School Readiness (EL&SR) and the Ohio Association of Elementary School Administrators (OAESA) entered into a partnership to develop a ready school guidance document. Ohio’s ready school proposal to WKKF emphasized that “readiness” is accomplished through the shared responsibility of early childhood educators and district leadership. The “leadership from both the early education and formal school arena must pave the way to create “enduring ties” that will lead to cohesive educational programs” (SPARK, Ohio Ready for School—Ready Schools proposal).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It is {{not clear}} how many L-type Ca 2 {{channels}} (LCCs) <b>are</b> <b>required</b> to ensure that a Ca 2 <b>spark</b> <b>is</b> triggered during a normal mammalian action potential (AP). We investigated this in rabbit ventricular myocytes by examining both the properties of sparks evoked by APs and the activity of LCCs. We measured Ca 2 sparks evoked by repeated APs with pipettes containing 2 mmol/L EGTA and single LCC activity in cell-attached patches depolarized to 50 mV using pipettes containing 110 mmol/L Ba 2. With 2 mmol/L Ca 2 in the external solution, we observed sparks at the beginning of every evoked AP at numerous locations. Each <b>spark</b> <b>was</b> observed repeatedly at a fixed location and began during a limited interval after the AP peak. These sparks occurred with a probability of approximately unity. However, the chance that an LCC does not open during the interval when a <b>spark</b> <b>is</b> triggered is quite high (0. 13). Therefore, because single channels open with a probability significantly lower than 1, more than one LCC must be available to ensure that <b>sparks</b> <b>are</b> triggered with a probability of approximately unity. We conclude that it is likely that a cluster of LCCs is involved in gating a cluster of ryanodine receptors at the beginning of an AP. (Circ Res. 2003; 92 : 532 - 538.) Key Words: Ca 2 channels Ca 2 sparks excitation-contraction coupling Ca 2 triggers trigger clusters Calcium <b>sparks</b> <b>are</b> local Ca 2 release events from thesarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and are believed to be the elementary basis of the Ca 2 transient.

40|$|The fires which {{recently}} occurred in flock machines in America {{have shown that}} toady's knowledge of the ignitability of flock clouds on flock machines is not sufficient. This is why it has been investigated {{within the scope of}} a research project which minimum <b>spark</b> energy <b>is</b> <b>required</b> to ignite flock clouds on flock machines. The first step taken for this purpose consisted in measuring the minimum ignition energy of more than 60 commercial flock samples on a minimum ignition energy apparatus optimized for high spark energies. It turned out that the minimum ignition energy of flock depends on fiber diameter, fiber length, fiber material, type and quantity of the chemical preparation compound and on the fiber color. Average flock has a minimum ignition energy of about 150 mJ. The lowest value of approx. 80 mJ was obtained for the finest commercial ground cotton flock. If the fines content can accumulate, it is, however, possible that even much lower values can be reached. In a second step it was tried to ignite the most ignitable flock samples by sparks and arc discharges from flock machines. It turned out that the single sparks of DC flock machines which are not ignition-optimized ignited the most ignitable flock samples only at discharge energies above 1300 mJ. Such discharges can occur only during failures of large DC facilities. (orig.)

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} Closed access. Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) uses the {{internal}} {{energy of the}} compressed charge to auto-ignite the mixture. Using internal exhaust gas re-circulation (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next. Although the emission and fuel economy can be largely improved, the engine power output is limited to part-load conditions only. At high-load, conventional <b>Spark</b> Ignition (SI) <b>is</b> <b>required.</b> In this research, both SI and CAI and the transition between the two were investigated on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with Lotus’ Research Active Valve Train (AVT) System.

Nonetheless, CS 3 still results in the fastest training of an MLR using Spark on the cluster. CS 2, i.e. caching only the necessary input data, resulted in the lowest evaluation computation times. It is important to note that CS 2 is the caching strategy used to obtain the results shown in Table  2.|$|R
