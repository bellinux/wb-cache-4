40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites as high-temperature structural materials depends strongly on maximizing the fracture or rupture {{life of the}} load-bearing fiber and matrix constituents. Using high-temperature data measured under <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>test</b> conditions, this study examines in a mechanistic manner the effects of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the creep and fracture behavior {{of a variety of}} SiC fiber types. It is shown that although some fiber types fracture during a large primary creep stage, the fiber creep rate just prior to fracture {{plays a key role in}} determining fiber rupture time (Monkman-Grant theory). If it is assumed that SiC matrices rupture in a similar manner as fibers with the same microstructures, one can develop simple mechanistic models to analyze and optimize the stress-rupture behavior of SiC/SiC composites for applied stresses that are initially below matrix cracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of primary MC decomposition {{and its influence}} on the rupture behaviors in the hot-corrosion resistant superalloy K 444 are investigated by the combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results reveal that the blocky primary MC mainly distributes at interdendritic regions and grain boundaries after the standard heat treatment. During long-term thermal exposure, primary MC decomposes gradually, which can be summarized into three stages. Firstly, the primary MC reacts with the gamma matrix and produces the M 23 C 6 particles and gamma' film, which {{can be described as}} MC + gamma -> M 23 C 6 + gamma'. In the second stage, the un-decomposed primary MC arrests the Ni element and forms the M 6 C particles and eta phase, which can be expressed as MC + gamma -> M 6 C + eta. In the third stage, the remaining primary MC reacts with the diffused Ni element and forms the eta phase with M 6 C and M 23 C 6 particles inside, which can be described as MC + gamma -> M 6 C + M 23 C 6 + eta. The reaction of the second and third stages should be ascribed to the high (Ti + Nb + Hf) /Al ratio and segregated W, Mo and Cr element in the decomposed region. In addition, the platelet-like sigma phase is found in the third stage.

40|$|Advanced {{reusable}} launch {{vehicles will}} likely incorporate fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMC's) in critical propulsion and airframe components. The use of CMC's is highly desirable to save weight, improve reuse capability, and increase performance. One {{of the candidate}} CMC materials is carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC). In potential propulsion applications, such as turbopump rotors and nozzle exit ramps, C/SiC components will be subjected to a service cycle that includes mechanical loading under complex, high-pressure environments containing hydrogen, oxygen, and steam. Degradation of both the C fibers and the SiC matrix are possible in these environments. The objective of this effort was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of C/SiC in various environments relevant to reusable launch vehicle applications. <b>Stress-rupture</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center on C/SiC specimens in air and steam-containing environments.

Substitutions of 3. 0 % W, 3. 0 W + 0. 9 V or Mo increased from 3. 0 % to 5. 8 % {{were made for}} the Cb in these alloys. Two additional alloys, one containing 3. 49 % Cb and 1. 10 % Ti and another containing 3. 89 % Cb and 1. 29 % Ti were also studied. Tensile properties at rooom and elevated temperatures, <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>tests,</b> and an analysis of extracted phases were carried out {{for each of the}} alloys. Additions of solid solution elements to a reduced Cb alloy had no significant effect on the properties of the alloys under either process condition. The solution and age alloys with substitutions of 1. 27 % i at 3. 89 % Cb had tensile properties similar top hose of the original alloy and stress-rupture properties superior to the original alloy. The improved stress-rupture properties were the result of significant precipitation of Ni 3 Ti-gamma prime in the alloy, which is more stable than gamma' at the elevated temperatures. At lower temperatures, the new alloy benefits from gamma' strengthening. With more precise control and proper processing, the reduced Cb direct-age alloy could substitute for Alloy 718 in high strength applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find an improved method of predicting the failure behavior of Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) pipe-work at long times under complex stress states which include a combination of internal pressure and axial load. The procedure currently used to qualify GRE tubing (as in ISO 19464 and ASTM 2992) is expensive and time-consuming, as it involves constant pressure <b>stress-rupture</b> <b>tests,</b> carried out over a period of more than 15 months. If the design of pipe is changed the procedure needs to be repeated. Another problem is that the current method only quantifies the behavior accurately when the pipe is under pure hydrostatic stress. The technique used to allow for the effect of axial loads can be quite inaccurate. The present work will attempt to develop a more effective method of predicting long term failure behavior under combinations of internal pressure and axial load. New models will be developed to quantify the growth of pipe wall damage that occurs under these conditions. An important question to be answered is whether or not there are stress levels below which no damage takes place and whether these stress levels would form a suitable basis for design. To date a novel type of pipe test specimen has been developed, which will enable the pipe to be easily subjected to combinations of internal pressure and axial load. Test spools have been manufactured and supplied by Future Pipe Industries and testing should begin shortly. Acoustic emission will be examined as a method of characterizing the development of damage in the pip...|$|R
