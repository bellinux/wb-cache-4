A fire was burning {{in a corner of the}} Lair, and in front of it, partly covered with a <b>sheet,</b> <b>lay</b> the Painted Lady, dead. Grizel stood beside the body guarding it, her hands clenched, her eyes very strange. [...] "You sha'n't touch her!"

60|$|They {{went into}} a room hewn out of the solid clay. Carpet was {{stretched}} on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture. There was a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed, beside which a middle-aged lady was seated. She had a kindly face which seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture of restraint. She pointed to the bed, where a <b>sheet</b> <b>lay</b> limply over the angles of a wasted frame. The face was to the wall.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stairway}} being now partly cleared, most of {{the crowd}} having rushed down to the street to observe the flight and pursuit, Dr. Helberson mounted to the landing, followed by Harper. At a door in the upper passage an officer denied them admittance. [...] "We are physicians," [...] said the doctor, and they passed in. The room was full of men, dimly seen, crowded about a table. The newcomers edged their way forward and looked over the shoulders {{of those in the}} front rank. Upon the table, the lower limbs covered with a <b>sheet,</b> <b>lay</b> the body of a man, brilliantly illuminated by the beam of a bull's-eye lantern held by a policeman standing at the feet. The others, excepting those near the head--the officer himself--all were in darkness. The face of the body showed yellow, repulsive, horrible! The eyes were partly open and upturned and the jaw fallen; traces of froth defiled the lips, the chin, the cheeks. A tall man, evidently a doctor, bent over the body with his hand thrust under the shirt front. He withdrew it and placed two fingers in the open mouth. [...] "This man has been about six hours dead," [...] said he. [...] "It is a case for the coroner." ...|$|E

50|$|During the Illinoian Stage, the Laurentide {{ice sheet}} covered about 85 percent of Illinois. At its maximum extent during this stage, this ice sheet reached its southernmost extent in North America near Carbondale, Illinois.

40|$|Structure and {{evolution}} of large scale photospheric and coronal magnetic fields in the interval 1976 - 1983 were studied using observations from the Stanford Solar Observatory and a potential field model. The solar wind in the heliosphere is organized into large regions in which the magnetic field has a componenet either toward or away from the sun. The model predicts {{the location of the}} current sheet separating these regions. Near solar minimum, in 1976, the current <b>sheet</b> <b>lay</b> within a few degrees of the solar equator having two extensions north and south of the equator. Soon after minimum the latitudinal extent began to increase. The sheet reached to at least 50 deg from 1978 through 1983. The complex structure near maximum occasionally included multiple current sheets. Large scale structures persist for up to two years during the entire interval. To minimize errors in determining the structure of the heliospheric field particular attention was paid to decreasing the distorting effects of rapid field evolution, finding the optimum source surface radius, determining the correction to the sun's polar field, and handling missing data. The predicted structure agrees with direct interplanetary field measurements taken near the ecliptic and with coronameter and interplanetary scintillation measurements which infer the three dimensional interplanetary magnetic structure. During most of the solar cycle the heliospheric field cannot be adequately described as a dipole...|$|E
40|$|The first Cenozoic ice sheets {{initiated}} in Antarctica from the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains and other highlands {{as a result}} of rapid global cooling ~ 34 million years ago. In the subsequent 20 million years, at a time of declining atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and an evolving Antarctic circumpolar current, sedimentary sequence interpretation and numerical modelling suggest that cyclical periods of ice-sheet expansion to the continental margin, followed by retreat to the subglacial highlands, occurred up to thirty times. These fluctuations were paced by orbital changes and were a major influence on global sea levels. Ice-sheet models show that the nature of such oscillations is critically dependent on the pattern and extent of Antarctic topographic lowlands. Here we show that the basal topography of the Aurora Subglacial Basin of East Antarctica, at present overlain by 2 - 4. 5 km of ice, is characterized by a series of well-defined topographic channels within a mountain block landscape. The identification of this fjord landscape, based on new data from ice-penetrating radar, provides an improved under¬standing of the topography of the Aurora Subglacial Basin and its surroundings, and reveals a complex surface sculpted by a succession of ice-sheet configurations substantially different from today's. At different stages during its fluctuations, the edge of the East Antarctic Ice <b>Sheet</b> <b>lay</b> pinned along the margins of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, the upland boundaries of which are currently above sea level and the deepest parts of which are more than 1 km below sea level. Although the timing of the channel incision remains uncertain, our results suggest that the fjord landscape was carved by at least two ice- flow regimes of different scales and directions, each of which would have over-deepened existing topographic depressions, reversing valley floor slopes...|$|E

40|$|Artificial post-graphene {{elemental}} 2 D {{materials have}} received much attention recently.

We have grown epitaxial 2 D stanene on a Ag(1 1 1) single crystal template and determined its crystalline structure synergetically by scanning tunneling microscopy, high- resolution synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy, and advanced rst principles calculations. From the STM images, we show that stanene forms a nearly planar structure in large domains.

30|$|Energy-saving {{water pump}} and {{efficient}} semipermeable membranes are the cores of reverse osmosis technology. Applying nanotechnology {{to improve the}} performance is a fashion in recent years. Based on the competitive effect of water’s spontaneous infiltration of two sides of a carbon nanotube, we design a water pump that makes use of the natural permeability by weakening one side’s competitiveness based on a small graphite <b>sheet</b> <b>laying</b> on the membrane. According to molecular dynamic simulations, continues net flux is observed. The motion mode of the sheet is the key for the performance. For the pure Brownian motion without any dynamical load, we find two water molecules per nanosecond flux, while the flux induced by the unidirectional motion can be several times enhanced, depending on the external force. The Brownian motion {{is similar to the}} physical mechanism of osmotic pressure, and the unidirectional motion shows great performance that has huge applications for reverse osmosis. Our work creatively proposes a new strategy to pump water molecules crossing though a nanochannel, inspiring for nanofluidic device designers.|$|R

There was a big room. On the floor a small binnacle lamp--that had found its way to the house years ago from the lumber-room of the Flash--did duty for a night-light. It glimmered very small and dull in the great darkness.
