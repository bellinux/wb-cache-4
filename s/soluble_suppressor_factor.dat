These factors, derived from human material, preclude easy corroboration by other investigators. To gain a general understanding of <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors</b> {{and to avoid}} the necessary restrictions of human experimentation, an animal model was devised. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected ip with the Walker 256 carcinoma. The resultant ascites {{proved to be a}} stable, reproducible source of <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors.</b> Ascites inhibited phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -induced blastogenesis of normal splenocytes by 98 %. The possibility of a toxic effect was eliminated by vital staining of splenocytes and by examination in a specific lymphotoxin assay. Suppressor activity persisted after heating at 100 °C for 40 min. Extraction by lipid solvents revealed that the bulk of suppressor activity resides in the lipid phase. The active fraction of heat-treated ascites passed through an Amicon PM- 10 filter. Thin-layer chromatography revealed the presence of prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 a. Tissue culture supernatants from short-term cultures derived from tumor-bearing animals revealed suppressor activity from thymus, spleen, and liver cultures (97, 91, and 71 %, respectively). No suppressor activity was detected in cultures of cancer cells. This study has demonstrated in this animal model that prostaglandins {{play a major role in}} suppression of lectin-induced blastogenesis.

This study investigated whether this inhibition {{is the result of}} suppressor or cytotoxic activity. Pretreatment of M phi with indomethacin in vivo, in vitro or both failed to reverse the inhibition of T-cell proliferation induced by poly I:C-treated, keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) -pulsed M phi, suggesting that prostaglandin production does not mediate the inhibition of T-cell proliferation. The transfer of supernatants from cultures containing poly I:C-treated, KLH-pulsed M phi to cultures containing saline-treated, KLH-pulsed M phi and T cells did not inhibit T-cell proliferation, suggesting that the inhibition of T-cell proliferation by poly I:C is not mediated by the production of <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors.</b> As addition of poly I:C-treated, KLH-pulsed M phi to cultures containing saline-treated, KLH-pulsed M phi did not significantly inhibit KLH-specific T-cell proliferation, the inhibition of T-cell proliferation is also not mediated by direct cell contact or short-range <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors.</b> In addition, poly I:C-treated, KLH-pulsed M phi did not induce cytolysis of syngeneic T cells.

Suppression of the proliferative response in MLC reached maximal levels when added SSF-containing supernatant approximated 20 % by volume of the culture medium. Suppression in the MLC was found to act at the proliferative stage. SSF acts independently of cytotoxicity and is stable at 56 degrees C for 30 min but is inactivated at higher temperatures.

SF or SF-adsorbed heat-killed macrophages failed to transmit suppression in silica-treated macrophage-depleted mice when injected i. p., while SF-adsorbed live macrophages could transmit suppression. In macrophage-depleted mice suppression could be transmitted by SF-adsorbed heat-killed macrophages on i. v. inoculation.

One mechanism whereby these Con-A activated spleen cells suppress Ig synthesis {{appears to be}} by the secretion of a <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factor(s)</b> since supernatants of Con-A stimulated splenocytes also suppress the polyclonal synthesis of immunoglobulin by human spleen cells. In this study, we report that supernatants of Con-A activated spleen cells suppress the in vitro synthesis of IgG, IgM and IgA by human spleen cells cultured with PWM. Our {{results indicate that the}} <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factor(s)</b> blocks an early stage in the differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells without affecting the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulin by more mature lymphocytes which appear to be irreversibly committed toward the pathway of synthesizing immunoglobulin. In addition, we studied the ability of normal human spleen cells to synthesize polyclonal immunoglobulin when cultured with either the T-cell dependent PWM or T-cell independent mitogens lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Nocardia. Our results demonstrate that normal human splenic mononuclear cells cultured with either Nocardia, LPS or PWM are significantly stimulated to synthesize polyclonal IgG, IgM and IgA.

These cells probably operate via <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors</b> and require auxiliary cells. The duration of contact sensitivity itself is controlled by another mechanism, which is antibody.

Homologous transfection of TcR alpha cDNA into a TcR alpha- beta+ clone reconstituted both CD 3 -TcR expression and suppressor function. Furthermore, suppressor activity from TcR beta- variants was specifically absorbed by antigen and anti-TcR alpha antibodies, but not by anti-CD 3 or anti-TcR beta affinity columns.

Immunoregulatory actions of SSF include suppression of: polyclonal B cell activation, proliferative responses of normal PBL, and natural killer (NK) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We examined {{the ability of}} the monosaccharides fucose (Fuc), galactose (Gal), glucose (Glc), and mannose (Man) to reverse SSF-mediated suppression of NK activity.

Fuc or Gal was added to PBL at various times after addition of SSF. SSF-mediated suppression of NK cytotoxicity becomes irreversible with respect to these monosaccharides during the first 24 hr of PBL exposure to SSF. To explore the mechanism behind this block of SSF-mediated suppression, Fuc or Gal (50 mM) was cultured with PBL for 24 hr before addition of SSF, or with SSF for 24 hr before addition to PBL.

Experiments were done to investigate the nature of these target molecules and to determine what cell types expressed them. It was found that purified lymph node T cells are suppressed by SSF indicating that T cells express the acceptor molecules. Adsorption experiments showed that the only cells capable of adsorbing the suppressor factor are DNFB- immune T cells from donors which share with the factor-producing strain either the H- 2 K or H- 2 D locus. This adsorption can be specifically blocked by pretreating the immune LN cells with antibodies directed against H- 2 K and/or H- 2 D determinants or against the hapten DNP but not by antibodies against Ia or theta-antigens.

Culture supernates of CL manifested greater suppression of the NK ability of allogeneic PBL than culture supernates produced by autologous PBL. These {{results are consistent with}} a model that suggests differential partitioning of lymphocyte subpopulations between colostrum and peripheral blood...|$|R
40|$|A single {{intraperitoneal}} injection of bacterial cell walls derived from groupA streptococci (SCW) ' into susceptible rats {{results in the}} development of acute and chronic erosive polyarthritis (1, 2). The pathology of the lesion leading to joint destruction {{has been shown to be}} aT cell-dependent, cell-mediated response to the deposition of the group A streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide polymers in the synovium (3 - 5). Furthermore, these chronic joint lesions share many common histopathologic, radiologic, and clinical features with human rheumatoid arthritis (6). Another apparent shared feature in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and rodents with SCW-induced arthritis is impaired immunoregulation and suppression of the immune system. Patients with arthritis frequently exhibit suppressed lymphoid cell functions (6 - 10), and depressed lymphoid cell activity has also been reported in SCW treated rats (2, 11, 12). The mechanism of aberrant immune responsiveness associated with these chronic inflammatory lesions is unknown, although adherent cells have been implicated (2, 10) and deficient IL- 2 production has also been reported (11). Because of the potential importance of impaired immunoregulation in the evolution of chronic inflammatory lesions such as arthritis, we have used the experimental model of SCW-induced chronic inflammation to explore the cellular and molecular pathways of suppressed immune responsiveness. In this study, we document a role for the adherent macrophage population in mediating the suppressed lymphoproliferative responses characteristic of the spleens of SCW-treated Lewis (LEW) rats. Furthermore, this suppression is mediated by a <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factor</b> released by SCW-activated macrophages within the spleen. Subsequent studies to characterize this suppressor activity revealed it to be consistent with the polypeptide, transforming growth factor R (TGRR) ...|$|E
40|$|Total {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes (PBL) and isolated subpopulations from children with Down's Syndrome (DS) and age-matched healthy controls were investigated for their (1) natural killer (NK) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activities, (2) interleukin 2 (IL- 2) -induced augmentation of NK activity, (3) lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC), (4) ability of serum- and culture-derived <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factor(s)</b> to inhibit NK activity of normal lymphocytes, and (5) capacity to produce interferon (IFN) against tumor targets in vitro. T lymphocytes from DS patients demonstrated significantly decreased NK activity against K 562 target cells compared to controls. DS lymphocytes also demonstrated {{a significant reduction}} in LDCC activity and IL- 2 -induced enhancement of NK activity. Furthermore, the ability of DS lymphocytes to produce IFN in vitro against K 562 target cells was also significantly lower than that for normal PBL. Although sera from DS patients showed a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the NK activity of allogeneic normal PBL than normal sera, culture supernates from DS lymphocytes demonstrated suppressive effects comparable to culture supernates from normal PBL. These studies suggest an association between the decreased NK activity of T-cell subpopulations and lower IFN production by PBL from patients with DS...|$|R
40|$|Supernatants from {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells obtained from certain {{patients with the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or its prodrome were capable of depressing spontaneous and pokeweed mitogen-driven B lymphocyte differentiation into plasmacytes, and the proliferative responses of T cells to specific antigen. These <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors</b> (SSF) were present in uniquely high concentrations, with significant differences from healthy controls and from patients with various other conditions previously associated with factor-mediated immunosuppression. T cell-independent functions were not modified by SSF. Suppression was not genetically constrained, and {{did not appear to be}} mediated by cytotoxicity, prostaglandin, or alpha or gamma interferons. SSF was a product of the interaction of T lymphocytes with adherent cells. T cells or T cell factors from AIDS patients, but not from normal controls, could collaborate with control adherent cells in the formation of SSF. Restoration of DNA synthesis-independent differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasmacytes in SSF-treated cultures was realized by addition of reducing agents, such as 2 -mercaptoethanol, on culture initiation. These data suggest inhibitory mechanisms possibly related to that of concanavalin A-induced soluble immune response suppression, and perhaps offer clues to clinically applicable substances which are potentially capable of mitigating such responses...|$|R
40|$|Adjuvant {{arthritis}} can {{be induced}} {{by a single}} injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) in the highly susceptible Lewis (LEW) rat strain, but not the resistant Wistar A. G. (WAG) strain. This strain-dependent susceptibility to the disease is correlated with differences in T suppressor cells regulation. In WAG rats, indeed, the in vitro response in LEW alloantigens was highly inhibited 11 days after FCA injection, while LEW rats in vitro response to WAG alloantigens was slightly increased. Furthermore, spleen cells from WAG rats given FCA 4 days before exhibited T cell-mediated active suppression of WAG in vitro response to LEW alloantigens when they were co-cultured with WAG normal spleen cells. This suppression was abolished by removal of T cells on nylon wool column. A previous irradiation of these T cells also inhibited their suppressive effect, suggesting that FCA-induced suppression {{might be due to}} <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factor(s).</b> On the other hand T cells from FCA treated LEW rats did not produce any modification of LEW in vitro response to WAG alloantigens. This suggests that the severe arthritis induced in LEW rats could be correlated with a defect of their suppressor cells functions, while in WAG rats FCA activated suppressor T cells could control the disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} {{and evaluation}} of antigen-induced suppressor T (Ts) 1 cell networks have considerably evolved {{in the last several}} years (1 - 4). While there are now a variety of ways to induce such Ts cells, one of the most intriguing approaches has been to intravenously inject ligand-derivatized lymphocytes into naive recipients, and to later use these recipients as suppressor cell donors (1, 3). This technique has been successfully used with haptens (5 - 7), polysaccharides (8), and immunoglobulins (9, 10) in mice. While suppressor networks generated by ligand-derivatized lymphocytes can have features that are inherently unique to a particular system, they also tend to share several characteristics. They typically involve several sets of sequentially activated Ts cells with complementary specificities; they often operate under H- 2 and Igh- 1 restrictions; and they usually secrete <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>factors</b> that mediate complex interactive functions (1, 3, 11). We have used an experimental model of interstitial nephritis (anti-tubular basement membrane [anti-TBM] disease) to determine if tubular antigen-derivatized lymphocytes induce or activate a disease-protective Ts cell network in an autoimmune setting. Interstitial nephritis can be induced in prototype SJL and BALB/c mice with an injection of renal TBM in adjuvant (12 - 14). Anti-TBM antibodies (Ab) appear by 10 d and interstitial lesions typically develop by 6 - 10 wk. Susceptibility to disease is defined by genes in H- 2 K and Igh- 1 (15), and is mediated by an effector T cell repertoire containing cytotoxic and delayed-typ...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{examined the}} generation of T cell released suppressor activity (TRSA) from peripheral blood T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{in response to a}} <b>soluble</b> <b>suppressor</b> activating <b>factor</b> (SAF) produced by a 6 -thioguanine resistant mutant of the human T cell line CEM. We reported (Lau et al., 1985 Clin. exp. Immunol. 61, 481) that T cells from a substantial proportion of RA patients exhibited impaired TRSA release. To delineate further the TRSA abnormality observed in patients with active RA, we evaluated the kinetics of SAF activation, precursor frequency of SAF reactive cells and quantity of activated SAF released on a per cell basis. The results showed that a lower precursor frequency of SAF reactive cells accounted for defective TRSA release in a majority of RA patients, while TRSA release on a per cell basis was normal. The defective TRSA response to SAF could not be explained by abnormal dose kinetics of SAF, time kinetics of TRSA release or prior in vivo lymphocyte activation of the RA T cells...|$|R
