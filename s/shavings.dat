5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal <b>shavings,</b> {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium <b>shavings</b> in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|Carrots can {{be stored}} for several months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can {{be placed in a}} bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood <b>shavings,</b> or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and <b>shavings</b> can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
5|$|The 1960 SOLAS Convention {{sought to}} control {{this sort of}} problem. These {{regulations}} required the upper ballast tanks designed in a manner to prevent shifting. They also required cargoes to be leveled, or trimmed, using excavators in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces {{the amount of the}} cargo's surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal, iron, and metal <b>shavings.</b>|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood <b>shavings</b> until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|The crew filmed several {{exterior}} {{scenes in}} the countryside near Madrid; the Cimmerian village was built in a forest near the Valsaín ski resort, south of Segovia. About onemillion pesetas ($12,084) worth of marble <b>shavings</b> were scattered {{on the ground to}} simulate snow. The Wheel of Pain scene took place in the province of Ávila. Conan's encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca. Most outdoor scenes were shot in the province of Almería, which offered a semiarid climate, diverse terrain (deserts, beaches, mountains), and Roman and Moorish structures that could be adapted for many settings.|$|E
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting <b>shavings</b> catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice <b>shavings</b> are {{thrown into the}} air and fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} <b>shavings</b> in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser <b>shavings.</b> The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood <b>shavings</b> and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil <b>shavings.</b> In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Evans {{was born}} in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755 to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he {{purchased}} a large farm {{to the north of}} Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans's early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved, however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely frugal man, forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and <b>shavings</b> of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company, but saw no active service during the war.|$|E

25|$|The Ainu have no priests by profession; {{instead the}} village chief {{performs}} whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies {{are confined to}} making libations of sake, uttering prayers, and offering willow sticks with wooden <b>shavings</b> attached to them. These sticks are called inaw (singular) and nusa (plural).|$|E
25|$|According to Master of Wine Clive Coates, {{the wines}} of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil are noted for a {{distinctive}} raspberry aroma {{that can also}} have elements of pencil <b>shavings.</b> Compared to Chinon, the wines tend to be slightly more austere with more noticeable acidity. While very similar, Coates notes that Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil {{can be a little}} more aromatic and a bit lighter than neighboring Bourgueil.|$|E
25|$|Aging plants {{presented}} a second challenge of this period, with maintenance difficulties and less flexibility to handle {{new products and}} flow patterns. Operations were beset by pollution, noise and smoke, in spite of new procedures for baling <b>shavings.</b> Leadership at the plant was also in transition, with Gene Nist as {{vice president at the}} Tacoma plant and Emmet Nist vice president in Seattle.|$|E
25|$|Planing wood {{along its}} side grain {{should result in}} thin <b>shavings</b> rising above {{the surface of the}} wood as the edge of the plane iron is pushed forward, leaving a smooth surface, but {{sometimes}} splintering occurs. This is largely a matter of cutting with the grain or against the grain respectively, referring to the side grain of the piece of wood being worked.|$|E
25|$|Other {{efficient}} stoves {{are based}} on Top Lit updraft (T-LUD) or Woodgas or Smoke Burner stove a principle applied and made popular by Dr. Thomas Reed, which use small pieces of sticks, chips of wood or <b>shavings,</b> leaves, etc., as fuel. The efficiency is very high up to 50 percent as compared to traditional stoves which are 5 to 15 percent on an average.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} that the {{electrical}} connectors between the torpedoes and the internal tube door were unreliable and often required the torpedo crews to open and re-close the door to clean the connection before an electrical contact could be established. Kursks crew had not fired a torpedo for three years, and that torpedo was a much simpler battery-powered type. The crew had to complete specific maintenance steps {{on a regular basis}} and before firing a torpedo. This included cleaning the torpedo tube of lubricants, metal <b>shavings,</b> and dust that accumulate during long periods of inactivity.|$|E
25|$|Much wood collage art is {{considerably}} smaller in scale, framed and hung as a painting would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood <b>shavings,</b> or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or {{on a wooden}} board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-relief collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and textural variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and {{taking advantage of the}} language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.|$|E
25|$|From about July 1942 {{to about}} September 1943, {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens (a major causative agent in gas gangrene) and Clostridium tetani, the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels {{at both ends of}} the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood <b>shavings</b> and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The Lego Group {{began in}} the {{carpentry}} workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen, in Billund, Denmark. In 1916, Christiansen purchased a woodworking shop in Billund which had been in business since 1895. The shop mostly helped construct houses and furniture, and had a small staff of apprentices. The workshop burned down in 1924 when a fire ignited some wood <b>shavings.</b> Ole Kirk constructed a larger workshop, and worked towards expanding his business even further. When the Great Depression hit, Ole Kirk had fewer customers and had to focus on smaller projects. He began producing miniature versions of his products as design aids. It was these miniature models of stepladders and ironing boards that inspired him to begin producing toys.|$|E
25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic <b>shavings</b> and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.|$|E
500|$|The pure {{element is}} {{relatively}} stable in air in bulk form, due to passivation of a protective oxide (...) film that forms on the surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10µm when yttrium is heated to 750°C in water vapor. When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; <b>shavings</b> or turnings {{of the metal}} can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400°C. Yttrium nitride (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000°C in nitrogen.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{commercial}} processes was the [...] "fast method" [...] or [...] "German method", first practised in Germany in 1823. In this process, fermentation {{takes place in a}} tower packed with wood <b>shavings</b> or charcoal. The alcohol-containing feed is trickled into the top of the tower, and fresh air supplied from the bottom by either natural or forced convection. The improved air supply in this process cut the time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks.|$|E
500|$|Briarcliff Farms' second location, in {{the town}} of Pine Plains, {{initially}} covered [...] The farm, [...] from the hamlet of Pine Plains, was adjacent to the Central New England Railway in the shallow Stissing Basin and [...] from the Hudson River. The Pine Plains farm had three barns, each built {{at a cost of about}} $20,000 ($ in [...] ) and housing 200 Jersey cattle bedded in sawdust or <b>shavings.</b> Barn B was in the Pine Plains hamlet of Bethel and Barn C was farther south, {{in the town}} of Stanford.|$|E
500|$|Richard and Molly had ten children. The first child, Mary, {{was born}} in 1794. She was {{followed}} by another girl, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood <b>shavings</b> to the fire. The incident {{was reported in the}} Bath Chronicle on 27 December 1798: [...] "A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some <b>shavings</b> ... The girl's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death." [...] When another daughter was born just five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived {{more than a couple of}} years. Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood. The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not very unusual. Almost half the children born in Britain throughout the 19th century died before the age of 5, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like smallpox and measles were particularly common.|$|E
500|$|Remembering his {{experience}} with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a chess board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge at one another. The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. The trick was achieved by coating the pieces {{in a mixture of}} rooster's blood, iron <b>shavings,</b> and [...] "magnetic dust". In Science and Civilisation in China (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have been very effective.|$|E
500|$|When Þjazi arrives home {{he finds}} that Iðunn is gone. Þjazi gets [...] "his eagle shape", and chases Loki, which causes a storm wind. The Æsir see a falcon flying with a nut, {{as well as the}} {{pursuing}} eagle, so they bring out loads of wood <b>shavings.</b> The falcon flies over the fortification of Asgard and drops down by the wall. The eagle, however, misses the falcon and is unable to stop. His feathers catch fire and the eagle falls within the gates of Asgard. The Æsir kill the jötunn Þjazi [...] "and this killing is greatly renowned." ...|$|E
500|$|Metallurgical work {{concentrated}} on uranium and plutonium. Although {{it had been}} discovered over a century before, little was known about uranium, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many references gave a figure for its melting point that was off by nearly [...] Edward Creutz investigated it and discovered that at the right temperature range, uranium could be hammered and rolled, and drawn into the rods required by the production reactor design. It was found that when uranium was cut, the <b>shavings</b> would burst into flame. Working with Alcoa and General Electric, the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug.|$|E
500|$|The main {{entrance}} hall is a grand, high ceilinged room using oak panelling salvaged from the Warwick Priory. The ornate, [...] "L" [...] shaped staircase {{is actually a}} reconstruction of the original sixteenth-century staircase of the priory, repurchased from an antique shop in London, and includes an acanthus leaf newel cap and overscaled newel posts in its design. [...] The floor in the entrance hall is fashioned from a composite known as zenitherm, made up of terracotta, asphalt and wood <b>shavings,</b> with tiles arranged in an irregular rectangular formation. [...] The room beyond the entrance hall also uses oak paneling, but uses materials derived from another English manor house in Warwickshire. The floor is made of wide-plank oak and has a fifteenth-century stained glass oval window in the south wall, using leaded glass from the Warwick Priory. [...] A Tudor rose motif, which the Weddells hired Italian artisans to complete in 1925-26, {{is located on the}} plaster ceiling. [...] Adjacent to this room to the east is a smaller drawing room, this time with heraldic reliefs on the plaster ceiling and featuring a cylindrical Florentine soapstone fireplace.|$|E
