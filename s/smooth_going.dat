40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel, self-validating {{approach}} for detecting curved reflection symmetry patterns from real, unsegmented images. Our method {{benefits from the}} observation that any curved symmetry pattern can be approximated by a sequence of piecewise rigid reflection patterns. Pairs of symmetric feature points are first detected (including both inliers and outliers) and treated as ‘particles’. Multiple-hypothesis sampling and pruning are used to sample a <b>smooth</b> path <b>going</b> through inlier particles to recover the curved reflection axis. Our approach generates an explicit supporting region of the curved reflection symmetry, which is further used for intermediate self-validation, making the detection process more robust than prior state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results on 200 + images demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. ...|$|R

5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as <b>smooth</b> when <b>going</b> down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|R
40|$|Many {{problems}} in Physics are described by dynamical {{systems that are}} conformally symplectic (e. g., mechanical systems with a friction proportional to the velocity, variational problems with a small discount or thermostated systems). Conformally symplectic systems are characterized by the property that they transform a symplectic form into a multiple of itself. The limit of small dissipation, which {{is the object of}} the present study, is particularly interesting. We provide all details for maps, but we present also the modifications needed to obtain a direct proof for the case of differential equations. We consider a family of conformally symplectic maps f_μ, ϵ defined on a 2 d-dimensional symplectic manifold M with exact symplectic form Ω; we assume that f_μ,ϵ satisfies f_μ,ϵ^*Ω=λ(ϵ) Ω. We assume that the family depends on a d-dimensional parameter μ (called drift) and also on a small scalar parameter ϵ. Furthermore, we assume that the conformal factor λ depends on ϵ, {{in such a way that}} for ϵ= 0 we have λ(0) = 1 (the symplectic case). We study the domains of analyticity in ϵ near ϵ= 0 of perturbative expansions (Lindstedt series) of the parameterization of the quasi [...] periodic orbits of frequency ω (assumed to be Diophantine) and of the parameter μ. Notice that this is a singular perturbation, since any friction (no matter how small) reduces the set of quasi-periodic solutions in the system. We prove that the Lindstedt series are analytic in a domain in the complex ϵ plane, which is obtained by taking from a ball centered at zero a sequence of smaller balls with center along <b>smooth</b> lines <b>going</b> through the origin. The radii of the excluded balls decrease faster than any power of the distance of the center to the origin...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{properties of}} conjugated circular arcs connecting two {{points on the}} plane with set directions of tan- gent vectors are studied in the work. It is shown that pairs of conjugated circular arcs with the same conditions in frontier points create one-parameter set of smooth curves tightly filling all the plane. One of the basic properties of this set {{is the fact that}} all coupling points of circular arcs are on the circular curve going through the initially given points. The circle radius depends on the direction of tangent vectors. Any point of the circle curve, named auxiliary in this work, determines a pair of conjugated arcs with given boundary conditions. One more condition of the auxiliary circle curve is that it divides the plane into two parts. The arcs going from the initial point are out of the circle limited by this circle curve and the arcs coming to the final point are inside it. These properties are the basis for the method of conjugated circular arcs tracing pro- posed in this article. The algorithm is rather simple and allows to fulfill all the needed plottings using only the divider and ruler. Two concrete examples are considered. The first one is related to the problem of tracing of a pair of conjugated arcs with the minimal curve jump when going through the coupling point. The second one demonstrates the possibility of trac- ing of the <b>smooth</b> curve <b>going</b> through any three points on the plane under condition that in the initial and final points the directions of tangent vectors are given. The proposed methods of conjugated circular arcs tracing can be applied in solving {{of a wide variety of}} problems connected with the tracing of cam contours, for example pattern curves in textile industry or in computer-aided-design systems when programming of looms with numeric control...|$|R
