500|$|During the Dive Bar Tour, Gaga {{recalled}} {{that she and}} musician Hillary Lindsey were seated in couches and having a back-and-forth conversation with guitar and piano. The singer asked questions about the men in her life, including her father and boyfriends, wondering why they would give her million reasons to leave them, but all <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to have one reason to stay. Lindsey, who previously had experiences in writing country songs in Nashville, was identified by Interscope as a potential collaborator on Joanne. The label's A Aaron Bay-Schuck, who had heard the initial Joanne material, introduced Gaga to Lindsey. They bonded over drinks and Gaga also played initial demos {{of some of the}} tracks she had written. Lindsey remembered that Gaga's personal experiences and stories resulted in many ideas for songs. [...] "Million Reasons" [...] was similarly picked from their conversations, including the title phrase. It was a straightforward songwriting session according to Lindsey, with Gaga using an [...] typewriter.|$|E

Roz retells the urban legend version of Vélez's suicide, {{reminding}} Frasier that [...] "even though things might not happen like we planned, they can work out anyway." [...] When Frasier asks [...] "how it worked out for Lupe", Roz tells him [...] "all <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to be remembered. Will you ever forget that story?" [...] Later in the episode Frasier asks a caller to his radio show, [...] "Have {{you ever heard of}} the story of Lupe Velez?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Usually the novitiate {{preceding}} profession {{lasted a}} year. Sister Thérèse hoped {{to make her}} final commitment on or after 11 January 1890 but, considered still too young for a final commitment, her profession was postponed. [...] She would spend eight months longer than the standard year as an unprofessed novice. As 1889 ended, her old home in the world Les Buissonnets, was dismantled, the furniture divided among the Guérins and the Carmel. It was not until 8 September 1890, aged 17 and a half, that she made her religious profession. The retreat in anticipation of her [...] "irrevocable promises" [...] was characterized by [...] "absolute aridity" [...] and {{on the eve of}} her profession she gave way to panic. [...] "What <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> beyond her. Her vocation was a sham." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E

60|$|The distressed brigand {{showed no}} gratification. She had {{the air of}} one who is aloof from worldly things.

But there, beyond the grave, is peace.|$|E
60|$|Obviously, for the moment, he {{was glad}} enough to remain free of those bonds which truly were none of his making. Chivalry alone might tempt him to fulfil Lord Truro's dying wishes, for the late Earl and the Duke's own father had been the closest of friends. Ursula's pride, however, would not allow her to appeal to that chivalry; what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to gain his love.|$|E
6000|$|Jeanie said, [...] "that her {{business}} at London was express; all <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was,</b> that any gentleman would, out of Christian charity, protect her to some town {{where she could}} hire horses and a guide; and finally," [...] she thought, [...] "it would be her father's mind {{that she was not}} free to give testimony in an English court of justice, as the land was not under a direct gospel dispensation." ...|$|E

6000|$|One {{of those}} periods--perhaps the happiest period in Mary's life--was {{during the early}} months in Italy of the English 'exiles'.

[Footnote: Mrs. Marshall, The Life and Letters of Mary W. Shelley, i. 216.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Ho! The {{odds were}} fearful enough already; {{she would be}} glad of any help, however earthly and carnal. But was not the work hopeless? What <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> men who could act while she thought. And those were just the men whom she would find nowhere but--she knew it too well--in the hated Christian priesthood. And then that fearful Iphigenia {{sacrifice}} loomed in the distance as inevitable. The only hope of philosophy was in her despair! ...............|$|E
6000|$|In fact, {{the boat}} might almost {{as well have}} gone to St. Jo. by land, for she was walking most of the time, anyhow--climbing over reefs and clambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long.

I thought she wanted a pair of stilts, but I had the deep sagacity not to say so.|$|E

60|$|A whole {{flood of}} Harewoods, Underwoods, and untold numbers besides, {{swept into the}} room as the bell began to ring for Evensong.

She could not go back to her coign of vantage, 'it had been too {{beautiful}} for her to bear more,' she said; and she severally declined offers of companionship from three female Harewoods and two sisters, telling Wilmet at last that all <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to be still and alone.|$|E
60|$|At her look, {{so eager}} and so worn, old Jolyon had grumblingly consented. He {{did not know}} what she wanted, he said, with going to a dance like this, a poor affair, he would wager; and she no more fit for it than a cat! What <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> sea air, and after his general meeting of the Globular Gold Concessions he was ready to take her. She didn't want to go away? Ah! she would knock herself up! Stealing a mournful look at her, he went on with his breakfast.|$|E
60|$|After all, Cecil was {{too much}} of an {{ingrained}} Charnock to be very deeply imbued with Women's Rights. All that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> her own way, and opposition. Lady Tyrrell had fascinated her and secured her affection, and she followed her lead, which was rather that of calm curiosity and desire to hear the subject ventilated than actual partisanship, for which her ladyship was far too clever, as well as too secure in her natural supremacy. They had only seemed on that side because other people were so utterly alien to it, and because of their friendship with the really zealous Mrs. Duncombe.|$|E

Of course {{he gave it to}} her, though he would gladly have eaten it himself, as three onions are not much {{at the end of a}} long day's walk, and soon after they all went to sleep, the poor man making himself as comfortable as he could in his corner.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{the mother}} {{did not know how}} much Gillian had on her mind, and thought all <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> discussion, and {{forgiveness}} for the follies explained in the letter, the last received. Of any connection between that folly and the accident to Lord Rotherwood of course she was not aware, and in fact she had more on her hands than she could well do in the time allotted, and more people to see. Gillian had to find that things could not be quite the same as when she had been chief companion in the seclusion of Silverfold.|$|E
6000|$|What <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was,</b> not counsel, but love.

And the two women spoke few words after that, for indeed there was nothing to be said. Only at last, [...] "My child, my child," [...] cried Godiva, [...] "better for thee, body and soul, to be here with me in the house of God, than there amid evil spirits and deeds of {{darkness}} in the wild woods." ...|$|E
