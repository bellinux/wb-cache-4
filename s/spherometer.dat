50|$|At first Cauchoix {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of scientific instruments including barometers and micrometers, but he soon specialized in optics, making <b>spherometers</b> and objectives. He made a telescope for the Paris Observatory in 1820 and in 1825 he made a 6.5 inch (16.5 cm) refractor for the observatory of the Collegio Romano, a Jesuit academy in Rome. In the Royal Observatory, Greenwich an 1838 instrument named the Sheepshanks telescope includes an objective by Cauchoix.|$|R

50|$|A contact-lever, {{delicate}} {{level or}} electric contact arrangement may {{be attached to}} the <b>spherometer</b> in order to indicate the moment of touching more precisely than is possible by the sense of touch. To measure the radius of a sphere—e.g. the curvature of a lens—the <b>spherometer</b> is leveled and read, then placed on the sphere, adjusted until the four points exert equal pressure, and read again. The difference gives the thickness of that portion of the sphere cut off by a plane passing through the three feet.|$|E

50|$|A <b>spherometer</b> is an {{instrument}} for the precise measurement of the radius of curvature of a sphere or a curved surface. Originally, these instruments were primarily used by opticians to measure the curvature of {{the surface of a}} lens.|$|E
50|$|A lens {{clock is}} a {{mechanical}} dial indicator {{that is used}} to measure dioptric power of a lens. It is a specialized version of a <b>spherometer.</b> A lens clock measures the curvature of a surface, but gives the result as an optical power in diopters, assuming the lens is made of a material with a particular refractive index.|$|E
50|$|Pullinger's {{apparatus}} is used {{to determine}} the linear expansion of a metallic rod in the laboratory. The apparatus consists of a metal cylinder closed at both ends (called a steam jacket). It is provided with an inlet and outlet for the steam. The steam for heating the rod is supplied by a boiler which is connected by a rubber tube to the inlet. The center of the cylinder contains a hole to insert a thermometer. The rod under investigation is enclosed in a steam jacket. One of its ends is free, but the other end is pressed against a fixed screw. The position of the rod is determined by a micrometer screw gauge or <b>spherometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{instrument}} is commonly used in inspections of oil field tool pipe for metal surface pits, fractures, and roundness before being shipped to drilling sites for exploratory wells. The process of inspections are designed to remove weakened drill pipe, so that pipe will not fracture during drilling. Tool pipe with thicker than 1" [...] walls for a 4" [...] diameter tube of hardened steel, fitted with tapered thread collars are re-used after drilling is complete, and thinner-walled tubular oil-well casing is in place. Electronic instrumentation similar to the <b>spherometer</b> in design are modified at inspection plants for casing, tubing, and drill pipe. The equivalent measurements in optics would be for a cylinder, or lens with a cylindrical component having an optical axis, where a plane through the lens would produce an oval circumference.|$|E
50|$|During {{the eclipse}} of August, 1869, Harkness {{discovered}} the coronal line K 1474. Three {{years later he}} was made {{a member of the}} Transit of Venus Commission, and had charge of the party at Hobart, Tasmania in 1879 and at Washington in 1882, when he became the executive officer. His most memorable accomplishments are related to the construction of telescopes, his theory of the focal curve of achromatic telescopes, and his invention of the <b>spherometer</b> caliper and other astronomical instruments. He was astronomical director of the Naval Observatory (1894-99) and director of the Nautical Almanac (1897-99). He retired from the Navy on attaining the relative rank of rear admiral (December, 1899). He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1893). Of his works, The Solar Parallax and its Related Constants (1891) is the most important.|$|E
50|$|Drill stem must be {{designed}} to transfer drilling torque for combined lengths that often exceed several miles down into the Earth's crust, and also {{must be able to}} resist pressure differentials between inside and outside (or vice versa), and have sufficient strength to suspend the total weight of deeper components. For deep wells this requires tempered steel tubes that are expensive, and owners spend considerable efforts to reuse them after finishing a well. A used drill stem is inspected on site, or off location. Ultrasonic testing and modified instruments similar to the <b>spherometer</b> are used at inspection sites to identify defects from metal fatigue, in order to preclude fracture of the drill stem during future wellboring. Drill pipe is classed as new (N class), becoming premium (P-class) and finally down to C (C 1 to 3) as fatigue is accumulated and as the outside diameter is worn down by usage. Eventually the drill pipe will be graded as scrap and marked with a red band.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spherometer</b> is an {{instrument}} widely used {{for measuring the}} radius of curvature of a spherical surface. Cylindrometer is a modified <b>spherometer,</b> which can measure the radii of both spherical and cylindrical surfaces. Both of these instruments {{are based on a}} geometric relation unique to circles and spheres, from Euclidean geometry. A more general understanding is obtained using coordinate geometry. The coordinate geometric approach also enables a generalization of the <b>spherometer</b> and cylindrometer to devices, which can handle aspherical surfaces.

40|$|A <b>spherometer</b> {{is often}} used to {{precisely}} measure the radius of curvature of a spherical surface. It can also measure the vertex radius of a more complex surface such as an off-axis parabola (OAP). This paper provides a reliable algorithm to find the vertex radius of an OAP by solving a few equations based on the test geometry. This algorithm can also be easily expanded to any conic surface with high-order aspheric coefficients. The algorithm was verified by measuring an 8 -inch diameter OAP and comparing the results with its known prescription. Results show good agreement. An example of measuring the vertex radius of a 4 -m diameter OAP is also presented. In addition to this, a calculation was done to show that the coma and astigmatism are independent of the clocking of the <b>spherometer</b> on the optic.

40|$|The {{determination}} of {{radius of curvature}} (ROC) of optics typically uses either a phase measuring interferometer on an adjustable stage to determine {{the position of the}} ROC and the optics surface under test. Alternatively, a <b>spherometer</b> or a profilometer are used for this measurement. The difficulty of this approach is that for large optics, translation of the interferometer or optic under test is problematic because of the distance of translation required and the mass of the optic. Profilometry and spherometry are alternative techniques that can work, but require a profilometer or a measurement of subapertures of the optic. The proposed approach allows a measurement of the optic figure simultaneous with the full aperture radius of curvature...|$|E
40|$|Four sheet metals, having quite {{different}} combinations of R-values and strain-hardening behavior were tested in uniaxial tension, uniaxial (through thickness) compression, balanced biaxial tension (bulge test), and plane-strain compression. The results were compared with predictions based upon three different anisotropic yield criteria. Although no single yield criterion proved to describe adequately all of the test results, different criteria provided the best agreement with particular metals. Results from through-thickness compression and bulge tests were nearly identical. In bulge testing, strains were determined from photographs of printed grids while the radius of curvature {{at the top of}} the dome was obtained using a projected fringe technique that involved a holographic grating. Radii measured by this technique were smaller for all materials than those measured by the conventional <b>spherometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|INSTRUCTIONS for {{measuring}} in-terior quality of eggs were published by Brant and Shrader (1952). These in-structions specify that the egg should be weighed, broken {{out on a}} flat glass plate, and the thick albumen measured using a <b>spherometer.</b> These measurements are converted into Haugh units {{by means of an}} interior quality calculator described by these authors. This procedure has been widely ac-cepted as a technique in egg quality re-search. Brant, Otte and Norris (1951) compared Haugh unit values, calculated by this procedure (Brant and Shrader, 1952), with albumen index values (Heiman and Carver, 1936) and with Van Wagenen scores (Van Wagenen and Wilgus, 1935). Their publication makes possible conver-sion of published data, using albumen in-dex or Van Wagenen score as measures of egg quality, to Haugh units. At the present time the method de-scribed by Brant and Shrader (1952) is being used widely in egg quality research laboratories and egg laying contests. The accuracy of this method may be affected by variation in egg temperature at time of measurement as well as delay between breakout and time of measurement. Stadelman, Ziegler and Darroch (1954) studied the effects of temperature at time of break-out on interior quality and re-ported the observed linear regression co...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details of}} a bending test method used to firstly identify whether a brittle layer exists in a bituminous road surface and secondly to determine the depth of such a layer. The test is basically a smaller version of the modulus of rigidity test for concrete. It applies 4 point bending to the specimen, with a constant bending moment in the middle third of the span. The top surface of the specimen is placed {{so that it is}} in tension under load. Testing is carried out in an instron test machine located in a temperature and humidity controlled room. The average curvature of the specimen in the constant bending moment region is measured by a specially fabricated <b>spherometer.</b> Tensile strain of the specimen in calculated from this measurement. 50 mm x 50 mm x 250 mm specimens are used and great care is required to prepare these.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel methodology for the in-situ measurement of mechanical stress during thin film growth utilizing a highly sensitive non-contact {{variation of the}} classic <b>spherometer.</b> By exploiting the known spherical deformation of the substrate {{the value of the}} stress induced curvature is inferred by measurement of only one point on the substrate's surface-the sagittal. From the known curvature the stress can be calculated using the well-known Stoney equation. Based on this methodology, a stress sensor has been designed which is simple, highly sensitive, compact, and low cost. As a result of its compact nature, the sensor can be mounted in any orientation to accommodate a given deposition geometry without the need for extensive modification to an already existing deposition system. The technique employs the use of a double side polished substrate that offers good specular reflectivity and is isotropic in its mechanical properties, such as oriented crystalline silicon or amorphous soda lime glass, for example. The measurement of the displacement of the uncoated side during deposition is performed with a high resolution (i. e. 5 nm), commercially available, inexpensive, fiber optic sensor which can be used in both high vacuum and high temperature environments (i. e. 10 (exp- 7) Torr and 480 oC, respectively). A key attribute of this instrument lies in its potential to achieve sensitivity that rivals other measurement techniques such as the micro cantilever method but, due to the comparatively larger substrate area, offers a more robust and practical alternative for subsequent measurement of additional characteristics of the film that can might be correlated to film stress. We present measurement results of nickel films deposited by magnetron sputtering which show good qualitative agreement to the know behavior of polycrystalline films previously reported by Hoffman...|$|E
