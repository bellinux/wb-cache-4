[...] On August 18, 2005, another Republican candidate, former Mayor of Yonkers John Spencer, gave a radio interview in which he attacked Pirro, calling her chances of winning the Conservative Party of New York State nomination [...] "a Chinaman's chance." [...] Spencer later apologized.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>for</b> {{the room}} was vacant. Mrs. Conroy had disappeared.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{struggling}} <b>for</b> breath, tore her hat {{from her}} head and threw it on the table. Her face was like {{the face of a}} virago, her eyes blazed, her cheeks were as pale as death save for one hectic spot of colour.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> a moment; but, {{since her}} hearers were as yet {{speechless}} from surprise, she went on.|$|E
60|$|She paused, but her {{companion}} made no sign. <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> so long, however, that speech became necessary.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nor {{will the}} judge and the lawyers, and all the rest. As you say so properly, {{it is not for}} us to be the informers. If they can prove it, let them.

6000|$|... "You little fool, <b>she</b> just <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> effect," [...] cried Felicity angrily. Felicity {{might be}} rather {{jealous of the}} Story Girl's gift, but she was furious at beholding [...] "one of our family" [...] made ridiculous in such a fashion.

60|$|At {{that she}} checked her impulse--it {{may even be}} that she mistrusted it. <b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{lingering}} undecided <b>for</b> an instant; then, turning her horse once more, she ambled up the slope to rejoin Diana.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> here <b>for</b> some time, and I did {{not move}} or speak, being so stunned by my {{discovery}} that I knew not what to say, and feared to reveal the truth to Edith too suddenly.
