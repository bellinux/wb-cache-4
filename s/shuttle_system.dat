5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate <b>shuttle</b> <b>system</b> of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the aging process.|$|E

25|$|Space Shuttle Enterprise (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-101) was {{the first}} orbiter of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>system.</b> Rolled out on September 17, 1976, it was built for NASA {{as part of the}} Space Shuttle program to perform {{atmospheric}} test flights after being launched from a modified Boeing 747. It was constructed without engines or a functional heat shield, and was therefore not capable of spaceflight.|$|E

The guidelines are directly applicable to the incorporation of OCMF into the design of space <b>shuttle</b> propulsion <b>systems</b> and the equipment with which the propulsion systems interface. The techniques and general approach, however, are also generally applicable to OCMF incorporation into the design of other space <b>shuttle</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
25|$|TU {{has its own}} {{on campus}} <b>shuttle</b> <b>system</b> that {{operates}} free of charge to students. The on-campus shuttle travels to most sections of the school, while the off-campus shuttles travel to housing complexes (The Fairways at Towson, University Village, The Colony, Donnybrook) that students live in {{that are on the}} outskirts of the campus. There is also direct access to the MTA Maryland buses with services connecting to the light rail.|$|E
25|$|The campus {{maintains}} 24,000 {{parking spaces}} and operates an award-winning sustainable transportation program. Elements of the sustainable transportation program include vanpools, a campus <b>shuttle</b> <b>system</b> called BruinBus, discounted carpool permits, and subsidized transit passes. One of the pass programs includes BruinGo!, which allows {{students and staff}} members to purchase discounted passes to ride Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus and the Culver CityBus. Additionally, UCLA has a grocery shuttle that transports students between the dorms and Westwood, on weekends {{in order to facilitate}} students' shopping needs.|$|E
25|$|UC San Diego {{maintains}} about 17,000 {{parking spaces}} {{and offers a}} number of alternative transportation options. The university runs a <b>shuttle</b> <b>system,</b> which is provided free for students, faculty, and staff, that services the main campus, UC San Diego Medical Center, university affiliated research centers, nearby apartment complexes and shopping centers in University City, and the Sorrento Valley train station. As part of a greater initiative to reduce the university's impact on the environment, {{a portion of the}} shuttle fleet has been refitted to exclusively use biodiesel fuel derived from vegetable oil. UCSD also reserves parking spaces for carpools, maintains a fleet of on-campus Zipcars, and provides free bike rentals.|$|E

25|$|On December 29, 2008, {{shortly after}} 7 PM, an {{electrical}} {{fire broke out}} near the Walnut Creek station. The fire apparently started after a train ripped off {{a portion of the}} electric third rail, dragging it under the train and sparking a fire along the rail. The fire caused major delays of 2–3 hours, as Pittsburg/Bay Point bound trains could travel no further than Lafayette station, and San Francisco Airport bound trains were held at Concord station, having to be taken out of service as the delays continued. A bus <b>shuttle</b> <b>system</b> was set up to take passengers along the Concord, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek, and Lafayette BART stations. Trains were eventually allowed through the station in both directions, sharing one track until the rail was repaired.|$|E
25|$|Metro Transit is {{the primary}} public {{transportation}} operator in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area of the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest operator in the state. The system is {{a division of the}} Metropolitan Council, the region’s metropolitan planning organization (MPO), averaging 267,700 riders each weekday, carrying 90% to 95% of the transit riders in the region on a combined network of regular-route buses, light rail and commuter rail. The remainder of transit ridership is generally split among suburban “opt-out” carriers operating out of cities that have chosen not to participate in the Metro Transit network. The biggest opt-out providers are Minnesota Valley Transit Authority (MVTA), Maple Grove Transit and Southwest Transit (SW Transit). The University of Minnesota also operates a campus <b>shuttle</b> <b>system</b> of its own, which ranks second in the state, measured by ridership.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{had argued}} that the Shuttle program was flawed. Achieving a {{reusable}} vehicle with early 1970s technology forced design decisions that compromised operational reliability and safety. Reusable main engines were made a priority. This necessitated that they not burn up upon atmospheric reentry, which in turn made mounting them on the orbiter itself (the {{one part of the}} <b>Shuttle</b> <b>system</b> where reuse was paramount) a seemingly logical decision. However, this had the following consequences: ...|$|E

Its immense size also necessitated {{the creation of a}} <b>shuttle</b> <b>system</b> circling the academic sector and surrounding areas including the administrative complex, located nearly a quarter mile from the central academic area. When originally built by the state of New York, the North Campus was provided with two Interstate exits, from I-290 and I-990, its own internal parkway, the John James Audubon Parkway, and two small lakes created from Ellicott Creek.
