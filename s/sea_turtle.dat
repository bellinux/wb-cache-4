5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> {{including}} the Atlantic green <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the leatherback <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers {{are difficult to}} determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|The hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a {{critically}} endangered <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> {{belonging to the}} family Cheloniidae.

5|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> distinguish it from other <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each flipper.|$|E
5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> olive ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E

5|$|The loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is found}} in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea.

The loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become , producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is omnivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods.

During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E
