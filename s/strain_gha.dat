40|$|The {{effects of}} Beauveria bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA,</b> applied as BotaniGard ES, on newly colonised and {{well-established}} populations of emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) were evaluated {{in the field}} using foliar and trunk sprays in Michigan in 20042005. Results from field trials at a newly colonised white ash site showed a 41 % reduction in A. planipennis population in fungal-treated trees {{compared with that of}} untreated controls. In addition, fungal infection was also found in 20 % of the larval population within 14 days of incubation under laboratory conditions. At a site with a well-established A. planipennis population in green ash trees, larval density was reduced by 47 % for trees treated with the fungus compared with that of the controls; 21 % of larvae from the current generation were found infected after 14 days of laboratory incubation. Fungal-treated green ash trees also produced fewer adults emerging in the next generation, with a 63 % reduction in adult density observed in treated trees compared to that of controls. As a result, fungal-treated trees sustained 42 % less crown dieback than did controls. Agrilus planipennis larval density was negatively correlated with trunk height above the ground, and positively correlated with log diameter. Results of laboratory leaf bioassays on A. planipennis adults showed that fungal conidia persisted well under field conditions, with mortality of 78100 % at 7 -days post-exposure for leaves collected between 2 and 264 h after application. Potential strategies for using B. bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA</b> for managing A. planipennis are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Beauveria bassiana (Fungi: Ascomycota) is an entomopathogenic fungus {{that serves}} as a {{biological}} control agent of Mormon crickets Anabrus simplex Haldeman (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) and other grasshopper pests. To measure the dose-dependent response of Mormon crickets to fungal attack, we applied B. bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA</b> topically to adults using doses of 5. 13 [*]×[*] 104 to 1. 75 [*]×[*] 106 conidia in sunflower oil, with oil only as a control. After three weeks, we assessed the survivors' hemolymph for fungal cells, active phenoloxidase (PO), and lysozyme. Mortality increased and body mass of survivors decreased with conidial dose. survivors' PO activity was elevated to the same level independent of dose. Those with fungal cells visible in their hemolymph did not differ in PO activity from those with clear hemolymph. We conclude that circulating PO may be an important enzymatic defense against Beauveria infection and that it is associated with attempted clearing of Beauveria blastospores and hyphae from Mormon cricket hemolymph...|$|E
40|$|The two {{biocontrol}} agents Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) {{have the}} potential to complement one another as part of an integrated pest management programme. While both can suppress whitefly and thrips infestations in protected crops, A. swirskii is primarily used preventatively whereas B. bassiana {{can be used as a}} curative treatment at higher pest levels. With this concomitant use in mind, the research presented here aimed to identify potential negative effects of the commercial B. bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA</b> on A. swirskii in a laboratory study. Adult A. swirskii were found to be susceptible to B. bassiana infection with slight to moderate virulence (20. 74 ± 3. 89 to 48. 33 % ± 3. 07) depending on the type of exposure and with a reduction in fecundity over time. There was however no negative effect on juvenile survival neither on dry residue nor on the offspring of infected mites. Thus, these two biocontrol agents do {{have the potential}} to be complementary. Further trials in the field are still required before a final conclusion can be reached...|$|E
40|$|The kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.), is {{an urban}} {{nuisance}} and significant agricultural pest. The median lethal concentrations of three strains of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo), including the Mississippi Delta native strain (NI 8) isolated from Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), the commercial <b>strain</b> BotaniGard® (<b>GHA)</b> (Victor, NY, USA), and the B. bassiana strain isolated from M. cribraria (KUDSC), were estimated on kudzu bug adults. A technique developed to evaluate B. bassiana against L. lineolaris was used. Younger adults (eight days after collection) {{were treated with}} NI 8 and GHA and older adult (50 days after collection) were treated with NI 8, GHA and KUDSC. Higher concentrations (n × 106, n × 107) of NI 8 and GHA caused kudzu bug mortality two days after treatment in younger adults and similar concentrations of NI 8, GHA, and KUDSC caused mortality one day after treatment in older adults. Lower concentrations (n × 104, n × 105) {{were not significantly different}} in mortality between strains. LS 50 values of the KUDSC were significantly lower than NI 8 and GHA values in older adults. This is the first available information on median lethal concentration of B. bassiana on kudzu bug adults bioassayed on artificial diet. It was determined that B. bassiana (KUDSC and NI 8) are highly effective for young adults at very low doses (LC 50 1. 98 – 4. 98 viable spores per mm 2) ...|$|R

40|$|Harmonia axyridis is a predatory coccinellid, {{native to}} {{central and eastern}} Asia. It has been {{available}} in many countries {{for use as a}} biological control agent of pest aphids and scale insects. In many of these countries, including the USA, H. axyridis has established. It is now considered an invasive alien species for a number of reasons, including its impact on functional biodiversity. Beauveria bassiana is known to be a natural mortality agent of overwintering coccinellids and is a potential candidate for the biological control of H. axyridis. In this paper we compare the susceptibility of three species of coccinellid, H. axyridis (cultures derived from Japan and Britain), Coccinella septempunctata and Adalia bipunctata to infection by B. bassiana (commercial <b>strain</b> <b>GHA)</b> after exposure at three doses (105, 107, 109 conidia ml– 1). The two subpopulations of H. axyridis (Japanese and British) were more resistant to B. bassiana infection than either A. bipunctata or C. septempunctata. This is exemplified by the median lethal doses at 10 days post-inoculation (LD 50) of 106. 2, 106. 0, 108. 3, 109. 6 conidia ml– 1 for A. bipunctata, C. septempunctata, H. axyridis (Japanese) and H. axyridis (British), respectively.

We investigated the soil persistence and field efficacy of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (BotaniGard) against apple sawfly under common organic orchard practices. We also assessed the efficacy of B. bassiana GHA and Metarhizium brunneum Petch (indigenous strain) against sawfly in the laboratory. Larvae treated with either fungus in the laboratory died faster than control larvae and displayed 49. 4 %- 68. 4 % mycosis. In the field, B. bassiana density remained high in the week after application, during larval descent to the soil. Fungal density decreased to 25 % at 49 d after application and to 0. 4 % after 55 weeks. Molecular markers revealed {{that the majority of}} fungal isolates recovered comprised the applied B. bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA.</b> Larvae pupating in soil cages in the orchard for 49 d displayed 17 % mycosis. The high efficacy under laboratory conditions was not seen in the field. B. bassiana application resulted in densities above the upper natural background level during the growing season, but reversion to background levels occurred within a year. It remains to be investigated whether this has a detrimental effect on nontarget organisms. Additional work is needed to bridge the knowledge gap between laboratory and field efficacy in orchards...|$|E
40|$|Fungi {{associated}} with the hemlock wooly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), were collected throughout the eastern USA and southern China. Twenty fungal genera were identified, as were 79 entomopathogenic isolates, including: Lecanicillium lecanii (Zimmermann) (Hypocreales: Insertae sedis), Isaria farinosa (Holm: Fries.) (Cordycipitaceae), Beauveria bassiana (Balasamo) (Hyphomycetes), and Fusarium spp (Nectriaceae). The remaining fungal genera {{associated with}} insect cadavers were similar for both the USA and China collections, although the abundance of Acremonium (Hypocreaceae) was greater in China. The entomopathogenic isolates were assayed for efficacy against Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Homoptera: Aphididae) and yielded mortality ranging from 3 to 92 %. Ten isolates demonstrating the highest efficacy were further assessed for efficacy against field-collected A. tsugae under laboratory conditions. Overall, two B. bassiana, one L. lecanii, and a strain of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), demonstrated significantly higher efficacy against A. tsugae than the others. Isolates were further evaluated for conidial production, germination rate and colony growth at four temperatures representative of field conditions. All isolates were determined to be mesophiles with optimal temperature between 25 – 30 ° C. In general, conidial production increased with temperature, though two I. farinosa produced significantly more conidia at cooler temperatures. When efficacy values were compared with conidial production and temperature tolerances, Agricultural Research Service Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungi (ARSEF) 1080, 5170, and 5798 had characteristics comparable to the industrial B. bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fitness {{costs can}} delay pest {{resistance}} to crops that produce insecticidal toxins {{derived from the}} bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and past {{research has found that}} entomopathogens impose fitness costs of Bt resistance. In addition, entomopathogens can be used for integrated pest management by providing biological control of pests. The western corn rootworm,Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major pest of maize and is currently managed by planting of Bt maize. We tested whether entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi increased mortality of western corn rootworm and whether these entomopathogens increased fitness costs of resistance to Cry 3 Bb 1 maize. We exposed western corn rootworm larvae to two species of nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae Filipjev (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae), and to two species of fungi, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) (<b>strain</b> <b>GHA)</b> and Metarhizium brunneum (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) (strain F 52) in two assay types, namely, seedling mat and small cup. Larval mortality increased with the concentration of H. bacteriophora and S. feltiae in the small cup assay, and with the exception of S. feltiae and B. bassiana in the seedling mat assay, mortality from entomopathogens was significantly greater than zero for the remaining entomopathogens in both assays. However, no fitness costs were observed in either assay type for any entomopathogen. Increased mortality of western corn rootworm larvae caused by these entomopathogens supports their potential use in biological control; however, the lack of fitness costs suggests that entomopathogens will not delay the evolution of Bt resistance in western corn rootworm...|$|E

The objective of investigation was determine the phytotoxic potential of HeberNem® in non target terrestrial plants. Zea Mays, Phaseolo vulgaris and Glycine max seeds with a 100 % of germination were used. The seed were planted on 400 g of red ferralitic soil {{at the rate of}} three seeds per replica. Two experimental groups were created a negative control and one group treated per each tested specie. The product was applied at a concentration of 107 ufc / ml in the volume of the water system. Daily observations were carried out, germinated seeds were quantified as well as the fresh weight of plants and the colony former unit (ufc) of the microorganism present in the soil and in the parts of the plant. Non phytotoxic effects were observed in any of the species exposed to the species exposed to the microorganism. In the 7 and 21 days of the assay, valves of 102 – 103 ufc/g of fresh weight were quantified in roots and stems. In addition, in the final soil of the study, a concentration of 102 ufc / g of soil was determined. These results are similar to the ones reported for Beauveria bassiana <b>strain</b> <b>GHA,</b> the concentrations found for the active agent are not related to the infectivity of the plants.

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{a novel approach}} to selecting isolates of Hyphomycete fungi as mycoinsecticides for biological control of aphids in arable crops in the UK. The approach was designed to select isolates which were compatible with both the biotic and abiotic environment. Aphis fabae was chosen as a representative target aphid for bioassays, based on results of preliminary experiments. Eighteen isolates of fungi were screened at a single concentration of 1 x 10 ⁸ conidia ml⁻¹ against apterous adult A. fabae, which were incubated at 23 °C. Spray applications were made using an electrostatic rotary atomiser in both laboratory and field experiments. Isolates that originated from aphid hosts were most pathogenic to A. fabae. Four isolates were selected for further studies; ARSEF 2879 (Beauveria bassiana), HRI 1. 72 (Verticillium lecanii), Mycotrol <b>strain</b> <b>GHA</b> (B. bassiana) and Z 11 (Paecilomyces fumosoroseus). Isolate HRI 1. 72 was most virulent to A. fabae in dose-response assays compared to other isolates; at concentrations of 1 x 105 conidia ml⁻¹ and above, mortality of aphids due to infection by HRI 1. 72 was 100 %. Isolates of P. fumosoroseus and V. lecanii were able to grow and germinate better in vitro at low temperatures (10 & 15 °C), than isolates of B. bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae. Aphis fabae and Myzus persicae, inoculated with isolate HRI 1. 72 and incubated at 10 °C, succumbed to infection after a significantly shorter period of time compared to other isolates. Rhopalosiphum padi was most resistant to infection by the four isolates compared to five other species of aphid. Aphis fabae, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Sitobion avenae, Metopolophium dirhodum, R. padi and M. persicae were most susceptible to infection by isolate HRI 1. 72. Aphids infected with isolates of V. lecanii often had fungal sporulation on their legs and died attached to leaves on which they were feeding. The isolates Mycotrol <b>strain</b> <b>GHA</b> and ARSEF 2879 were pathogenic to the 7 -spot ladybird Coccinella septempunctata and the generalist parasitoid Praon volucre. The isolates HRI 1. 72 and Z 11 had very little impact on these natural enemies tested. When aphids of A. fabae were co-inoculated with isolates of Hyphomycete fungi and Erynia neoaphidis, most individuals succumbed to infection with E. neoaphidis. A significant number of aphids died within 24 hours of inoculation and {{showed no signs of}} external sporulation. The potential interactions between these natural enemies in the biocontrol of aphids are discussed. The spatial and temporal distribution of aphids and their natural enemies, in field bean and wheat crops, was determined in two field seasons (1997 & 1998). Aphids sampled from the field, after application of Hyphomycete fungi in 1998, mostly succumbed to infection with E. neoaphidis. Epizootics of E. neoaphidis were recorded in both years. Greater numbers of healthy laboratory aphids succumbed to infection with Hyphomycete fungi when they were bioassayed on leaves sampled immediately following spraying (51 - 100 %) compared to 24 hours later (8 - 65 %). Microclimate recordings showed humidity in both crops was generally > 90 % overnight and differences were as great as 15 % between {{the top and bottom of}} crop canopies. Temperature differences were as great as 5 - 7 °C between individual sensors. The implications of using a biorational approach as part of the development of Hyphomycete fungi as mycoinsecticides for the control of aphids is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{technically}} standardised bioassay {{method was}} designed, evaluated {{and used to}} assess virulence and host range of hypocrealean fungi against aphids. A track mounted sprayer was used to apply conidia because hand held {{versions of the same}} sprayer can be used for field applications, thereby allowing the outcome from laboratory experiments to predict activity in the field accurately. Eighteen fungal isolates were assessed in single concentration bioassays against the black bean aphid Aphis fabae Scopoli. Isolates comprised commercially available mycoinsecticides (based on Beauveria bassiana and Lecanicillium longisporum) and isolates of B. bassiana, Lecanicillium spp., Paecilomyces fumosoroseus and Metarhizium anisopliae. Aphid mortality was in excess of 80 % for 15 isolates, and HRI 1. 72 (L. longipsorum), Z 11 (P. fumosoroseus), Mycotech <b>strain</b> <b>GHA</b> (B. bassiana) and ARSEF 2879 (B. bassiana) were studied further. Multiple-concentration bioassays identified HRI 1. 72 as the most virulent isolate against A. fabae with significantly smaller LC 50 and LT 50 values compared to other isolates. A precise LC 50 value (2. 95 x 102 conidia ml- 1) was calculated for HRI 1. 72 using a second multiple-concentration assay with smaller concentrations of conidia. The four isolates were applied at a single concentration (1 x 108 conidia ml- 1) against Myzus persicae, A. fabae, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. A ranking of aphid susceptibility was obtained, such that S. avenae>M. persicae, A. pisum, A. fabae> R. padi. Results indicate the importance of standardising bioassay methods to reduce bioassay variability without compromising the ability to use the bioassay to investigate fungus-host interactions under varying abiotic and biotic conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractShelf life {{determinations}} under non-refrigerated conditions, {{especially high}} temperature regimes characteristic of tropical/subtropical regions, deserve more attention. In this study, we investigated effects of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on longevity of conidia of Beauveria bassiana (Bb) <b>strain</b> <b>GHA.</b> Similar rates of conidial survival were observed after storage for 60 days at 50 °C in atmospheres of pure CO 2, N 2, H 2, or He (49 – 51 % viability), but few conidia (⩽ 2 %) survived storage in O 2 -rich atmospheres. Viability of conidia stored {{in an atmosphere}} of 20 % CO 2 / 80 % N 2 decreased to < 80 % within 180 days at 40 °C and within 30 days at 50 °C but remained high (87 %) after a 16 -month storage period at 25 °C. O 2 concentrations in the storage containers ranged from 0. 3 % at the start to as high as 12. 4 % at the end of experiments (due to container leakage). When active packaging (hermetically sealed packages with O 2 /moisture scavengers) was employed, shelf lives were substantially improved. Viabilities ⩾ 80 % were consistently recorded after 6 months at 40 °C or 2 months at 50 °C when a dual O 2 /moisture absorber or a combination of sachets (dual O 2 absorber/CO 2 generator+desiccant) were used. Water activities (aw) supporting greatest survival were ⩽ 0. 030, suggesting that optimal aw for long-term storage under anaerobic conditions is lower than determined in previous studies of storage in the presence of O 2. Additionally, we have shown that actively packaged conidia with higher than desirable initial aw should be allowed an equilibration period at a moderate temperature before exposure to high storage temperatures. Active packaging of dried conidia (aw⩽ 0. 032) preserved 71 % viability for 16 months at 40 °C and 63 – 65 % for 3 months at 50 °C. To our knowledge, these are the longest survival times yet reported for Bb conidia under high-temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|Conidia of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae are {{the most}} common active {{ingredients}} in commercially available mycoinsecticides, and longer shelf-lives under non-refrigerated conditions could increase their limited market acceptance. Contrasting results from commonly used germination protocols constitute an important impediment to consistent, universally comparable efficacy and shelf-life studies. A series of laboratory experiments investigated the underlying causes of this problem. Lower viabilities due to imbibitional damage were observed with decreasing water activity (aw) and decreasing temperature of the water/surfactant solutions used in preparing conidial suspensions. Dry conidia of M. anisopliae (strain CB- 10) and M. acridum (strain IMI- 330189), in contrast to those of Beauveria bassiana (<b>strain</b> <b>GHA),</b> were highly susceptible to imbibitional damage. Germination of the driest M. anisopliae conidia was drastically reduced to 66 % after immersion at 25 degree C and to less than 1 % at 0. 5 degree C. Significant loss of viability was prevented when conidia were immersed in warm water (ca. 34 degree C) or when slowly rehydrated by humidification prior to immersion. Inclusion/exclusion of debilitated conidia (conidia exhibiting delayed germination or hypersensitivity to imbibitional damage) in germination counts was identified as an additional factor contributing to variability in quality assessments. Germination protocols based on fast rehydration and shorter incubation times are recommended as a means of discounting debilitated conidia in viability determinations. In shelf-life experiments, longevities of B. bassiana conidia were similar and significantly greater in storage containers flushed with CO 2, N 2, H 2, or He, than in containers flushed with high concentrations of O 2. In atmospheres with 20 % CO 2 / 80 % N 2, viability measured after fast rehydration and incubation for 24 h remained high (87 %) after a 16 -month storage period at 25 degree C. Active packaging systems comprising aluminized bags and commercially available O 2 - and moisture-absorbing materials, consistently preserved viability at levels of 8089 % for six months at 40 degree C and two months at 50 degree C. Results suggest that optimal aw for long-term storage of conidia under anaerobic conditions are lower than previously reported from studies of storage in the presence of O 2. To our knowledge, these are the longest high-temperature survival times for B. bassiana conidia reported to date...|$|E

B. bassiana and its “inert” carrier oil in the product BotaniGard and the “inert” carrier oil alone provided 99 and 96 % mortality respectively in Petri dish assays 1 d after treatment when applied in 1 ml water. When the same treatments were applied in 0. 5 ml of carrier water mortality was only 1. 4 and 0. 7 % respectively 1 d after treatment. After 10 d in Petri dishes, B. bassiana and its “inert” carrier oil and the “inert” carrier oil alone applied in 0. 5 ml water showed 77 and 9 % mortality respectively. When one-tenth the label dosage of B. bassiana and “inert” carrier oil was combined with neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid, and dinotefuran applied in 1 ml water, there were significant increases (34, 30, and 68 % respectively) in weevil mortality over the neonicotinoids alone 1 d after treatment. When one-tenth the label dosage of “inert” carrier oil alone was combined with neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid, and dinotefuran applied in 1 ml water, there were also significant increases with clothianidin and dinotefuran (38 and 24 % respectively) in weevil mortality over the neonicotinoids alone 1 d after treatment. B. bassiana and its “inert” carrier oil provided 28, 50, and 78 % mortality at the highest label dosage and 47, 76, and 89 % mortality at 4 × the highest label dosage in turf plug assays at 7, 10, and 14 d after treatment. Addition of 5 or 20 % MycoMax (a nutrient source for B. bassiana) did not significantly increase mortality in turfgrass plug assays. ELISA plates {{were used to determine}} the amounts of clothianidin and imidacloprid in Poa annua clippings from treated golf course fairways. Amounts of clothianidin ranged from 71. 8 to 1238. 1 ng/g tissue in 2011 and 68. 8 to 2045. 0 ng/g tissue in 2012. Amounts of imidacloprid ranged from 40. 8 to 1679. 2 ng/g tissue in 2011 and 116. 8 to 3722. 0 ng/g tissue in 2012. Listronotus maculicollis adults were caged on neonicotinoid and neonicotinoid/pyrethroid treated P. annua plugs. Substantial feeding on P. annua was observed; however, mortality of L. maculicollis adults was not significantly different from control plugs. We were not able to determine concentrations of either clothianidin or imidacloprid that were effective in controlling larvae.
