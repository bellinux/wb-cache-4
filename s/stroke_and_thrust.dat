6000|$|But {{his words}} were drowned by the furious shouts of the crowd, [...] "Death to the Flemings!" [...] and a rush was made at the door, headed by the clerk, who struck savagely at Edgar. The latter parried the <b>stroke,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> the man through the throat. With a yell of rage the crowd now strove furiously to enter, but the {{position}} of the two lads standing back a couple of feet from the entrance rendered it impossible for {{more than two or three}} to attack them at once, and the clubs and rough weapons were no match for the swords. Nevertheless, although five or six of their opponents fell, the weight of numbers pressed the friends back to the staircase, where they again made a stand.|$|E

50|$|Like pouwhenua and taiaha, {{this long}} club was {{designed}} for sparring <b>and</b> lightning <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> <b>thrusts,</b> aided by quick footwork {{on the part of}} the wielder. The blows were not struck with the blade as one would with an axe, but rather with the thicker straight front edge. It was common for tewhatewha to be decorated with a bunch of split pigeon or hawk feathers which hang from a drilled hole near the lower edge of the extension. This decoration may have also had the added benefit of distracting or confusing the wielder's opponent.|$|R
60|$|The {{practice}} at the pels which Myles was bidden to attend comprised the chief exercise of the day with the esquires of young cadet soldiers of that time, and in it they learned not only all the <b>strokes,</b> cuts, <b>and</b> <b>thrusts</b> of sword-play then in vogue, but also toughness, endurance, and elastic quickness. The pels themselves consisted of upright posts of ash or oak, about five feet six inches in height, and in girth somewhat thicker than a man's thigh. They were firmly planted in the ground, and upon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed.|$|R
60|$|Then Rames {{seemed to}} awake. He leapt from his knees, he smote and the blow went home, though the iron which the Nubian wore beneath his robe stayed it. He smote again more fiercely, {{and now it}} was the blood of Amathel that flowed. Then bending almost to the ground before the {{answering}} <b>stroke,</b> he leapt <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> with all the strength of young limbs trained to war. He <b>thrust</b> <b>and</b> behold! between the broad shoulders of Amathel pierced from breast to back, appeared the point of the Egyptian's sword. For a moment the prince stood still, then he fell backwards heavily and lay dead.|$|R
50|$|A fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belt is {{a series}} of mountainous foothills {{adjacent}} to an orogenic belt, which forms due to contractional tectonics. Fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belts commonly form in the forelands adjacent to major orogens as deformation propagates outwards. Fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belts usually comprise both folds <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> faults, commonly interrelated. They are commonly also known as thrust-and-fold belts, or simply thrust-fold belts.|$|R
50|$|The Alps are a fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belt. Folding <b>and</b> <b>thrusting</b> is the {{expression}} of crustal shortening which {{is caused by the}} convergent movements of the European and Apulian plates.|$|R
60|$|Then {{at length}} John Clavering rushed in <b>and</b> <b>thrust.</b> Hugh sprang back before his point. Again he rushed <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>and</b> again Hugh sprang back. A third time and Hugh fairly ran, whereon a shout went {{up from the}} Claverings.|$|R
40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of drag-based paddling propulsion are studied {{with a simple}} mechanical model and a measurement technique for mapping three-dimensional flow fields. In drag-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength is an important parameter {{in the relationship between}} vortex formation <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> generation. Our results indicate that spanwise flow behind the paddling propulsor significantly affects tip vortex development <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> generation. The distribution of spanwise flow is dependent on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared with a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, spanwise flow is not as strong as that for the high Reynolds number case. Without sacrificing total impulse, the flexible propulsor can smooth out thrust peaks during sudden stroke motions, which is favorable for avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. We also explored the role of stopping vortex shedding in efficient thrust generation by determining the relationship between <b>stroke</b> angles <b>and</b> total impulses generated by paddling propulsors...|$|R

50|$|The Sub-Andean Zone and the Northern and Eastern Lowlands share {{a common}} ancient history but has since the Andean orogeny {{developed}} to two distinct zones. While both zones share essentially the same old sedimentary platform strata the strata at the Sub-Andean Zone have been folded <b>and</b> <b>thrusted</b> into a fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belt with structural traps where hydrocarbon fluids have accumulated. The limit between the fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belt <b>and</b> the Eastern Lowlands is drawn by the Serranía del Aguaragüe a north-south range representing the Andean thrust front.|$|R

50|$|At more {{southern}} latitudes (36-39° S) various Jurassic and Cretaceous marine transgressions {{from the}} Pacific are {{recorded in the}} sediments of Neuquén Basin. In the Late Cretaceous conditions changed. A marine regression occurred and the fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belts of Malargüe (36°00 S), Chos Malal (37° S) and Agrio (38° S) started to develop in the Andes and did so in until Eocene times. This meant an advance of the orogenic deformation since the Late Cretaceous that caused {{the western part of}} Neuquén Basin to stack in the Malargüe and Agrio fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belts. In the Oligocene {{the western part of the}} fold <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> belt was subject to a short period of extensional tectonics whose structures were inverted in the Miocene.
