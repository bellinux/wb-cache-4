40|$|Vein arrays {{are often}} {{composed}} of pull-aparts which are linked by <b>shear</b> <b>fractures,</b> {{good examples of}} which occur in the Lower Jurassic limestones of Somerset, southwestern England. Such pull-apart arrays have displacement-distance characteristics which are similar to fault zones, with maximum displacement (indicated by the largest pull-apart widths) near {{the centre of the}} array, and with displacement decreasing towards the tips. Pull-apart arrays usually die out into enéchelon or pinnate veins. Evidence for pressure solution along the <b>shear</b> <b>fractures</b> which connect pull-aparts include their dark and braided nature, their obliquity to the displacement direction, the high dihedral angles (often > 90 °) between conjugate <b>shear</b> <b>fractures,</b> and the dissolution of earlier structures. A range of geometries occurs, with varying relative amounts of veins and pressure solution being related to varying amounts of transtension or transpression. There is a general trend for an increase in the angle between vein segments and the <b>shear</b> <b>fractures</b> as contraction increases. There is therefore a trend for increased pressure solution on the <b>shear</b> <b>fractures</b> in more contractional arrays.

40|$|Abstract — Quartz veins at the Mufferaw gold {{prospect}} and Komis gold deposit, northern Saskatchewan, {{are examples}} of oblique-extension veins that crystallized in shear and tensile frac-tures, which propagated and then opened oblique to their walls during a single continuous deforma-tion event. The Mufferaw gold prospect consists of an interlinked mesh of conjugate <b>shear</b> <b>fractures,</b> tensile fractures, and veins. Oblique-extension veins crystallized in conjugate <b>shear</b> <b>fractures,</b> which opened during dilation of intersecting tensile fractures under the same far-field stress system. At the Komis gold mine, tensile and dextral <b>shear</b> <b>fractures</b> cut across granodiorite dikes. The tensile frac-tures formed perpendicular to the dike margins during stress transfer from the less-competent coun-try rocks to the more-competent dikes.

40|$|A 3 -D {{model of}} <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> in an elastic {{half-space}} provides {{insight into the}} initiation of sliding along weak pre-existing surfaces in rock or consolidated sediments. An elastic model is justified physically if regions of non-elastic deformation associated with sliding are small relative {{to the size of}} the <b>shear</b> <b>fracture.</b> A subsurface elliptical <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> parallel to the surface simulates sliding at depth along a pre-existing weakness (e. g. a bedding plane). Based on the stress concentration at the <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> perimeter, the model predicts landslide scars will tend to have elliptical shapes in map view and width-to-length values of 0. 5 ^ 1, consistent with many observations. As a <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> spreads, the stress concentration at its perimeter promotes its propagation up towards the surface. The model predicts that sliding at depth causes and precedes fracturing at the surface. For a <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> less then twice as long as it is wide, surficial fracturing should start in the head and from there ‘unzip ’ down along the slide flanks. Depending on the ambient stress state and the shear strength loss at the slide base, a <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> might need to become several or more times wider and longer than its depth to develop a sufficiently intense stress concentration to propagate out of plane to the surface. This accounts for the large length-to-thickness ratios of many natural slides. The model also accounts for the following generic landslide characteristics: a steep, arcuate, concave-downhill head scarp; an echelon pattern of opening-mode fractures along the flanks and subparallel to the head scarp trace; subsidence and normal faulting near the head of a slide; and uplift with thrust faulting near the slide toe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to numerically investigate the lap <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> of a hybrid laminate made of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) and metal foil plies (e. g. aluminium), validated by corresponding experiments. The numerical Finite Element (FE) model of the hybrid laminate, subjected to lap <b>shear</b> <b>fracture,</b> is composed of five laminas with alternating metal/CFRP layers with cohesive elements lying within Al/CFRP interface. In the FE model, individual CFRP laminas are assumed as an orthotropic homogenized continuum under plane stress, and aluminium facesheets are modelled as an elastic–plastic continuum. The Al/CFRP interface is represented via quadratic cohesive elements, the constitutive law of which is an exponentially decaying law representing the degrading behaviour of the interface (implemented as user element in ABAQUS). The numerical model captures the experimentally obtained results with minimal error, and predicts the failure modes successfully. The influence of specimen geometry (e. g. overlap length, total length, and total width) on lap <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> response is analyzed in detail in this study, too, in order to confirm the specimen design for the test, as there is still no corresponding test standard for hybrid laminates...|$|E

The result indicates that when the specimen was moved by stem, <b>shearing</b> <b>fracture</b> was generated inside the specimen where {{it was not yet}} hardened, because the resistance on the contact surface was sufficiently large to prevent slip between the metal tool and the wood specimen at 160  °C, at which temperature the specimen was cured. It is known that shearing stress at an interface cannot exceed shearing strength of a material [15]. When the shearing stress at the interface becomes equal to the shearing strength of the material, the slippage at the interface is stopped and <b>shearing</b> <b>fracture</b> is generated inside the material (sticking friction). In this case of sticking friction, the friction force is due not to shearing at the interface, but to <b>shearing</b> <b>fracture</b> [16].

40|$|Symmetrically notched beam {{specimens}} {{of concrete and}} mortar, loaded near the notches by concentrated forces that produce a concentrated shear force zone, are tested to failure. The cracks do not propagate from the notches in the direction normal to the maximum principal stress but in a direction in which shear stresses dominate. Thus, the failure is due essentially to <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> (Mode II). The crack propagation direction seems to be governed by maximum energy release rate. Tests of geometrically similar specimens yield maximum loads which agree with the recently established size effect law for blunt fracture, previously verified for tensile fracture (Mode I). This further implies that the energy required for crack growth increases with the crack extension from the notch. The R-curve that describes this increase is determined from the size effect.

We tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in wrist function or health status after open reduction and plate-and-screw fixation between volar <b>shearing</b> <b>fractures</b> with a dorsal cortical fracture (complete articular, AO Type C) and those without a dorsal cortical fracture (partial articular, AO Type B). Methods: In a multicenter cohort study, fifty-seven patients with a volar marginal <b>shearing</b> <b>fracture</b> of the distal part of the radius and volar radiocarpal subluxation were followed for at least one year following plate-and-screw fixation. Thirtyseven patients who also had a dorsal metaphyseal cortical fracture (Type-C fracture) were compared with twenty patients who had a partial articular (Type-B) fracture. The two cohorts were analyzed for differences in wrist and forearm motion, grip strength, pain, and the Gartland and Werley, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) scores at six, twelve, and twenty-four months postoperatively. Differences in mean values and their change over time were determined. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} patients with a Type-B fracture and those with a Type-C fracture with respect to motion, grip strength, or the Gartland and Werley or DASH score at any time point. At six months after the surgery, the patients with a Type-B volar <b>shearing</b> <b>fracture</b> reported a mean score for pain in motion of 0. 5 point on a 10 -point visual analogue scale compared with 2. 2 points for patients with a Type-C fracture (difference in means, 1. 7 points [95 % confidence interval, 0. 7 to 2. 6 points]; p < 0. 001), but no significant difference was seen at twelve or twenty-four months. Conclusions: Volar <b>shearing</b> <b>fractures</b> are usually complete articular, Type-C injuries.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to report the long term surgical treatment outcome of closed talar dome fractures. Methods: Eight closed talar body fractures, treated by open reduction and internal fixation with small fragment cancellous screws and/or Herbert screws in our level I trauma centre were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs of the foot (antero-posterior, lateral and oblique views) and ankle (antero-posterior, lateral and mortise views) were obtained. The patients were followed up both radiologically and functionally (foot function index, FFI) after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and then annually. Results: There were five crush <b>fractures</b> and three <b>shear</b> <b>fractures</b> (two sagittal <b>shear</b> and one coronal shear), with average follow-up of 5 years. No early complications were noticed in these patients. Late complications included osteoarthrosis of subtalar/ankle joints in six patients and osteonecrosis of talar body in four patients. On functional assessment, mean FFI after 5 years was 104. 63 points and worse outcome was noticed in crush injury and coronal <b>shear</b> <b>fractures.</b> Sagittal <b>shear</b> <b>fractures</b> had a good functional and radiological outcome.

Extension fracture surfaces display discrete, highly reflective cleavage planes and <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces are covered with calcite gouge and display grooves and striations that are aligned parallel to slip. This study uses the fractured samples that were formed under triaxial extension experiments to characterize 1) microscopic surface features using scanning electron microscopy, 2) fracture surface morphology using laser profilometry, and 3) off-fracture damage using optical microscopy. These data are used to test the step-crack model of fracture development for the formation of hybrid fractures. Spectral analysis of the profiles demonstrates that microscopic roughness decreases gradually across the extension-to-shear fracture transition in both the orientations parallel and perpendicular to slip. However, macroscopic roughness gradually increases then decreases across the transition in the direction parallel to slip. The greatest macroscopic roughness occurs at the transition from extension fractures to tensile-hybrid fractures and is attributed to the presence of macroscopic steps in hybrid fractures surfaces. The treads of the steps in the hybrid fracture surfaces have characteristics of extension fracture surfaces and the risers have characteristics of <b>shear</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces. The treads have a right-stepping left lateral geometry that is consistent with the step-crack model. Thin sections of hybrid fractures display systematically spaced, pinnate, microfractures that emanate {{from both sides of the}} macroscopic fracture surface.
