5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first <b>softswitch,</b> a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the legacy}} public {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets' calls.

2500|$|In 1993, she {{persuaded her}} husband and her {{brother-in-law}} Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry. The company was a supplier of <b>softswitch</b> technology that enabled telecom [...] "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." [...] The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology. Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became [...] "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division." [...] , she remained in that position.|$|E
