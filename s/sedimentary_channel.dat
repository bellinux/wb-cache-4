40|$|On-site {{running waters}} are often sources of diffuse {{contamination}} around industrial sites {{that need to}} be treated to prevent detrimental effect to the adjacent environment. Settling process, such as sedimentary channels, is one way to limit pollutant spreading. However, in these specific media, pollution may accumulate and sediments become depositories of toxic substances. This project deals with the management of a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>channel</b> highly contaminated by hydrocarbons with the additional difficulty of proposing a solution preserving the nearby environment located within a Natural resource protection area. The aims of the treatment were i) to prevent contaminants mobility by degradation and/or stabilization and ii) to preserve the natural resources of the site. Among remediation process, phytoremediation is an all-encompassing term that includes a variety of techniques and strategies using higher plants that lead to contaminant degradation, removal, or immobilization, by removing contaminant sources, breaking exposure pathways between the source(s) and receptor(s). Furthermore, phytoremediation can be considering as a landscaping action within the global management of the site. Since anaerobic conditions of the sediment compartment is unfavorable to plant growth and organic compounds biodegradation, we proposed a new approach combining phytoremediation and the use of a calcium peroxide (CaO 2) amendment to serve as an oxygen release product (ORP) in order to promote aerobic biodegradation and plant growth. Two experiments under controlled conditions in laboratory were performed: i) batch in vitro tests without plant in order to assess reactivity of the sediment with different ORP (ORP: IXPER 75 C, Solvay) levels and ii) plant growth assays with five selected species. The batch in vitro test showed a strong ORP-effect on physico-chemical parameters, with increasing pH and decreasing redox potential. Only the highest level of ORP enabled hydrocarbons degradation but resulted also in detrimental pH values for both microorganisms’ activity. pH increasing could also lead to strong negative effect on plant growth. Hydrocarbon dissipation was mainly attributed to oxidative processes. Lab plant growth experiments, with moderate levels of ORP to limit excessive pH increase, did not lead to any significant variation of hydrocarbon concentration. However, most of the tested species seemed to overcome the sediment detrimental growth conditions, confirming the phytoremediation feasibility for in situ application. Furthermore, ORP addition improved plant growth especially for Thalia dealbata and Scirpus lacustris. The absence of significant change in hydrocarbon content in sediments could be explained by the recalcitrant nature of the pollution a relative short term experiment. Organic chemistry characterization (GC analysis) revealed that hydrocarbon signature was marked by a large UCM (unresolved complex mixture) signal revealing an already aged and biologically stable pollution. Plant cover establishment should remain an asset in preventing sediment transfer, therefore insuring pollution stabilization, and in preserving the neighboring ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the bed shear stress along vegetated river beds is essential for accurately predicting the water level, velocity and solute and sediment transport fluxes in computational hydroenvironmental models. Details are given herein of an experimental and theoretical study to determine the bed boundary shear stress along vegetated river beds introducing a novel field measuring method, namely the FliessWasserStammtisch (FST) -hemispheres. Although investigations have been conducted previously for <b>sedimentary</b> <b>channels</b> using the FST-hemispheres, this preliminary study {{is thought to be}} the first time that such hemispheres have been used to investigate the bed shear stresses in vegetated channels. FST-hemispheres were first developed by Statzner and Müller [1989. Standard hemispheres as indicators of flow characteristics in lotic benthos research. Freshwater Biology 21, 445 - 459] to act as an integrated indicator of the gross hydrodynamic stresses present near the bed. Test and validation data were found to be at least of the same order of magnitude for the stresses predicted from literature for <b>sedimentary</b> <b>channels,</b> with this study establishing the commencement of a database of calibrated FST-hemisphere laboratory data for vegetated channel beds. In a series of experiments, depths ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 28 m were considered, equating directly to comparable conditions in small rivers or streams. The results of this study provide a basis for enabling the FST-hemispheres to be used to evaluate the boundary shear stress for a wider range of applications in the future, including vegetated river beds...|$|R

In concurrence with the placement of boulders along a thalweg, the placement of boulders along an instream to form man-made sills also helps to slow the sedimentary erosion and deposit of running water sources, while keeping the esteem (fishing, local wildlife, and recreation) and natural resources of the running water source intact. The placement of boulders along a thalweg and the creation of instream sills help to aid the flow of water during late summer months when the flow rate drops, and helps to slow sedimentary erosion and deposit in the spring and fall months when the flow rates are high. This process of utilizing a thalweg to slow stream bed erosion was used in Meacham Creek in Umatilla, Oregon.|$|R

Although NGR values calculated using well data (1 -D) are generally used as acceptable approximations of the reservoir NGR, the interpretation of the shape and lateral extension of sedimentary features solely based on vertical data is rather difficult. In this work, several models are generated to study the impact of uncertainty inherent in subsurface model conceptualization and the controlling factors. The following sections describe the geometry of channels, present several empirical equations used to explain the geometry of channels, and discuss ambiguities in their application. Petrophysical models are generated, and oil production from each model is simulated. Field-level and well-level results are compared, and the impact of various geological factors on cumulative primary production is analyzed.|$|R
40|$|Tidal rivers are a {{vital and}} little studied nexus between {{physical}} oceanography and hydrology. It {{is only in}} the last few decades that substantial research efforts have been focused on the interactions of river discharge with tidal waves and storm surges into regions beyond the limit of salinity intrusion, a realm that can extend inland hundreds of kilometers. One key phenomenon resulting from this interaction is the emergence of large fortnightly tides, which are forced long waves with amplitudes that may increase beyond the point where astronomical tides have become extinct. These can be larger than the linear tide itself at more landward locations, and they greatly influence tidal river water levels and wetland inundation. Exploration of the spectral redistribution and attenuation of tidal energy in rivers has led to new appreciation {{of a wide range of}} consequences for fluvial and coastal sedimentology, delta evolution, wetland conservation, and salinity intrusion under the influence of sea level rise and delta subsidence. Modern research aims at unifying traditional harmonic tidal analysis, nonparametric regression techniques, and the existing understanding of tidal hydrodynamics to better predict and model tidal river dynamics both in single-thread channels and in branching channel networks. In this context, this review summarizes results from field observations and modeling studies set in tidal river environments as diverse as the Amazon in Brazil, the Columbia, Fraser and Saint Lawrence in North America, the Yangtze and Pearl in China, and the Berau and Mahakam in Indonesia. A description of state-of-the-art methods for a comprehensive analysis of water levels, wave propagation, discharges, and inundation extent in tidal rivers is provided.

40|$|Understanding {{linkage between}} channel process along a river course and hill-slope process with lateral {{sediment}} sources can be significant for management of sedimentary systems. The linkage, which {{is characterized by}} distribution of storm-induced sediment in a river channel, is often expressed as sediment pulse (wave). This paper examines the propagation of sediment pulse formed by storm-induced sediment flow in two river channels of Southern Hokkaido, and classifies the patterns of sediment pulse based on difference {{in the distribution of}} accumulated sediment volume. Longitudinal changes in sediment volume along a river channel were modified to a sediment mass curve. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation analyses were employed for examining sediment mass curves. The sediment pulses demonstrated with sediment mass curve was classified to four patterns, such as decreasing, increasing, intermediate and periodic types. Decreasing type along a transport-limited channel and increasing type along a supply-limited channel were dominated. Periodic type was not influenced by <b>sedimentary</b> link between <b>channel</b> and hill-slope but independently occurred by available sediment along a channel. Furthermore these types of sediment pulse were resulted to be influenced by channel width, channel slope and (quasi-) stream power.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of fluvial and aeolian facies within the Siluro-Devonian Swanshaw Sandstone Formation of SW Scotland allows {{a more detailed}} depositional history of the Lanark basin {{in the southern part}} of the Midland Valley of Scotland to be inferred. The formation is well exposed in Ayrshire and has four main <b>sedimentary</b> facies associations: <b>Channel,</b> Aeolian, Floodplain and Mudflat. Each combines several sedimentary facies: eight facies are recognized in the channel association, three in the aeolian, four in the floodplain and two in the mudflat. These facies associations co-existed in seven different depositional settings in the western Lanark basin. Deposition occurred on a semi-arid proximal alluvial plain with an aeolian component described for the first time in the Lanark basin. Sedimentation was pulsed, largely driven by periods of source area uplift that resulted in the deposition of coarse-grained conglomeratic and sandstone-dominated facies. The principal transport was via river channels, commonly in shallow braided systems. Periods of low sediment flux are marked by fewer channels and by the preservation of floodplain successions including aeolian deposits. Abandonment of the fluvial system towards the top of the formation in Ayrshire is marked by a progression through sandflats and mudflats to the overlying volcanic formation. The relationship of the fluvial and aeolian deposits is analysed. The palaeo-wind direction is compatible with that recorded in sandstones of similar age in the Orcadian basin...|$|R

This study was combined with detailed sedimentologic analysis of continuous cores, which provided a record of depositional settings developed in this area through the Holocene. The results revealed well-preserved, meandering to anastomosed drainage networks of wide palaeochannels that were superimposed by a narrower palaeochannel system. In both cases, the sedimentary record consists of sands, heterolithic deposits and muds, locally rich in plant debris. The strata are organized into fining upward successions that reach approximately 18 m thick in the wide channels and 4 m thick in the narrow <b>channels.</b> <b>Sedimentary</b> features suggestive of a coastal location for the wider palaeochannels and reworking of sediments by tidal currents include the prevalence of well to moderately sorted, rounded to sub-rounded, fine- to medium-grained sands displaying foreset packages separated by mud couplets, suggestive of tidal cycles.

This formation at lower parts (Rock unit A) is frequence fo shale and siltstone lithologies and at upper unit (Rock unit B) mainly lithologies of sandstone with interlayers of siltstone, shale and in some parts consists of conglomerate. The most important diagenetic processes affected the Zagun Formation are mechanical compaction, pressure solution, curvilinear and autogenetic micas, and veins filled by carbonate and silica cements.

However, these studies provide limited information {{on the distribution of}} sedimentary facies within channel-fills, channel-scale stacking patterns, or the detailed stratigraphic relationship with adjacent levee-overbank deposits. Seismic-scale outcrops of Unit C 2 in the Permian Fort Brown Formation, Karoo Basin, South Africa on two subparallel fold limbs comprise thin-bedded successions, interpreted as external levee deposits, which are adjacent to channel complexes, with constituent channels filled with thick-bedded structureless sandstones, thinner-bedded channel margin facies, and internal levee deposits. Research boreholes intersect all these deposits, to link <b>sedimentary</b> facies and <b>channel</b> stacking patterns identified in core and on image logs and detailed outcrop correlation panels. Key characteristics, including depth of erosion, stacking patterns, and cross-cutting relationships, have been constrained, allowing paleogeographic reconstruction of six channel complexes in a 36 km 2 (14 mi 2) area. The system evolved from an early, deeply incised channel complex, through a series of external levee-confined and laterally stepping channel complexes culminating in an aggradational channel complex confined by both internal and external levees. Down-dip divergence of six channel complexes from the same location suggests the presence of a unique exhumed example of an exhumed deep-water avulsion node. Down-dip, external levees are supplied by flows that escaped from channel complexes of different ages and spatial positions, and are partly confined and share affinities with internal levee successions.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} of backscatter imagery {{coupled with a}} large 3 D seismic dataset in the Lower Congo Basin (LCB) reveals a patchy distribution of features interpreted {{to be associated with}} fluid seepage from 300 m to 2500 m water depth. With the exception of one region of anomalous backscatter positive-relief mounds, all inferred seep sites occur in negative-relief pockmarks. The extensive 3 D seismic dataset in the LCB offers a unique opportunity to study the plumbing system that is feeding surface cold seep systems, and in general, to reconstruct the relationship between tectonics and fluid flow in continental margins. The fluid seeps in the LCB are associated with morphologically, stratigraphically or tectonically controlled focused fluid flow. The integration of the geophysical datasets, backscatter imagery coupled to 3 D seismic, clearly indicates that fluid seeps are not randomly distributed, but their seabed organization reflects 1) the location of the underlying structure (reservoir or trap) where the fluids are coming from, 2) the geometry and morphology of the reservoir/trap, and 3) the discontinuities in the sedimentary column along which fluids have migrated. In the LCB seafloor pockmarks are always associated with underlying tectonic structures (fault zones, salt diapirs, polygonal faults) or buried <b>sedimentary</b> bodies (turbiditic <b>channels,</b> erosional surfaces), whereas they never occur above sub-horizontal parallel-stratified fine-grained sediments. Even if triggering processes can not be clearly defined here, we propose a model of seafloor fluid seep organization, which represents a new tool for identifying the geometry of flow pathways and the underlying buried bodies where the fluids are originating from.

40|$|International audienceThe Congo River, {{the second}} largest river in the world, is {{a major source of}} organic matter for the deep Atlantic Ocean because of the {{connection}} of its estuary to the deep offshore area by a submarine canyon which feeds a vast deep-sea fan. The lobe zone of this deep-sea fan is the final receptacle of the <b>sedimentary</b> inputs presently <b>channelled</b> by the canyon and covers an area of ~ 2500 km². The quantity and the source of organic matter preserved in recent turbiditic sediments from the distal lobe of the Congo deep-sea fan were assessed using Rock-Eval pyrolysis analyses. Six sites, located at approximately 5000 m water-depth, were investigated. The mud-rich sediments of the distal lobe contain high amounts of organic matter (~ 3. 5 to 4 % Corg), the origin of which is a mixture of terrestrial higher-plant debris, soil organic matter and deeply oxidized phytoplanktonic material. Although the respective contribution of terrestrial and marine sources of organic matter cannot be precisely quantified using Rock-Eval analyses, the terrestrial fraction is dominant according to similar hydrogen and oxygen indices of both suspended and bedload sediments from the Congo River and that deposited in the lobe complex. The Rock-Eval signature supports the 70 % to 80 % of the terrestrial fraction previously estimated using C/N and δ 13 Corg data. In the background sediment, the organic matter distribution is homogeneous at different scales, from a single turbiditic event to the entire lobe, and changes in accumulation rates only have a limited effect on {{the quantity and quality of}} the preserved organic matter. Peculiar areas with chemosynthetic bivalves and/or bacterial mats, explored using ROV Victor 6000, show a Rock-Eval signature more or less similar to background sediment. This high organic carbon content associated to high sedimentation rates (> 2 to 20 mm. yr− 1) in the Congo distal lobe complex implies a high burial rate for organic carbon. Consequently, the Congo deep-sea fan represents an enormous sink of terrestrial organic matter when compared to other turbiditic systems over the world...|$|R
40|$|Detailed sedimentological studies, using {{coastal and}} inland exposures, {{were carried out}} at {{formation}} and bed levels on the Ashdown and Wadhurst Clay formations (Late Berriasian-Valanginian) in the Weald, southeast England. Field descriptions of outcrops were conducted at seven sites and supplemented by borehole and 2 D seismic data. Field samples were studied in detail using hand specimen analysis. The sandstones were described in hand specimen and via optical microscopy. Clay mineral and geochemical analyses on mudstones, shales, and ironstones were conducted using XRD, XRF, and SGR methods while SEM analyses were conducted on selected sandstones and ironstones. Porosity and permeability of selected sandstones were measured using pycnometry and gas permeametry respectively. The dominance of quartz arenites and kaolinite {{and the presence of}} thorium and Zr in the sediments suggest that they were sourced mainly from granitic and/or gneissic rocks. Materials from metamorphic sources appear to be secondary in abundance. The mineralogical and textural maturity of the sediments coupled with relatively short travel distance (300 km) suggests reworking from secondary or matured sources. The two formations received sediments from at least two sources. The clay mineral assemblage, sandstone composition, and gamma-ray data confirm that the main source of the sediments is the London Massif in the north and north east while sediments were also sourced from Armorica in the south based on the presence of detrital zircon. The palaeoclimatic conditions at the source area as revealed by the dominance of quartz arenites and kaolinite and the presence of thorium were warm and humid which led to intensive weathering. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the sediments suggest that they may have been directly or indirectly sourced from a stable craton. The lithology (sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, shales and ironstones); facies (<b>channel</b> and floodplain/overbank); <b>sedimentary</b> structures (<b>channels,</b> cross stratification, flaser bedding, ripples and planar laminations); sedimentary architecture (repeated cycles and vertically stacked multi-storey successions), and gamma ray data (more radioactive sandstone facies) confirm that the sediments within the two formations were deposited in predominantly fresh water environments although tidal and lagoonal conditions were clearly evident in the Ashdown Formation and Wadhurst Clay Formation respectively. The lithology and sedimentary facies show that deposition occurred in both braided and meandering river systems although meandering facies are more prominent in the lower Ashdown Formation. The presence of abundant load and slump structures and fresh green glauconite in the sandstones provide evidence that deposition was rapid while the water depth was shallow and not beyond 2 metres based on the widespread occurrence of colour mottling and frequent exposure of the sediments to the air. Early diagenesis was confirmed by the precipitation of sideritic ironstones while diagenetic alteration is minimal based on the clay mineral assemblage. Evidence from the shallow burial nature of sideritic ironstone, the proportion of illite-smectite and the nature of diagenesis confirm that the sediments have experienced shallow burial not beyond 2 km. Enrichments in redox sensitive trace elements such as Mo, U, V and Co suggest anoxic conditions in the sediments. The highest levels of anoxia were in the lower sections of the formations. Palaeosalinity as indicated by sideritic ironstone indicates a pH between 6 and 10. Porosity ranges from 6. 8...|$|R
30|$|The {{sandstone}} {{from the}} Oligocene Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 3) in the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin, China, is extensively distributed and {{acts as an}} effective regional reservoir for hydrocarbon accumulation. Based on thin sections, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) image analysis and cathodoluminescence (CL), a comprehensive analysis of the sedimentology, petrography, diagenesis and reservoir quality of the Oligocene sandstone reservoirs of the Xiaganchaigou (E 3) Formation in the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin, are studied. The sandstones in the Lengdong area are classified as argillaceous sandstone, silty sandstone, fine sandstone, medium sandstone, pebbly sandstone, conglomeratic sandstone and conglomerate based on their grain sizes, degrees of sorting, and matrix contents. Five sedimentary facies were identified in the Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 3) of the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin: distributary channel, interdistributary bay, mouth bar, central bar and distal sand sheet facies. Their major diagenetic processes include compaction, carbonate cementation and feldspar and calcite cement dissolution. The porosity and permeability values of the fine sandstone, conglomerate, and conglomeratic sandstone are the highest, followed by those of the medium sandstone and silty sandstone, and the argillaceous sandstone and pebbly sandstone have the lowest porosity and permeability values. The diagenetic sequence {{in the study area}} ranges from the eodiagenesis B stage to the mesodiagenetic A stage. Compaction has significantly reduced the primary porosity. Carbonate cements, mainly calcite cements, occlude pores by precipitating in intergranular and intragranular spaces. Dissolution largely contributes to increasing the secondary porosity. The well-sorted and relatively coarser-grained sandstones that formed in higher-energy <b>sedimentary</b> facies (distributary <b>channel,</b> mouth bar and central bar) have a better reservoir quality than the poorly sorted, clay-rich sandstones that formed in low-energy environments (interdistributary bay and distal sand sheet). Based on the comprehensive analysis of petrographic data, diagenesis and sedimentary facies, the reservoir in the Lengdong area is classified into three types: type A, type B and type C. Type A, located {{in the center of the}} study area, is the most favorable reservoir, while type C sandstone is the last to consider when looking for a good reservoir. This study can guide hydrocarbon exploration in the Lengdong area, as well as in northwestern China and similar areas throughout the world.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} flood-related {{variations}} in provenance of fine-grained palaeochannel sediments from the Bienener Altrhein (Germany), an abandoned river channel {{close to the}} apex of the Rhine river delta. Geochemical and grain size analyses were conducted on channel-fill sediments from multiple core sections, ranging from 1. 15 m to 8. 48 m depth, which represents pre-industrial sediment deposited from approximately 1550 AD to 1850 AD. In addition, four sediment cores of ~ 1 m length were retrieved from channel-fills or overbank deposits along the Upper Rhine and the three main tributaries of the Rhine in Germany (Neckar River, Main River and Moselle River). Sediment geochemistry was analysed using an Itrax X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanner. Four elements (Ti, Co, Rb, W) were selected for further analysis based on the following a priori criteria: (1) The elements must be associated with minerals in the fine particle size fractions; 2) they must not be susceptible to precipitation-dissolution reactions during early diagenenis of the sediment; 3) the elements must be detected {{in the vast majority of}} the measurements; 4) the difference between the minimum and maximum number of the XRF counts for the upstream cores must be greater than 50 % of the average number of counts. The XRF counts for these elements were standardised to z-scores and were subsequently corrected for the variation clay content (150 μm), which was primarily deposited during historical flood events. The results show the Mahalanobis distances are larger than 1 for most increments, which indicates that the four sampled upstream sites do not entirely cover all sources of sediment deposited in the Bienener Altrein channel. The logtransformed Mahalonibis distance correlates significantly (α = 0. 05) with the > 150 μm particle size fraction for the Upper Rhine River (negative) and the Moselle River (positive). This implies that the proportion of fine sediment that originates from the upper parts of the river basin and, hence, the sediment transport distance increases with flood magnitude. These results provide an excellent starting point to reconstruct the origin of historic flood events as documented in the <b>sedimentary</b> records of <b>channel</b> fills and dike breach ponds...|$|R
40|$|The process-based {{classification}} of upland drainage networks {{and the response}} of bedrock channels to extreme events has attracted significant attention in the recent literature. The acknowledgement {{of the importance of}} headwater reaches to catchment-scale ecological and geomorphological processes highlights the need for process-based studies in such settings and an examination of how such settings respond to big flood events. A catastrophic flood event in the Lockyer Valley in 2011 resulted in significant geomorphic changes across the catchment, particularly in bedrock-confined reaches. This study assesses the post-flood channel morphology in three reaches and examines the response of such settings to the catastrophic 2011 flood and subsequent flooding in 2013. Field-survey data, multi-temporal LiDAR analysis, flood frequency analysis and sediment entrainment threshold calculations were used to investigate the reach-scale morphological response of steep, bedrock-confined channels. The results indicate that the three study reaches underwent catastrophic stripping during the 2011 flood with large-scale destruction of channel units and in-channel vegetation to create a highly disorganised channel morphology. The flood frequency analysis demonstrates that the 2011 flood is the largest on record and represents a ~ 50 -yr recurrence interval (ARI). The extent of geomorphic change due to this extreme event increased with stream order (catchment area), evidenced through volumetric analysis of alluvium eroded. However, net erosion per unit area was the greatest in the steepest (smallest catchment area) reach. The longitudinal profiles and channel cross-sections in all three reaches show extensive channel lowering and widening with erosion to bedrock occurring along much of the valley floor. Channel cross sections expanded by up to 220 % and longitudinal profiles experienced significant reductions in morphological variance with the loss of vertical variability. It is estimated that this event, with an estimated discharge range of 415 - 897 m 3 /s and an estimated unit stream power range of 616 - 1077 W/m 2, mobilised the entire grain-size population from sand to boulders up to 1670 mm in diameter. Channel recovery through vertical accretion of <b>sedimentary</b> material and <b>channel</b> narrowing has occurred to some extent following the 2011 event, most likely the function of a ~ 6 -yr ARI event in 2013. However, modern channel morphologies do not reflect existing classification frameworks for mountain stream morphology due to the disturbance of sediment supply and transport capacity conditions during this event. It is hypothesised that rare, large magnitude floods dominate the episodic morphological evolution of such settings with the recovery of in-channel units (e. g. pools and riffles) dependent on the subsequent frequency of bedload transporting events...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} mostly a {{synthesis}} of work conducted on the continental margin of the Gulf of Cádiz using a broad database collected by several cruises and projects supported by the Spanish Research Council and the NRL and Naval Oceanographic Office (USA), including: bathymetry, sidescan sonar imagery, seismic profiles, sediment cores, submarine photographs and physical oceanographic data. These data have enabled us to establish a detailed understanding of the morphologic development of the margin, its Pliocene and Quaternary stratigraphy, and a full characterization of the contourite depositional system (CDS) generated by the Mediterranean outflow water (MOW). The northern margin of the Gulf of Cádiz shows the following distinct features: (a) an active compressive framework where the “Cádiz Allocthonous Unit” provides an unstable substratum for Late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary sedimentation; (b) a relative lack of submarine canyons, except in the western area of the Algarve margin; (c) a very broad continental slope that lacks a marked continental rise; (d) a middle slope dominated by along-slope processes driven by the MOW, which has generated a complex CDS during the Pliocene and Quaternary; and (e) an irregular lower slope and abyssal plain region dominated by down-slope processes that is partly detached from an upper slope source region. The CDS is composed of both depositional and erosive features. The main depositional features are characterised by sedimentary wave fields, sedimentary lobes, mixed drifts, plastered drifts, elongated mounded, and separated drifts and sheeted drifts. The main erosive features are contourite channels, furrows, marginal valleys and moats. These various depositional and erosive features have a specific location along the margin, and their detailed distribution is essential to understand the present (and past) interaction of the MOW with the middle slope. Based on this distribution, five morphosedimentary sectors have been identified within the CDS, which {{from east to west}} are: (1) proximal scour and sand ribbons; (2) overflow <b>sedimentary</b> lobe; (3) <b>channels</b> and ridges; (4) active contourite drifts; and (5) submarine canyons. The development of the CDS has been controlled in general by the Pliocene and Quaternary environmental and paleoceanographic changes and by the morphology of the margin, but in detail the development of each of these sectors is related to systematic deceleration of the MOW as it flows westwards, to the interaction with the margin bathymetry, and to the effects of Coriolis force. Our comprehensive sedimentary model for the CDS defines the Gulf of Cádiz margin as a mixed contourite-turbidite system with a detached combined drift-fan morphology. This is different from many other contourite influenced margins, where the contourite processes are dominant on the middle slope, and separated from the down-slope processes, which are characteristic on the lower slope and abyssal plains. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a process-based, {{depth-averaged}} Delft 3 D hydrodynamic and morphologic {{model of}} the Wax Lake Delta in Atchafalaya Bay, Louisiana was developed to simulate a five year period of delta development. The purpose of this modeling effort was to test the ability of process-based modeling tools to successfully simulate typical delta-building processes and the resulting morphologic and stratigraphic characteristics of the delta. Recent developments in conceptual modeling of mouth bar formation and full delta development have confirmed the capability of process-based models to simulate the processes necessary for delta growth and the resulting long-term, geologic scale morphologic and stratigraphic features. In this attempt to model the actual development of a prototype delta using similar techniques to those employed in the conceptual delta models, the applicability of physics-based modeling to delta evolution simulation will be further validated. Morphology qualitatively reproduced typical river-dominant delta growth through the establishment of new depositional lobes while maintaining approximate radial symmetry. More specific stratigraphic features were also reproduced. The successive stacking of coarsening upwards sequences observed in Wax Lake Delta mouth bar deposits {{was evident in the}} stratigraphy of modeled incipient jet deposits, a result of the varying discharge regime. Though incipient jet deposits developed in the model at the distal ends of distributary channels, the prograding bars did not aggrade sufficiently to induce flow bifurcation {{and the development of a}} mature mouth bar depositional lobe. The overall coarsening-upwards, though sand dominant stratigraphic sequence of typical friction-dominant river mouth deposits is reproduced. Significant mud-dominant prodelta deposition is observed basinward of the original delta front location. In the prototype Wax Lake Delta, deposition of fine sediments in this area is hindered by waves and wind-induced transport, so the modeled mud depositional bodies do not reflect prototype development. Distributary channels are significantly incised and narrowed over the course of the simulation. The narrowing proceeds from significant sand-dominant subaqueous levee deposition on the channel banks. Though distributary channels in the real Wax Lake Delta do frequently incise through the full deltaic <b>sedimentary</b> sequence with <b>channel</b> extension, the modeled incision is persistent throughout the simulation. Upstream accretion of established delta lobes through sand-deposition, similar to the observed primary process of subaerial development in the neighboring Atchafalaya Delta, was also present in the modeled development. The Wax Lake Delta is clearly river-dominant according to traditional classification schemes; however, the deposition of fine sediments is influenced by basin processes that resuspend and export significant quantities from Atchafalaya Bay. The processes contributing to the coarse sediment depositional features that dominate the Wax Lake Delta are qualitatively simulated under purely riverine forcings, but the fine sediment dynamics cannot be accurately simulated in the present, process-limited model. Recommendations for improving morphological simulation include model redevelopment with an alternative, total load transport formulation and the inclusion of limited marine forcings that inhibit fine-sediment deposition.

40|$|Severe floods caused {{extensive}} damage and life-loss throughout Europe {{over the last}} decades. The magnitude and the short recurrence interval of large events {{raised questions about the}} actual safety standards for flood protection. This was reason to raise the 1, 250 -yr design flood for river dikes in the Netherlands (Waterwet, 2009) from 15, 000 to ~ 16, 000 m 3 s- 1. A major problem in calculating the magnitude of the design flood is uncertainty, which mainly originates from limited data availability for predicting the recurrence time of extreme events; a 110 -year interval of discharge data presumably poorly represents the distribution of extremes through time. Non-stationarity of the flooding regime further complicates the use of short discharge records for flood frequency analysis, as it is not expected that the distribution and magnitudes of floods is fixed in time. During the Holocene, climate variability and growing human influence have exerted perturbations to the fluvial system, which translates to gradual changes in flood probabilities. In this research available data was increased by harvesting information from sedimentary records from oxbow lake fills of the Lower Rhine. These records were cross-validated with instrumental records, historical records of the last six centuries, and between overlapping sedimentary archives. This resulted in a flood record that stretches back to 8, 200 years BP. To arrive at such a record and to use it for flood risk assessments, methodological advances were necessary. First, it was shown how alternative observational information from multiple stations and historical records can be used to extend the discharge record at Lobith. Based on this data it was already demonstrated that floods of the last decades are more rare than previously considered. Moreover, this data clearly indicated multi-decadal non-stationarity of the flooding regime. Next, various types of infilling abandoned channels were studied to target the best sites for retrieving sedimentary flood records; it was concluded that especially oxbow channel fills yield long and subtle flood deposits registration with high preservation potential and recording of flood magnitudes in the coarsest admixed grains in flood beds. <b>Sedimentary</b> characteristics of <b>channel</b> fills and flood beds were correlated with contemporaneous discharge records (since 1770 AD) and major geomorphological changes in the Lower Rhine floodplain. Besides the possibility to use largest events as stratigraphic markers, the correspondence of general fill properties to accumulation rates allowed to refine standard linear age-depth modelling. Discharges of palaeofloods were calculated from the established regression between grain-size characteristics in flood deposits and measured discharges, and hydraulic modelling based on the elevation of slackwater deposits on high terrace levels in the Lower Rhine Valley. It was found that around 4700 years ago, an extreme must have occurred of at least 13, 250 m 3 s- 1, larger than any measured discharge. Considering anthropogenic adjustments, this discharge corresponds to at least 14, 000 m 3 s- 1 in the present situation, thus reaching similar values as current flood protection levels. Other floods of similar size (millennium floods) occurred around 784 and 1374 AD, and 4500 and 6200 years ago. The 8200 -year record also indicates strong temporal variability in the flood regime, especially strong during the Little Ice Age...|$|R
40|$|Large aggregations of sylasterid corals {{have been}} {{identified}} throughout the offshore waters of the Antarctic, Sub-Antarctic and South America. These biodiverse regions are interspersed by deep trenches, <b>channels,</b> <b>sedimentary</b> plains and isolated rocky habitat, which may facilitate or inhibit dispersal over evolutionary and ecological time scales. Deep-sea sampling has increased exponentially, across these benthic habitats, due to collaborative projects such as the Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML). Consequently, {{it is now possible}} to attempt to combine genetic and taxonomic expertise, explore evolutionary relationships and assess this data in relation to environmental change – both past and future. The biogeographic distribution of stylasterid corals is representative of population isolation, based on the discovery of dissimilar species aggregations throughout sampled regions. To further investigate this biogeographic pattern, I sampled all 33 of the known stylasterid species documented from the Antarctic, Sub-Antarctic, South West Atlantic and Patagonian fiord regions across depths (10 m - > 2000 m), geographic spatial scales (10 km – 10, 000 km), and habitat types (shelf, slope, seamount and fiords). Genetic relationships were investigated using DNA sequence data from multiple gene regions including: The mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (16 S), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO 1), and the nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS). This data was assigned to four research components to determine 1) the biogeographic distribution of Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic stylasterids (n = 33 species, 14 genera). 2) Phylogenetic relationships based on morphology and genetics (n = 12 species, 8 genera). 3) Phylogenetic relationships incorporating the fossil record, to assess the evolutionary history of stylasterid populations in the Drake Passage (n = 7 species, 6 genera), and lastly, 4) genetic and demographic connectivity between populations to inform conservation management regimes (n = 7 species, 4 genera). Morphological taxonomy combined with mitochondrial DNA sequence data produced a well aligned phylogenetic cladogram. The genetic variability seen in stylasterid 16 S and CO 1 sequences was comparatively higher than other coral and hydrozoan studies, offering potential for these gene regions in DNA barcoding. This has practical implications including the discovery of new species, cataloguing of Antarctic biodiversity and identification of specimens that are impossible to determine by taxonomic means. However, phylogenetic and taxonomic alignment was only achieved through the incorporation of systematic expertise in species identification, and inter-species relationships remain unresolved when compared to the nuclear ITS gene region. Therefore, the incorporation of more gene regions for study, and the use of molecular taxonomy as a complementary tool, rather than a replacement for traditional systematics is recommended for future studies. When the mitochondrial phylogeny was calibrated with the fossil record, phylogenetic topology represented an evolutionary scenario in which stylasterid ancestors’ speciated in the Drake Passage during the Eocene/Oligocene transition boundary from calcite to aragonite sea conditions (34 MYA). The phylogeny also suggests that skeletal bi-mineralogy may have {{played a central role in}} the speciation process. The presence of calcite in some genera and literature on the utility of either calcite or aragonite through oceanic time suggest a successional progression toward aragonite mineralogy in response to modern oceanic conditions (Oligocene => modern). Further research in this area may lead to the identification of acclimation states in stylasterid corals, and information on their ability to buffer impending ocean acidification, as the chemical state of the Southern Ocean shifts towards calcite sea conditions in the near future. When investigating genetic population connectivity in the Sub-Antarctic, and across the Polar Front into South America, estimates demonstrate limited to no gene-flow across spatial scales of 300 - > 1000 km. Large scale comparisons were clearly subdivided, and genetic subdivision was evident both among populations either side of, and north of the Polar Front based on CO 1 data. However, disparate gene-flow estimates derieved from 16 S signify that populations were connected through evolutionary linkages, and connectivity south of the Polar Front may be amplified by the presence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). For fine scale comparision, local estimates of connectivity (200 km) between two Errina spp. fiord populations in Patagonia, Chile, showed no evidence of genetic subdivision (FST = 0, p = 0. 6). Similarly, Errina spp in East Antarctica also showed no evidence of genetic subdivision (ITS- 1 FST = 0. 03 P = 0. 165 and ITS- 2 FST = 0. 002, P = 0. 27). However, despite a lack of genetic differentiation in ITS Errina population comparisons, haplotype networks typify a pattern of adaptive radiation from a common ancestor, and upon comparing nucleotide polymorphism in CO 1 (π = 0. 012 – 0. 11), 16 S (π = 0 – 0. 05), ITS- 1 (π 0 - 0. 002) and ITS- 2 (π 0. 02 – 0. 03) it was determined that relative variability in 16 S and ITS represented historic connections, whilst CO 1 being more variable, may also be more recent. Taken together, results suggest that a multitude of factors influence stylasterid coral populations, and temporal variation is particularly important in the context of this study. It is recommended that researchers focus on contemporary measures of connectivity, preserve specimens with genetic research in mind (> 90...|$|R
