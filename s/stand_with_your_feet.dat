5000|$|This led {{to one of}} {{the most}} infamous events in rail history. On 7 December 1981 the press was invited aboard APT for its first {{official}} run from Glasgow to London, during which it set a schedule record at 4 hours 15 minutes. The press proved uninterested in this success. Instead, they focused on a distinct sickening sensation from the tilt system, and nicknamed APT the [...] "queasy rider". They also reported that the stewardess, Marie Docherty, suggested the solution was to [...] "just <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> apart." [...] BR engineers did little to address the problem when one publicly suggested that the reporters were simply too drunk on BR's free alcohol. On its return trip from London the next day, one of the coaches became stuck in a rotated position when the tilt system failed, and this was heavily reported in the press. Two days later, the temperature dipped and the water in the hydrokinetic brakes froze, forcing the train to end service in Crewe.|$|E

If I get tired I will fasten another loop {{by the side of}} that on which I am resting, so you can come up and pass me. There is no hurry. It ought not to take up above an hour, and it will not do for us {{to get to the top}} until the place becomes a little quiet. Tonight they are sure to be {{drinking}} and feasting over their victory until late." ...|$|R
