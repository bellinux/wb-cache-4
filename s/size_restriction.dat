25|$|When enterobactin binds ferric iron, this both {{alters the}} 3-dimensional {{conformation}} of the molecule and changes the charge from neutral to negative 3. The FepA binding site, {{formed by the}} extracellular loops, is composed of positively charged amino acids. The combination of charge-specificity and <b>size</b> <b>restriction</b> of the barrel makes FepA import highly specific for ferric-enterobactin.|$|E
25|$|The {{discharge}} valve is spring-loaded to a preset pressure discharge pressure, {{acting as a}} variable <b>size</b> <b>restriction</b> to hold a constant pressure in chamber D, despite varying fuel flow rates. The valve is opened as the discharge fuel pressure increases above the force from the spring, thereby lowering the fuel pressure to maintain a balanced position with the spring force.|$|E
50|$|In later times, the {{practical}} need for very small demos had diminished, but {{the willingness to}} compete in squeezing much into little space had not disappeared. It was therefore necessary to introduce artificial <b>size</b> <b>restrictions</b> in order to challenge the authors. In modern demoscene events, there are demo competitions with relatively loose <b>size</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and intro competitions with quite strict limits of 64 kilobytes or less.|$|R

25|$|In 1888 the Lieutenant Governor ceded {{his powers}} of electoral {{district}} creation. The powers instead came under federal control {{with the passage}} of the North-West Representation Act through the Parliament of Canada. The formula for representation of the electoral districts was revised to 2500 electors per district and no <b>size</b> <b>restriction.</b> The first comprehensive legislation detailing electoral procedures was passed by the Legislative Assembly, An Ordinance respecting Elections to the North-West Legislative Assembly was given Royal Assent on December 31, 1892. This legislation formed the basis of electoral law that is in current use today in the territories as well as Saskatchewan and Alberta.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{reactions}} of professional fishermen, western school whiting are considered to have good to excellent flesh for eating, and fetch similar high prices at market to other whiting species. Due to their offshore nature {{in the south of}} Western Australia, they are rarely taken by recreational fishermen, while {{in the northern part of}} their range where they inhabit shallower waters, they are often overlooked for larger tropical species by anglers. Thus they are not a major recreational fishery either. They respond to the same fishing styles as other whitings, generally using light lines and sinkers with worm or mollusc baits. They are caught off beaches, jetties and from boats. There is no <b>size</b> <b>restriction</b> on the species, but a daily bag limit of 40 per person applies.|$|E

Forced to move oil around the Cape of Good Hope, shipowners realized that bigger tankers were the key to more efficient transport. While a typical T2 tanker of the World War II era was [...] long and had a capacity of , the ultra-large crude carriers (ULCC) built in the 1970s were over [...] long and had a capacity of [...] Several factors encouraged this growth. Hostilities in the Middle East which interrupted traffic through the Suez Canal contributed, as did nationalization of Middle East oil refineries. Fierce competition among shipowners also played a part. But apart from these considerations is a simple economic advantage: the larger an oil tanker is, the more cheaply it can move crude oil, and the better it can help meet growing demands for oil.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{a class of}} {{stabilized}} explicit-implicit domain decomposition (SEIDD) methods for the parallel solution of parabolic problems, based on the explicit-implicit domain decomposition (EIDD) methods. EIDD methods are globally non-iterative, non-overlapping domain decomposition methods which, when compared with Schwarz alternating algorithm based parabolic solvers, are computationally and communicationally efficient for each simulation time step but suffer from time step <b>size</b> <b>restrictions</b> due to conditional stability or conditional consistency. By adding a stabilization step to the EIDD methods, the SEIDD methods are freed from time step <b>size</b> <b>restrictions</b> while retaining EIDD’s computational and communicational efficiency for each time step, rendering themselves excellent candidates for large-scale parallel simulations. Three algorithms of the SEIDD type are implemented, which are experimentally tested to show excellent stability, computation and communication efficiencies, and high parallel speedup and scalability. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model of}} prosodic structure development that takes account of the fundamental continuity between child and adult systems, the surface level divergence of child forms from their adult target forms, and the overall developmental paths of prosodic structure. The main empirical base for the study comes from longitudinal data collected from three Japanese-speaking children (1; 0 - 2; 6). Evidence for word-internal prosodic constituents including the mora and the foot is found in compensatory lengthening phenomena, syllable <b>size</b> <b>restrictions</b> and word <b>size</b> <b>restrictions</b> in early word production. By implementing the representational principles that organize these prosodic categories as rankable and violable constraints, Optimality Theory can provide a systematic account {{of the differences in}} the prosodic structure of child and adult Japanese while assuming representational continuity between the two. A constraint-based model of prosodic structure acquisition is also shown to [...] ...|$|R
