25|$|The {{start of}} the game {{could not have been}} much better for East Carolina or worse for Marshall. On the second play from scrimmage, Leftwich threw a screen pass deep in his own {{territory}} that bounced off the arms of intended receiver Denero Marriott into the hands of Ty Hunt, who returned the interception 12 yards for the game's first touchdown. On Marshall's second possession, a <b>snap</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shotgun went over Leftwich's right shoulder, and Jerome Stewart picked up the ball and ran it back 43 yards for another Pirates touchdown. Marshall appeared to be finding its rhythm on its third drive, with Leftwich completing five consecutive passes. However, that drive also ended in a turnover, with Leftwich throwing an interception to Stewart in the end zone. The quarter would end with the Pirates up 21-0, with Garrard scoring on a 9-yard run.|$|E

500|$|By April 2008, Zinta had {{completed}} shooting for Jahnu Barua's drama Har Pal. In {{the same year}} she played the leading role of Chand in Deepa Mehta's Canadian film Heaven on Earth, a Punjabi language mystical drama based on {{the true story of}} a young Indian woman who, after an arranged marriage to a non-resident Indian man from Canada, migrates to Toronto and becomes a victim of severe domestic abuse. Expressing her desire for [...] "a new kind of acting challenge", Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with to fulfill it. To prepare for the part, she read and watched several books and documentaries on domestic violence. As the film was to be shot entirely in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her, she learnt it in a crash course of fifty days. She was emotional during the making of the film: [...] "I never knew a character would affect me so deeply. I've become completely withdrawn and introspective... I can't <b>snap</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the character." [...] She eventually called it her most challenging project, as it helped her [...] "shed everything that Preity Zinta was about." [...] Heaven on Earth was first screened at several film festivals and, upon release, garnered career-best reviews for Zinta. Her performance earned her the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 2008 Chicago International Film Festival, for [...] "her strong yet subtle performance as a woman struggling to keep her dreams despite brutal realities." [...] Among other awards, she was acknowledged with Best Actress nominations at several award functions in Canada, including the Genie Award by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, and the Vancouver Film Critics Circle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} didn't {{get better}} for Miami {{in the third}} quarter. [...] On their first drive Marino was intercepted by defensive back Fimel Johnson. [...] Then on their next possession, Marino fumbled a <b>snap</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shotgun formation, and Bills lineman Bryce Paup recovered it, resulting in Christie's second field goal that gave the Bills a 27–0 lead. [...] The Dolphins responded by driving 67 yards, including Marino's 31-yard completion to O. J. McDuffie, to cut the score to 27-7 with McDuffie's 5-yard touchdown catch {{early in the fourth}} quarter. [...] But after a Bills punt, the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs at the Bills 39. [...] Following two carries by Thomas for 17 yards, fullback Tim Tindale, a rookie from Canada's Western Ontario University who had never gained more than 6 yards in a single carry before this game, took off for a 44-yard touchdown run, giving the Bills a 34-7 lead.|$|E
60|$|But Johnny didn't run. Oh, my, no! Johnny didn't run. He drew himself {{together}} {{ready to}} spring. He showed all his sharp teeth and ground them savagely.

Just in front of him the dog stopped and barked. He was a little dog, a young and foolish dog, and he was terribly excited. He barked until he almost lost his breath. He didn't like the looks of Johnny Chuck's sharp teeth. So he circled around Johnny, trying to get behind him. But Johnny turned as the dog circled, and always the little dog found those sharp teeth directly in front of him. He barked and barked, until it seemed as if he would bark his head off.|$|E
