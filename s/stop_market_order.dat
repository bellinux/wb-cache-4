40|$|This {{research}} shows that the existing literature on milk <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> misses an important effect. Previous work ignores the interaction of <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> with milk grading regulation.

Additional costs of producing fluid grade milk, omitted from previous welfare analyses, reduce producer benefits from <b>marketing</b> <b>orders.</b> Estimates of the additional cost indicate that this previously unmeasured effect is a significant component of the total welfare effect of <b>marketing</b> <b>orders.</b> An econometric model is developed to explain the variation in the fluid grade share of milk across states and time as a function of <b>marketing</b> <b>order</b> policy. Regression results support the hypothesis that <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> have encouraged the shift towards production of fluid-grade milk. Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|In order-driven markets, limit-order book (LOB) {{resiliency}} is {{an important}} microscopic indicator of market quality when the order book is hit by a liquidity shock and plays {{an essential role in}} the design of optimal submission strategies of large orders. However, the evolutionary behavior of LOB resilience around liquidity shocks is not well understood empirically. Using order flow data sets of Chinese stocks, we quantify and compare the LOB dynamics characterized by the bid-ask spread, the LOB depth and the order intensity surrounding effective <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> with different aggressiveness. We find that traders are more likely to submit effective <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> when the spreads are relatively low, the same-side depth is high, and the opposite-side depth is low. Such phenomenon is especially significant when the initial spread is 1 tick. Although the resiliency patterns show obvious diversity after different types of <b>market</b> <b>orders,</b> the spread and depth can return to the sample average within 20 best limit updates. The price resiliency behavior is dominant after aggressive <b>market</b> <b>orders,</b> while the price continuation behavior is dominant after less-aggressive <b>market</b> <b>orders.</b> Moreover, the effective <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> produce asymmetrical stimulus to limit orders when the initial spreads equal to 1 tick. Under this case, effective buy <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> attract more buy limit orders and effective sell <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> attract more sell limit orders. The resiliency behavior of spread and depth is linked to limit order intensity. Comment: 18 pages inclusing 8 figure...|$|R
