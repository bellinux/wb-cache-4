50|$|In {{population}} genetics, the allele <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum,</b> {{sometimes called}} the site <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum,</b> is {{the distribution of the}} allele frequencies of a given set of loci (often SNPs) in a population or sample. Because an allele <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> is often a summary of or compared to sequenced samples of the whole population, it is a histogram with size depending on the number of sequenced individual chromosomes. Each entry in the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> records the total number of loci with the corresponding derived allele frequency. Loci contributing to the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> are assumed to be independently changing in frequency. Furthermore, loci are assumed to be biallelic (that is, with exactly two alleles present), although extensions for multiallelic <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> exist.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{main product}} of the DFT {{algorithms}} is the amplitude <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> while the phase <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> calculation is mainly unwanted. However, this part becomes relevant in the cases, in which the spectral lines {{have to be considered}} as vectors. Since the data record, from which the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> is calculated, is usually acquired by non-coherent sampling, a problem of the correct phase determination appears. Time windows minimise the leakage in the amplitude frequency spectrum; their effect on the phase <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> is unclear. Moreover, the phase of each frequency depends on its initial phase and it varies in every data record, which is often undesired. One possibility of how to exactly express the phases of higher harmonic components is described in this paper. I. Rectangular window The amplitude <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> as well as the phase <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> strongly depend on the time window used. Sampling without application of any window can be described as a multiplication of the sampled signal by rectangular window or by the sequence of unitary discrete pulses.

The sources of vibration and noise depend on the transportation mean type. Therefore every transportation mean identifies itself by characteristic <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> and noise level. Using the recording of the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> of the transportation means, one can identify the attenuation methods of the generated noise.

30|$|As {{shown in}} the {{frequency}} spectral maps, the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> are mainly concentrated in the low- and medium-frequency responses below 100  Hz. This result is consistent with that in other studies [21 – 23]. The <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the motor bracket load is concentrated at 20 and 60 HZ. The <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the gearbox bracket load is concentrated below 10  Hz. The torsion load spectrum is concentrated below 10  Hz. The <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the stress response is concentrated at 20 and 60  Hz.

40|$|We {{consider}} the decoherence of photons suffering in phase-damping channels. By exploring the evolutions of single-photon polarization states and two-photon polarization-entangled states, {{we find that}} different <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> envelopes of photons induce different decoherence processes. A white <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> can lead the decoherence to an ideal Markovian process. Some color <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrums</b> can induce asymptotical decoherence, while, some other color <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrums</b> can make coherence vanish periodically with variable revival amplitudes.

5000|$|The {{expected}} allele <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> may {{be calculated}} using either a coalescent or diffusion approach. The demographic {{history of a}} population and natural selection affect allele frequency dynamics, and these effects {{are reflected in the}} shape of the allele <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum.</b> For the simple case of selective neutral alleles segregating in a population that has reached demographic equilibrium (that is, without recent population size changes or gene flow), the expected allele <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> [...] for a sample of size [...] is given by where [...] is the population scaled mutation rate. Deviations from demographic equilibrium or neutrality will change the shape of the expected <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|R

By comparing observed data summarized in a <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> to the expected <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> calculated under a given demographic and selection model, one can assess the goodness of fit of that the model to the data, and use likelihood theory to estimate the best fit parameters of the model.|$|R
40|$|Many fabric defects {{are very}} small and undistinguishable, which are very {{difficult}} to detect by only monitoring the intensity change. Faultless fabric is a repetitive and regular global texture and Fourier transform can be applied to monitor the spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a fabric. When a defect occurs in fabric, its regular structure is changed so that the corresponding intensity at some specific positions of the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> would change. However, the three-dimensional <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> is very difficult to analyze. In this paper, a simulated fabric model is used to understand the relationship between the fabric structure in the image space and in the frequency space. Based on the three-dimensional <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum,</b> two significant spectrum diagrams are defined and used for analyzing the fabric defect. These two diagrams are called the central spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrums.</b> The defects are broadly classified into four classes: (1) double yarn; (2) missing yarn; (3) webs or broken fabric; and (4) yarn densities variation. After evaluating these four classes of defects using some simulated models and real samples, seven characteristic parameters for central spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> are extracted for defect classification. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} the practicability of using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) {{in combination with}} Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine the size and location of a defect in a material of known geometry and physical constants. Defects were analyzed by comparing the actual change in <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> measured by RUS to the change in <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum</b> calculated using FEA. FEA provides a means of determining acceptance/rejection criteria for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). If FEA models of the object are analyzed with defects in probable locations; the resulting resonant <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> will match the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> of actual objects with similar defects. By analyzing many FEA-generated <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra,</b> {{it is possible to}} identify patterns in behavior of the resonant frequencies of particular modes based {{on the nature of the}} defect (location, size, depth, etc.). Therefore, based on the analysis of sufficient FEA models, it should be possible to determine nature of defects in a particular object from the measured resonant frequency. Experiments were conducted on various materials and geometries comparing resonant <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> measured using RUS to <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> calculated using FEA. Measured <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> matched calculated <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> for steel specimens both before and after introduction of a thin cut. Location and depth of the cut were successfully identified based on comparison of measured to calculated resonant frequencies. However, analysis of steel specimens with thin cracks, and of ceramic specimens with thin cracks, showed significant divergence between measured and calculated <b>frequency</b> <b>spectra.</b> Therefore, it was not possible to predict crack depth or location for these specimens. This thesis demonstrates that RUS in combination with FEA can be used as an NDT method for detection and analysis of cracks in various materials, and for various geometries, but with some limitations. Experimental results verify that cracks can be detected, and their depth and location determined with reasonable accuracy. However, experimental results also indicate that there are limits to the applicability of such a method, the primary one being a lower limit to the size of crack ? especially thickness of the crack - for which this method can be applied...|$|R
