5|$|Temple 3 (also {{known as}} Structure 3) is a pyramid-temple {{located on the}} east side of Plaza A, {{opposite}} Temple 2, and is similar in form to that building. The stairway climbs the west (plaza) side of the temple platform. In front of the stairway, at the level of the plaza, is a small rectangular platform. A large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building, these were pieces of large cylindrical incense-burners, of which more than twelve were used in the temple. One represented an elderly god emerging from the jaws of a serpent, another two show the same deity in a standing position. They may represent one of the patrion deities of the Kaqchikel, B'elehe-Toh or Hun-Tihax. The incense burners were found exactly where the Kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned Iximche. Some of these incense-burners bore a suspended <b>solar</b> <b>disc</b> with modelled rays. Fragments of an Early Postclassic plumbate ware vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of the temple that were probably the remains of a relic from within the temple itself. There is no evidence of such early occupation at Iximche and may have been plundered from Zaculeu, a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance. A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3. Two low platforms stand in front of the temple, they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of an atmosphere on Venus was concluded by Mikhail Lomonosov {{on the basis of}} his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 from the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. He used a two-lens achromat refractor and a weak solar filter (smoked glass) and [...] reported seeing a bump or bulge of light ("Lomonosov's arc") off the <b>solar</b> <b>disc</b> as Venus began to exit the Sun. Lomonosov attributed that effect to refraction of solar rays through an atmosphere; he also reported the appearance of a sliver around the part of Venus that had just entered the Sun's disk during the initial phase of transit. [...] In 2012, Pasachoff and Sheehan reported, based on knowing what Venus's atmosphere would look like because of Pasachoff and Schneider's observations of the 2004 transit of Venus, that what Lomonosov reported was not Venus's atmosphere. To make a decisive test, a group of researchers carried out experimental reconstruction of Lomonosov's discovery of Venusian atmosphere with antique refractors during the transit of Venus on [...] 5–6 June 2012. They observed the [...] "Lomonosov's arc" [...] and other aureole effects due to Venus's atmosphere and concluded that Lomonosov's telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around Venus off the Sun's disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by Lomonosov in his 1761 paper are employed.|$|E

2500|$|Active regions involve all the {{phenomena}} {{directly linked to}} the magnetic field, which occur at different heights above the Sun's surface: sunspots and faculae, occur in the photosphere, spicules, Hα filaments and plages in the chromosphere, prominences in the chromosphere and transition region, and flares and coronal mass ejections happen in the corona and chromosphere. If flares are very violent, they can also perturb the photosphere and generate a Moreton wave.

40|$|Various solar {{features}} {{can be seen}} on maps of the Sun in the mm and sub-mm wavelength range. The recently installed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) {{is capable}} of observing the Sun in that wavelength range with an unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. To interpret solar observations with ALMA the first important step is to compare ALMA maps with simultaneous images of the Sun recorded in other spectral ranges. First we identify different structures in the solar atmosphere seen in the optical, IR and EUV parts of the spectrum (quiet Sun (QS), active regions (AR), prominences on the disc, magnetic inversion lines (IL), coronal holes (CH) and coronal bright points (CBPs)) in a full <b>disc</b> <b>solar</b> ALMA image. The second aim is to measure the intensities (brightness temperatures) of those structures and compare them with the corresponding QS level. A full <b>disc</b> <b>solar</b> image at 1. 21 mm obtained on December 18, 2015 during a CSV-EOC campaign with ALMA is calibrated and compared with full <b>disc</b> <b>solar</b> images from the same day in Hα, in He I 1083 nm core, and with SDO images (AIA at 170 nm, 30. 4 nm, 21. 1 nm, 19. 3 nm, and 17. 1 nm and HMI magnetogram). The brightness temperatures of various structures are determined by averaging over corresponding regions of interest in the ALMA image. Positions of the QS, ARs, prominences on the disc, ILs, CHs and CBPs are identified in the ALMA image. At 1. 21 mm ARs appear as bright areas (but sunspots are dark), while prominences on the disc and CHs are not discernible from the QS background, although having slightly less intensity than surrounding QS regions. ILs appear as large, elongated dark structures and CBPs correspond to ALMA bright points. These results are in general agreement with sparse earlier measurements at similar wavelengths. The identification of CBPs represents the most important new result. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

In order to clear up the origin and possibly explain some <b>solar</b> limb and <b>disc</b> spicule quasi-periodic recurrences produced by overlapping effects, we present a simulation model assuming quasi- random positions of spicules. We also allow a set number of spicules with different physical properties (such as: height, lifetime and tilt angle as shown by an individual spicule) occurring randomly. Results of simulations made with three different spatial resolutions of the corresponding frames and also for different number density of spicules, are analyzed. The wavelet time/frequency method is used to obtain the exact period of spicule visibility. Results are compared with observations of the chromosphere from i/ the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) filtergrams taken at 1600 angstrom, ii/ the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) of Hinode taken in the Ca II H-line and iii/ the Sac-Peak Dunn's VTT taken in Hα line.

40|$|The {{solar system}} started to form about 4. 56 Gyr ago {{and despite the}} long {{intervening}} time span, there still exist several clues about its formation. The three major sources for this information are meteorites, the present solar system structure and the planet-forming systems around young stars. In this introduction we give {{an overview of the}} current understanding of the solar system formation from all these different research fields. This includes the question of the lifetime of the <b>solar</b> protoplanetary <b>disc,</b> the different stages of planet formation, their duration, and their relative importance. We consider whether meteorite evidence and observations of protoplanetary discs point in the same direction. This will tell us whether our solar system had a typical formation history or an exceptional one. There are also many indications that the solar system formed as part of a star cluster. Here we examine the types of cluster the Sun could have formed in, especially whether its stellar density was at any stage high enough to influence the properties of today's solar system. The likelihood of identifying siblings of the Sun is discussed. Finally, the possible dynamical evolution of the solar system since its formation and its future are considered.

40|$|Star {{formation}} and chemical enrichment {{histories of the}} dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor are investigated by means of chemical evolution models and a simulation code for colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The CMD simulation code is designed to fully consider effects of the chemical evolution on stellar evolution and photometric properties. Comparisons between the chemical evolution models and the observed abundance patterns reveal that the star formation rates were very low (1 - 5 % of that of the <b>solar</b> neighbourhood <b>disc)</b> and that the initial star formation continued for a long duration (> 3. 9 - 6. 5 Gyr) in these dSphs. This star formation history can reproduce morphologies of the observed CMDs, such as narrow red giant branches and red horizontal branches. Hence, both of the abundance patterns and the morphologies of the CMDs {{can be explained by}} the star formation histories characterised by the low star formation rate and the long duration of the star formation period.
