40|$|WP 12 / 2006; This paper aims at {{examining}} the university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> context at present {{in place in}} Italy, with {{particular attention to the}} relationship with the academic institutions and the problems of financing. In the latest years, more and more attention is devoted to investigate the emergence of the university spin-off phenomenon. There is an increasing focus on universities’ entrepreneurial orientation and their ability to exploit and transfer scientific knowledge to the commercial sector. The present paper is based on a series of interviews held during the period May-July 2005 in several university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> in Milan, Bologna, Padova and Genova. The paper is divided in two parts. In the first one, after a theoretical background on the spin-off literature, it follows a general description of the United Kingdom context and the Italian university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> framework and their characteristics. The second part is focused on an analysis of the <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> interviewed. The results highlight positive and negative factors in the relationship between university institutions and <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> Furthermore, the relationships with banks and venture capitalists are investigated. The interviews highlighted a lack of competencies in the financial sector and a general negative opinion on venture capital. Italian university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> have difficulties in negotiating good conditions with banks and are afraid to trust in venture capitalists. Besides, Italy doesn’t have an effective business angels network and it lacks seed capital. Therefore they prefer to count on the classical three Fs, 'family, friends and fools', to raise capital for their business. Notwithstanding, Italian university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> are characterised by a very high know-how background and a great desire of independence. In conclusion, Italy is just at the beginning in developing the university spin-off phenomenon. Most universities emanated spin-off regulations only in recent years. There is significant potential for the Italian university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> to play a bigger, more enhanced role in the creation of new jobs in the future, and in supporting technology transfer...|$|E

40|$|Academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> tend to grow slowly which {{decreases}} {{the effectiveness of}} policies enhancing the knowledge based economy. The average growth of the 105 academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> in this research is 1. 2 fte per year, however the median is only 0. 4 fte per year. In order {{to increase the speed}} at which academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> grow, insight in what can go well and wrong needs to be obtained. This research is focussing on the match between incoming information about resources and resource deficiencies of academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms,</b> and the effect of this match on the firms growth. The match in this research will be defined as the response of the academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> to resource deficiencies in terms of attracting external information about these resources. A good match would mean that the firms are acting pre-emptively, solving problems before they exist. The main research questions which this research answers is: "How well does the incoming information retrieved from the knowledge networks of the academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> match with the resources they are lacking, and how does this match influence the growth". By using common sense the following hypothesis is proposed and later tested: "Firms which are better at matching the incoming information from their knowledge networks with their missing resources, and thus have a higher match, grow faster". This research question and hypothesis is analysed and tested by using a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. The main part of this research is done quantitatively by using STATA®. After the quantitative results are known they are interpreted, and checked qualitatively through four in-depth interviews. These results combined generate the validated results. The dataset which is used to perform the quantitative part contains data about 105 academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> in Delft and Trondheim. The trend which is found is that academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> which are pre-emptively obtaining information about investment capital, or management skills grow faster than their counterparts which are reactive or passive. This conclusion also verifies the hypothesis and shows that firms which are better at matching the incoming information by acting pre-emptively do experience a faster growth. The recommendations which follow from these results are split into two categories: recommendations for the firms, and recommendations for the incubators. The recommendations for the academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> are as follows. Try to be ahead of future resource deficiencies, and solve future resource deficiencies before they emerge. If your firm is experiencing a strong growth make sure that the management skills within the firm are developed to sustain such growth before the lack of management skills is holding the firm back. The recommendations for the incubators are based on the recommendations to the academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> In order to make sure the firms act pre-emptively they need to know when to attract information. The incubator should therefore create an early warning system based upon the actual stage of development of the academic <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> This stage of development should include the number of employees of the firm, the capital position of the firm, the maturity of the product the firm is selling, and the current resource deficiencies of the firm.

40|$|Purpose: – The {{university}} is an institution {{with a long}} history and, {{over the course of the}} centuries, it has gone through several stages in its development. While initially conceived as an institution with a teaching “mission,” the university later adopted a knowledge generation function (research). In recent years, the idea has emerged that the {{university is}} assuming a “third mission”: contributing to society and economic development more directly; turning the university into an Entrepreneurial University. What, however, constitutes this Entrepreneurial University? Are all Entrepreneurial Universities composed of the same factors? The purpose of this paper is to answer these significant questions, through an empirical analysis performed on a sample of 59 Northern and Southern European universities.

40|$|University <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> {{in their}} first, often critical, years face a {{shortage}} of basic resources needed for growth. A major way of gaining such resources is through knowledge derived from social networks. However, social networks may be quite different in nature such that the influence of these networks on growth of university spin‐offs may vary, like according to tightness, strength, social heterogeneity and spatial proximity of network partners. In this paper, we first examine theoretical ideas on social capital {{and the role of}} social networks. This is followed by an empirical study of university <b>spin‐off</b> <b>firms</b> to explore differences in social networks between two development stages and to estimate the influence of network characteristics on growth in these stages. Early stage spin‐offs tend to employ networks dominated by tightness, strong relationships, more homogeneous partners and local partners, whereas networks of spin‐offs in later stages tend to face clearly contrasting features. Furthermore, network characteristics tend to influence growth mainly in years following the early stage, with a positive influence of social capital in networks that are relatively open to new knowledge and information.

40|$|Recently, {{the topic}} of {{internal}} corporate governance {{has been the focus}} of many studies by scholars and practitioners. Specifically, researchers have studied the effects of board structure on shareholders' wealth in the context of different financial decisions, such as green mail, management buy-out, bankruptcy, and mergers and acquisitions. However, the differences in the internal governance of divestitures, usually undertaken to reverse a merger activity and increase the firm's focus on its core business, have not been empirically investigated. This study examines the market reaction to divestiture decisions characterized by spin-offs and equity carve-outs. It further moves to analyze the determinants of such reaction by focusing on firm specific variables, as well as those characterized by the board structure of the divested firm. To our knowledge, this latter aspect of divestiture decisions has not been comprehensively analyzed in the literature. The results show that only shareholders of <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> realize significant abnormal returns at the announcement date. There is some support for the hypothesis that states that carve-out firms have higher needs for external financing. The belief that carve-out firms have better access to capital markets is not empirically supported. Also, market reactions to divestitures, which are characterized by smaller boards, are found positive and larger, supporting the efficiency argument of the firm's internal governance. Moreover, a higher voting control by outside directors was positively related to the abnormal returns of the divestiture sample. <b>Spin-off</b> <b>firms</b> with higher dividends realize lower returns at the announcement of a divestiture. Outside board directorships are associated with positive abnormal returns for <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> In addition, CEO-chairman duality decreases shareholders' wealth in <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|E

30|$|The present study, however, in {{an attempt}} to provide an {{innovative}} contribution to management literature, focuses on the relationship between the parent and the spin-off company; in particular, it explores the possible role assumed by the latter in relation to the former. Hence, starting from the stakeholder theory and the assumption that a spin-off may occur as a spontaneous process (that only employees desire) or an induced process (expected also by the parent company), it is possible to theorize three potential attitudes of a <b>spin-off</b> <b>firm</b> towards its parent: hostile, supportive, and non-oriented. In this view, when a spin-off process occurs, the parent company could ‘gain’ a new stakeholder. For the sake of brevity, our research focuses on companies born by spontaneous spin-off. Therefore, it is assumed that such a stakeholder, by virtue of the ‘critical’ knowledge scripts synthesized by the new entrepreneurs (ex-employees), serves purposes {{similar to those of the}} parent company, however assuming a hostile attitude towards the latter. Thus, the spin-off process would give birth to a competitor. The plausibility of this hypothesis is subsequently tested through multivariate statistical techniques.|$|R
40|$|Open {{innovation}} is well conceptualized and researched for large established firms, {{but not for}} small and young ones. What makes small high-technology firms more open in search behaviour and innovation and others more closed, has remained largely unknown. This particularly holds true for university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> The paper fills this gap and deals with {{the extent to which}} openness is adopted among university <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> Openness in this paper is measured by two dimensions, capacity and diversity, and an explanation is sought for the variation in these dimensions. For this purpose we develop a set of models including enabling factors and strategic intentions factors, and we control for competition in the business environment and density in the urban environment. Using an exploratory approach in regression analysis, our models of openness diversity (sources of knowledge use) tend to be stronger than the models of openness capacity (size of external knowledge pool). Openness diversity varies with four enabling factors, i. e., science-driven innovation, size of firm, size of founding team and pre-start experience, and with prospector strategy. Location tends also to be important, with a higher level of openness diversity in rural/peripheral areas. Finally, we develop a framework linking openness dimensions and growth of <b>spin-off</b> <b>firms.</b> Innovation SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E
