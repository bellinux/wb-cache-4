50|$|Orrell {{played their}} home games at Edge Hall Road from 1950 until 2007. <b>Sub-landlord</b> Dave Whelan, who was granted {{ownership}} of the lease on the land in 2001 after paying members £1,000 each for their shares, subsequently bought the freehold of the site {{on the death of}} the owner and sold the three pitches that had hosted the 2nd, 3rd and 4th XV's as well as all Junior sides for over £3 million.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many parts}} of the UK there are {{substantial}} freeholders who historically have owned and continue to own large land holdings, and this ownership has been and continues to be passed under leased ownership to <b>sub-landlords</b> and leaseholders; this system was particularly suitable when areas of London were initially built on greenfield land, and later in the period immediately after the Second World War, when considerable renovation and rebuilding was urgently required, the estates were able to effectively subcontract redevelopment to <b>sub-landlords,</b> known as head-lessors.|$|R
60|$|Within {{three months}} Carl had become {{assistant}} bar-keeper, {{and now he}} could save eight dollars a week. He bought a couple of motor magazines and went to one vaudeville show and kept his <b>sub-landlord's</b> daughter from running off with a cadet, wondering how soon she would do it in any case, and receiving a depressing insight into the efficiency of society for keeping in the mire {{most of the people}} born there.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>sub-landlord's</b> {{daughter}} was a dwarfish, blotched-faced, passionate child of fifteen, with moist eyes and very low-cut waists of coarse voile (which she pronounced [...] "voyle"). She would stop Carl {{in the dark}} [...] "railroad" [...] hallway and, chewing gum rapidly, chatter about the aisleman at Wanamacy's, and what a swell time there {{would be at the}} coming ball of the Thomas J. Monahan Literary and Social Club, tickets twenty-five cents for lady and gent, including hat-check. She let Carl know that she considered him close-fisted for never taking her to the movies on Sunday afternoons, but he patted her head and talked to her like a big brother and kept himself from noticing that she had clinging hands and would be rather pretty, and he bought her a wholesome woman's magazine to read--not an entirely complete {{solution to the problem of}} what to do with the girl whom organized society is too busy to nourish, but the best he could contrive just then.|$|R
