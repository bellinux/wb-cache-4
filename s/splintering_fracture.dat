2500|$|The first {{broadside}} sent splinters {{flying in}} the President's spar deck where Decatur was standing. A large splinter {{hit him in the}} chest knocked him over while another cut his forehead. His first Lieutenant who was standing next to him had his leg cut off by a splinter and was knocked down and through the wardroom hatch. Another <b>splinter</b> fatally <b>fractured</b> the skull of a Lieutenant next to him too. Before that point it may well have been believed that Endymion was a standard 18-pounder frigate as she was firing at president with only her brass 18-pounder long bow chaser. It was clear that 24-pounder shot form Endymion's broadside was much more effective than the 18-pounder shot that Decatur had experienced from the HMS Macedonian while he was aboard the United States. Such 18-pounder shot from the HMS Guerriere was unable to pierce the USS Constitution which was built to the same design as President giving the Constitution the nickname of [...] "Old Ironsides" [...] It was clear that the British had learned from their losses early in the war.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{thoracic}} surgery performed for diagnosis or treatment of chest conditions has required {{access to the}} chest through thoracotomy or sternotomy incisions. Sternotomy {{requires the use of}} a sternal saw to divide the sternum and requires spreading of the divided portions of the sternum with a sternal retractor to allow for visualization of the thoracic structures, passage of instruments into the chest, and removal of specimens. Thoracotomy, as most commonly performed, requires division of one or more major muscles of the chest wall including the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis or serratus muscles, along with spreading of the ribs with a rib spreader. Because the joints of the ribs with the vertebral bodies have only limited flexibility, the use of a rib spreader usually results in rib fractures in the process of rendering the interspace between the ribs wide enough to perform diagnostic or therapeutic maneuvers. Because of this, thoracic surgeons generally intentionally remove a section of one or more ribs in an effort to prevent <b>splintered</b> rib <b>fractures</b> {{associated with the use of}} a rib spreader. Sternotomy and thoracotomy have been proven over decades to provide highly effective means of access to thoracic structures and in general are tolerated by patients. However, both incisions have the potential for causing significant pain that may last for extended periods and both result in bony fractures that require a minimum of six weeks to heal during which time patients must refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous activity. The great advantage of VATS over sternotomy or thoracotomy is avoidance of muscle division and bone fractures that allows for diminished duration and intensity of pain and a shorter time to return to full activity.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. 'The Besieged Ego' critically appraises the representation, or mediation, of identity in contemporary film and television shows through a thorough analysis of split and fragmentary characters. As I show, the prevalence of nonautonomous characters in horror, fantasy and psychological based film and television products {{calls into question the}} very concept of a unified, 'knowable' identity that can be traced progressively through time with continuity. I use psychoanalysis as an interpretive tool and model in order to effectively understand representations of identity that are not 'whole'; psychoanalysis arguably allows for, and engages with, a <b>splintered</b> or <b>fractured</b> identity as its very premise lies in unknowable psychical forces such as the unconscious. The concept of 'ego' is particularly useful as a concept through which to analyse onscreen representations of identity; the differing definitions of Freud's ego (realist and narcissistic) alongside Lacan's delusional ego allow for an understanding of identity that shifts and is deeply enigmatic, unknowable and in essence confusing. However, representations of split identities can only be fully examined in light of social and cultural contexts; I therefore employ an eclectic range of approaches and methodologies throughout the thesis in order to ascertain what is at stake in the representation and meaning of the double. The form of the double, and cinematic modes and rhetorics used to denote fragmentary identity, is addressed in the thesis through a detailed analysis of texts drawn from a range of industrial and cultural contexts. The double carries significant cultural meanings {{about what it means to}} be 'human' and the experience of identity as a gendered individual; I argue that the double, or split identity, has become a 'new myth' that expresses in fictional form our problematic experience of the world as a social, and supposedly whole and autonomous, subject...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{pulmonary}} lobectomy {{is performed}} through a poster-lateral thoracotomy incision; over decades, thoracotomy has demonstrated its effectiveness in {{providing access to}} structures in the thorax and is in general tolerated by patients. Thoracotomy, as most commonly performed, requires cutting through one or more major muscles of the chest wall including the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis or serratus muscles, and spreading of the ribs with a rib spreader. Because the joints of the ribs with the vertebral bodies have only limited flexibility, {{the use of a}} rib spreader usually results in rib fracture in the process of rendering the interspace between the ribs wide enough to perform a pulmonary lobectomy. Because of this, thoracic surgeons generally intentionally remove a section of one or more ribs in an effort to prevent <b>splintered</b> rib <b>fracture</b> {{associated with the use of}} the rib spreader. There is wide consensus that thoracotomy is one of the most painful incisions that patients can undergo. In the initial post-operative setting after thoracotomy, the use of epidural catheters, patient-controlled analgesia pumps for intravenous narcotic administration, and intravenous ketorolac are commonplace and patients generally require a 7- to 10-day hospital stay before their pain is adequately controlled with oral opioid analgesics that they can take at home. A great deal of emphasis is placed on post-operative pulmonary toilet because the incisional pain associated with thoracotomy leads to a decreased ability of patients to cough and clear bronchial secretions, which in turn leads to an increased risk of persistent atelectasis (collapsed areas of lung) or pneumonia. Finally, to allow time for the divided muscles and bone fractures to heal, patients must refrain from strenuous activity or lifting greater than 5 lbs for 6 weeks after surgery.|$|R
40|$|Background: Treatment of humeral shaft {{fractures}} with intramedullary nailing {{compared with}} dynamic compression plating leads to comparable results. No single treatment option is superior in all circumstances {{for a particular}} fracture and each case has to be individualized. Objectives: Comparative assessment of results of plating and Intramedullary Nailing in a rural set up so that proper management techniques can be provided for better functional outcome and minimum complications. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted {{over a period of}} three years on sixty patients with closed acute humeral shaft fracture requiring operative interventions. Results: Forty percent of cases were in the age group 31 - 40 years with males outnumbering females. Motor vehicle accidents (63. 3 %) were most frequent cause. Right humerus was more frequently (66. 6 %) involved. Maximum patients (40 %) were operated within 4 - 6 days after injury. Out of 30 patients of plate group complications were: Infection- 6. 6 %; delayed union- 13. 3 %; shoulder movement restriction- 13. 3 %; elbow movement restriction- 6. 6 %. Out of 30 patients of nail group complications were: <b>Splintering</b> of <b>fracture</b> end- 6. 6 %; infection- 6. 6 %; delayed union- 26. 6 %; shoulder movement restriction- 13. 3 %; elbow movement restriction- 6. 6 %; shoulder pain- 46. 6 %. Maximum number of fractures (73. 3 % in plating group and 60 % in nailing group) clinically united in the interval of 11 - 13 weeks. Maximum number of patients had radiological union in period of 12 - 16 weeks (73. 3 % plate group and 66. 6 % nail group). There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups. On functional assessment, excellent results were obtained in 22 patients (73. 3 %) in locking plate group and 18 patients (60 %) in locking nail group. Conclusion: For patients requiring surgical treatment of mid shaft humeral fractures, locking plating and interlocking intramedullary nailing both provide statistically comparable results but a higher rate of excellent and good results and a tendency for earlier union was seen with locking plating group in the present series...|$|R

He had mustered boarding parties in case the British were taken by surprise, but Endymion also turned to starboard and the two ships headed south, exchanging broadsides. Decatur had no time to batter the British vessel into surrender, if he could, as the other three British ships would almost certainly be in range before long; so his gunners fired high into Endymions rigging, seeking to disable her, using chain shot and [...] "dismantling shot" [...] (bars of iron linked by a ring), while the British gunners fired low into the hull of President. However, it was claimed that the shooting was poor on both sides while Presidents powder was defective. Despite this claim, gunfire from the Endymion significantly damaged the Presidents hull. Shot had pierced President below the waterline and 6 feet of water was found in the hold(although some could have been from the grounding). Furthermore [...] Endymion successfully disabled 6 guns on the President s starboard broadside by damaging the barrels or shooting them off their carriages. 10 out of the 15 starboard gun ports were hit and the gun crews reduced. Shot from the Endymion was even found inside the President s magazine. Given the situation, President might have been on its way to sinking. This suggests that Philip Brokes method of naval gunnery was effectively used in the engagement as was it in the engagement between Shannon and Chesapeake 18 months earlier as in both cases the British were able to target the enemys gun ports. These were remarkably small targets given the accuracy of naval guns of the era and it is likely that Brokes method of using gunsights and degree markings on the deck were the key method in which that such small targets were able to be hit. Meanwhile, President had significantly cut the rigging of Endymion effectively slowing it down.|$|R
