In Kalundborg, Denmark a <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> links a 1500MW coal-fired power plant with the community and other companies. Surplus heat from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes {{in addition to a}} nearby fish farm, whose sludge is then sold as a fertilizer. Steam from the power plant is sold to Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical and enzyme manufacturer, in addition to a Statoil plant. This reuse of heat reduces the amount thermal pollution discharged to a nearby fjord. Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's sulfur dioxide scrubber contains gypsum, which is sold to a wallboard manufacturer. Almost all of the manufacturer's gypsum needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of open-pit mining needed. Furthermore, fly ash and clinker from the power plant is utilized for road building and cement production.|$|E

In this paper, eco-industrial systems are extracted as <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> by using social network analysis first. We then construct a novel cascading failure model and propose an evaluation method of node importance according to the features of <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> of eco-industrial parks. Based on the cascading model, an effective new method, that is, the critical threshold, is put forward to quantitatively assess the resilience of <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> of eco-industrial parks. Some theoretical analysis is furthermore provided to the critical threshold. Finally, we take Jinjie eco-industrial system in Shanxi Province of China as a case to investigate its resilience. The key potential nodes are identified by using our model. We also find the respective relation among the resilience of <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> and the parameters in our cascading model. Theoretical analysis results and numerical simulations both show the optimal value of the tunable load parameter with which the strongest resilience level against cascading failures can be attained in <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> of eco-industrial parks...|$|R

This paper provides an approach to quantify the environmental performance of industrial symbiosis networks using guidance from the literature of life cycle assessment. Additionally, an approach to distribute credits due to exchanges for firms in the industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> is outlined. From the approach, influential methodological considerations used for the quantifications are discussed, including e. g. the production of reference systems, allocation methods, system boundaries and functional unit.

This thesis tries to suggest and assess an adapted approach to establish successful industrial symbiosis, with a case study on the northern Stockholm region. An extensive literature review, meetings with experts and stakeholder interaction by questionnaires, interviews and a workshop were used. Potential obstructions were identified, possibilities of self-organizations and planning explored and solutions suggested. Combined with the feedback from 25 questionnaires and a workshop with local stakeholders an approach to establishing industrial symbiosis in northern Stockholm was suggested and assessed.

40|$|Industrial {{symbiosis}} (IS) is a subdiscipline of Industrial Ecology {{that aims}} to bring together companies from different sectors to share resources, namely energy, materials, and water. The main goal of IS is to improve resource (materials, waste, energy) efficiency and lead to mutual environmental, financial and social benefits to participants. In this paper we present a semantic approach for IS input/output matching. This approach is based on knowledge modelling and ontologies. Ontologies are used to model all resources - waste, water, energy - along with details about their composition, characteristics (chemical and physical) and tacit knowledge about their flow.

40|$|International audienceForming and {{sustaining}} an industrial symbiosis depends on several actors. Actors {{that have an}} interest in the symbiosis and the possibility to influence it are called " stakeholders ". According to social exchange theory and resource dependency theory, the power of actors in a network depends on the dependency of other actors on the resources they control. We adapt the stakeholder value network approach from the strategic management literature to the industrial symbiosis context as a means to provide insights into the power of stakeholders of an industrial symbiosis. The approach is applied to a waste incinerator steam <b>network</b> <b>symbiosis</b> case study in France, which has been successfully operated and extended over decades. The results from the case study show that using the stakeholder value network approach enables the assessment of the relative power of symbiosis stakeholders and to identify key resources on which their power is based.

40|$|Aim of {{industrial}} symbiosis {{is to create}} synergies between industries in order to exchange resources (by-products, water and energy) through geographic proximity and collaboration [1]. By optimizing resource flows in a “whole-system approach”, a minimization of dangerous emissions and of supply needs can be achieved. Resources exchanges are established to facilitate recycling and re-use {{of industrial}} waste using a commercial vehicle. Several paths can be identified {{in order to establish}} an industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> (Figure 1, left), in relation (i) to the life cycle phase (raw material, component, product) and (ii) to the nature (material, water, energy) of the resource flows to be exchanged. Sometimes by-products and/or waste of an industrial process have to be treated and valorized in order to become the raw materials for others. In particular, two main treatment processes can be identified: refurbishment/upgrade for re-use (Figure 1, center) and recycling for material recovery (Figure 1, right). A brief overview of technological and economic aspects is given, together with their relevance to industrial symbiosis...|$|E
40|$|Interest in how {{industrial}} production could {{be adapted to}} promote sustainable development has increased in recent decades worldwide. Industrial symbiosis (where one company’s unwanted materials become the input for another company) is one approach to reducing {{the environmental impact of}} production, which itself has attracted widespread policy interest. The UK’s National Industrial Symbiosis Programme has become known internationally {{as an example of a}} successful industrial symbiosis initiative, attracting both academic interest and policy imitation. However, the suitability of industrial symbiosis development initiatives to be transferred between geographic contexts is a largely neglected issue in industrial symbiosis literature. Practice replication can be viewed as a knowledge transfer process. In order to address that issue, this study adopts a theoretical framework drawn from the knowledge transfer literature, which suggests that language skills, technical assistance and expertise are among the factors influencing the success of international attempts at practice replication. The knowledge transfer literature, however, has focussed on commercial activity, i. e., firms’ primary activities, not environmental initiatives such as industrial symbiosis. Theoretical framework on knowledge transfer is therefore adopted to study the topic. The research aims to provide a deeper understanding of factors affecting the process of replicating one country’s industrial symbiosis development practice to another. A European Commission funded project replicating the UK’s industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> facilitation approach to the Tianjin Binhai New Area of China has been selected to conduct an in-depth case study. This case study can be viewed as a transnational knowledge transfer practice. In addition, this research used a knowledge transfer perspective to inform an in-depth analysis of the organisation of National Industrial Symbiosis Programme. Also, it conducted the analysis of policy context affecting industrial symbiosis activities in the UK and China to provide a background of industrial symbiosis development in the two countries. Qualitative research methods such as semi-structured interviews and participant observation have been used to collect data. This research contributes to knowledge transfer theory through proposing a knowledge-based model illustrating the process of knowledge development within an organisation and the process of transnational knowledge transfer from the knowledge source to another. Also, factors affecting the process of transnational knowledge transfer have been summarised. In addition, the research provides a deeper understanding of a industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> facilitation approach which has been widely cited as an industrial symbiosis development exemplar. Theoretical contributions could guide future transnational collaborations on replicating good practices for industrial sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recently, various overlay {{networks}} {{have been widely}} deployed over physical IP networks. Since selfish behavior of overlay networks to satisfy demands of their applications and users often conflicts with each other, performance of the overall network system and quality of service offered to users easily deteriorate. To tackle the problem, our research group proposes the framework called overlay <b>network</b> <b>symbiosis</b> based on the biolog-ical symbiosis model where different bacteria coexist in the shared medium. In the overlay <b>network</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> overlay <b>networks</b> directly and/or indirectly {{interact with each other}} through the shared environment and accom-plish cooperative or collaborative control. In this paper, as an example of biologically-inspired symbiotic overlay networks, we propose a mechanism that enables different P 2 P file-sharing networks to cooperate and live together with mediation of a portal server. In our proposed mechanism, the portal server provides users with transparent utilization of multiple P 2 P file-sharing networks by handling search requests and shared files in place of users. Through numerical analysis, we showed that the proposed mechanism improved the hit ratio of search requests in comparison to the scenario where P 2 P file-sharing networks were independent...|$|R

40|$|Government and {{industry}} increasingly face challenges resulting from resource scarcity and climate change. By reducing carbon emissions whilst promoting resource efficiency and business development, industrial symbiosis has been recognised {{as a strategy}} to manage these challenges. Industrial symbiosis {{can be interpreted as}} the innovative use of waste from one company as a resource for another company, i. e. waste-to-resource innovation. These resource innovations involve the development of relations between waste producers and users, and often governmental organisations and other actors. A review of industrial <b>symbiosis</b> and relevant <b>network</b> and innovation literature concluded that empirical understanding of the implementation of industrial symbiosis, and consequently how it can be promoted by public and private organisations, needed considerable improvement. Hence, a qualitative empirical exploration was conducted to answer the question: How and why did industrial symbiosis develop over time? The exploration was carried out in the Humber region (UK) and, with several bio-based developments emerging in the area, focused on biowaste-to-resource innovation. Case studies with companies revealed: the social process through which resource partnerships developed; important contextual conditions (resource security, economic benefits, and governance); and varying network diversification and strengthening strategies. Analysing these innovations in their longer-term dynamic contexts revealed different business-responses to context-changes through their varying innovation and government-engagement strategies. Some companies were constrained by poor harmonisation of economic and various governmental drivers. In particular, since 2012, regional governance capacity for biowaste-to-resource innovation decreased while such innovations gained momentum at national government level. These findings have added to understanding of variation in factors and processes associated with implementing industrial symbiosis through company activities, strategies, and collaborations; and the relations between context dynamics, evolution of industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks,</b> and on-going business development. The level of detail revealed in this inductive empirical research contributed to identifying numerous further research directions. Moreover, practical recommendations were provided to companies and governmental organisations supporting the promotion of industrial symbiosis and contributing to the on-going transition to a more resource efficient and circular economy...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{field of}} industrial ecology studies energy and material flows {{within and between}} different systems in our society while the concept of industrial ecology strives toward mimicking similar flows in natural eco-systems. Industrial ecology can be a means of achieving decoupling between economic growth and environmental impact within the industry sector. A sub-field of industrial ecology is industrial symbiosis which focuses on material, energy and water exchanges between traditionally separate actors {{in order to achieve}} economic and environmental benefits. Energy provider E. ON {{is a part of the}} industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> on Händelö outside of Norrköping. E. ON also has operations in the Northern Harbour industrial area in Malmö, and sees an opportunity for the development of industrial symbiosis in that area which has unexploited land. The aim of this thesis is to explore how a private actor can influence the industrial development of an area to facilitate the formation of industrial symbiosis connections. This is done by studying the emergence and development of industrial symbiosis in Händelö and how different actors have influenced that development, as well as the conditions for such development in the Northern Harbour. Industrial symbiosis in Händelö has evolved spontaneously because of profitability in each connection. This study shows that the establishment of Agroetanol’s ethanol pilot plant next to Händelöverket was an enabling event in the development of the industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network.</b> The diversity of fuels used in Händelöverket, and the number of energy products that it provides suggest that it served as a so called anchor tenant in this development, attracting Agroetanol with its availability of steam produced from renewable fuels. This was one important aspect for the establishment of Agroetanol. Political instruments such as a tax exemption on Agroetanol’s plant and CO 2 and energy taxes on fossil fuels have also contributed to this development. Conditions for industrial symbiosis in the Northern Harbour in Malmö are quite different from those in Norrköping. An important difference is that industrial symbiosis has been recognized as a tool for sustainability and might be considered when planning the unexploited land. There are however many interest in this land, especially by the port company CMP and the City of Malmö’s Real Estate Office who have invested large sums in expanding the port business. They prefer goods intensive businesses that utilize the infrastructure provided by the port and railway in the area. Malmö has also set some ambitious environmental targets to be fulfilled 2030. They create a need to transition from the partly natural gas powered energy system today to one based on renewable fuels. There are also opportunities in a gasification plant which is planned by E. ON, and an EU-funded project seeking to make use of the biofuels potentials of port sites by using industrial symbiosis. The conclusions of the study are that there are ways for a private actor to influence industrial symbiosis development. Some that have been identified in this work are: As an anchor tenant with multiple large input and output streams, by attracting businesses to the area. As an enabler of a biorefinery network with multiple end-products and by-products. As a part of a coordinating entity that aims to facilitate industrial symbiosis...|$|E
40|$|The project aims at {{analyzing}} {{the feasibility of}} utilizing cement kiln dust (CKD) in treating wastewater from tea industry {{with the concept of}} industrial symbiosis. CKD is the dust collected at the air pollution control device(s) associated with a kiln system from cement industry. A very less percent of CKD is recycled and the rest is land filled /stockpiled; disrupts groundwater through leaching of minerals. Cement Kiln Dust (CKD), rich in CaO, SiO 2, behaves as a neutralizing as well as stabilizing agent for tea effluent treatment. The ability of CKD to reduce the BOD, COD, TSS, and phosphates in tea effluent was analyzed and the optimum dosage is determined. The effect of different dosages of Cement Kiln Dust ranging from (1 - 3) gm/l has been discussed on the bench scale tests. The results show that, for different CKD concentrations, high removal efficiencies of 94. 4 and 99. 0, 58. 9 for BOD, TSS, phosphates and a lower efficiency for COD with 9. 09 are achieved for 2. 5 gm/l. The persistent presence of color providing proteins theaflavins (TF) and the arubigins (TR) from the leftover tea leaves in the effluent imparts the low removal efficiencies of COD. However, the COD value is within the dischargeable limits (CPCB standards). Moreover, a considerable removal efficiency and high SVI of 0. 181 makes CKD a feasible coagulant in treating tea effluent with optimum dosage of 2. 5 g/l. The objective of developing industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network</b> was thus achieved using the CKD to treat wastewater from tea industries.     International Journal of Environment Volume- 4, Issue- 3, June-August 2015 Page: 20 - 34 </p...|$|E
40|$|The area of Eastern Nebraska {{north of}} Omaha, {{including}} the municipality of Blair is host to {{a collection of}} unique companies and industries. These industries, driven by the agricultural and urban economy of the area, {{as well as the}} geographic proximity to each other, make it an advantageous area to study the potential for a network where individual entities utilize the concept of industrial symbiosis. This potential network {{is referred to as the}} Eastern Nebraska Industrial <b>Symbiosis</b> <b>Network</b> (ENISN). Industrial symbiosis, a sub-set of industrial ecology, engages separate industries in a collaborative and collective approach, concerning itself with the flow of materials and energy, water, and/or by-products between each other. The outcome of industrial symbiosis is advantageous to not only the companies, but to the environment as well. The incorporation of ecological economic principles are at the core of industrial symbiosis. A 2 ̆ 2 circular-economy 2 ̆ 2 invites a more sustainable approach where efficient allocation of resources and a philosophy of an end to growth, drive this unique economy that differs from the traditional neoclassical style. This study compares the potential of an ENISN with the existing Kalundborg Symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark, a long established example of industrial ecology and the use of an eco-industrial network where the by-product of one enterprise is used as a resource by another enterprise, in a closed cycle. Industrial symbiosis is a collaboration where public and private enterprises buy and sell residual products, resulting in mutual economic and environmental benefits. The results of this study indicate the ENISN study site has the potential for an industrial symbiosis site. The analysis of material flows and inductive themes derived from interviews with potential partners revealed the presence of collaboration and environmental stewardship. The results of the study suggest that the human capital exists to make an ENISN; however, the impetus to take on the challenging ontological barriers remains to be seen. Advisor: Mark E.

40|$|Industrial synergies – be they, {{the single}} {{by-product}} exchanges between two companies or the comprehensive industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> involving numerous industrial synergies – {{have been recognized}} for their potential to improve industrial resource efficiency and provide simultaneous economic benefits. With increasing research on maximizing the implementation of industrial symbiosis initiatives per se, the notion of quality of these implemented exchanges has been disregarded. Nevertheless the quality and consideration of whole production life cycle impacts of industrial symbiosis initiatives are important to ensure harmonic and sustainable development. To develop and promote a strategy for advancement of new and qualitative industrial synergies the analysis and evaluation of existing examples of collaboration is necessary. To provide a means for evaluation and comparison {{of the quality of}} industrial synergies, a qualitative evaluation method is developed. An illustration of the evaluation method is presented through two case studies of industrial synergies identified in the brewery industry and the wood processing industry in Latvia. The results of these case studies provide valuable information for decision makers in Latvia and industrial symbiosis practitioners worldwide. Case study results show that only few of the considered self-organized industrial synergies are beneficial regarding all three – environmental quality, economic quality and geographic proximity – evaluation categories. This leads to the conclusion that these three aspects create a three-layer filter for development of qualitative industrial synergies and the quality of each category should be considered before the planning stage of such collaborations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper explores {{various forms}} of eco-industrial {{networks}} in advancing environmental sustainability. Prior research on environmental sustainability primarily identifies industrial actors as autonomous entities or considers the role of networks in advancing environmental sustainability from a rather narrow perspective. However, the networks of ties in which industrial firms are embedded profoundly impacts not only their own performance, but also the natural {{environment in which they}} operate. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify four forms of eco-industrial networks that have the potential to advance environmental sustainability: 1) <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks,</b> 2) sustainable supply networks, 3) environmental issue networks and 4) environmental solution networks. The paper presents important insights on the operational logic for each of these network forms and the dimensions of their network architecture. The main implications of this comparison are that policy-makers and practitioners need to become aware of the various mechanisms through which inter-organisational networks can reduce environmental load. Furthermore, {{there is a need to}} build broad coalitions of organisations that are mobilised to address environmental issues. We suggest that network architecture which maximises its members' capability to self-organise while also including a coordinating organisation can be highly suitable for eco-industrial networks. We also suggest some fruitful avenues for future research on eco-industrial networks. In integrating research on eco-industrial networks with existing research on inter-organisational alliances and networks, the paper provides more understanding on the multifaceted role played by {{various forms of}} eco-industrial networks in advancing sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Social advance {{based on}} {{unlimited}} resource consumption has derived in serious environmental problems. As a response, {{several initiatives to}} disassociate resources consumption and human progress have arisen {{over the past few}} years, being sustainability one of their crucial pillars. In this context, industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis offer more sustainable alternatives to the exploitation of natural resources by considering the co-operation of different companies. While modelling approaches to optimize energy and water sharing networks have been widely studied in the literature, little {{attention has been paid to}} resource sharing between different industries, as outlined by Boix et al. in (Boix et al. 2015). Hence, there is a need of systematic procedures allowing the identification and assessment of potential sharing alternatives. Thus, this permits focusing on the targets to be further investigated and eventually optimized. This work aims to develop increasing complexity models to identify symbiosis opportunities regarding material sharing in the chemical and process industry. The modelling approach explores the concept that waste from a process may be used as or transformed into added value raw materials for another, emphasizing the reuse and recycling of materials and thus diminishing the consumption of fresh resources. Given a set of inlet waste streams to be managed or disposed, a set of demanded raw material to feed different processes and a set of potential material transformations (chemical reactions) with related costs, the objective is to determine the targets or symbiosis opportunities within a network of chemical process industries. Decision variables address the amount of raw material demand covered by reused/recycled streams, the amount of waste entering the system to be treated and the amount to be disposed, among others. Models include mass and energy balances and an economic objective function and lead to different Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. The models have been implemented in GAMS and tested on a case study recreating an industrial network based on ethylene, chorine and related chemicals. Results show the potential of this targeting approach allowing identifying and assessing promising industrial symbiosis opportunities, helping in the decision-making process. The work discusses the limitations and further developments required to address the systematic decision-making support to the efficient management of industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks</b> in the chemical process industries...|$|R

The {{main objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand how the activities developed by FIEMG â the Federation of Industries of the State of Minas Gerais, have built and mobilized the capacities for the development of Industrial Symbiosis. Industrial symbiosis - IS occurs through physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products among (geographically close) industries in a collective approach to increase competitive advantage, thus improving the environmental performance of companies as well as reducing their total costs (Chertow, 2000; Chertow, 2007). Among several cases of IS in the world, we highlight the case of Kalundborg Industrial Park in Denmark and the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme - NISP in England. In Brazil, FIEMG coordinates the Mining Industrial Symbiosis Programme - PMSI, which is based on the British symbiosis program. Representatives of seven companies from different sectors and regions of the state were interviewed, as well as four actors: the Federation of Industries of the State of Minas Gerais, the environmental agency, an employerâs association and a cooperative of waste pickers. Data analysis aims at identifying the elements present in Spekkink framework (2014) Contexts, Institutional Capacities, Actors, Interactions and Network of Symbiotic Exchanges in mining reality. The results show how FIEMG uses its institutional capacity to promote the PMSI; how the actors are involved in symbiosis through their beliefs, desires and opportunities; the way the interactions occur between these actors and the results as a <b>symbiosis</b> <b>network.</b> This study evidences the importance of the IS promoter and its connection with the actors, especially the employerâs associations; the little influence of governance, economic and physical contexts in promoting PMSI; the low participation of some actors, as the environmental agency, in the symbiosis process and the barriers that come from the exchanges between companies...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that there are {{differences}} in approaches to industrial symbiosis in the Nordic countries. In Finland and Denmark, there is generally a strong top-down approach to industrial symbiosis, accompaniedby a clear vision and comprehensive strategies for a CE/industrial symbiosis at the national and regional levels. Industrial symbiosis exchanges have been actively facilitated by municipal and regional actors and networks in combination with key private companies. In Iceland, Sweden and Norway, industrial symbiosis initiatives are often characterized by a bottom-up approach, where private companies and business parks are driving the development, while industrial symbiosis is largely missing from the national-level policy agenda. In the Icelandic and Swedish regional case studies, there are no local policy instruments that directly support industrial symbiosis or a CE, and industrial symbiosis activities are not explicitly a part of regional and municipal development strategies. In order to utilize the full dynamic and regional potential of industrial symbiosis in these regions, {{there is a need to}} develop coherent policies and support schemes for industrial symbiosis activities to fill this gap. According to the study, a key motivation for companies to engage in industrial symbiosis activities has been the desire to increase profitability and competitiveness. Business opportunities are the major driving force behind the development of industrial symbiosis. Among the main hindrances to industrial symbiosis development identified in the regional case studies has been companies’ lack of time and resources to implement new business models such as industrial symbiosis, as well as a lack of industrial symbiosis expertise in the region and low awareness about the opportunities provided by industrial symbiosis. In this regard, the presence of a cluster, network or other co-ordinating body that can facilitate collaboration helps to organize exchanges across companies. Disseminating information about industrial symbiosis solutions has played an important role in the Danish, Finnish and Norwegian cases. Overall, the regional cases showed similarities and differences with regard to the organization of industrial <b>symbiosis</b> <b>networks,</b> the type of support instruments in place to stimulate industrial symbiosis activities, adoption of the term industrial symbiosis and the potential for economic growth. Regarding the potential for new businesses and jobs to arise from industrial symbiosis activities in Nordic regions, exact numbers or quantitative estimates are difficult to obtain. It can be stated, however, that there is significant future potential to expand industrial symbiosis activities and develop new industrial symbiosis-related businesses in Nordic regions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} factors {{influencing}} {{the development and}} sustained operation of regional industrial <b>symbiosis</b> (IS) <b>networks</b> and discusses the roles a coordination body can play to alter these factors so as to catalyse the development and functioning of such networks. These are analysed {{within the context of}} experiences gained {{in the early stages of}} three regional IS programmes under development in the UK, and of the recently launched national IS programme (NISP) that they are part of. It is stated that the policy framework in the UK has elements supportive of such networks to evolve, and the regional public bodies are favouring their development. Based on differences among studied cases, it is argued that the nature of companies' operations and industrial history in the regions, the extent of peer pressure, the positioning of the coordinating body in the region, and its approach to awareness raising and recruitment have major influence on the progress of the programmes. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of aligning the characteristics of emerging operations with the longer-term sustainability requirements. If accepted, this challenge assigns additional responsibilities to the coordinating parties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbiome}} of {{the human}} body represents a <b>symbiosis</b> of microbial <b>networks</b> spanning multiple organ systems.

Industrial Symbiosis: Early {{experiences}} from a national programme in the UK. ” in a forthcoming issue of Journal of Cleaner Production. Please do not quote without {{the permission of the}} Authors. This article reviews the efforts of developing industrial <b>symbiosis</b> (IS) <b>networks</b> in Humber and Mersey Estuaries and in West Midlands in the UK, where the authors have, to varying degrees, been part of the efforts for identifying and establishing inter-organizational synergistic linkages with environmental and economic gains since Summer 2000. Following a generic review of technical, political, economic, informational, and organisational factors that can have major influences on the development and functioning of IS networks and the role of coordination bodies aiming to catalyse the system developments, major political and institutional elements relevant to IS developments and applicable to all three regions are outlined. Experiences from individual IS programmes are then shared and analysed in light of technical, informational and organisational factors and the attributes of coordination bodies. Such analyses indicate the dominating importance of the organizational factors such as the history of industrial development, intensity of social interactions among relevant parties, and their mental proximity. Experiences also reveal that the perception of regional parties about the coordinating bodies is influential on the effectiveness of development efforts. A set of recommendations drawn from the analysis is intended to inform further similar efforts under National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). The paper concludes by highlighting the need of aligning the functioning of emerging networks with the requirements of longer term sustainability, which imposes higher challenges on coordination bodies. 1...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of advances in sensor network research {{over the last five}} years have focused on the development of a series of small-scale (100 s of nodes) testbeds and specialized applications (e. g., environmental monitoring, etc.) that are built on low-powered sensor devices that self-organize to form application-specific multihop wireless networks. We believe that sensor networks have reached an important crossroads in their development. The question we address in this paper is how to propel sensor networks from their smallscale application-specific network origins, into the commercial mainstream of people’s every day lives; the challenge being: how do we develop large-scale general-purpose sensor networks for the general public (e. g., consumers) capable of supporting a wide variety of applications in urban settings (e. g., enterprises, hospitals, recreational areas, towns, cities, and the metropolis). We propose MetroSense, a new people-centric paradigm for urban sensing at the edge of the Internet, at very large scale. We discuss a number of challenges, interactions and characteristics in urban sensing applications, and then present the MetroSense architecture which is based fundamentally on three design principles: <b>network</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> asymmetric design, and localized interaction. The ability of MetroSense to scale to very large areas is based on the use of an opportunistic sensor networking approach. Opportunistic sensor networking leverages mobility-enabled interactions and provides coordination between people-centric mobile sensors, static sensors and edge wireless access nodes in support of opportunistic sensing, opportunistic tasking, and opportunistic data collection. We discuss architectural challenges including providing sensing coverage with sparse mobile sensors, how to hand off roles and responsibilities between sensors, improving network performance and connectivity using adaptive multihop, and importantly, providing security and privacy for people-centric sensors and data...|$|R
40|$|Sinorhizobium meliloti is a {{free-living}} soil bacterium {{which is}} capable of establishing a symbiotic relationship with the alfalfa plant (Medicago sativa). This <b>symbiosis</b> involves a <b>network</b> of bacterium-host signaling, {{as well as the}} potential for bacterium-bacterium communication, such as quorum sensing. In this study, we characterized the production of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) by two commonly used S. meliloti strains, AK 631 and Rm 1021. We found that AK 631 produces at least nine different AHLs, while Rm 1021 produces only a subset of these molecules. To address the difference in AHL patterns between the strains, we developed a novel screening method to identify the genes affecting AHL synthesis. With this screening method, chromosomal groEL (groELc) was shown to be required for synthesis of the AHLs that are unique to AK 631 but not for synthesis of the AHLs that are made by both AK 631 and Rm 1021. We then used the screening procedure to identify a mutation in a gene homologous to traM of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which was able to suppress the phenotype of the groELc mutation. A traR homolog was identified immediately upstream of traM, and we propose that its gene product requires a functional groELc for activity and is also responsible for inducing the synthesis of the AHLs that are unique to AK 631. We show that the traR/traM locus is part of a quorum-sensing system unique to AK 631 and propose that this locus is involved in regulating conjugal plasmid transfer. We also present evidence for the existence of a second quorum-sensing system, sinR/sinI, which is present in both AK 631 and Rm 1021...|$|R
40|$|The UK National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP) is {{the first}} {{industrial}} <b>symbiosis</b> (IS) <b>network</b> {{in the world to}} have been established at national level. Many studies have recently investigated the UK NISP, but much work remains to be done in understanding the context that enabled the development and management of a large scale IS network. This research aims to explore and understand: (1) the place of the UK NISP within the UK government’s ‘green’ market strategy; and, (2) the management and organisational design employed by the UK NISP in developing and managing a nation-wide IS network. Based on a qualitative inquiry, a case study approach was adopted to conduct this research. In-depth semi-structured interviews were used to gather information from twenty-eight policy officers, government advisors, as well as representatives of the UK NISP and its partner organisations. The research findings showed that the government’s decision-making mechanism, in each of the UK countries, was significantly different. Whilst {{it was found that the}} UK government is focused on embedding ecological modernisation components in the policy process, there is also a need for extended and consistent decentralisation across the UK and a structural framework that enables non-state stakeholders to effectively influence the policy process. The outcomes of this research indicate a relationship between EM theory and the IS concept. By adopting the ecological modernisation agenda, the UK government can play a significant role in promoting the use of the IS concept by: (1) devising policies that are directly aimed at supporting the development of IS networks; and, (2) aligning the funding for technological innovation with the needs of potential IS projects. Nevertheless, the study found that the future of the UK NISP is entirely dependent on UK government funding and, therefore, it is recommended that the UK NISP should identify ways to raise income from the private sector as well for the UK NISP’s long term survival. The findings also highlighted the effectiveness of the organisational design employed by the UK NISP (including leadership at national level, regional delivery strategy and regional partnership strategy) for a large scale IS network and the suitability of the UK NISP’s organisational design to the dynamic nature of the IS network development. The regional partnership strategy was found to promote sectoral focus in IS networks, which did not adhere to the ‘innovation’ and ‘diversity’ principles of IS. This would result in limited innovation and raise the potential for an IS network to become unstable, for example, if a member decides to leave the network, the lack of diversity in the IS network would make it difficult to replace that member. So it is important that the UK NISP staff and contractors are provided with extensive training to ensure a better understanding of the IS concept principles. In a society facing economic and environmental challenges, this study specifically contributes to the understanding of the context that enabled the development of a large scale IS network that would help integrate environmental protection and economic growth.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} networking, social capital and elites {{have done much}} to expand {{academic}} knowledge {{in each of these}} topic areas. Elites are defined in several ways, including their attributes and their use of and access to power. However, far less research has been conducted on how those attributes and/or power are used by local political elites. A great deal of research has also been conducted on social capital, what it is and how it can benefit society, but less work has been done on the local politician’s individual production and use of social capital. Despite the important role that networks and networking play in producing social capital, local elite networks thus remain largely unexplored. We know little of how their networks are constructed and used in the pursuance of status and less on how the elite adapt the use of their networks in response to socio-economic change. In focusing on the construction and use of social capital networks by the Borough Aldermen and Councillors in Northampton over the longue durée, this work redresses those shortcomings. The research uses a large number and variety of sources which provide a wealth of qualitative and quantitative data with which to explore elite networking and social capital in the town. The work contributes towards furthering academic knowledge on how elites gain maintain and propagate status. The research reveals that the elite use two different constructs of networks, each of which provides different benefits for the user. It is the <b>symbiosis</b> of these <b>networks</b> which enables the political elite to respond to socio-economic and political events. The research also finds that overlapping networks produce the largest exchange of social capital, which is translated into gaining and maintaining status. It is clear that, over the longue durée, the importance of business networks in producing social capital has drastically reduced, and has been replaced by the growing importance of political association membership. It is also evident in the research that the expansion of formal institutions in the business and political arenas has led to individual Councillors and Aldermen making strategic choices. Using a market mentality of returns, they decide which networks give greater social capital and are thus more valuable and useful in gaining and maintaining elite status. ...|$|R
