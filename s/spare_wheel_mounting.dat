50|$|The Discovery Sport will {{initially}} be sold with alloy wheels {{ranging from}} 18 in to 20 in in diameter. Various emergency <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> options are available depending on vehicle configuration: a full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> internally under {{the floor of}} the trunk, or if the 5+2 seating option is fitted it will be a 'space-saver' <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the underside of the}} car, directly under the boot. It is not possible to have a factory-fitted tow bar with a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> on 5+2 seat vehicles as they mount in the same place under the vehicle, so a tyre repair system of sealant and a compressor is supplied instead.|$|R

50|$|Depending on the market, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} is available with an under-floor mounted or rear door <b>mounted</b> <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> For example, UK vehicles have the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> under the floor, while in Australia and Argentina the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> is <b>mounted</b> {{on the rear}} door, leaving space for an auxiliary fuel tank, which is desirable in countries where long journeys in isolated areas may be required. The fuel capacity of the dual tank series four is 150 L compared to 179 L of the series three.|$|R
50|$|Many Sport utility {{vehicles}} (SUVs) and off-road vehicles have the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> externally - usually {{on the rear}} door, but others may mount them on the roof, the side, or even on the bonnet (hood).|$|R

50|$|The cyclecar body {{featured}} a dummy bullnose radiator and side-by-side twin seats. The sports model {{had a full}} length exhaust running {{the length of the}} outside of the car on the driver's side, as well as twin <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> on top of the tail. The Tourer model cost £168 and the Sports model £188.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover or <b>spare</b> tire {{cover is}} an {{accessory}} {{that covers the}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> on external part of a car or van. On 4x4 vehicles the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> is normally rear mounted and is often printed with a dealer's name or something more fun. Covers can be hard shells or soft vinyl covers. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover protects <b>spare</b> tires from the dirt and the sun's harmful UV rays in areas with many days of sunshine. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> covers need to be removed {{once in a while}} and cleaned.|$|R

50|$|For the 1928 Mille Miglia {{endurance}} race, two new chassis were {{fitted with}} roadster bodies featuring cycle wings, running boards, doors, headlights, a small windshield, a folding canvas top and two <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> on the tail. Under the hood the engines {{were the same}} as found in the Tipo 26 Grand Prix. Those cars were known as Tipo 26 MM.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 {{along with}} the rest of the Claymore range, the Nimbus was uprated {{featuring}} heavier BMC axles and an Albion constant mesh gearbox with either five or six speeds. Vacuum assistance to the brakes was now provided by a Hydrovac system, belt-driven from the engine. Two Nimbus-specific changes were the option of a drop-frame extension at the rear for a luggage boot and the option of a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> on a slide-out carrier, below this extension.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a version called Golf Country (7.735 cars), co-manufactured by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Austria, {{designed}} for medium off-road driving. It had more suspension travel, Syncro four-wheel drive, improved ground clearance of 21 cm, bullbars at front and rear (generally over a single headlight grille), a skid plate for protecting the engine area, sub-frame to protect the rear Syncro differential and propshaft and a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> externally on a swing-away triangular frame on the back.|$|R
50|$|For the 1928 Mille Miglia {{endurance}} race, a new chassis {{received the}} same treatment as the Tipo 26 MM being fitted with a roadster body. The coachwork featured cycle wings, running boards, doors, headlights, a small windshield, a folding canvas top and two <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> on the tail. Under the hood the engine {{was the same as}} found in the Tipo 26B. Three other chassis were built between 1929 and 1930. Those cars were known as Tipo 26B MM.|$|R
50|$|The body is {{distinguished}} by its <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> on the specially designed bonnet, its additional bumpers, front and rear, its flared wheel arches (for 1982), big optional tyres (for 1982) and tail lights {{similar to the}} Citroën Acadiane van.The 4x4 version has a gearbox with four normal speeds and a three-speed transfer gearbox for crossing slopes up to 60%. At the time, the Méhari 4x4 {{was one of the}} few 4x4s with four-wheel independent suspension. The car had all wheel disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|The SE5 was {{conceived}} {{and ready for}} the 1968 Motor Show in under 12 months. For the SE5 John Crosthwaite and his team designed a completely different longer chassis frame, revised and improved suspension, new and relocated fuel tank, a rollover bar, new cooling system, <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> in the nose to give increased rear space and a 17+1/4 imp gal fuel tank. When designing the chassis Crosthwaite worked closely with Ogle body stylist Peter Bailey to modify and refine the prototype.|$|R
50|$|In September 1939 France {{declared}} war on Germany and in June 1940 the German Army rapidly invaded and occupied Northern France. Before September 1939, unlike Renault, Panhard et Levassor had not supplied cars to the French army, but with the outbreak of war Panhard et Levassor received an order for 182 of the larger-engined Dynamics, {{with the emphasis on}} the long cabined “six-light” sedans/salons. The army cars, generally reserved for senior ranks, are in most instances recognisable from the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the outside of the}} rear panel. Civilian versions, even with the long cabin body, kept the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> inside the car.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a legend}} that Henry Ford II {{complained that the}} trunk of his {{personal}} Ford Thunderbird did not have room for a set of golf clubs without removing the spare tire. The 1956 Thunderbird had its spare tire mounted outside. However, adding weight behind the rear wheels was said to adversely affect steering and handling. For 1957 the Thunderbird's trunk was stretched 5 in to allow the spare tire to migrate back inside, although the Continental mounting was still optional. This external <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mount</b> became a customizing aftermarket appearance accessory during the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The Liege has a {{glass fibre}} body with an {{integral}} floor bonded in. The chassis {{is a simple}} but strong ‘A’ frame, with independent double wishbone front suspension. The live rear axle is from the Suzuki Carry which has a 5.1-1 ratio to suit the 16 in Liege cast aluminium wheels. Coilspring shock absorbers are used all round. The 850 cc four-cylinder aluminium engine is from a Reliant Robin. The braking, being period, has 7 in drums front and rear. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> on the back allowed a small space in the rear for soft luggage and all-weather equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The Maicoletta was {{introduced}} in 1955. It used components based on those used in Maico's conventional motorcycles, including the engine, transmission, and front forks. It was built {{to compete in the}} German scooter market of the 1950s. [...] Maico had earlier introduced an enclosed motorcycle with superior weather protection for the rider, the Maico Mobil, that was marketed as a [...] "two-wheeled car" [...] with interchangeable <b>wheels</b> and a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> into the barrel shaped bodywork behind the number plate and rear lamp. The Maicoletta used the fourteen-inch wheels, gear ratio indicator, and headlights from the Mobil.|$|R
50|$|All 1932 Fords—V8-8s and Model Bs—came {{with black}} fenders, wire wheels, and a {{rear-mounted}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> (side <b>mount</b> on cars {{equipped with a}} tail gate). Options included single or twin sidemounts, luggage rack, clock, in- and outside mirrors, and choice of leather or Broadcloth (closed cars) interior material.|$|R
50|$|A special {{version of}} the Yeti is offered in China. The car has 60 mm longer {{wheelbase}} and <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> can be <b>mounted</b> on a fifth door.|$|R
5000|$|During its life, the Rancho {{was offered}} in several versions. Apart from the basic Rancho, {{there was the}} Grand Raid, fitted with such {{off-road}} extras as an electric winch on the front bumper and an extra <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> on the roof - {{as well as a}} limited-slip differential. It also received undercarriage protection, bronze tinted windows, and was only available in a matte green colour. The Rancho X was the upscale model, with additional standard items such as alloy wheels and metallic paint. The Découvrable model's rear cabin consisted of an open frame with roll-down fabric covers, which could serve as an [...] "open" [...] car during good weather. Finally, the Rancho AS was the commercial version, with no rear seat, making it exempt from the French tax on passenger cars.|$|R
50|$|Announced in October 1958, {{this model}} was wider and longer than its forebears and {{differed}} structurally {{in that the}} rear swinging arms were lower and external to the body, and the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of}} the car. The type reference is supposed to be SE492/4 but one has the reference B.100. The chassis numbers are D1/1 to D1/19 but then again one example has D1/100, this particular car could be the prototype since it appears in publicity pictures.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1956 model, more trunk {{space was}} added, the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>mounted</b> outside (which helped free up trunk space), the {{exhausts}} {{were moved to}} the ends of the bumper, and air vents were added behind the front wheels to improve cabin ventilation. To improve rear-quarter visibility with the removable hardtop in place, [...] "porthole" [...] windows were available as a no-cost option. An optional 312 cu in (5.1 L) Y-block V8 was added as an option. 1956 production was 15,631 units, the lowest of all three 2-seater Thunderbird model years.|$|R
5000|$|BRDM-2M-96 - The {{biggest problem}} with the BRDM-2 pointed out by the Polish crews {{was the fact that}} the crew {{compartment}} was cramped. To address this issue, the WKMech design team decided to remove the belly wheels and redesign the floor of the vehicle. This gives it much more space for the crew or space for two more soldiers, who can be sent out of the vehicle to recon the surrounding area, thus limiting the possibility of the armoured car falling into a trap set up by the enemy. To ensure the ability to quickly enter and exit the vehicle, doors were added on both sides of the hull. It's fitted with the PNK-72 night vision device for the driver. which during night time operations is used instead of the normal TNP-A day sight. It replaces the original TWN-2B night vision device. The commander has the POD-72 day/night sight, which gives him a 360 degree field of view and is mounted in the front of his cupola. The BRDM-2M-96 also has new seats for the crew, a new generation heater for the engine and fighting compartment, GPS and new communication equipment (including the Sotas internal communication system). It also can carry a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear of the hull. Designed in 1996. Used by Polish Kosovo Force units.|$|R
50|$|While it {{actually}} has six wheels (eight {{if you count}} the semi-usable spares behind the front axle), it is listed as a 4WD vehicle- the two rear axles are powered, while the front axle is only used for steering. This is different from many US Military combat vehicles which came later, {{most of which were}} all-wheel drive (4x4 or 6x6). Though it had respectable (for the 1930s) performance on paved and improved surfaces, the lack of powered front wheels and its length combined to give it very poor off-road performance, especially in mud and snow. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> were <b>mounted</b> on free-spinning 'stub axles' {{in an effort to keep}} it from bottoming out the chassis, but they did nothing to help it get unstuck.|$|R
5000|$|July 1932 saw the {{introduction}} of a new “Regent” all-steel bodied “Limousine”. The “Regent” bodied cars had nothing in common with the ill fated Opel Regent of 1929 apart from the name. In place of the conventional vertical rear end of the earlier 1.8 litre, the “Regent" [...] body came with a sloping rear that followed the fashion for streamlining and incorporated a luggage locker. A <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>mounted</b> on the rear panel and access to the fuel filler was through a fuel cap positioned {{through the hole in the}} middle of the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> The first “Regent” bodied 1.8-litre was a two-door saloon/sedan, but during the next few months the new fashionable “Regent” body equivalents were offered of the more conservative original bodied. The only exception was the Torpedo bodied “Touring” version which retained the more perpendicular profile of the original Opel 1.8-litres. In addition to the “Regent” bodies 1933 also saw {{the introduction}} of a four-door Series 18N “six-light” limousine.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 Tom Karen of Ogle Design {{was asked}} to submit some body designs for a new {{four-seater}} Scimitar, the SE5 Reliant Scimitar GTE. Managing Director Ray Wiggin, Chief Engineer Crosthwaite and fibreglass body expert Ken Wood went to Ogle’s in Letchworth {{to look at a}} couple of mock-up body designs for the new SE5, mostly cardboard and sticky tape. There was no doubt in Crosthwaite's mind that it was the right shape. Wiggin told Ken Wood to go ahead and do a proper master. The SE5 was conceived and ready for the 1968 Earls Court Motor Show in under 12 months. For the SE5 Crosthwaite and his team designed a completely different chassis frame, revised and improved suspension, new and relocated fuel tank, a rollover bar, new cooling system, <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> in the nose to give increased rear space and a 17-gallon fuel tank. The car had separate folding rear seats and later a rear windscreen wiper, both firsts. When designing the chassis Crosthwaite worked closely with Ogle body stylist Peter Bailey to modify and refine the prototype. The design was so successful that the basic chassis and suspension geometry remained the same until the last version of the GTE was produced 20 years later. Journalists were divided in their opinions of the vehicle, but once they actually got to drive it they were usually impressed with the performance, handling, and practicality.|$|R
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>mounted</b> on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|R
5000|$|The Snipe, or {{from late}} 1932, Snipe 80 {{featured}} a 3498-cc six-cylinder engine of 80 mm bore and 116 mm stroke with the overhead-inlet, side-exhaust valve gear {{that had been}} a feature of the company’s six-cylinder engines since the mid-1920s. A single Stromberg carburettor was fitted. The four speed transmission had a right hand change lever (right hand drive cars) until 1931 when it moved to the centre of the car facilitating the production of left hand drive examples. The shutters on the radiator grille were opened and closed thermostatically to control the flow of cooling air. For 1933 the engine was redesigned to have overhead valves producing an extra 5 bhp. Bendix mechanical brakes were fitted.The conservatively boxy 4 or 6 light saloon body with <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> on the front wings incorporated rear-hinged doors for back passengers. A fabric saloon (until 1930), sports saloon, tourer and drophead coupé were also listed and bare chassis were also supplied to outside coachbuilders. In 1930 on the home market the chassis sold for £410, the tourer £495, coupé £565 and saloon £535. With a 120-inch wheelbase and a total length of 173 inches, the car was, {{by the standards of the}} British market, larger and more spacious than the average family car such as the more mainstream Hillman Minx of that time, the Hillman business having been acquired by Humber in 1928. With the success of the Snipe, Humber was seen to be succeeding, [...] "where many had failed, in marketing large cars at competitive prices".|$|R
50|$|The first Unimog 404 concept-vehicle {{was made}} in 1953 and was {{slightly}} smaller than the series production model, it had a track width of 1,600 mm and a wheelbase of 2,670 mm. Two prototypes for the french army followed in 1954, the first 1,100 series production models were also purchased by the french army. Since the french army didn't want the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> to occupy space for soldiers on the bed, the Daimler-Benz engineers decided to build the Unimog 404 with a downswept frame so the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> could be <b>mounted</b> underneath the bed. This constructional feature also allowed more torsional flexing and, therefore, improved the offroad capabilities of the Unimog. Later, the downswept frame became a key constructional feature for the following Unimog types.|$|R
2500|$|January 1969 saw {{the arrival}} of the Suzuki Fronte Van three-door wagon (LS10) as a {{successor}} to the Suzulight FE-series Van which had been built alongside the LC10 for a couple of years. The LS10 featured a conventional drivetrain lay-out (engine in front, rear wheel drive), a rear rigid axle with leaf springs and a wheelbase of [...] Design was square in style, radically different from the Fronte sedan. To begin with, the rear opening was a single unit, hinged at the top. The engine was the air-cooled 356cc LC10 two-cycle three-cylinder unit, here detuned to [...] for a top speed of 105km/h. The Van (and its subsequent siblings) has MacPherson struts in front and semi-elliptic leaf springs in rear. Unusually for Japanese cars, the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>mounted</b> in the engine compartment - something more commonly seen in French cars - to help free up more space for luggage.|$|R
50|$|Constructed from {{fiberglass}} {{the body}} was made from 13 inner and outer panels, including a floor panel, riveted and bonded together. The whole body was designed to bolt directly to an unmodified VW bug chassis. In the first prototypes stock front seats from Ford or VW were retained and a lounge-type seat was created for {{the rear of the}} vehicle. To add to the rear seating area a foot stool / cushion was added above the fuel tank. A single sliding door on the right side was the only entrance. The radio and switches were in the door panel {{to the left of the}} driving position. Shock absorbing bumpers of composite construction were designed to look like curved wood. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>mounted</b> to absorb frontal crash energy. For sunny days a large removable panel was positioned in the center of the roof panel. To reduce production costs parts from other vehicles were used. Front windshield was from an AMC Javelin, tail lights from a Datsun Truck and various other parts from a Ford Pinto.|$|R
5000|$|The GAZ-46 MAV {{used the}} {{mechanics}} of existing Russian GAZ 4x4 [...] "jeeps" [...] {{as well as being}} created somewhat bigger for better buoyancy, and its design is heavily inspired by that of the wartime Ford GPA. Just like the 'Seep', its hull is entirely out of steel, welded to a steel chassis. The layout is the same: engine compartment in the front, crew compartment in the center, and the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> horizontally <b>mounted</b> on the rear deck. The driver and the commander of the vehicle have individual seats in the front with a three-seat bench behind them. The windshield can be folded down, and if necessary, a cover can be installed to close the cockpit. The engine is coupled to a manual three-speed gearbox and a two-speed transfer-case. Also, there is a screw-propellor for in the water propulsion, driven by a power take-off, and a proper rudder provides good maneuverability. Front and rear suspension {{is in the form of}} leaf-sprung rigid live axles. Thanks to its steeply raked front and rear and four-wheel drive, the GAZ can manage reasonably steep river banks before swimming across.|$|R
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> on stub axles, and a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|R
