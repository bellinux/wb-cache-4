Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices,</b> glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.|$|R
50|$|A {{power supply}} is an {{electronic}} device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load. The primary {{function of a}} power supply is to convert one form of electrical energy to another. As a result, power supplies are {{sometimes referred to as}} electric power converters. Some power supplies are discrete, <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices,</b> whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{reflective}} stripes that are permanently fixed to clothing, the safety reflector is a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>device</b> {{that can be}} attached to any article of clothing as needed, often using a safety pin and some string. For vehicles, the reflector is usually a fixed part. In bicycles, reflectors are usually on wheels, pedals, under the seat, {{on the back of}} the luggage rack, and in front of the front fork. In motorcycles, automobiles, and other vehicles, reflectors are built into the front and rear ends (and sides) next to the headlights and brake lights.|$|E
5000|$|A charge controller, charge {{regulator}} or battery regulator limits {{the rate at}} which electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries.It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan, and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life.The terms [...] "charge controller" [...] or [...] "{{charge regulator}}" [...] may refer to either a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>device,</b> or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery charger.|$|E
50|$|A {{data logger}} (also {{datalogger}} or data recorder) is an electronic device that records data over time or {{in relation to}} location either with a built in instrument or sensor or via external instruments and sensors. Increasingly, but not entirely, {{they are based on}} a digital processor (or computer). They generally are small, battery powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and sensors. Some data loggers interface with a personal computer, and use software to activate the data logger and view and analyze the collected data, while others have a local interface device (keypad, LCD) and {{can be used as a}} <b>stand-alone</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
40|$|Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a {{non-contact}} {{manufacturing process}} in which material is removed from a metal workpiece by high frequency electrical pulses produced between an electrode and the workpiece. EDM machines are usually <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices,</b> and are quite expensive.

WSN are collections of <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices</b> which, typically, have one or more sensors (e. g. temperature, light level), some limited processing capability and a wireless interface allowing communication with a base station. As they are usually battery powered, the biggest challenge is to achieve the necessary monitoring whilst using the least amount of power...|$|R
5000|$|Data loggers are implicitly <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices,</b> while typical data {{acquisition}} system must remain tethered to a computer to acquire data. This stand-alone aspect of data loggers implies on-board memory {{that is used to}} store acquired data. Sometimes this memory is very large to accommodate many days, or even months, of unattended recording. This memory may be battery-backed static random access memory, flash memory or EEPROM. Earlier data loggers used magnetic tape, punched paper tape, or directly viewable records such as [...] "strip chart recorders".|$|R
5000|$|The Act {{directed}} the NTIA to implement and administer a program through which eligible US households could obtain {{a maximum of}} two [...] "coupons" [...] (actually payment vouchers) of $40 each, to be applied towards {{the purchase of a}} digital-to-analog converter box. The Act defines the term converter box to mean [...] "a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>device</b> that does not contain features or functions except those necessary to enable a consumer to convert any channel broadcast in the digital television service into a format that the consumer can display on television receivers designed to receive and display signals only in the analog television service, but may also include a remote control device." [...] The Act, however, did not define [...] "eligible household".|$|E
5000|$|A medical {{treadmill}} {{which is}} also used for ergometry and cardiopulmonary stress test as well as performance diagnostics is always a class IIb medical device either when used as <b>stand-alone</b> <b>device</b> in a medical environment or when used in connection with an ECG, EMG, ergospirometry, or blood pressure monitoring device.On the running deck the subject is moving, who adapts to the adjustable speed of the belt. The running deck is usually mounted on damping elements, so the running deck has shock absorbing characteristics. By a lifting element, the entire frame including treadmill running deck will be raised and thus simulates a pitch angle for uphill running. Some treadmills also have the reversing of a running belt {{for the purpose of}} downhill loads. Most treadmills for professionals in the fitness area, run for table sizes of about 150 cm long and 50 cm width, a speed range of about 0 ... 20 km/h and slope angle of 0 ... 20%.|$|E
5000|$|The later iPDS is a {{portable}} unit, about 8" [...] x 16" [...] x 20", with a handle. It {{has a small}} green screen, a keyboard built into the top, a 5¼ inch floppy disk drive, and runs the ISIS-II operating system. It can also accept a second 8085 processor, allowing a limited form of multi-processor operation where both processors run simultaneously and independently. The screen and keyboard can be switched between them, allowing programs to be assembled on one processor (large programs took awhile) while files are edited in the other. It has a bubble memory option and various programming modules, including EPROM, and Intel 8048 and 8051 programming modules which are plugged into the side, replacing <b>stand-alone</b> <b>device</b> programmers. In addition to an 8080/8085 assembler, Intel produced a number of compilers including those for PL/M-80 and Pascal, {{and a set of}} tools for linking and statically locating programs to enable them to be burned into EPROMs and used in embedded systems.|$|E
50|$|Described as an {{assimilation}} of {{an alarm clock}} with a digital photo frame and an iPod dock, the ICF-CL75iP was released in October 2009. Endgadget knocked the limited codec support, but lauded the attractive design and low ($149.95) announced price tag. They also suggested Sony should add Chumby widget support, a wish Sony later granted with their Dash alarm clock. CNet Australia felt that although it was missing some features consumers might expect from <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices,</b> the combination of functionality makes up for the shortcomings of each of its parts.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a preliminary set of security requirements for {{safe and secure}} next-generation medical systems, consisting of dynamically composable units, tied together through a real-time safety-critical middleware. We note that this requirement set {{is not the same}} for individual (<b>stand-alone)</b> <b>devices</b> or for electronic health record systems, and we must take care to define system-level requirements rather than security goals for components. The requirements themselves build on each other such that it is difficult or impossible to eliminate any one of the requirements and still achieve high-level security goals...|$|R
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} a disposable microfabricated fluorescence-activated cell sorter (µFACS) for sorting various biological entities. Compared with conventional FACS machines, the µFACS provides higher sensitivity, no cross-contamination, and lower cost. We have used µFACS chips to obtain substantial enrichment of micron-sized fluorescent bead populations of differing colors. Furthermore, we have separated Escherichia coli cells expressing {{green fluorescent protein}} from a background of nonfluorescent E. coli cells and shown that the bacteria are viable after extraction from the sorting device. These sorters can function as <b>stand-alone</b> <b>devices</b> or as components of an integrated microanalytical chip...|$|R
