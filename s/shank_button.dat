40|$|The {{purpose for}} this garment {{was to create}} an evening dress, {{inspired}} by Italian cityscapes at night, that could be worn in the evening while on a trip touring Italy. I designed it {{with the intentions of}} creating a classy and feminine romantic piece that shows both the colors, textures and nostalgia of the blinking lights of a coastal Italian city against the night sky. Process: I began by sketching renderings of ideas for the piece. During this process, I did image research on Italy and gathered images from multiple Italy destinations. From these, I established the looks and colors that I wanted to use. After a trip to Fabric Depot in Oregon to get fabric and many draping, patterning and fitting sessions later, I stitched each piece together to fit my model. Technique: I used the draping method to create Moonlight. Bed sheets were my primary material for draping the garment on a mannequin. After getting the draped piece to look the way I desired it, I moved to creating the paper pattern. I used bedsheets again to sew a sample of the garment to establish correct fit on my model and solidify the look of the design. When the sample fit correctly, I started on the fashion fabric. Carefully, I stitched the pieces together being conscious of every detail. When the base of the garment was completed, I added the final embellishments including trims and buttons. Materials: 100 -percent polyester satin, silver chain, imitation pearls, polyester lining fabric, 100 -percent cotton thread, invisible zipper, <b>shank</b> <b>buttons...</b>|$|R
50|$|Shank boutons have {{a hollow}} {{protrusion}} {{on the back}} through which thread is sewn to attach the <b>button.</b> <b>Button</b> <b>shanks</b> may be a separate piece added {{to the back of}} a button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which case the button is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'. This is a common construction for older shell and glass buttons, for example. <b>Buttons</b> with <b>shanks</b> have no holes in the button blank (the main part of the button) itself because they are not needed for sewing. <b>Buttons</b> with <b>shanks</b> are more expensive to produce than shankless buttons.|$|R
5000|$|Long coats {{that are}} good-quality or better {{often have a}} special shank at the bottom button. Because the bottom button of a coat is subject {{to a lot of}} stress, shanks are {{typically}} longer than usual and are sometimes made with elastic-thread. In addition to the special shank, an additional (shankless) button with no thread shank is often used {{on the underside of the}} fabric when sewing the button on. As a result, the stress to the <b>button,</b> <b>shank,</b> and thread pulls on this second button instead of the fabric. This prevents the thread from damaging and ripping the fabric, and is one of two ways to prevent [...] "popping a button" [...] (the other method is to use good strong thread such as buttonhole twist).|$|R
