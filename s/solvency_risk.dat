The statistical population of the study consisted of the companies accepted by Tehran Stock Exchange.

40|$|Differences in the {{portfolios}} of depositories {{and insurance}} and reinsurance firms are important {{for the design of}} efficient capital regulations. Using a simple contingent claims model which focuses on credit risk and in which intermediaries issue liabilities under conditions of moral hazard, we illustrate three effects of risk-based capital regulations on institutional <b>solvency</b> <b>risk,</b> liquidity and economic efficiency. First, assuming identical asset risks to depositories, insurers that issue significant amounts of contingent liabilities may exhibit a zero risk of insolvency while holding significantly less equity capital than depositories. Second, higher capital requirements must be placed on depositories to attain the same degree of <b>solvency</b> <b>risk,</b> owing to the riskless payoffs promised for bank deposits and similar liabilities. Third, while bank-based capital regulations cannot resolve losses associated with systemic financial risk, capital regulations that incorporate incentive-compatible tax penalties to mitigate moral hazard effects can do so by increasing both liquidity and spanning. We conclude that distortions occur when measuring the <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> of insurers and other non-bank intermediaries with bank-based capital regulations and that uniform harmonization of capital regulations across depositories and insurers can significantly reduce aggregate liquidity and efficiency.

40|$|Stress {{testing is}} an {{important}} tool for evaluating risks to the financial system. The models used to conduct these tests are evolving to include more realistic features. The 2007 – 09 financial crisis demonstrated that, in addition to <b>solvency</b> <b>risk,</b> liquidity risk and spillover effects can generate losses for banks during times of stress. The Bank of Canada has developed an inno-vative stress-testing model—the MacroFinancial Risk Assessment Framework (MFRAF) —which captures the various sources of risk (solvency, liquidity and spillover effects) that banks face. We apply MFRAF to the stress-testing scenario used in the 2013 Canada Financial Sector Assessment Program led by the International Monetary Fund.

To assess the overall impact of different mix of capital and liquidity, we simulate the framework under a severe but plausible macro scenario for different balance-sheet structures. Of particular interest, we find that (1) capital has a decreasing marginal effect on {{systemic risk}}, (2) increasing capital alone is much less effective in reducing liquidity risk than <b>solvency</b> <b>risk,</b> (3) high liquid asset holdings reduce the marginal effect of increasing short term liability on systemic risk, and (4) changing liquid asset holdings has little effect on systemic risk when short term liability is sufficiently low.

40|$|Return {{guarantee}} {{constitutes a}} key ingredient of classical life insurance premium calculation. In the current low interest rate environment insurers face increasingly strong {{financial incentives to}} reduce guaranteed returns embedded in life insurance contracts. However, return guarantee lowering efforts are restrained by associated demand effects, since a higher guaranteed return makes the net price of the insurance cover lower. This tradeoff between possibly higher future insurance obligations {{and the possibility of}} a larger demand for life insurance products can theoretically also be considered when determining optimal guaranteed returns. In this paper, optimality of return guarantee levels is analyzed from a solvency point of view. Availability and some other properties of optimal solutions for guaranteed returns are explored and compared in a simple model for two measures of <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> (company-level and contract-level VaR). The paper concludes that a <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> minimizing optimal guaranteed return may theoretically exist, although its practical availability can be impeded by economic and regulatory constraints...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes and {{demonstrates}} a methodology for modeling correlated systemic solvency and liquidity risks for a banking system. Using a forward looking simulation of many risk factors applied to detailed balance sheets for a 10 bank stylized United States banking system, we analyze correlated market and credit risk and estimate {{the probability that}} multiple banks will fail or experience liquidity runs simultaneously. Significant systemic risk factors are shown to include financial and economic environment regime shifts to stressful conditions, poor initial loan credit quality, loan portfolio sector and regional concentrations, bank creditors ’ sensitivity to and uncertainties regarding <b>solvency</b> <b>risk,</b> and inadequate capital. Systemic banking system <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> {{is driven by the}} correlated defaults of many borrowers, other market risks, and inter-bank defaults. Liquidity runs are modeled as a response to elevated <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> and uncertainties and are shown to increase correlated bank failures. Potential bank funding outflows and contractions in lending with significant real economic impacts are estimated. Increases in equity capital levels needed to reduce bank solvency and liquidity risk levels to a target confidence level are also estimated to range from 3 percent to 20 percent of assets. For a future environment that replicates the 1987 – 2006 volatilities and correlations, we find only a small risk of U. S. bank failures focused on thinly capitalized and regionally concentrated smaller banks. For the 2007 – 2010 financial environment calibration we find substantially elevated solvency and liquidity risks for all banks and the banking system. JEL Classification Numbers...|$|E

40|$|With the issuing of Pension Funds {{circular}} PF 117 in 2004 in South Africa, regulation required valuation assumptions for {{defined benefit}} pension funds {{to be on}} a best-estimate basis. Allowance for prudence was to be made through explicit contingency reserves, in order to increase reporting transparency. These reserves for prudence, however, were not permitted to put the fund into deficit (the no-deficit clause). Analysis is conducted to understand the risk that PF 117 poses to pension fund sponsors and members under two key measures: contribution rate risk and <b>solvency</b> <b>risk.</b> A stochastic model of a typical South African defined benefit fund is constructed with simulations run to determine the impact of the PF 117 requirements. Findings show that a best-estimate funding basis, coupled with the no-deficit clause, results in significant risk under both contribution rate and <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> measures, particularly in the short-term. To mitigate these risks, alternative ways of introducing conservatism into the funding basis are required, with possible options including incorporating margins into investment return assumptions or the removal of the no-deficit clause...|$|E

In fact, banks of the peripheral countries used the public funds to increase their exposure to risky domestic debt, so that when <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> in the Eurozone worsened the run of private short-term investors from Eurozone banks intensified. (ii) In contrast, ECB’s announcement of being a potential buyer of last resort via the Outright Monetary Transaction program (OMT) significantly reduced the bank-sovereign nexus.

40|$|A country {{entering}} a monetary union gives {{up the right}} to determine its own monetary policy, thereby relinquishing monetary instruments to assure fiscal solvency. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical model to address fiscal <b>solvency</b> <b>risk.</b> We show that when debt is subject to an upper bound and policy faces stochastic shocks, a government can find itself in a position for which the expected present value of future surpluses under current policy is less than debt. Agents refuse to lend into such a position, and the sudden stop of capital flows defines a fiscal solvency crisis. We model the dynamics of a fiscal solvency crisis in a monetary union {{under the assumption that}} the fiscal authority will respond to the crisis using default to reduce the value of debt. We simulate the model to estimate fiscal <b>solvency</b> <b>risk</b> in the European Monetary Union.
