50|$|Weeks earlier, {{reportedly}} on 17 January 1817, {{a luminous}} snowstorm occurred in Vermont and New Hampshire. Saint Elmo's fire appeared as <b>static</b> <b>discharges</b> on roof peaks, fence posts, and the hats and fingers of people. Thunderstorms prevailed over central New England.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} water vapor {{directly}} controls the permittivity of the air. During times of low humidity, <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.|$|E
25|$|October 12, 1939 a <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> at 9,000 meters ignited {{hydrogen}} in SP-2 Komsomol (VR60). The crew unlatched {{the gondola}} into a free fall, deployed the gondola parachute and then bailed out on personal parachutes; all survived.

25|$|Items {{that are}} {{particularly}} sensitive to <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> may {{be treated with}} the application of an antistatic agent, which adds a conducting surface layer that ensures any excess charge is evenly distributed.

25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} low humidity in extraterrestrial environments, very large static charges can accumulate, causing a major hazard for the complex electronics used in space exploration vehicles. Static electricity {{is thought to}} be a particular hazard for astronauts on planned missions to the Moon and Mars. Walking over {{the extremely}} dry terrain could cause them to accumulate a significant amount of charge; reaching out to open the airlock on their return could cause a large <b>static</b> <b>discharge,</b> potentially damaging sensitive electronics.|$|E
25|$|Lightning is a {{dramatic}} natural example of <b>static</b> <b>discharge.</b> While the details are unclear and remain a subject of debate, the initial charge separation {{is thought to be}} associated with contact between ice particles within storm clouds. In general, significant charge accumulations can only persist in regions of low electrical conductivity (very few charges free to move in the surroundings), hence the flow of neutralizing charges often results from neutral atoms and molecules in the air being torn apart to form separate positive and negative charges, which travel in opposite directions as an electric current, neutralizing the original accumulation of charge. The static charge in air typically breaks down in this way at around 10,000 volts per centimeter (10 kV/cm) depending on humidity. The discharge superheats the surrounding air causing the bright flash, and produces a shock wave causing the clicking sound. The lightning bolt is simply a scaled-up version of the sparks seen in more domestic occurrences of <b>static</b> <b>discharge.</b> The flash occurs because the air in the discharge channel is heated to such a high temperature that it emits light by incandescence. The clap of thunder {{is the result of the}} shock wave created as the superheated air expands explosively.|$|E
25|$|A <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> in the {{presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|E

25|$|In some observations, {{the ball}} {{lightning}} {{appeared to have}} an extremely high energy concentration but this phenomenon hasn't been adequately verified. The present theory concerns only the low energy lightning ball form, with centripetal forces and surface tension. The visibility of the ball lightning {{can be associated with}} electroluminescence, {{a direct result of the}} triboelectric effect from materials within the area of the reaction. <b>Static</b> <b>discharge</b> from the cylindrical stage imply the existence of contact electrification within the object. The direction of the discharges indicate the cylinder's rotation, and resulting rotational axis of the ball lightning in accordance to the law of laminar flow. If the ball came from the channel, it would have rotated in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeling of}} an {{electric}} shock {{is caused by the}} stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body. The energy stored as static electricity on an object varies {{depending on the size of}} the object and its capacitance, the voltage to which it is charged, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. For modelling the effect of <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> on sensitive electronic devices, a human being is represented as a capacitor of 100 picofarads, charged to a voltage of 4000 to 35000 volts. When touching an object this energy is discharged in less than a microsecond. While the total energy is small, on the order of millijoules, it can still damage sensitive electronic devices. Larger objects will store more energy, which may be directly hazardous to human contact or which may give a spark that can ignite flammable gas or dust.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their greater power, as well as lack of warning, {{positive}} lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous. Due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current, they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited. At the present time, aircraft are not designed to withstand such strikes, since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set, and the dangers unappreciated until the destruction of a glider in 1999. The standard in force {{at the time of the}} crash, Advisory Circular AC 20-53A, was replaced by Advisory Circular AC 20-53B in 2006, however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated. Aircraft operating in U.S. airspace have been required to be equipped with <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> wicks. Although their primary function is to mitigate radio interference due to static buildup through friction with the air, in the event of a lightning strike, a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere. These measures, however, may be insufficient for positive lightning.|$|E

50|$|Two {{forms of}} lead styphnate are six-sided {{monohydrate}} crystals and small rectangular crystals. Lead styphnate is particularly sensitive to {{fire and the}} <b>discharge</b> of <b>static</b> electricity. When dry, it can readily detonate by <b>static</b> <b>discharges</b> from the human body. The longer and narrower the crystals, the more susceptible lead styphnate is to static electricity. Lead styphnate does not react with metals and is less sensitive to shock and friction than mercury fulminate or lead azide. It is stable in storage, even at elevated temperatures. As with other lead-containing compounds, lead styphnate is toxic owing to heavy metal poisoning.|$|R

2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the <b>static</b> <b>discharge</b> causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E

Nevertheless, mobile phone manufacturers and gas stations ask users to switch off their phones.

In the MythBusters episode [...] "Cell Phone Destruction", investigators concluded that explosions attributed to cell phones could be caused by <b>static</b> <b>discharges</b> from clothing instead and also observed that such incidents seem to involve women more often than men.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901 Fleming {{designed}} the transmitter used by Guglielmo Marconi {{in the first}} transmission of radio waves across the Atlantic from Poldhu, England, to Nova Scotia, Canada. The distance between the two points was about 3,500 km. Although the contact, reported November 12, 1901, was widely heralded as a great scientific advance at the time, {{there is also some}} skepticism about the claim, because the received signal, the three dots of the Morse code letter [...] "S", was so weak the primitive receiver had difficulty distinguishing it from atmospheric radio noise caused by <b>static</b> <b>discharges,</b> leading later critics to suggest it may have been random noise. Regardless, it was clear to Fleming that reliable transatlantic communication with the existing transmitter required more sensitive receiving apparatus.|$|R

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of these modeling techniques for IC induced some issues, especially under Pspice, being the targeted tool for our simulation.
