5|$|Henson's 1960s {{talk show}} {{appearances}} culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog. Rowlf {{became the first}} Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of The Cube, another Henson-produced experimental movie.|$|E

He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered his face with white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> to be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E

25|$|Until 1834, the Bank of England {{observed}} about 33 saints' {{days and}} religious festivals as holidays, {{but in that}} year this was reduced to four: 1 May (May Day), 1 November (All Saints' Day), Good Friday and Christmas Day. In 1871, the first legislation relating to bank holidays was passed when Liberal politician and banker Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act 1871, which specified the days in the table below. Under the Act, no person was compelled to make any payment or to do any act upon a bank holiday which {{he would not be}} compelled to do or make on Christmas Day or Good Friday, and the making of a payment or the doing of an act on the following day was equivalent to doing it on the holiday. People were <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> that some called the first Bank Holidays St Lubbock's Days for a while. Scotland was treated separately because of its separate traditions: for example, New Year is a more important holiday there.|$|E

500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E

500|$|During college Rodman {{worked at}} a summer youth {{basketball}} camp, where he befriended camper Bryne Rich, who was shy and withdrawn due to a hunting accident in which he mistakenly shot and killed his best friend. The two became almost inseparable and formed a close bond. Rich invited Rodman to his rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches because he was black.

[...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians.

500|$|... "This Is the Day" [...] {{was taken}} from Ivy's second studio album Apartment Life which was {{released}} on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was prominently featured in the 1998 American comedy film There's Something About Mary and was also included on the film's official soundtrack. Reflecting on its usage in the film, Durand commented that it was unimaginable to see their songs in several scenes and that she [...] "fe <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> to have something like that in a movie". The song was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. Despite Atlantic Records signing Ivy earlier in 1997, they were later dropped and picked up by 550 Music. Following its inclusion on the film, the aforementioned label distributed the song to radio stations across the United States on October 19, 1998, in addition to releasing it as a CD single in the United States; two formats were created, with the commercial release including bonus tracks [...] "Sleeping Late" [...] and [...] "Sweet Mary" [...] and the promotional featuring just the album version of the single. Additionally, 550 Music reissued Apartment Life in the United States with new cover art and digitally remastered tracks, while both Schlesinger and Chase opened up a new recording studio titled Stratosphere in New York City in June 1999. Furthermore in the late 1990s, [...] "This Is the Day" [...] would be included on the Pepsi-issued album Pepsi Pop Culture (1998) and the 1999 compilation album titled Live a Little, Vol. 1.|$|E

500|$|Wanting {{to be on}} television, Cartman and Kenny {{join the}} ship's crew under false pretenses of wanting to save the whales. After a brief run-in with Captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the show Deadliest Catch, Japanese pilots launch kamikaze attacks on the Sea Shepherd. The suicidal planes kill the Whale Wars crew except for Stan, Cartman and Kenny. The trio are {{captured}} and brought to Japan, where Emperor Akihito tells them retaliation for the bombing of Hiroshima is the primary motive for Japan's whaling efforts, with Cartman finding the whole nuclear drop and mass devastation hilarious. He shows them a doctored photograph—given to Japan by the United States after the bombing—of the Enola Gay piloted by a dolphin and a killer whale. According to him, Japan was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> the Americans gave the Japanese these photos they declared peace. Knowing the picture is a fake, Stan decides to reveal {{the truth about the}} bombing, but Cartman reminds him that the Japanese seek to drive the entire species of the perpetrators to extinction. Claiming the U.S. government has authorized him to show the [...] "original" [...] photo, Stan presents the Emperor, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, and other Japanese officials with a new doctored photo showing a cow and chicken in the Enola Gay (created by Kyle, who Stan managed to phone beforehand). The Japanese become infuriated, now believing cows and chickens had modified the original photo to frame the innocent whales and dolphins. The Japanese agree to cease their whaling efforts and start slaughtering cows and chickens, storming farms full of the animals. The episode ends as Randy congratulates Stan for making the Japanese [...] "normal, like us".|$|E
500|$|Later in 2004, McAdams starred {{opposite}} fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in {{the romantic}} drama The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks' {{novel of the}} same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling's poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming to familiarize herself with the southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked the film's director Nick Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was won over by the [...] "beauty and clarity" [...] of McAdams's performance. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune declared her [...] "a real discovery" [...] who [...] "infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts".

500|$|Darwin {{published}} On the Origin of Species on November24, 1859. The first printing was 1,250 copies, {{with some}} having {{been sent to}} America via ship; one of those was for Gray. Gray's copy arrived just before Christmas, and he read it between Christmas and New Year's. Since there was no international copyright law at the time, Gray worked to protect the book from publishing piracy. According to American law at the time, a copyright could only be secured by an American edition being published by an American citizen, and royalties {{were not required to}} be paid to the author. Gray arranged the first American edition of On the Origin of Species and was able to negotiate royalties on Darwin's behalf. Gray took a 5%royalty from the publisher, and Darwin was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> for Gray's efforts that he offered Gray some of his royalties. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book Forms of Flowers (1877) to Gray, and he wrote in 1881, [...] "there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation I value more highly than I do yours." [...] Seeing the [...] "unity we perceive in nature" [...] and law in the universe, regarding all species he felt [...] "that they not only had a Creator but have a Governor." [...] Gray and Agassiz strongly disagreed; Agassiz was adamantly opposed to the idea of evolution, whereas Gray was a staunch supporter, believing in theistic evolution. As the debate raged over Darwin's theories, the rift between Gray and Agassiz grew deeper, and they were estranged by December 1863, when Gray was elected president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which also marked Agassiz' increasing isolation within the scientific community. Gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from the National Academy of Sciences in 1867. In late 1866 Agassiz apologized to Gray and the two were at least civil to one another again.|$|E
