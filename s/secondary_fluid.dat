40|$|Microfluidic {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complicated {{as the number of}} applications grows. The use of microfluidic systems for chemical and biological agent detection, for example, requires that a given sample be subjected to many process steps, which requires microvalves to control the position and transport of the sample. Each microfluidic application has its own specific valve requirements and this has precipitated the wide variety of valve designs reported in the literature. Each of these valve designs has its strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the valve design proposed here is its simplicity, which makes it easy to fabricate, easy to actuate, and easy to integrate with a microfluidic system. It can be applied to either gas phase or liquid phase systems. This novel design uses a <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> to stop the flow of the primary fluid in the system. The <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> must be chosen based on the type of flow that it must stop. A dielectric fluid must be used for a liquid phase flow driven by electroosmosis, and a liquid with a large surface tension should be used to stop a gas phase flow driven by a weak pressure differential. Experiments were carried out investigating certain critical functions of the design. These experiments verified that the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> can be reversibly moved between its 'valve opened' and 'valve closed' positions, where the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> remained as one contiguous piece during this transport process. The experiments also verified that when Fluorinert is used as the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid,</b> the valve can break an electric circuit. It was found necessary to apply a hydrophobic coating to the microchannels to stop the primary fluid, an aqueous electrolyte, from wicking past the Fluorinert and short-circuiting the valve.

A counter flow heat exchanger in which a high temperature primary fluid heats and vaporizes a lower temperature <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> is considered as the system. The governing equations of this system is obtained by using the transient field equations, constitutive relations, boundary conditions and the initial conditions of both the primary and the secondary fluids. The governing equations of the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> are decoupled from the equations of the primary fluid by determining a heat flux profile and superimposing it {{on the wall of the}} channel of the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid.</b> With this superimposed heat flux profile an equivalent system is obtained which utilizes the fundamental equations of the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> to analyze {{the stability of the}} flow. To investigate the stability of the system, a relation between the variation of the inlet velocity and the variation of the total channel pressure drop is needed. The Laplace transform of this relation is called the transfer function of this system and is obtained by using a small perturbation technique and linearization.

This current research investigates the capillary state suspensions in more detail using a computational model to evaluate the lowest energy states of small particle number clusters. These clusters are used as building blocks for the formation of sample-spanning networks within the admixture, where the constituent structures have limited regions of stability based on the wetting angle and volume of the <b>secondary</b> <b>fluid</b> leading to changes in the strength of the network. The influence of the capillary force in the formation of these networks is further substantiated using rheological measurements.
