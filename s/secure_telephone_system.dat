50|$|The Ninth Chief Directorate (also nicknamed Devyatka (девятка)) of the KGB was the {{organization}} {{responsible for providing}} bodyguard services to the principal Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) leaders (and families) and major Soviet government facilities (including nuclear-weapons stocks).

2500|$|The KGB Security Troops {{were the}} uniformed {{paramilitary}} {{troops of the}} Soviet KGB which engaged in military-related activities that are not mentioned in legislation governing the Soviet Armed forces. The KGB controlled elite units that guarded the highest party officials and stood a continuous ceremonial guard at the Lenin Mausoleum. The special KGB signal troops also operated communications linking the party with the Ministry of Defense and the major territorial commands. Another KGB armed force guarded sensitive military, scientific, and industrial installations in the Soviet Union and, until the late 1960s, controlled Soviet nuclear warhead stockpiles. They also guarded government installations (nuclear weapons, etc.), operated the Moscow VIP subway (Russian journalists have reported {{that the existence of}} Metro-2 is neither confirmed nor denied by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) or the Moscow Metro administration.), and <b>secured</b> Government–Party <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ptarmigan is a mobile, {{cryptographic}} {{digital and}} modular battlefield {{wide area network}} communications system based on the Plessey System 250 architecture. It was initially {{designed to meet the}} needs of the British Army of the Rhine in West Germany and replaced the BRUIN system. The system consists of a network of electronic exchanges known as trunk nodes. These nodes are connected by multichannel UHF and SHF radio relay links that carry voice, data, telegraph and facsimile communications. The Single Channel Radio Access subsystem is effectively a VHF <b>secure</b> mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> that gives isolated or mobile users an entry point into the PTARMIGAN network. Ptarmigan has undergone a number of upgrades since it came into service in 1982. ( [...] First delivery of Ptarmigan equipment was to 1 Armoured Division HQ and Signal Regiment in December 1984, and did not enter service until February/March 1985) These include the introduction of an Air Portable Secondary Access Node for 16 Air Assault Brigade, and the General Purpose Trunk Access Port software enhancement which provides interconnectivity to other nations' tactical communications systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to nonsecure voice, data, and video services, the DSN will provide transmission, switching, {{and support services}} for <b>Secure</b> <b>Telephone</b> Units, Third Generation (STU-IIIs, now obsolete), the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), the dial-up alternative routing for the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (NIPRNet), and the Secret IP Router Network (SIPRNet). The DSN can also provide access to the Government Emergency <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (GETS).|$|R
50|$|A <b>secure</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> is {{a telephone}} that provides voice {{security in the}} form of end-to-end encryption for the telephone call, and in some cases also the mutual authentication of the call parties, protecting them against a man-in-the-middle attack. Concerns about massive growth of telephone tapping incidents led to growing demand for <b>secure</b> <b>telephones.</b>|$|R

It requires high {{transmission data}} rate, high interactivity and customizable service in a high mobility environment. VoIP in wireless networks is a promising technology. It is significant to design a railway freight dispatching <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> based on VoIP in wireless networks (IEEE 802. 11 and IEEE 802. 16).

The contract included 35 Honeywell 6000 series systems, some having multiple processors. System models from the H-6060 through the H-6080 were acquired. [...] They ran a specially secured variant of Honeywell’s General Comprehensive Operating Supervisor (GCOS), {{and for years}} the vendor maintained and enhanced both the commercial GCOS and the [...] "WWMCCS" [...] GCOS in parallel.

50|$|Mobile radio <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> of {{wireless}} type {{that preceded the}} modern cellular mobile form of telephony technology. Since they were the predecessors {{of the first generation}} of cellular <b>telephones,</b> these <b>systems</b> are sometimes retroactively referred to as pre-cellular (or sometimes zero generation, that is, 0G) systems. Technologies used in pre-cellular systems included the Push to Talk (PTT or manual), Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (AMTS) systems.These early mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> can be distinguished from earlier closed radiotelephone systems in that they were available as a commercial service {{that was part of the}} public switched telephone network, with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatch system.|$|R

50|$|Some private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> use a paging facility {{that acts as a}} liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the <b>telephone</b> <b>system,</b> and allows announcements to be played over the phone speakers.|$|R
50|$|The {{practical}} {{availability of}} <b>secure</b> <b>telephones</b> is restricted by several factors; notably politics, export issues, incompatibility between different products (the devices {{on each side}} of the call have to use the same protocol), and high (though recently decreasing) price of the devices.|$|R
50|$|The STU-II (Standard Telephone Unit II) is a <b>secure</b> <b>telephone</b> {{developed}} by the U.S. National Security Agency.
