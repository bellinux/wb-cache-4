40|$|Abstract — In {{the design}} of an active matrix LCD, {{the ratio of the}} pixel voltage to the video voltage, {{abbreviated}} to RPV, is an important metric of the performance, since the pixel voltage determines the transmitted luminance of the pixel. Hence, in {{the design of}} a source driver circuit for an LCD, of primal importance is the issue of how to restrict the admissible allowance of the RPV of a pixel within a specified narrow range. This constraint on the RPV is analyzed in terms of parameters associated with the sampling switch and the <b>sampling</b> <b>pulse,</b> and then by using a minimal number of these parameters, a design scheme is described dedicatedly for the sampling switch, which finds an optimal sampling switch size and an optimal <b>sampling</b> <b>pulse</b> waveform.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a basic model for time-interleaved {{photonic}} analog-to-digital converter (TIPADC) and analyze its linear, nonlinear, and noise performance. The basic operation mechanism of TIPADC is illustrated and the linear performance is analyzed in frequency domain. The mathematical expressions and {{the output of the}} system are presented in each processing step. We reveal that photonic sampling folds the whole spectrum of input signal in a narrow band, which enables the analog bandwidth of a TIPADC to be much higher than the bandwidth of back-end electronics. The feasible regions of the system is obtained in terms of system frequency response, and a set of sampling criteria determining the basic requirements to the system are summarized for typical applications. The results show that the global minimum feasible bandwidth of back-end electronics is the half of single channel sampling rate when the bandwidth of photonic <b>sampling</b> <b>pulse</b> is comparable to input signal frequency. The amplitude and phase noise of photonic <b>sampling</b> <b>pulse</b> train, the thermal noise and shot noise of photodetection, and the quantization noise and aperture jitter noise of EADCs are investigated. The nonlinearity of TIPADC is also analyzed. The effect of different factors, such as the single channel sampling rate, the average optical power and the bandwidth of back-end electronics, on the effective number of bits of TIPADC is qualitatively and quantitatively discussed. The results explicitly show that TIPADC can perform high fidelity conversion to ultra-high speed analog signal and overcome the major performance limitations existing in traditional ADCs such as aperture jitter and bandwidth.

Beat frequency simulations and Fourier spectra are also used in the evaluation of the ADC performance. A fully functional 4 -bit ADC, with a maximum input bandwidth of 10 GHz for a clock speed of 20 GHz, was achieved through simulations.
