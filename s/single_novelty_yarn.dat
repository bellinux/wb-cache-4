50|$|Flammé yarns are {{a kind of}} <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is {{generally}} a loose or untwisted core wrapped by at least one other strand. The extra element can be a metallic thread, or a much-thicker or much-narrower strand of yarn, or yarn that varies between thick and thin. Some companies have come to put twin yarns on the market to show off combinations of one regular <b>yarn</b> and <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> in assorted colors or even two different types of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ladder yarn or {{train tracks}} yarn {{is a type}} of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is {{constructed}} like ladders, with a horizontal stripe of material suspended between two thinner threads, alternating with gaps. Sometimes a contrasting strand is fed through the gaps to produce another look.|$|R
5000|$|The yarn {{affects the}} bulk and drape of the knitted fabric, {{as well as}} the {{visibility}} of stitches. Complicated stitch patterns are best seen with a smooth, highly spun yarn and may be invisible with [...] "furry" [...] yarns such as mohair or <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fabrics and}} yarns used in {{traditional}} embroidery vary {{from place to}} place. Wool, linen, and silk have been in use {{for thousands of years}} for both fabric and yarn. Today, embroidery thread is manufactured in cotton, rayon, and <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk. Ribbon embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/organza blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.|$|R
50|$|Ribbon or tape yarn {{is a kind}} of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is made of ribbon, but {{generally}} not the kind of ribbon used in sewing and millinery. Rather, they are ribbons made especially for knitting or crocheting, with some in a tubular form, some woven flat, and some similar in appearance to Bias tape. Ribbon yarns can be composed of many materials, from synthetics to silk to plant fibers.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> {{make use}} of special plying {{techniques}} to gain their special effects. By varying {{the tension in the}} strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is bouclé, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.|$|R
50|$|Natural fibers from animals, such as alpaca, angora and merino {{and plant}} fibers, chiefly cotton, have become easier and less costly {{to collect and}} process and {{therefore}} more widely available. Exotic fibers, such as silk, bamboo, yak and qiviut are growing in popularity as well. The yarn industry has started to make <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns,</b> which produce stunning results without years of knitting experience. Designers have begun to create patterns which work up quickly on large needles, a phenomenon known as instant-gratification knitting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> {{include a}} wide variety of yarns made with unusual features, {{structure}} or fiber composition such as slubs, inclusions, metallic or synthetic fibers, laddering and varying thickness introduced during production. Some linens, wools to be woven into tweed, and the uneven filaments of some types of silk are allowed to retain their normal irregularities, producing the characteristic uneven surface of the finished fabric. Man-made fibres, which can be modified during production, are especially adaptable for special effects such as crimping and texturizing.|$|R
5000|$|Eyelash yarn is {{made from}} a {{polyester}} fiber with a furry texture resembling eyelashes. These <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> are made of a thin central ply surrounded by short [...] "hairs". This yarn differs from [...] "fur" [...] type yarn in that it contains evenly spaced threads at intervals between lengths of bare core thread, whereas fur yarns have an abundance of threads covering {{the entirety of the}} core thread. Eyelash yarn comes {{in a wide range of}} colors, with the [...] "hairs" [...] sometimes being made of multicolored or metallic fibers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as complex yarns. A yarn which makes a fabric is not always smooth and uniform. Complex yarns are the uneven yarns which may be thick and thin or have curls, loops, twists and even differently coloured areas along their length. This look of the yarns are used to add interesting effects in fabrics. In complex ply two or more complex yarns are twisted around each other to form loops, curls and knots to create fancy effects. Many knitting yarns are complex ply yarns which give interesting textures in finished products.|$|R
5000|$|Eyelash yarn {{is a type}} of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It {{appears as}} a thread base, with several long strands spaced at even {{intervals}} that jut out at an angle from the main strand. The long strands, or hair, can be metallic, opalescent, matte, or a combination of types. The hair can be curly or straight and can sometimes be two different lengths. Prominent types are composed of 100% polyester with a straight and relatively short hair. Because of its thinness, eyelash is normally carried along with another, plainer yarn to add visual interest to the primary yarn.|$|R

The creative or technical designers visit the manufacturers monthly to maintain communication and address any design/production issues. Costs limit fibre choice usually to polyester {{which is then}} designed for variety of looks, e.g. highly lustrous, soft matt, textured and <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> to create interest in the woven and knitted fabrics. Wool can be used but is expensive, therefore limited (Sage used wool for the BMWi 3). Yarns are supplied by Autofil Worldwide Ltd., who also piece- or yarn-dye and texturize to a very wide variety of looks and feel; the blend, has to be visually appealing to the customer (the OEM), pass various rigorous tests (such as abrasion and light fastness), be durable (up to 10  years) and most importantly, cost effective.|$|R
5000|$|Raschel knits do not stretch {{significantly}} {{and are often}} bulky; consequently, they are often used as an unlined material for coats, jackets, straight skirts and dresses. These fabrics can be made out of conventional or <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> which allows for interesting textures and designs to be created. [...] The qualities of these fabrics range from [...] "dense and compact to open and lofty and can be either stable or stretchy, and single-faced or reversible. [...] The largest outlet for the Raschel warp knitting machine is for lace fabric and trimmings. Raschel knitting is also used in outdoors and military fabrics for products such as backpacks. It is used to provide a ventilated mesh next to the user's body (covering padding) or mesh pockets and pouches to facilitate visibility of the contents (MIL-C-8061).|$|R

60|$|In November the {{vegetation}} above 4000 feet turns wintry and brown, the weather becomes chilly, {{and though the}} cold is never great, hoar-frost forms at Churra, and water freezes at Moflong. We prepared to leave as these signs of winter advanced: we had collected upwards of 2,500 species, {{and for the last}} few weeks all our diligence, and that of our collectors, had failed to be rewarded by a <b>single</b> <b>novelty.</b> We however procured many species in fruit, and made a collection of upwards of 300 kinds of woods, many of very curious structure. As, however, we projected a trip to Cachar before quitting the neighbourhood, we retained our collectors, giving orders for them to meet us at Chattuc, on our way down the Soormah in December, with their collections, which amounted to 200 men's loads, and for the conveyance of which to Calcutta, Mr. Inglis procured us boats.|$|R
