He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> name.|$|E
5|$|A {{departure}} from the hip-hop and R <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> previous studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} of April, 2010, being blonde again and having left Avrupa Müzik, now {{being part of the}} music label of Poll Production, Yener {{released}} yet another album, called Hande'ye Neler Oluyor? (What's Going On With Hande?). Before she released this album, she has been cited that she would likely return to a more pop-oriented sound, meaning letting go of the prevailing electronic <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> last three albums and her EP Hande Maxi. Although not a collection of pure electronic songs, the album didn't throw the electronic sound completely overboard — it actually contains no live instrumentation — favouring a more dance-pop oriented album, reminiscing of some songs of her Apayrı-era, over the more Türk pop albums {{in the early days of}} her career.|$|E

It {{was released on}} ANTI-, her first through that label, on 1 October 2012, in the UK {{and the next day}} in the USA. Recorded in Portland, Oregon, USA, the album is produced by Tucker Martine and expanded on the purely acoustic <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> previous record, with many of the songs written in the open guitar tunings Orton had learned from Bert Jansch in the years previous. The album was largely recorded live, with a band consisting of Brian Blade on drums, Sebastian Sternberg on bass, and Rob Burger on keyboards. Additional guitar work came from Marc Ribot and Ted Barnes, with backing vocals by Laura Veirs and Sam Amidon. Sugaring Season was widely received as a return to form, with many critics calling it her finest album to date.|$|E

500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, commenting that {{although}} she sings through the verses in her [...] "usual speak-sing fashion", the chorus is [...] "joyously irresistible".

60|$|There was not {{a single}} feeling in the {{temperament}} of Elizabeth Temple that could prompt her to desert a companion in such an extremity.

500|$|Criticism {{that her}} {{success in the}} music {{industry}} was attributed to {{being a member of the}} Jackson family and a producer-dependent artist led her to write all lyrics for the album, in addition to co-producing every song and co-writing each of their arrangements with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Its title, read [...] "Janet, period.", is meant to disassociate her public image from her family, dropping her surname. A pop and R record, Janet incorporated hip hop, opera, house and jazz, eliminating the rigid, industrial <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> previous records. Lyrically, the theme of Janet is sexual intimacy—an abrupt departure from her conservative image. Much of her lyrics emphasize a woman's perspective on sexuality and the demand for practicing safe sex.|$|E

For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public. She perused of her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, [...] "What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album to speak to things on my mind.

A subsequent verse sung by Lewis returns to the eerie and sinister <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> introduction. After the second chorus, the song enters into a bridge where the group hum and Lewis sings two lines from the pre-chorus, [...] "Each moment is cool / Freeze the moment". The track later ends in an outro sung by Lewis using the same lyrics and starker sound from her introduction, but enhanced by guitar, synths and welding, clipped dance rhythms.|$|E
