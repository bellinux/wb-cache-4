Thus, conversely, minute analyses of the tension-records were deeped to be available for the elucidation not only of the main-line tensions but of the issues concerning the working of the line-hauler, the operation of the gears and the seamanship in hauling the line.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{microclimate}} and energy balance indicators of 2 habitats with different types of vegetation (wetland, pasture) during the growing season. Mainly moisture and temperature regime and energy fluxes were monitored {{in the period of}} 1. 4. to 30. 9., 2014. All values were dependent on the type of vegetation, and the type and location of the environment. Microclimate analysis was performed on two locations - in a pasture in the basin of Mlýnský stream and wetland habitat in the basin of Horský stream. Both sites are located on the right bank of the Lipno lake. All the necessary meteorological characteristics were measured using automatic weather <b>stations.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of temperatures and humidity of soil and air, received, and the total amount of reflected sunlight and heat balance characteristics - albedo, Bowen ratio, evaporative fraction and heat flows were evaluated. The biggest differences were monitored at heights, in which was measured. In terms of relative humidity, values most varied at canopy level, where the differences were noticeable. The highest mean relative humidity was measured at height of 0. 2 m and 2 m on the wetland. As relative humidity even air temperature is dependent on the height at which it was measured. While the height of 2 m, the values at both sites was almost identical, at the canopy level are differences significant. The average temperature values depend on the season, but the largest amplitude of the temperature reached the sites in June. The surface temperature of the soil at the wetland was almost unchanged, contrary to pasture its course was similar to air temperatures series at the canopy level. The soil temperature at 20 cm was almost the same at both sites. In terms of energy fluxes, {{it was found that the}} highest latent heat flux of evaporation was in wetland. Sensible heat flux was higher in the pasture. The flux of heat into the ground is bigger during the morning and evening hours on the wetland, however ground heat flux was higher in the pasture during the day...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} based on data sets in winter in 1983 of ECMWF 500 hPa height field and {{meteorological}} observations at surface level at Mizuho <b>Station.</b> The <b>indicators</b> of cloudiness and temperature at the surface in the Antarctic interior are those at Vostok station. From the daily data, {{it is found that}} the katabatic wind at the Mizuho Station is strong and surface temperature in the inlaid area of Antarctica is high while a strong high pressure system at the 500 hPa level appears over East Antarctica. This situation suggests the existence of downward flow in the lower level over the inland area of Antarctica, which is a compensational flow and induces adiabatic heating. The evolution of the high pressure system is partly associated with a variation in the hemispheric-scale circulation system, shown by N. HIRASAWA and T. YAMANOUCHI (Proc. NIPR Symp. Polor Meteorol. Glacciol., 9, 193, 1995). It is noted that cloudiness in the inland area is larger in during the high pressure than during the low pressure. This situation suggests that when strong katabatic wind induces strong conpensational downward flow, the downward flow is not always predominant from top to bottom of troposphere. However, the mechanism in the relationship between the atmospheric circulation in the lower level and the increase in cloudiness is left to be solved...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, marine {{scientists}} have {{relied heavily on}} satellite sea surface temperatures and terrestrial weather <b>stations</b> as <b>indicators</b> {{of the way in}} which the thermal environment, and hence the body temperatures of organisms, vary over spatial and temporal scales. We designed biomimetic temperature loggers for three species of rocky intertidal invertebrates to determine whether mimic body temperatures differ from the external environment and among species and microhabitats. For all three species, microhabitat temperatures were considerably higher than the body temperatures, with differences as great as 11. 1 °C on horizontal rocky substrata. Across microhabitats, daily maximal temperatures of the limpet Cellana tramoserica were on average 2. 1 and 3. 1 °C higher than body temperatures of the whelk Dicathais orbita and the barnacle Tesseropora rosea respectively. Among-microhabitat variation in each species 2 ̆ 7 temperature was equally as variable as differences among species within microhabitats. Daily maximal body temperatures of barnacles placed on southerly facing vertical rock surfaces were on average 2. 4 °C cooler than those on horizontal rock. Likewise, daily maximal body temperatures of whelks were on average 3. 1 °C cooler within shallow rock pools than on horizontal rock.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine empirically {{the market for}} local {{amenities}} in the Paris metropolitan region. We find first that there is considerable inequality in the spatial distribution of these local amenities, including accessibility, environmental and social indicators. We use a spatial representation and Lorenz curves to examine the degree of inequality in these amenities, and this provides evidence that some amenities (or disamenities) are much more inequitably distributed than others. The most extremely unequally distributed amenities are noise (due to its concentration near airports), “Redevelopment Areas”, presence of water (lakes and rivers) and forests, and presence of train and subway <b>stations.</b> Some <b>indicators,</b> such as the “Poulit accessibility ” measure, were by contrast remarkably constant over the region. We recognize that local amenities should be capitalized into the housing market, and explore the willingness to pay of households for these amenities within the Paris region using alternative specifications of a location choice model. One of the core questions we examine is the spatial scale of the amenity effects and how this is captured in a location choice context. By estimating models at both a commune and at a grid cell level, we obtain new insights into how households in the Paris region trade off amenities against each other and against housing cost. We find that the residential location choice model fits the data moderately better at the smaller scale of the grid cell compared to the commune...|$|R
40|$|Projects {{to expand}} the {{passenger}} rail network in the United States will connect major metropolitan areas over long distances, travelling through smaller communities along the way. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a concept for planning around stations to support transit and allow the development of dense, mixed use, walkable places. TOD literature focuses largely on developing around transit in metropolitan areas. Guidance for small towns and cities in rural areas is lacking. This thesis compares best planning practices from TOD literature to the planning practices of small cities located in rural areas of New England where new passenger rail service or a new station has been developed in the last fifteen years. The research focuses on planning efforts in the area within a half mile of the <b>station.</b> Two <b>indicators,</b> property values and ridership, were also used {{to determine if the}} service has impacted the area surrounding the station. The goal of the research is to determine how planning for rural stations differs from planning for TOD in metropolitan areas. Findings show that many of the best planning practices from the literature were applied in the small cities, though there were a few important differences. The station was included as part of broader development plans, rather than acting as a central focus of the plan. Additionally, it was found that stations should incorporate multiple uses to create activity throughout the day since train service is less frequent than in an urban setting...|$|R

40|$|Indicators {{evaluated}} {{from the}} long-term hourly averages of ozone volume fractions at air monitoring sites are proposed as {{measures of the}} photochemical pollution exposure at those sites. These indicators {{are based on the}} average of the daily maximum-to-minimum ratio during the period of maximum ozone production and are corrected a), for the average maximum to average total ozone ratio (indicator P 1) and b), for the number of hours the limit ozone volume ratio limit of 80 ppb was exceeded (indicator P 2). These indicators are then combined into P 3 as their geometrical mean. The rationale for the introduction of a new set of indicators is based on the suspicion that ozone volume fractions do not provide information either on the total daily ozone that is produced or on the fraction of it that has produced other photochemical pollution components despite that ozone correlates quite well with some of them. Unlike the European stations, where every case in excess of the 80 ppb limit occurs within the April to September "growth period", stations in the subtropics have longer periods (e. g. at Greater Baton Rouge (GBR), USA, for 2001 to 2008) are shifted towards later months June to November (e. g. the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China for 2006). While GBR and the rural PRD <b>stations</b> exhibit <b>indicators</b> close to those of polluted stations in northern Italy (Po Valley), the (sub) urban PRD stations have high photochemical pollution indicators. However, a surprisingly low indicator level occurs for the coastal Hong Kong stations for reasons possibly attributable to the prevailing easterly winds which bring fresh air and airborne sea-salt particulates.
