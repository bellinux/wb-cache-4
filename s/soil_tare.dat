50|$|Rhizoctonia can {{be found}} across {{all areas of the}} United States (environmental {{conditions}} permitting) where its host crops are located. The severity of infection can vary and for highly infected patches, severity of the infection can be very devastating to the farmer. Some of these consequences are major yield losses (from 25% to 100%), increased <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> (because the soil sticks to the fungus' mycelium), and poor industrial quality of the crops based on increased levels of sodium, potassium, and nitrogen. Due to the number of hosts that the pathogen attacks, these consequences are numerous and detrimental to a variety of crops. Sheath blight caused by this pathogen is the second-most devastating disease after rice blast.|$|E
40|$|High <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> {{of sugar}} beet on wet clay soil after {{uprooting}} with share lifters is usually {{attributed to the}} fact that the soil becomes sticky due to mechanical impact during uprooting. Results of field experiments have shown good potential for obtaining low <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> of sugar beet on wet clay soil by beet extraction with a high average vertical acceleration and a spiral extraction path with a small pitch. The objective of this research was to provide models for soil-beet-lifter systems used in these experiments, and to simulate some of the observed effects of the uprooting method on <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> and soil adherence. As the rootlet system plays an important role in the origination of <b>soil</b> <b>tare,</b> the rootlet system was also modelled. A constitutive soil model, assuming elastic-perfectly-plastic soil behaviour, was used as a basis for modelling soil-beet-lifter system variants, including beet with and without rootlets, uprooting by extraction, rotation and extrusion, and uprooting with low and high vertical acceleration. The origination of <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> is presented on the basis of the calculated zone of initial soil failure during extraction. Expected soil adherence is discussed in relation to the stress state of the soil. The simulated initial soil failure and stress state of the soil agreed well with experimental results on <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> and soil adherence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> {{of sugar}} beet from wet clay soils should {{be reduced to}} lower the cost and prevent some {{negative}} effects of <b>soil</b> <b>tare.</b> Commonly used share lifters press the soil onto the sugar beet and, thereafter, the soil adheres strongly to the beet and is difficult to remove from the beet by mechanical cleaning systems. With the objective to reduce adhering-soil tare and soil adherence, a grab lifter (extraction, three variants) and a driven rotary-shoe lifter were compared with a conventional driven polder share lifter in a field experiment on clay soil. <b>Soil</b> <b>tare</b> after quick extraction with a small-pitch, spiral motion was reduced {{by a factor of}} 3. 8 - 6. 2, depending on the wetness of the soil. Relative soil adherence was reduced by a factor of 1. 5. <b>Soil</b> <b>tare</b> after lifting with a driven rotary-shoe lifter was reduced by a factor of 3. 7, irrespective of the soil wetness. Relative soil adherence was not reduced. For both uprooting methods, dug losses were slightly higher and superficial beet damage was lower compared to share lifting. While complex engineering and crown fracture hinder practical application of grab lifting, the driven rotary-shoe lifter offers good potential for reduction of <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> in practice.

40|$|<b>Tare</b> <b>soil</b> is soil {{attached}} to harvested products like potato tubers. <b>Tare</b> <b>soil</b> becomes a considerable waste stream after storage, washing and processing of harvested products. There {{is a high}} risk on contamination of <b>tare</b> <b>soils</b> with (quarantine) phytopathogens, because of import of harvested products from {{different regions of the}} world. Disinfestation is necessary to make <b>tare</b> <b>soils</b> applicable for agricultural production. Anaerobic (non-chemical) soil disinfestation (ASD) and inundation are suitable methods to disinfest <b>tare</b> <b>soils.</b> Two different soils (marine loam and glacial sand) were either treated with five (2011) or four (2012) treatments and these were: (i) no treatment (control), (ii) freshly cut grass, (iii) Herbie 7025, (iv) inundation (five cm water on top of the soil surface), and (v) combination of Herbie 7025 and inundation (2011 only). Containers with treated and untreated soils were inoculated with two quarantine phytopathogens, Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 2 and Globodera pallida. After soil inoculation, the containers were airtight closed and only opened for destructive sampling after 84 days. Then, soils were analysed for the presence of R. solanacearum biovar 2, using immunofluorescence colony staining, and for the presence of viable G. pallida eggs, determined by the number of juveniles hatched from eggs and lured to potato root exudate. Strong (> 99. 4 %) declines of both pathogens in treated versus the appropriate control soils were observed. Repetition of the experiment revealed the same pattern and therefore it was concluded that ASD and inundation, as separate treatments, have promise for remediation of <b>tare</b> <b>soils</b> from contaminating quarantine pathogen...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to present the {{environmental}} quality of building materials after mid 1998, and to evaluate: - The applicability of building materials under conditions of the Building Material Decree, -The impact of the standards in the Decree on the (re) use of building materials. - The critical components and the extent to which they can be influenced. - Quality improvements compared to the ex-ante evaluation in 1997. - Problems encountered in practice. For this purpose, data on composition and leaching were collected and evaluated. The environmental quality was tested against the standards of the Building Material Decree. In general, data were evaluated for three heights: 0. 2, 0. 7, and 2. 0 meter. 98 - 99 % of the materials is in compliance with the Building Material Decree. The total reuse of building materials of about 141 Mton in 1997 has increased to 155 Mton in 2001. This is caused by a doubling of the reuse of granular secondary building materials, especially slightly polluted soils and aggregates of construction and demolition waste. 76 % of the total use of building materials are primary and 24 % are secondary building materials. There are considerable problems to meet the requirements of the Building Material Decree for the following materials: cleaned soil (antimony); MSWI bottom ash (copper, molybdenum); mine stone (antimony, selenium); aggregates of construction- and demolition waste (sulphate); dredge spoil (fluoride, sulphate); <b>tare</b> <b>soil</b> (mineral oil, DDD/DDE/DDT, aldrin/dieldrin/endrin) and clay (DDD/DDE/DDT, drins). General quality-related problems are intensified inspections induced by measurement dispersion and time, costs and quality of batch inspections...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{studies on}} {{cropland}} usually only consider water, wind and tillage erosion. However, {{significant amounts of}} soil may also be lost from the field during the harvest of crops such as sugar beet, potato, carrot and chicory root. During the harvest, soil adhering to the crop, loose soil or soil clods and stones are exported from the field together with these crops. This process of soil erosion is called soil losses due to crop harvesting or SLCH. In this study, interannual variability of SLCH for sugar beet in four west European countries, i. e., France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, was investigated for the last decades. Longterm (1978 - 2000) average SLCH values ranged between 5. 2 Mg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) (Germany) and 13. 8 Mg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) (France), while the minimum and maximum observed annual average SLCH values were 2. 0 and 20. 5 Mg ha(- 1) harvest, respectively. A {{large part of the}} temporal variability of annual average SLCH for sugar beet within a given country could be explained by the rainfall depth recorded during the harvesting season. However, due to efforts made by farmers and the processing industry SLCH appeared also to decrease over time during the last decade. Furthermore, significant differences in SLCH were found between the countries studied, which could only be partly explained by rainfall depth during the harvesting season. Other determining factors may be differences in soil types, harvesting technique, agronomic practices and crop yield. As SLCH values were derived from <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> data measured in sugar factories, differences could also be attributed to differences in post-harvesting cleaning, that lowers <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> but that does not {{have an effect on the}} true soil loss at the field plot where sugar beet was harvested. Given that SLCH contributes significantly to overall soil loss on cropland, more research is needed to fully understand the temporal and spatial variability of SLCH. Â© 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|During {{harvesting}} of crops, such as sugar beet, {{potatoes and}} chicory roots, considerable quantities of soil, consisting of adhering soil, soil clods and stones, are exported from cropland. This soil erosion process is called soil loss due to crop harvesting (SLCH). This study aimed {{to assess the}} variability in soil losses caused by potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) harvesting in Belgium and to investigate the role of weather conditions prior to the harvest and regional differences in soil texture on SLCH variability. To meet these objectives, more than 1000 <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> data measured at a potato -processing factory during the harvesting seasons of 1999, 2000 and 2001 were analysed. Soil loss was on an average 2. 2 t ha(- 1) per harvest but could be as large as 45 t ha(- 1) per harvest. The average soil losses per municipality were positively and exponentially related to the average content of soil particles < 16 mu m. This relationship was {{in close agreement with}} a previous field study on SLCH for potatoes in Belgium and could explain why measured soil loss values from a German study were larger than SLCH values for potatoes measured in Belgium. Weather conditions prior to harvest played only a minor role for SLCH variability. As a consequence, SLCH for potatoes harvested mechanically is more variable in space than in time. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{harvest of}} {{crops such as}} sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), leek (Allium porrum L.) and carrot (Daucus carota L.) causes soil loss from arable land because soil {{adhering}} to the crop and soil clods that failed to be separated by the harvesting machine, are exported from the field together with these harvested crops. These soil losses can be of the same order of magnitude as soil losses caused by water erosion processes, but are often neglected in soil erosion research. In this article we developed a methodology to investigate the spatial and long-term (1846 â 2004) variability of soil loss due to crop harvesting (SLCH) in Belgium and the spatial distribution {{of the importance of}} SLCH relative to soil losses caused by water erosion processes in Flanders. The study is based on long-term time series of <b>soil</b> <b>tare</b> data of crop processing factories and area and crop yield statistics. Until the middle of the 20 th century, potato and roots and tubers grown as second crop, had the largest share in the SLCH-crop growing area in Belgium. Sugar beet gained importance {{from the end of the}} 19 th century onwards and has now, of all SLCH crops, the largest growing area. We could estimate that, partly due to increasing crop yields and the mechanisation of the harvesting process, SLCH per hectare of cropland increased from 0. 4 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 in 1846 to 2. 4 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. Since then mean annual soil losses decreased again to 1. 8 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 in 2004. It was assessed that total yearly SLCH in Belgium rose from more than 575, 000 Mg in the middle of the 19 th century to more than 1. 7 - 106 Mg in the 1970 s and early 1980 s, while current SLCH values are 1. 4 - 106 Mg. We estimated that since 1846, more than 163 - 106 Mg soil was exported from cropland in Belgium through this erosion process, which corresponds to 109 hm 3 or an average soil profile truncation of 1. 15 cm. Average sediment export from cropland in Flanders was 3. 7 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 in 2002, of which 46 % was due to SLCH and 54 % was due to water erosion processes. The relative importance of SLCH varied, depending on the agricultural region, between 38 % and 94 %. status: publishe...|$|E
