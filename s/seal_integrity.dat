30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} effect of {{increasing}} the LCM concentration on the <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> at the different fracture width for both single LCM and mixtures. By increasing the concentration of nutshells from 15 to 50  ppb the <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> improved approximately 500  % (Fig.  3 a). For graphite and nutshells blend (Fig.  3 b), the <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> were improved when tested using TS 1 and TS 2 by 22 and 113  %, respectively.|$|R
30|$|From the plotted {{results of}} the three high {{concentrations}} (50  ppb) single LCM treatments shown in Fig.  2 a, nutshells resulted in higher <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> at the two fracture widths (up to 2200 psi) compared to graphite (449 psi) and sized calcium carbonate (589 psi). The same was observed for LCM mixtures shown in Fig.  2 b, where treatments containing nutshells and graphite (40  ppb) exhibited higher <b>sealing</b> <b>integrities</b> up to 2800 psi {{compared to the other}} blend containing graphite and sized calcium carbonate at higher concentration (80  ppb) for the two different fracture width (589 and 224 psi for TS 1 and TS 2, respectively). In general, as anticipated, increasing the fracture width resulted in weaker <b>seal</b> <b>integrities.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rollover {{structures}} are often associated by large river deltas, and are favorable traps for hydrocarbons. Trapping {{is dependent on}} top <b>seal</b> <b>integrity,</b> and favorable juxtaposition of sandstone reservoirs against impermeable shale across the normal faults that develop within the hanging wall.|$|E
50|$|Induced {{seismicity}} {{can also}} be caused by the injection of carbon dioxide as the storage step of carbon capture and storage, which aims to sequester carbon dioxide captured from fossil fuel production or other sources in earth’s crust {{as a means of}} climate change mitigation. This effect has been observed in Oklahoma and Saskatchewan. Though safe practices and existing technologies can be utilized {{to reduce the risk of}} induced seismicity due to injection of carbon dioxide, the risk is still significant if the storage is large in scale. The consequences of the induced seismicity could disrupt preexisting faults in the Earth’s crust as well as compromise the <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> of the storage locations.|$|E
40|$|Mike Dudbridge, {{author of}} the book 'Handbook of <b>Seal</b> <b>Integrity</b> for the Food Industry' {{discusses}} the problems of seal failure and best practice for maintaining <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> in food packaging operations. The perfect seal is one that carries out its function {{for the life of the}} product and both retains and protects the product to the desired level. The first step in seal management is to ensure that clear standards are set for the performance and testing of the seals being produced. The second step is to set up a testing system for seals. Robust methods of filling packs without contaminating the seal area are essential as seal contamination is the largest cause of <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> failures. The use and adherence to Standard Operating Procedures is important in the operation of sealing machines. Planned Preventive Maintenance (PPM) is essential to the performance of sealing machines. Training of machine operators and awareness by junior and middle management is vital if <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> performance is to be improved...|$|E
30|$|The {{variation}} in the <b>sealing</b> <b>integrities</b> under high temperatures suggests that LCM treatments should be evaluated at the expected formation temperature.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} investigation showed comparable trends {{where the}} <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> increased by increasing LCM concentration, {{which is in}} agreement with previous investigations.|$|R
30|$|To {{correlate}} the PSD with {{variation in}} the <b>seal</b> <b>integrities,</b> the <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> for each fracture width are plotted on the left y-axis versus the particle size distribution obtained from the dry sieve analysis on the right y-axis as shown in Figs.  4 and 5. It is clearly observed that the D 90 plays the most {{significant effect on the}} overall <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> where larger particle sizes resulted in enhancing the <b>seal</b> <b>integrities.</b> In other words, the D 90 value should be selected such that it matches the fracture width to ensure fracture sealing, which is in agreement with previous findings (Smith et al. 1996; Hands et al. 1998). The improved performance of treatments containing nutshells is attributed {{to the fact that the}} D 90 values of theses blends ranging between 1900 and 2400 microns are higher than the fracture widths (Figs.  4, 5). All LCM treatments having a D 90 that is smaller than the used fracture width failed to establish a seal within the fracture. Based on the results, it is recommended that the D 90 for any granular LCM treatment for a specific fracture width be equal or slightly larger than the expected fracture width.|$|R
30|$|Figure  6 shows a {{comparison}} between four tests, which were conducted at both room temperature and high temperature (HT) of 180  °F (82  °C). The <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> of graphite and calcium carbonate blend were not affected significantly by the high temperature, where a reduction from 584 to 537 psi (8  %) was observed. For both tests using graphite and nutshells treatments at 20 and 40  ppb, {{a reduction in the}} <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> was observed at 180  °F by 11 and 30.5  %, respectively. However, when a 50  ppb nutshell only was tested at higher temperature, an increase in the <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> from 755 to 1164 psi (54  %) was observed (Fig.  6).|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} granular LCMs {{in terms of}} their <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> was carried out using pumpable LCM sizes in order to push the envelope of using LCM in sealing wide fractures thus cutting the time required to mitigate losses. The effect of LCM type, concentration, particle size distribution (PSD), temperature, and LCM shape on the formed <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> was investigated. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} address the effectiveness of LCM treatments in sealing fractured shales, with specific application to the Barents Sea overburden.|$|E
40|$|Adhesives were {{evaluated}} {{to determine if}} they qualify for application to hybrid microcircuit packages. The effort consisted of the following: (1) seal gold-plated Kovar packages with selective adhesives and determine <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> after exposure to temperature humidity environments; (2) seal both gold-plated Kovar and ceramic packages with the four best adhesives identified in (1) and determine <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> after exposure to MIL-STD- 883 A test environments; and (3) subject the best adhesive identified in (2) to a 60 C/ 98 % RH environment and determine susceptibility to moisture permeation.

30|$|Based on both optical {{microscopy}} and SEM images, the low sphericity and angularity of nutshell particles resulted in maintaining higher <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> compared to graphite and calcium carbonate.|$|R
30|$|From {{hydraulic}} fracturing application, proppant with high sphericity and roundness {{will result in}} higher fracture conductivity (Cutler et al. 1985). However, the main objective of LCM treatment {{is to reduce the}} fracture conductivity by forming an impermeable seal within the fracture that prevents further fluid losses into the formation. Based on the qualitative analysis of LCM particles, the angularity and low sphericity of nutshells resulted in higher <b>seal</b> <b>integrities</b> (up to 2800 psi) due to the low permeability of the formed seal. On the contrary, the high sphericity of both graphite and calcium carbonate, resulted in relatively higher seal permeability and thus lower <b>seal</b> <b>integrities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Wells drilled through low-permeable caprock are {{potential}} {{connections between the}} CO 2 storage reservoir and overlying sensitive targets like aquifers and targets located at the surface. The long term well <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity</b> is therefore essential for the fluids confinements. In this work, we propose to develop an integrated framework constituted by field experiment, laboratory characterization and modeling {{in order to get}} better insights into the conditions of a good well <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity</b> on the long term scale. Our work is carried out {{within the context of the}} EU-FP 7 project UltimateCO 2 (Understanding the Long Term fate of geologically stored CO 2) led by BRGM and dedicated to the long term fate of CO 2 focusing on several physical processes. A field experiment is thus being currently set-up in the underground rock laboratory of Mont-Terri (St Ursanne, canton of Jura, Switzerland) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in the <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> for nutshells when used in single LCM treatment at high temperature is attributed to the swelling of nutshell particles, which was quantified experimentally.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{was made to}} determine the feasibility of using adhesive package sealing for hybrid microcircuits. Major effort consisted of: (1) surveying representative hybrid manufacturers to assess the current use of adhesives for package sealing; (2) making a cost comparison of metallurgical versus adhesive package sealing; (3) determining the <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> of gold plated flatpack type packages sealed with selected adhesives, thermal shock, temperature cycling, mechanical shock, and constant acceleration test environments; and (4) defining a more comprehensive study to continue the evaluation of adhesives for package sealing. Results showed that 1. 27 cm square gold plated flatpack type packages sealed with the film adhesives and the paste adhesive retained their <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> after all tests, and that similarly prepared 2. 54 cm square packages retained their <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> after all tests except the 10, 000 g's constant acceleration test. It is concluded that these results are encouraging, {{but by no means}} sufficient to establish the suitability of adhesives for sealing high reliability hybrid microcircuits...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeterogeneity in mudstone/shale layers has {{significant}} effects on <b>seal</b> <b>integrity.</b> The presence of intra-layer sandstone channels in a seal layer may allow the buoyant CO 2 {{to escape from}} the reservoir, even if the globally- averaged permeability of the seal layer seems sufficiently low. We carried out numerical simulations to study the effects of seal discontinuity on the long-term behaviour of CO 2 injected into deep saline aquifers. The results indicate that properties of such channels becomes key factors of <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> and following mass phase distribution of CO 2 trapped by startigraphic, dissolution, and residual gas mechanism, if present in a seal...|$|E
30|$|Since {{the only}} {{variable}} that was {{changed with the}} fluid density is the increase of the barite particles within the mixture, {{it is believed that}} barite particles affect/improve the <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity.</b> From the flattened increase of sealing pressure from 12.5 to 16.5  ppg (Fig.  4) it appears that there might be an optimum point where the proper size-distributed particles in the system are just right to fill the sealing structure’s pore spaces. The LCM performance will not improve beyond that point.|$|R

Two common blends consisting of class H cement and pozzolan/cement ratios of 35 : 65 and 65 : 35 were studied under CO 2 exposure conditions of 2200 psi and 50  ∘C. Although the rate of chemical reaction is significantly greater than with neat cement paste, the alteration of physical properties {{is not sufficient to}} compromise <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity</b> under the conditions of the experiments...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} results of the Phase 1 acceptance test of the 241 -SY- 101 Flexible Receiver System (FRS). This acceptance test consisted of a pressure-decay/leak test of the containment bag to verify that the seams {{along the length of the}} bag had been adequately <b>sealed.</b> The <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity</b> of the FRS must be verified to ensure that the release of waste and aerosols will be minimized during the removal of the test mixer pump from Tank 241 -SY- 101. The FRS is one of six major components of the Equipment Removal System, which has been designed to retrieve, transport, and store the mixer pump. This acceptance test was performed at Lancs Industries in Kirkland, Washington on January 17, 1995. The bag temperature-compensated pressure loss of 575 Pa was below the acceptance criteria of 625 Pa and the test results were therefore found to be acceptable. The bag manufacturer estimates that 80 [...] 90 % of the pressure loss is attributed to leakage around the bag inflation valve where the pressure gage was connected. A leak detector was applied over the entire bag during the pre-tests and no leakage was found. Furthermore, the leak rate corresponding to this pressure loss is very small when compared to the acceptable leak rate of the completely assembled FRS. The <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity</b> of the assembled FRS is verified in Phase 3 testing...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seal</b> <b>integrity</b> {{is vital}} in food supply chains with modern methods of food {{retailing}} and {{a requirement for}} very high levels of consumer satisfaction. Robust packages are {{an important factor in}} food preservation, consumer confidence in the product as well as waste minimisation and cost control throughout the system. The Handbook of <b>Seal</b> <b>Integrity</b> in the Food Industry is aimed at people working in food supply chains and associated industries from packing machine operators to quality managers and from retail technical staff to packaging machine designers and maintenance engineers. This well illustrated and comprehensively indexed handbook paints a complete picture of all of the factors that operate together in the creation of food packages with high performing seals. A comprehensive review of the reasons for poor <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> is included along with suggestions for improvements in maintenance, machine set up and operation. Seal testing systems are featured along with management techniques to ensure a high level of performance and consistency in your business and a right first time approach within packaging systems. The design and operation of the main types of sealing system is reviewed for rigid, semi rigid and flexible packaging systems along with an overview of packing materials such as thermoplastics. Finally the handbook looks at innovations in the packaging of food products with a view of developments in packaging materials, sealing systems and on-line <b>seal</b> <b>integrity</b> measurement and monitoring systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations to determine how process settings and crimp geometry affect the <b>seal</b> strength and <b>integrity</b> of traditional polyolefin and biopolymer flexible packaging materials. The results show agreement with previous studies where temperature and dwell time are found to be the dominant factors for both polyolefin and biopolymer films. Pressure and crimp geometry are shown to be secondary factors in the process, up to the point of squeezing the film into molecular contact. In general it is shown that biopolymers exhibit similar sealing characteristics to more traditional films. In respect of the sealing crimp geometry it is shown that the crimp pitch has little or no effect on <b>sealing</b> <b>integrity</b> for films with gauges between 25 µm and 40 µm. But, for the same gauge material, crimp angles greater than 80 ° offer the greatest potential to gain higher seal strengths. It is further shown that with the cellulose and PLA films tested, a higher seal strength can be produced with crimp pitches of 2 mm and lower. Also presented are some more general implications for guiding the selection of sealing crimp geometry and their usage with biopolymers...|$|R
