I know he was very eminent, and that's all. Things of this sort grow.

60|$|The {{house was}} neat and well appointed, and Doctor Ripley was shown by a smart maid into a dapper little consulting-room. As he passed in he noticed {{two or three}} parasols and a lady's sun-bonnet hanging in the hall. It was a pity that his {{colleague}} should be a married man. It would put them upon a different footing, and interfere with those long evenings of high scientific talk which he had pictured to himself. On the other hand, there was much in the consulting-room to please him. Elaborate instruments, seen more often in hospitals than in the houses of private practitioners, were scattered about. A <b>sphygmograph</b> stood upon the table and a gasometer-like engine, which was new to Doctor Ripley, in the corner. A bookcase full of ponderous volumes in French and German, paper-covered for the most part, and varying in tint from the shell to the yolk of a duck's egg, caught his wandering eyes, and he was deeply absorbed in their titles {{when the door opened}} suddenly behind him. Turning round, he found himself facing a little woman, whose plain, palish face was remarkable only for a pair of shrewd, humorous eyes of a blue which had two shades too much green in it. She held a pince-nez in her left hand, and the doctor's card in her right.|$|E
60|$|Just {{so do we}} find a {{crowd of}} petty vivisectionists daily {{committing}} atrocities and stupidities, {{because it is the}} custom to do so. Vivisection is customary as part of the routine of preparing lectures in medical schools. For instance, there are two ways of making the action of the heart visible to students. One, a barbarous, ignorant, and thoughtless way, is to stick little flags into a rabbit's heart and let the students see the flags jump. The other, an elegant, ingenious, well-informed, and instructive way, is to put a <b>sphygmograph</b> on the student's wrist and let him see a record of his heart's action traced by a needle on a slip of smoked paper. But it has become the custom for lecturers to teach from the rabbit; and the lecturers are not original enough to get out of their groove. Then there are the demonstrations which are made by cutting up frogs with scissors. The most humane man, however repugnant the operation may be to him at first, cannot do it at lecture after lecture for months without finally--and that very soon--feeling no more for the frog than if he were cutting up pieces of paper. Such clumsy and lazy ways of teaching are based on the cheapness of frogs and rabbits. If machines were as cheap as frogs, engineers would not only be taught the anatomy of machines and the functions of their parts: they would also have machines misused and wrecked before them so that they might learn as much as possible by using their eyes, and as little as possible by using their brains and imaginations. Thus we have, as part of the routine of teaching, a routine of vivisection which soon produces complete indifference to it on the part even of those who are naturally humane. If they pass on from the routine of lecture preparation, not into general practice, but into research work, they carry this acquired indifference with them into the laboratory, where any atrocity is possible, because all atrocities satisfy curiosity. The routine man is in the majority in his profession always: consequently the moment his practice is tracked down to its source in human passion there is a great and quite sincere poohpoohing from himself, from the mass of the profession, and from the mass of the public, which sees that the average doctor is much too commonplace and decent a person to be capable of passionate wickedness of any kind.|$|E

50|$|The article {{reviews the}} {{evolution}} of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure measurement (CNAP). The historical gap between ease of use, but intermittent upper arm instruments and bulky, but continuous “pulse writers” (<b>sphygmographs)</b> is discussed starting with the first efforts to measure pulse, published by Jules Harrison in 1835. Such <b>sphygmographs</b> led a shadowy existence in the past, while Riva Rocci’s upper arm blood pressure measurement started its triumphant success over 100 years ago. In recent times, CNAP measurement introduced by Jan Penáz in 1973 enabled the first recording of noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure resulting in marketed products such as the Finapres™ device and its successors. Recently, a novel method for CNAP monitoring has been designed for patient monitoring in perioperative, critical and emergency care, where blood pressure needs to be measured repeatedly or even continuously to facilitate the best care for patients.|$|R
40|$|The problem: To {{develop an}} {{instrument}} that will provide an external (indirect) measurement of arterial blood pressure {{in the form of}} an easily interpreted graphic trace that can be correlated with standard clinical blood-pressure measurements. From sphygmograms produced by conventional <b>sphygmographs,</b> it is very difficult to differentiate the systolic and diastolic blood-pressure pulses and to correlate these indices with the standard clinical values. It is nearly impossible to determine these indices when the subject is under physical or emotional stress. The solution: An electronic blood-pressure system, basically similar to conventional ausculatory sphygmomanometers, employing a standard occluding cuff, a gas-pressure source, and a gas-pressure regulator and valve. An electrical output transducer senses cuff pressure, and a microphone positioned on the brachial artery under the occluding cuff monitors the Korotkoff sounds from this artery. The output signals present the conventional systolic and diastolic indices in a clear, graphical display. The complete system also includes an electronic timer and cycle-control circuit...|$|R

5000|$|One {{year after}} Riva-Rocci’s findings, Leonard Erskine Hill and Harold Barnard {{reported}} blood pressure monitoring during anesthesia {{for the first}} time. Their almost concurrently invented devices consisted of a narrow armlet to occlude the brachial artery, a small bicycle-type metal pump and a metal manometer graduated in mmHg. It seems surprising that the first report of blood pressure monitoring during anesthesia {{did not mention the}} use of <b>sphygmographs,</b> which had already been in common use at this time [...] One reason might be that the former practice totally relied on the observation of breathing as the sole method of monitoring; even the palpation of pulse during ether or chloroform administration was not recognized as a good practice. Another reason may be found directly in the title of the report: “A simple and accurate form of sphygmometer or arterial pressure gauge contrived for clinical use” - implying that for clinical use the device must be simple and accurate.|$|R

50|$|In 1867, aged 18, Mahomed {{began to}} study {{medicine}} at the Sussex County Hospital, Brighton. Two years later in October 1869, he entered Guy's Hospital, London as a medical student. He was an outstanding student and, in 1871, won the student Pupils' Physical Society prize {{for his work on}} the <b>sphygmograph,</b> having been runner-up the previous year.|$|E
50|$|The {{device was}} {{a system of}} levers hooked to a scale-pan in which weights were placed to {{determine}} the amount of external pressure needed to stop blood flow in the radial artery. Although the instrument was cumbersome and its measurements imprecise, the basic concept of Vierordt's <b>sphygmograph</b> eventually led to the blood pressure cuff used today.|$|E
5000|$|Marey {{started by}} {{studying}} blood circulation {{in the human}} body. Then he shifted to analyzing heart beats, respiration, muscles (myography), and movement of the body. To aid his studies he developed many instruments for precise measurements. For example, in 1859, {{in collaboration with the}} physiologist Auguste Chauveau and the watch manufacturer Breguet, he developed a wearable <b>Sphygmograph</b> to measure the pulse. This <b>sphygmograph</b> was an improvement on an earlier and more cumbersome design by the German physiologist Karl von Vierordt. [...] In 1869 Marey constructed a very delicate artificial insect to show how an insect flies and to demonstrate the figure-8 shape it produced during movement of its wings. Then he became fascinated by movements of air and started to study bigger flying animals, like birds. He adopted and further developed animated photography into a separate field of chronophotography in the 1880s. His revolutionary idea was to record several phases of movement on one photographic surface. In 1890 he published a substantial volume entitled Le Vol des Oiseaux (The Flight of Birds), richly illustrated with photographs, drawings, and diagrams. He also created stunningly precise sculptures of various flying birds.|$|E
5000|$|Vierordt {{developed}} {{techniques and}} tools for the monitoring of blood circulation. He {{is credited with}} the construction of an early [...] "hemotachometer", an apparatus for monitoring the velocity of blood flow. In 1854, he created a device called a <b>sphygmograph,</b> a mechanism consisting of weights and levers used to estimate blood pressure, and considered to be a forerunner of the modern sphygmomanometer. One of his better known written works was a treatise on the arterial pulse, titled Die Lehre vom Arterienpuls in gesunden und kranken Zuständen.|$|E
50|$|On {{diseases}} {{of the nervous system}} Anstie wrote several memoirs, and finally in 1871 a book on Neuralgia and the Diseases which resemble it. He also contributed an article on the same subject to Sir John Russell Reynolds's System of Medicine. The views which he expounded in both works were to a large extent original, and doubtless open to criticism; but many of his observations are of permanent value. In 1867 he gave two lectures at the College of Physicians on the <b>sphygmograph,</b> a mechanical device used to measure blood pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Besides Marey's <b>sphygmograph,</b> {{a device}} {{developed}} by the Austrian Samuel von Basch attracted attention and was introduced in Europe in 1880 [...] A fluid filled bladder placed on the wrist was able to detect pulse; the pressure, which was necessary for {{the disappearance of the}} pulses, was measured with a mercury manometer. This allowed the first measurement of systolic blood pressure. Several other sphygmographs were developed in the late 19th century, especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. These instruments were portable, reasonably accurate and widely available, so physicians even used them at the bedside.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his early}} studies Mackenzie used Riva-Rocci's <b>sphygmograph</b> to {{graphically}} record the pulse.

In 1890 he discovered premature ventricular contractions and use of the polygraph enabled Mackenzie to make original distinctions between harmless and dangerous types of pulse irregularities (arrhythmias).

50|$|The {{study of}} {{physiological}} methods for deception tests measuring emotional disturbances {{began in the}} early 1900s. Benussi was the first to work on practical deception tests based on physiological changes. He detected changes in inspiration-expiration ratio—findings confirmed by N.E. Burtt. Burtt conducted studies that emphasized the changes in quantitative systolic blood-pressure. William Moulton Marston studied blood-pressure and noted increase in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or over indicated guilt through using the tycos sphygmomanometer, with which he reported 90-100% accuracy. His studies used students and actual court cases. Then in 1913 W.M. Marston determined systolic blood-pressure by oscillatory methods and his findings cite definite changes in blood pressure during the deception of criminal suspects. In 1921, John Augustus Larson criticized Marston's intermittent blood pressure method because emotional changes were so brief they could be lost. To adjust for this he modified the Erlanger <b>sphygmograph</b> to give a continuous blood pressure and pulse curve and used it to study 4,000 criminals.|$|E

On {{the dynamics of}} technological change in medicine, designed his model {{for the development of}} twentieth century imaging devices. The development of instruments, according to Blume, is divided into four stages: exploration; development, diffusion, evaluation and assessment, and feedback. The central question in this article is whether Blume's model {{can be applied to the}} nineteenth century context of the increasing u. se of diagnostic instruments, related to the '. scientification' of medicine. A case study of the <b>sphygmograph</b> shows that in the nineteenth century a considerable overlap in time can be found between the different stages. Nevertheless, most of the characteristics of these stages do correspond to the nineteenth century situation. Therefore it is suggested to replace the stages model with a spiraled model, in which four elements of development play a part: new ideas, experiments, construction of prototypes and publication of the results. Besides, the different whirls should not be subdivided according to the disciplines in which the technique was used, but with reference to the amount of specialisation occuring around the instrument. The development would then be described from an amateur's workshop to respectively an experimental physiological laboratory, an instrumentmaker's workshop, and an experimental medical practitioner. Subsequently the level changes to that of an established laboratory, a commercial producer and a more or less specialised medical practice. Through these stages other long-term constituent processes take place. Advantage of this model is that its basic categories - ideas, experiments, construction of prototypes, publication of results - can be extended with subcategories at any level if the social situation demands this...|$|E

The potential effects of school-based health intervention programmes on cardiovascular risk and surrogate markers are unclear, as only few studies have attempted to investigate a complete risk profile including a detailed laboratory analysis or micro- and macrovascular function. In this study a comprehensive school-based randomized intervention programme will be investigated in 10 - 14 -year old children addressing the influence of lifestyle intervention on inactivity, cardiometabolic risk factors and early signs of vascular disease. Methods/Design 15 secondary schools in Southern Germany are randomly assigned to intervention or control schools. Children {{in the fifth grade}} (10 - 11 years) will be observed over four years. The study combines a school-based with a home-based approach, aiming at children, teachers and parents. The main components are weekly lifestyle-lessons for children, taught by regular classroom teachers to increase physical activity in- and outside of school, to improve eating patterns at school and at home, to reduce media consumption and to amplify well-being. In 4 - 6 annual meetings, teachers receive information about health-related topics with worksheets for children and supporting equipment, accounting for school-specific needs and strategies. Parents' trainings are provided on a regular basis. All examinations are performed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} every school year. Anthropometry includes measurements of BMI, waist and upper arm circumferences, skinfold thickness as well as peripheral blood pressure. Blood sampling includes lipid parameters, insulin, glucose, hsCRP, adiponectin, and IL- 6 as well as testosteron and estrogen to determine maturation status. Vascular function is non-invasively assessed by measuring arterial stiffness in large arteries using a <b>sphygmograph</b> and by analysing arteriolar and venular diameters in the retinal microcirculation using a non-mydriatric vessel analyser. A questionnaire is filled out to determine daily physical activity, motivational factors, dietary habits, quality of life (KINDL-R) and socio-economic data. Physical fitness is assessed by a six-item test battery.

No cases of clinical postscarlatinal nephritis have been included. Particu-lar interest centers in the period from 8 to 30 days after the onset of infection. LITERATURE As early as 1874 Mahomed (1) found that scarlet fever convalescents, at some period during the six weeks after defervescence, exhibited a pulse of high tension (<b>sphygmograph)</b> and hemoglobinuria (guaiac test) without albuminuria (nitric acid test). If the tension was high and persisted, albumin was liable to appear. Occasionally there was anorexia with slight fever (1000 F.) and sometimes a little edema was evident upon careful examination, but as a rule, there were no constitutional symptoms or signs. He called this picture the "prealbuminuric stage of nephritis. " Thompson (2), in 1886, examined the urine for blood and albumin three times a day for 56 days in 180 cases of scarlet fever. Eighty-four per cent of the patients were under 15 years. In 66 cases (37 per cent) there were no urinary changes. Two cases (1 per cent) showed anasarca without urinary changes, and in 112 (62 per cent) the urine showed albumin, blood, or both, with or without edema. Thompson calls all of these 112 cases " nephritis, " but "in some cases, the evidence of kidney mischief was so slight and evanescent that but for careful and frequent testing, the presence of these substances, would no doubt, have been overlooked. " Thompson also found, at times, a positive guaiac test with no albumin, but thought the "pre-albuminuric stage " of nephritis was infrequent.

30|$|One {{of these}} pulses is the radial pulse. A {{diagnosis}} method {{relying on the}} radial pulse signals detected by physician fingers {{can be traced back}} to 500 BC in China [2]. The first mechanical device can measure the arterial pressure waveform at radial called <b>sphygmograph</b> which was developed and improved in the nineteenth century [3]. Later, more and more researchers studied into this area, and different kinds of devices to measure the radial pulse wave were investigated. Nowadays, there are various commercial pressure waveform measurement devices developed by different companies and groups. These devices generally use technologies like RF-signal of an ultrasound, applanation tonometry, photoplethysmography, piezoelectric sensor, oscillometric, mechanotransducer, and volume plethysmography [4]. However, most of these sensing devices are only capable of measuring the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate [5]. The typical calibration for them is only a static process that relies on several discrete reference values from the cuff-based blood pressure sensors [5],[6]. This results in most of them could not achieve radial pulse details and dynamic behaviors that contain rich physiological and pathological information reflecting cardiovascular disease and vessel aging. In addition, most of devices are not cost effective and are unwearable, and this limits them to be extensively used for continuously monitoring the pulse signals of users. Without continuously monitoring the signals, the history of health condition related to cardiovascular diseases cannot be recovered for helping the diagnosis process and certain important physiological and pathological characteristics may be generally missed. For example, some characteristics from the pulses are significant during the intense exercise or the sleeping time due to the heavy load of the cardiovascular system and increasing of the blood viscosity; however, they may be lost without wearing a portable pulse sensor that has continuous monitoring capability. Recently, some research work also mentioned that continuous monitoring of the pulses will help to prevent the varied cardiovascular diseases at the early stage as well as to alarm users when the pulse signals become singular so as to avoid the situations like stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden death [2],[7]. In prospect of the increase in demand, developing a low-cost, wearable pulse sensor that can offer real-time continuous monitoring, immunizes mechanical and electronic noises, as well as displays some basic diagnostic results is becoming one of the most popular research topics in this area [5],[6].|$|E

The recording of radial pressure pulse at Chun, Guan and Chy positions were further analyzed. In this study, 103 subjects including 39 controls, 33 dyspepsias and 31 rhinitis were diagnosed by Chinese medicine practitioner. Every subject was recorded 6 seconds of radial arterial pulse at Chun, Guan and Chy positions on both hands. Then the numerical methods of Fourier transform, filter, and fitting were employed to analysis the data and 4 parameters of a, b, x 0,and y 0 were induced. The four parameters were adopted to calculate the area between graph and horizontal axis without the effect of y 0. Each parameter's outliers were removed by the criterion of the group mean ±three times the standard deviation. These five indicators (a, b, x 0, y 0, and area) were analyzed by ANOVA. The parameter has no effect on the result at significant level α = 0. 01. The different positions with the other four parameters were analyzed and discussed by ANOVA and Tukey's test. At significant level α = 0. 01, parameter b and x 0 cannot distinguish the difference between normal, dyspepsia and rhinitis, nevertheless, at right Guan, dyspepsia and rhinitis' values of a and area are higher than normal's, and the rhinitis' values of a and area are higher than dyspepsia's at left Chun. 中醫雖然有一套完整的診斷與治療的方法，不過診治上主要還是憑藉中醫師本身的經驗與判斷，顯得過於主觀。在近代中醫脈診科學化的研究上，使用脈診儀量測受試者橈動脈上的寸、關、尺等三個位置，並應用各種數值分析方法針對脈波圖進行研究探討。 本實驗對象共 103 名，其中 39 名受測者經中醫師診斷為身體機能正常， 33 名為胃病， 31 名為鼻病。每位受試者均擷取左右手的寸、關、尺一共六個位置的脈搏波，擷取 6 秒的脈波進行傅利葉轉換、濾波、數據擬合進而獲得a、b、x 0 、y 0 四個參數。每個參數均使用平均值±三倍標準差的標準將離群值刪除，而每組資料均可計算出去除y 0 影響後與橫軸相圍的面積。 將a、b、x 0 、y 0 、面積等五個指標進行ANOVA分析，在α= 0. 01 的顯著水準之下可以發現y 0 對實驗結果並無影響。對其餘四個指標與不同部位分別進行ANOVA分析，並使用Tukey’s test對有顯著差異的位置與參數進行探討。由結果可知在α= 0. 01 的顯著水準之下，參數b與x 0 無法進一步分辨受試者是屬於身體機能正常、胃病或是鼻病。參數a和面積則是在右關處可以發現，鼻病、胃病的受試者的數值均高於身體機能正常的人，在左寸位置則是鼻病患者的數值會顯著高於胃病患者。摘要	i Abstract	ii 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 2 第二章 文獻探討	 3 2 - 1 中醫四診	 3 2 - 2 中醫切診	 4 2 - 2 - 2 中醫切診的理論與意義	 6 2 - 3 脈象的生成	 8 2 - 3 - 1 中醫對脈象產生的認識	 8 2 - 3 - 2 橈動脈脈搏波的形成	 9 2 - 3 - 3 用駐波觀點研究脈和脈象的產生機制	 9 2 - 4 脈診儀	 12 2 - 4 - 1 中醫脈診指法	 12 2 - 5 - 2 脈診儀原理	 13 2 - 5 脈診的科學性	 15 2 - 5 - 1 寸、關、尺不同位置所得到的訊息不同	 15 2 - 5 - 2 脈波圖的時域分析	 17 2 - 5 - 3 脈波圖的頻域分析	 20 2 - 5 - 3 - 1 低頻部分的頻域分析	 21 2 - 5 - 3 - 2 高頻部分的頻域分析	 23 2 - 5 - 4 其它分析方法應用於解讀脈波訊號	 25 第三章 材料與方法	 26 3 - 1 實驗對象	 26 3 - 2 實驗儀器設備	 26 3 - 3 實驗方法與步驟	 27 3 - 4 數據分析方法	 27 3 - 4 - 1 傅利葉轉換與濾波	 27 3 - 4 - 3 去除變異過大的離群值(outlier) 	 29 3 - 4 - 4 統計分析	 29 3 - 4 - 5 Tukey’s test	 30 第四章 結果與討論	 32 4 - 1 去除離群值	 32 4 - 3 參數a與不同感測位置的關係探討	 34 4 - 3 - 1 ANOVA分析	 34 4 - 3 - 2 使用Tukey’s test 對ANOVA結果進行分析	 35 4 - 4 參數b與不同感測位置的關係探討	 36 4 - 4 - 1 ANOVA分析	 36 4 - 4 - 2 使用Tukey’s test 對ANOVA結果進行分析	 37 4 - 5 參數 與不同感測位置的關係探討	 38 4 - 5 - 1 ANOVA分析	 38 4 - 5 - 2 使用Tukey’s test 對ANOVA結果進行分析	 39 4 - 6 數據的波形與橫軸所圍之面積與不同感測位置的關係探討	 39 4 - 6 - 1 ANOVA分析	 39 4 - 6 - 2 使用Tukey’s test 對ANOVA結果進行分析	 40 第五章 結論與建議	 42 5 - 1 結論	 42 5 - 2 建議	 43 第六章 參考文獻	 44 附錄一	 4...|$|E
40|$|Surviving source {{materials}} {{relating to}} education in 19 th-century regional medical schools (igakkō) are rare, partly because {{a lack of}} interest among following generations, and partly because of the short life span of many of those institutions. Ōe Okuji’s (1864 – 1919) ancestors served as physicians in the domain of Nakatsu for more than 150 years. His father, Untaku (1822 – 1899), a widely respected man with many disciples, successfully switched from Sino–Japanese to Western-style medicine during those dramatic decades of the late Tokugawa era. Having grown up {{in the early years of}} the Meiji Restoration, Okuji was the first in his family to receive a Western-style education, at the Ōita Prefectural Medical School, from which he graduated in 1886. Some of his books and lecture notes are held by the Ōe Medical Archive (Nakatsu), to which one of the items is unique. This is copy of a manuscript entitled “Illustrated Physical Diagnosis – Illustrations” (Shindan zusetsu – zufu). The accompanying booklet “Illustrated Physical Diagnosis” (Shindan zusetsu) was published in 1879 by Yoshimatsu Bunji. While the first volume of Yoshimatsu’s print can be found in two libraries, the second volume containing the illustrations has vanished. Had Yoshimatsu’s work simply been a translation of the foreign book the “Manual of Physical Diagnosis” published in 1878 in New York by the pathologist Francis Delafield (as is suggested by Yoshimatsu’s title), this disappearance would not be a problem. However, being well aware of Delafield’s shortcomings, Yoshimatsu added extensive explanations, each of which covered almost half a page. Furthermore, comparing Ōe’s copy with Delafield’s manual reveals that Yoshimatsu produced a completely new set of illustrations. Yoshimatsu started with so-called anatomical “fugitive sheets” taken from Delafield’s book. These superimposed hinged flaps enable readers to observe the interior of a human body as if they were conducting a dissection. The earliest examples of such sheets occurred in European books during the early 16 th century. Around 1680, a copy of the Dutch edition of Johannes Remmelin’s famous “Catoptrum microcosmicum” arrived in Nagasaki. For decades, handmade copies circulated among Japanese physicians until a copy was printed as the “Dutch Anatomical Atlas of the Whole Body” (Oranda zenku naigai bungō-zu) in 1772, shortly before publication of the epoch-making “New Book on Anatomy” (Kaitai shinsho). Hence, physicians in 19 th-century Japan were already familiar with this kind of anatomical representation. Delafield’s manual contains only a set of superimposed flaps, but Yoshimatsu extends it by producing a series of pictures showing the location of organs and certain abnormalities. He also includes drawings of several types of stethoscopes, a spirometer, a cyrtometer, a stethogoniometer, a stethometer, and Étienne-Jules Marey’s famous <b>sphygmograph.</b> Most of these diagnostic instruments were recent inventions and their depiction added greatly to the practical value of Yoshimatsu’s booklet. The early years of the Meiji government greatly affected everyone involved in medicine. However, elements of tradition facilitated the adoption of new concepts relating to the human body and illness and treatment, and also stimulated the involvement of the authorities in questions of medical education and practice. Although revolutionary in content, Yoshimatsu’s publication also exhibits traits of Japan’s long tradition of absorbing foreign knowledge. Eleven years after the government decided to suppress traditional medicine in favor of the Western medical paradigm, Yoshimatsu did what Japanese physicians had been doing since they first encountered “Dutch medicine” in the 1650 s: he collected more information, and critically assessed new knowledge from abroad before using it to revise his text. The young student Ōe Okuji had his own ways of coping with difficult circumstances. Because of substantial cultural obstacles to the dissection of human corpses in Japan, he had limited opportunities to observe an autopsy during his years in Ōita. Therefore, he used printed materials to make anatomical drawings. Motivated by Yoshimatsu’s illustrations, Ōe recreated his figurative sheets with great accuracy. His finished copy was bound at a local branch of the famous book dealer Murakami Kanbei (Kyōto). Ōe was undoubtedly proud of the work to which he impressively dedicated much time and effort that he would not easily have forgotten...|$|E
