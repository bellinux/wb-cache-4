40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} intraocular pressure (IOP) in porcine eyes during femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery using a liquid-optic interface system. Materials and methods: Femtosecond laser cataract surgery with the Catalys™ was performed on freshly enucleated porcine eyes in Oftalvist Moncloa, Madrid, Spain. Capsulorhexis and lens fragmentation were completed in all the eyes without complications. IOP was measured with a reusable blood pressure transducer connected by direct cannulation to the anterior chamber, recording data before suction (basal), {{at the beginning of}} the <b>suction</b> <b>phase,</b> every five seconds during femtosecond procedure and after the removal of the suction ring from the eye. Results: Nine porcine eyes were used in this study. Basal IOP before suction was 5. 67 [*]±[*] 2. 39 [*]mmHg, rising to 20. 33 [*]±[*] 4. 18 [*]mmHg {{at the beginning of the}} <b>suction</b> <b>phase</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). During femtosecond procedure, pressure reached a value of 19. 74 [*]±[*] 4. 31 [*]mmHg, remaining stable during the entire process.

40|$|The {{transition}} and separation {{processes of the}} boundary layer developing on a flat plate under a prescribed adverse pressure gradient typical ofUltra-High-Lift low-pressure turbine profiles have been investigated, with and without {{the application of a}} synthetic jet (zero net mass flow rate jet). A mechanical piston has been adopted to produce an intermittent flow with zero net mass flow rate. The capability of the device to suppress or reduce the large laminar separation bubble occurring under steady inflow condition at low Reynolds numbers has been experimentally investigated by means of hot-wire measurements. Wall static pressure measurements complement the hot-wire time-resolved velocity results. The paper reports the investigations performed for both steady and controlled conditions. The active device is able to control the laminar separation bubble induced at low Reynolds number conditions by the strong adverse pressure gradient. An overall view of the timedependent evolution of the controlled boundary layer is provided by the phaselocked ensemble averaging technique, triggered at the synthetic jet frequency. The separated flow transition process, which is detected for the uncontrolled condition, is modified by the synthetic jet in different ways during the blowing and <b>suction</b> <b>phases.</b> Overall, the phase-locked velocity distributions show a reduced separated flow region for the whole jet cycle as compared to the uncontrolled condition.

We report a case of a 15 -year-old female who had history of cough with sputum for 3 days along with fever. She was seen in another hospital and was treated as a case of pneumonia where she received antibiotic but with no improvement. Computerized tomography (CT) chest showed diffuse interlobular septal thickening in the background of ground glass opacity giving a picture of crazy paving pattern which was consistent with the diagnosis of PAP. The patient was scheduled to undergo, first right-sided whole lung lavage (WLL) under general anesthesia. Endobronchial intubation using left sided 37 Fr double lumen tube. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as described in our previously published report was connected to the right lumen of the endobronchial tube. CPAP ventilation was used during the suctioning of lavage fluid phase in order to improve oxygenation. WLL was done using 5 L of warm heparinized saline (500 i. u/litre). The same procedure was repeated on the left side using 6 L of heparinized normal saline solution. In conclusion, anesthesia in {{alveolar proteinosis}} for patients undergoing WLL is challenging to the anesthesiologist.

The array is arranged in a convergent couple configuration, where each single jet is oriented at ± 45 ◦ in the plane perpendicular to the mean channel flow. The actuator system is derived from a commercial engine for airplane models where the oscillating piston {{gives rise to the}} periodic blowing and <b>suction</b> <b>phases</b> needed for the generation of a synthetic jet. The interaction produces couples of counter-rotating large-scale longitudinal vortical structures organized periodically in the spanwise direction. These vortices persist along the channel up to long distances from the injection section and produce an attenuation of the wall turbulence. Reductions in the mean skin friction of up to 15 % and in the turbulence fluctuations (wall shear stress and streamwise velocity) of up to 12 % are obtained. The efficiency of the interaction depends on the piston oscillation frequency. The near-wall activity is influenced to a great extent by the action of the large-scale vortices. The variable interval time averaging (VITA) events are reduced and the integral time macroscales are increased while the probability density function (PDF) analysis shows higher levels of intermittency. The interpretation of these effects is given in terms of regeneration mechanisms of the near-wall structures. A comparison between the present control scheme and the forcing obtained using continuous jets has also been made. In the case of synthetic jets, the forcing effects appear weaker with respect to those obtained using continuous jets, at least for the tested conditions. Drag reduction and turbulence attenuation are in fact lower when synthetic jets are used as a forcing technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper is}} focused on the {{investigation}} of the interaction between a synthetic jet and the boundary layer which develops over a flat plate subjected to an adverse pressure gradient typical of a high-lift low-pressure turbine profile. Two different Reynolds numbers of the main flow, Re = 200000 and Re = 70000, typical of the low-pressure turbine operating conditions during the take-off/landing and cruise phases, respectively, have been investigated. Wall static pressure distributions along the plate showed the different effects induced by the jet on the boundary layer separation with the jet Strouhal numbers investigated. The device capability of suppressing the large laminar separation bubble which occurs for the uncontrolled condition has been more in depth investigated by means of hot-wire time-mean and ensemble averaged measurements. The phase-locked ensemble averaging technique, synchronized with the synthetic jet frequency, has been employed to distinguish the effects induced by the jet during the blowing and the suction phases. The active device has been proved to be able to control the laminar separation bubble induced by a strong adverse pressure gradient, also at the low Reynolds number condition tested. The ensemble averaged measurements showed that a larger contribution to the reduction of the boundary layer velocity defect is obtained during the <b>suction</b> <b>phase</b> of the jet.

According to the latest trends in miniature consumer and military electronics, {{there is a need for}} compact cooling solutions to meet performance requirements at compact volumes. Successful technology must feature a thin profile and a small footprint area, while still removing a significant amount of heat dissipation. Impinging synthetic jets driven by a piezoelectric membrane are a promising method for cooling small-scale electronics. In this paper, we explore the thermal response of a miniature synthetic jet impinging upon a vertical heater. In addition, we study the local flow field using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique to couple heat transfer with fluid dynamics. Heat transfer results show that the maximum cooling performance occurs with a jet-to-surface spacing of 5 ⩽ H/Dh ⩽ 10, which is associated with the flow consisting of coherent vortex structures. There is a degradation of heat transfer for closer jet-to-surface spacings, such as H/Dh = 2. This was due to the incomplete growth of the vortices, along with re-entrainment of warm air from the impinging plate back into the jet flow. There was also some warm air sucked back into the jet during the <b>suction</b> <b>phase</b> of the synthetic jet.

40|$|Synthetic jets {{are largely}} {{used in the}} {{electronic}} cooling field; indeed their heat transfer performances have been widely investigated. The heat transfer performances have been enhanced through the design of innovative synthetic jet devices, as the twin synthetic jets device. Obviously the heat transfer performances of the classic and innovative synthetic jet devices are strictly related to their impinging flow field. Therefore the behavior of impinging single and twin circular synthetic jets in phase opposition is experimentally investigated by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at Reynolds and Strouhal numbers equal to 5100 and 0. 024, respectively. Several nozzle-to-plate distances (H), ranging between 2 and 10 nozzle diameters (D), have been investigated. The time-averaged behavior of the velocity components has been reported and discussed. Their distributions, near the impinging plate, have been described. For the single jet, at short nozzle-to-plate distances (H/D 6), the axial velocity profile is bell-shaped. This is ascribed to the adverse pressure gradient strength and the potential core-like region extension. External oscillations are observed in all the flow field quantities near the impinging plate at 2 diameters from the stagnation point due to a secondary counter rotating vortex ring generation. The presence of such a counter rotating vortex ring decreases as the nozzle-to-plate distance increases. Comparing the two synthetic jet configurations, higher axial velocity and turbulence level but lower axial phase-correlated organized contribution to velocity have been found for the twin case because of the jets interaction. The evolution of the flow field for both configurations has been explained through phase-averaged measurements. High turbulence is observed along the shear layer emanated by the nozzle edge and in the vortex ring core. During the <b>suction</b> <b>phase</b> the saddle point shows a different behavior in the two configurations. In the single case, the saddle point reaches the impinging plate causing injection of air from the plate into the device.

Dry densities of statically compacted specimens varied {{in most of the}} cases in the range: 1. 3 to 1. 5 Mg/m 3. Pellets had a very high dry density, close to 2 Mg/m 3. To outstanding characteristics of these mixture is its discontinuous porosity. Pore sizes of the compacted pellets vary around 10 nm. However the inter-pellet size of the pores is four to five orders of magnitude higher. This double porosity and the highly expansive nature of the pellets controlled all the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the mixture.

In oil injected compressors, oil is mostly injected in the working domain to seal, cool and lubricate. But would the injection of atomized oil or other liquid in the suction of the compressor be useful for better control of the discharge temperature and reduction in energy consumption, is still to be determined. Similarly, liquid neutral to the process may be injected in an oil free compressor suction to help controlling discharge temperature. It can be erosive and corrosive to the compressor rotors.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the flow field in a rectangular tank filled with water and forced by a speaker {{has been carried out}} by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The employed experimental apparatus is sketched in figure 1. The speaker oscillation creates a disturbed field which determines a periodically waving of the free surface on {{the upper part of the}} tank. Phase-locked measurements have been performed sampling the investigated phenomenon each 12 ° obtaining 30 phases. Several depths d (8 cm, 6 cm and 4 cm), working frequencies f (1. 825 Hz, 2. 8 Hz, 3. 4 Hz) and wave amplitudes have been tested. In particular, for a fixed depth and working frequency, the wave amplitude equal or more than 10 % compared to the maximum depth of the tank is obtained varying the supply voltage V. In figures are represented the PIV measurements in the following conditions: f = 2. 8 Hz, V = 800 mV, d = 8 cm of water. The phases φ= 264 ° - φ= 336 ° are characterized by the formation of a vortex structure such like a synthetic jet starting from the speaker outflow. This expulsion phase causes free surface oscillation with the formation of a non-sinusoidal free surface. The non-regular behavior of the free surface is caused by the contrast between the fluid going backward from the previous phases and the new injected fluid in forward direction. During the entire expulsion phase, the vortex structure is generated and convects downstream until it reaches a distance of about x= 3. 5 w where the vortex dissolves. Simultaneously, the free surface has a sinusoidal trend as expected because of the periodical forcing. The vortex structure gets smaller while it proceeds along the tank floor because of two main reasons: diffusion of kinetic energy and interaction with the descending free surface. This interaction stops the downstream evolution of the vortex structure which collapses under the water mass moving downward.

40|$|A Compressor Resorption Heat Pump (CRHP) is a {{potential}} contribution to energy reduction in applications in which waste streams are upgraded, with limited energy addition, into high value process streams for reuse in industry. Previous research concluded that a CRHP with a wet screw compressor is a suitable option for many applications. An ammonia/water mixture {{was found to be}} the most appropriate fit, in terms of thermodynamic behaviour, for such an application. Objective of this thesis was to develop an integration of a geometry model and a thermodynamic model suitable for further optimisation of the wet twin-screw compressor. The integration of the geometry model and the thermodynamic model was carried out in modelling tool Matlab/Simulink, with inclusion of the physical properties of the working fluid. The development of the integrated dynamic model was carried out based on research for a heat pump process with a pre-selected geometry and a homogeneous two-phase fluid. The existing geometry model was transformed from shaft rotation based to time based equations to achieve the dynamic model requirements and the possibility of modelling the process in Simulink. The geometry model provides inputs to the thermodynamic model that dynamically describes the wet twin-screw compressor from the <b>suction</b> <b>phase</b> through compression to the discharge phase. The thermodynamic model requires inclusion of physical properties of the fluid and these were added by importing the physical properties through Refprop via Fluidprop. Mechanical constraints of a wet twin-screw compressor inevitably lead to internal leakage paths that reduce the compressor efficiency. The leakage paths have been included together with factors for friction, flow loss, etc. to represent the process in a more realistic way. The integrated model has been validated with the calculated result by model case A and measured results from the experimental set-up by Zaytsev [1]. A number of variations have been applied to the integrated model as examples of how to evaluate options for improvements. Making use of the developed integrated model parameters can be varied to show the influence on the compressor. The evaluations used a specific set of boundary conditions from previous research, using the geometry specified by Zaytsev [1]. The effects of three input parameters on the output and efficiency were evaluated: rotor length, discharge port area and vapour quality. The main result of the evaluation is that per boundary condition, the inputs from the geometry model have to be adjusted to achieve an optimal design of the twin-screw compressor.

40|$|In {{order to}} extend fluid-based flow control {{techniques}} {{that have been}} demonstrated at low subsonic speeds to high speed flows, {{it is necessary to}} develop actuators having sufficient momentum to control and manipulate high speed flows. Two fluidic actuation approaches are developed where the control jet may reach supersonic velocities and their performance is characterized. The first actuator is a compressible synthetic (zero net mass flux) jet. This is an extension of previous work on synthetic jets with an increase in driver power yielding substantial pressurization of the cavity such that the flow is compressible. The jet is generated using a piston/cylinder actuator, and the effects of variation of the orifice diameter, actuation frequency, and compression ratio are investigated. Operation in the compressible regime uniquely affects the time-dependent cylinder pressure in that the duty cycle of the system shifts such that the <b>suction</b> <b>phase</b> is longer than the blowing phase. The structure of the jet in the near-field is documented using particle image velocimetry and Schlieren flow visualization. In the range investigated, the stroke length is sufficiently long that the jet flow is dominated by a starting jet rather than a starting vortex (which is typical of low-speed synthetic jets). A simple, quasi-static numerical model of the cylinder pressure is developed and is in generally good agreement with the experimental results. This model is used to assess system parameters which could not be measured directly (e. g., the dynamic gas temperature and mass within the cylinder) and for predictions of the actuator performance beyond the current experimental range. Finally, an experiment is described with self-actuated valves mounted into the cylinder head which effectively icrease the orifice area in suction and overcome some of the limitations inherent to compressible operation. The second actuation concept is the combustion-driven jet actuator. This device consists of a small-scale (nominally 1 cc) combustion chamber which is filled with premixed fuel and oxidizer. The mixture is ignited using an integrated spark gap, creating a momentary high pressure burst within the combustor that drives a high-speed jet from an exhaust orifice. At these scales, the entire combustion process is complete within several milliseconds and the cycle resumes when fresh fuel/oxidizer is fed into the chamber and displaces the remaining combustion products. The actuator performance is characterized by using dynamaic measurements of the combustor pressure along with Schlieren flow visualization, limited dynamic thrust measurements, and flame photography. The effects of variation in the following system parameters are investigated: fuel type and mixture ratio, exhaust orifice diameter, chamber aspect ratio, chamber volume, fuel/air flow rate, ignition/combustion frequency, and spark ignition energy. The resulting performance trends are documented and the basis for each discussed. Finally, a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the utility of teh combustion-driven jet actuators at low-speed for transitory reattachment of a separated flow over an airfoil at high angles of attack.

40|$|Mechanical {{agitation}} is used commonly in gas-liquid reactors {{to improve}} the homogeneity of dispersion and to enhance the transfer of reacting compounds between gas and liquid. The design and scaleup of gas-liquid reactors is problematic due to non-ideal mixing, heat and mass transfer limitations. In this work, phenomenological models were developed and validated against experiments to investigate local gas-liquid mass transfer in agitated tanks. The aim was to develop more generalized and reliable simulation tools for agitated gas-liquid reactors. Gas-liquid hydrodynamics and mass transfer are related complicatedly to bubble size. Local Bubble Size Distributions (BSD) were measured from several systems in agitated laboratory tanks. The measurements revealed {{a wide range of}} existing bubble sizes and a significant spatial inhomogeneity of BSDs. The comparison between capillary <b>suction</b> probe, <b>phase</b> Doppler anemometry and photography showed that BSDs are biased due to limitations of experimental techniques. A dynamic multiblock model with a limited number of ideally mixed subregions was developed to investigate the inhomogeneity of dispersion. Mass transfer fluxes were modelled based on the two-film theory and simplified solution of Maxwell-Stefan diffusion. Local BSDs and mass transfer areas were solved from the population balances for bubbles by the method of classes. Unknown parameters in phenomenological bubble breakage, coalescence, turbulent slip and mass transfer models were fitted against experiments. The multiblock model was used to describe macroscopic inhomogeneities of dispersion in the fitting. The results show that multiblock stirred tank model is an excellent tool for the testing and validation of closure models. The adjusted models describe local BSDs, gas holdups and mass transfer rates under varying agitation conditions and physical properties of dispersion in a limited range. Due to complexity of gas-liquid agitation measured local BSDs alone are not however sufficient for the validation of mechanistic closure models. More basic research and isolated experiments are needed for this. A comparison between multiblock and CFD simulations shows that multiblock model is an optimal trade-off between the accuracy and CPU time, when local mass transfer rates are of interest. The simulations with the validated models predict a significant inhomogeneity of mass transfer, which mostly results from the spatially varying gas-liquid interfacial areas. The developed models relate mass transfer to local physical properties and micro-scale turbulence. They are less dependent on vessel size and geometry than traditional kLa-correlations and therefore suitable for detailed reactor scale-up and design studies. The validated population balance and mass transfer closures for aqueous xanthan systems together with the bioreaction kinetics from literature were incorporated to multiblock fermenter model to investigate batch xanthan fermentation. The simulations show the need of population balances for the detailed investigation of reactive, viscous gas-liquid dispersions in which mass transfer and mixing limitations are present. The model describes the effects of mixing on reactor performance successfully. The results highlight the potential of multiblock modelling for the detailed investigation of complex multiphase reactors. reviewe...|$|R

Two simulants were used: a 120 Pa Laponite solution and a 30 Pa/ 30 cP kaolin:bentonite clay mixture, which filled the tank to the 32 -foot level. The first test with 120 Pa Laponite demonstrated breakthrough at an air pressure of 14. 6 psig. The second test with the clay simulant resulted in breakthrough at 16. 7 psig. Given the specific gravities of these simulants, the breakthrough pressures are very close to the hydrostatic pressures corresponding to the simulant elevations inside the sparger. The CRV test stand at the Engineering Development Laboratory, SRNL, was used to simulate the UFP at 1 / 4 -scale, where the tank diameter was 40. 5 -inches. The simulant was a 30 Pa/ 30 cP kaolin:bentonite mixture loaded with 3. 3 wt% dry laponite, which successfully achieved a 596 Pa yield stress (vane method) after 14 hrs. However, it apparently had a thicker consistency than the 30 Pa/ 30 cP rheology of real waste under flowing conditions. The vessel was filled to a H/D of 1. 38 and the PJMs were initially filled to approximately full height (39 -inch). During the initial drive phase, starting from the full PJM level, application of the same PJM air pressure during normal operation did push the gelled simulant the full travel distance. But on the refill or <b>suction</b> <b>phase,</b> the maximum simulant height in the PJM was only about a third (9. 2 -inch) of the original travel (27 -inch). After 20 cycles of PJM operation only, air sparging, starting at 7 scfm, increasing to 10 scfm was introduced. This increased the PJM drive distance to a stable value of 64 % of the full travel after 327 cycles. Visual observation suggests that the simulant was moving up and down as a solid plug and that the cavern may be very limited. Thus, air sparging did not reestablish full PJM operation, but this could be due to the higher consistency of the simulant as compared to the actual waste. A third test utilized 5 mm glass beads deposited {{at the bottom of the}} CRV vessel, which was filled with water. Enough glass beads were added to cover the tank bottom surface with a one-bead-thick layer. Based on empirical correlations, the glass beads simulate the behavior of solid particles in the waste. Two spargers were tested: a 2 -inch dia. Sch. 160 pipe with straight end, and a 2 -inch dia. Sch. 160 pipe with 4 (45 deg) notches around the perimeter, 3 / 4 -inch deep. The objectives were to determine the required distance between the sparger end and the vessel bottom, air pressures, and air flows required to lift the glass beads off the vessel bottom. The test started with the spargers 6 inches from the bottom. For the flat faced sparger, no lifting was observed up to 50 scfm. Liftoff was observed only when the sparger end was 1 -inch off the bottom. At 10 scfm, glass beads started to be lifted off. At 50 scfm, approximately 300 beads (or approximately 1. 5 % of all beads) were lifted off. A 30 -inch diameter affected zone was observed where the bed was vibrating. For the notched sparger, no liftoff was observed until the sparger was 1 -inch from the bottom with 40 scfm (approx. 10 beads or 0. 05 % of the total). At 50 scfm, 50 % more beads were lifted off and a 12 -inch diameter of bulk movement and 24 -inch affected zone was established...|$|E
