These are tobacco leaves that because of their nature and appearance are used to roll a cigar in one continuous sheet (thus the name blunt is used). The United States Tobacco Taxation Board has classified all individual cigar wrappers as [...] "blunts" [...] and taxes them as roll-your-own tobacco. Many US states classify blunt wraps as tobacco and a license is required to sell them and collect tax. Canada defines a blunt wrap as [...] "a sheet or tube made of tobacco used to roll cigarette tobacco in—similar to rolling paper".

50|$|Over {{time the}} term Blunt came to {{describe}} any cigar {{wrapped in a}} single continuous leaf. However, in the 1970s a new manner of producing cigars was invented. This manner is known as spiral binding. No longer did cigars have to be rolled in a continuous single leaf but instead a continuous <b>spiral</b> <b>wrap</b> from base to tip could be employed. The basic shape of a blunt remained unchanged although the burn characteristics of a spiral wrapped cigar {{is not the same}} as a single continuous leaf. However spiral wrapping is much less expensive than using a full single tobacco leaf. Spiral wrapping gives a better seal than a single continuous leaf as overlapping can be done (much like wrapping an arm in a bandage, spiral wrapping is easier to seal than a single continuous bandage).|$|E

This unified theory can be applied to <b>spirals</b> <b>wrapping</b> the conventional scanning surfaces and makes it possible to accurately reconstruct the NF data required by the NF-FF transformation employing the corresponding classical scanning.

Over 3 months, human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells progressively matured into myelin basic protein(+) and adenomatous polyposis coli protein(+) oligodendrocytes.

40|$|Abstract Background The Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) {{phenotype}} {{caused by}} mutation in the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene varies considerably, from early onset and severe forms to late onset and milder forms. The mechanism {{is not well}} understood. The myelin protein zero (P 0) mediates adhesion in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wraps</b> of the Schwann cell's myelin sheath. The crystalline structure of the extracellular domain of the myelin protein zero (P 0 ex) is known, while the transmembrane and intracellular structure is unknown. Findings One novel missense mutation caused a milder late onset CMT type 2, while the second missense mutation caused a severe early onset phenotype compatible with Déjérine-Sottas syndrome. Conclusions The phenotypic variation caused by different missense mutations in the MPZ gene is likely caused by different conformational changes of the MPZ protein which affects the functional tetramers. Severe changes of the MPZ protein cause dysfunctional tetramers and predominantly uncompacted myelin, i. e. the severe phenotypes congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy and Déjérine-Sottas syndrome, while milder changes cause the phenotypes CMT type 1 and 2. </p...|$|R

40|$|The node of Ranvier {{has been}} the object of {{particular}} attention from students of the nerve fiber primarily for two reasons.

Another {{has been the}} urge to provide anatomical loci for the measurable electrical properties of the nerve fiber, both at rest and during impulse propagation.

To overcome this difficulty, cerebral edema was induced in rats {{by means of the}} unilateral intracerebral implantation of silver nitrate.

In addition, several other aspects of the myelin and myelin-forming cell relationships became apparent in the edematous tissue.

Three instances are known among invertebrates of the {{evolution of}} axonal sheaths possessing the functional properties and many of the structural properties of vertebrate myelin. Comparison of these invertebrate myelins raises the question of what structural features must a sheath possess in order to produce the two principal functional characteristics of impulse speed enhancement and energy savings. This essay reviews the features recognized by early workers as pertaining to myelin in vertebrate and invertebrate alike: osmiophilia, negative birefringence and saltatory conduction. It then examines common features revealed by the advent of electron microscopy: multiplicity of lipid membranes, condensation of those mem-branes, specialized marginal seals, and nodes. Next it examines the robustness of these features as essential components of a speed-enhancing sheath. Features that are not entirely essential for speed enhancement include membrane compaction, <b>spiral</b> <b>wrapping</b> of layers, glial cell involvement, non-active axonal membrane, and even nodes and perinodal sealing.

40|$|AbstractFrom a new anti-parallel initial {{condition}} using long vortices, three-dimensional incompressible turbulence forms after two re- connection steps {{and the formation}} of at least one set of vortex rings, similar to how anti-parallel quantum vortices evolve [10]. The long domain allows multiple reconnections, which enhance vortex stretching rates and the generation of small-scale vortex structures within the vortex rings. For the Navier-Stokes vortices, further new features are a profile less likely to shed vortex sheets and an improved mapping of the direction of the vorticity onto the three-dimensional mesh. The vortices evolve via the following steps: First, until the first reconnection, dynamics largely consistent with how vortices attract in the Euler equations. Second, vortex reconnection where the symmetry planes meet. Third, a series of vortex rings, with the stretching at each following set of reconnections leading to the new reconnections and rings. Roughly half of the circulation reconnects into two “bridges”, leaving two distinct “threads”, as he extra stretching transforms the threads into <b>spirals</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the bridges.

40|$|Abstract The {{formation}} of the sperm giant axoneme of the gall-midge fly Asphondylia ruebsaameni is described here. The axoneme consists of {{a great number of}} microtubular doublets (up to 2500) arranged in a double <b>spiral</b> <b>wrapping</b> around an axial cluster of mitochondria. Each microtubular doublet is provided with an outer arm only. In the early spermatid the occurrence of a large system of curved multi-layered filamentous material associated with membranous cisternae has been observed in the perinuclear region. Such a system extends throughout the cytoplasm to contact the plasma membrane. The filamentous material appears to act as a nucleating centre for the assembly of the microtubular doublets, which initially have a submembranous location and later are distributed in the interior of the cell. After their assembly, microtubular doublets are associated pairwise and are arranged in a single microtubular row with a zig-zag configuration. This configuration changes during spermiogenesis as a consequence both of a rotation of the microtubular doublet pairs and a compaction of the axonemal complex due to the elimination of the excess cytoplasm. As a result of this process, a double parallel spiral of microtubular doublets is forme...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{with the}} {{electron}} microscope of longitudinal {{sections of the}} sciatic nerves of infant mice {{during the period of}} early myelin formation are described. These observations are interpreted in relation to previous studies of transverse sections, and a general picture of the formation of an internodal length of the myelin sheath in three dimensions is formulated. In general, an internodal length of myelin sheath is attained by the <b>spiral</b> <b>wrapping</b> of the infolded Schwann cell surface; the increase in length of the internode during maturation is at least partially explained by the increased length of axon covered by the overlapping of successive layers during the wrapping of the infolded Schwann cell surface; and the nodes of Ranvier refer to the structure complex at the junctions of adjacent non-syncytial Schwann cells. The fact that the mode of formation of myelin brings each of its layers into intimate contact with the axon surface at the nodes is emphasized because of the possible functional significance of this arrangement.

It consists of a shovel-shaped myelin sheet surrounded by a continuous thickened rim of cytoplasm. Most of the unusual myelin configurations are explained as simple variations on this basic theme. With the help of this model, an explanation of the formation of the myelin sheath is offered.
