50|$|The New York Clearing House brought {{order to}} {{what had been a}} tangled web of exchanges. Specie {{certificates}} soon replaced gold as the means of <b>settling</b> <b>balances</b> at the Clearing House, further simplifying the process. Once certificates wereexchanged for gold deposited at member banks, porters encountered fewer of the dangers they had faced previously while transporting bags of gold from bank to bank. Certificates relieved the strain on the bank’s cash flow, thus reducing the likelihood of a run on deposits. Member banks had to do weekly audits, keep minimum reserve levels and log daily settlement of balances which further assured more ordered, efficient exchanges.|$|E

50|$|Under the Bretton Woods {{international}} monetary agreement of 1944, {{the gold standard}} was kept without domestic convertibility. The role of gold was severely constrained, as other countries’ currencies were fixed {{in terms of the}} dollar. Many countries kept reserves in gold and settled accounts in gold. Still they preferred to <b>settle</b> <b>balances</b> with other currencies, with the American dollar becoming the favorite. The International Monetary Fund was established to help with the exchange process and assist nations in maintaining fixed rates. Within Bretton Woods adjustment was cushioned through credits that helped countries avoid deflation. Under the old standard, a country with an overvalued currency would lose gold and experience deflation until the currency was again valued correctly. Most countries defined their currencies in terms of dollars, but some countries imposed trading restrictions to protect reserves and exchange rates. Therefore, most countries' currencies were still basically inconvertible. In the late 1950s, the exchange restrictions were dropped and gold became an important element in international financial settlements.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} characteristics of cement quality is particle size distribution. There are several simple methods to measure the particle size distribution of cement based on the Stokes diameter, like Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. A major disadvantages of these methods are they are time consuming process and require special skills. Particle size distribution also can be analyzed by using a different principle through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering methods and Coulter counter method. Even these methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, however, the equipments are expensive. In the present study, it has developed a new method to overcome the problem. The method is the buoyancy weighing-bar method. This method is a simple and cost-effective. The principle of the buoyancy weighing-bar method that the density change in a suspension due to particle migration is measured by weighing buoyancy against a weighing– bar hung in the suspension, and the particle size distribution is calculated using {{the length of the}} weighing-bar and the time–course change in the the apparent mass of the weighing–bar. This apparatus consists of an analytical balance with a hook for underfloor weighing, and a weighing–bar, which is used to detect the density change in suspension.

50|$|Essentially a {{confidence}} trick, a fraudster uses a company {{at their disposal}} to gain confidence with a bank, by appearing as a genuine, profitable customer. To give the illusion of being a desired customer, the company regularly and repeatedly uses the bank to get payment from {{one or more of}} its customers. These payments are always made, as the customers in question are part of the fraud, actively paying any and all bills raised by the bank. After time, after the bank is happy with the company, the company requests that the bank <b>settles</b> its <b>balance</b> with the company before billing the customer. Again, business continues as normal for the fraudulent company, its fraudulent customers, and the unwitting bank.

Operation Gazelle was an act performed by Israel in October 1973 during the conflict with Egypt.

40|$|The {{lamination}} and burrowing {{patterns in}} 17 box cores were analyzed {{with the aid}} of X-ray photographs and thin sections. A standardized method of log plotting made statistical analysis of the data possible. Several 'structure types' were established, although it was realized that the boundaries are purely arbitrary divisions in what can sometimes be a continuous sequence. In the transition zone between marginal sand facies and fine-grained basin facies, muddy sediment is found which contains particularly well differentiated, alternating laminae. This zone is also characterized by layers rich in plant remains. The alternation of laminae shows a high degree of statistical scattering. Even though a small degree of cyclic periodicity could be defined, it was impossible to correlate individual layers from core to core across the bay. However, through a statistical handling of the plots, zones could be separated {{on the basis of the}} number of sand layers they contained. These more or minder sandy zones clarified the bottom reflections seen in the records of the echograph from the area. The manner of facies change across the bay, suggests that no strong bottom currents are effective in the Eckernförde Bay. The marked asymmetry between the north and south flanks of the profile can be attributed to the stronger action of waves on the more exposed areas. Grain size analyses were made from the more homogeneous units found in a core from the transition-facies zone. The results indicate that the most pronounced differences between layers appear in the silt range, and although the differences are slight, they are statistically significant. Layers rich in plant remains were wet-sieved in order to separate the plant detritus. This was than analyzed in a sediment <b>settling</b> <b>balance</b> and found to be hydrodynamically equivalent to a well-sorted, finegrained sand. A special, rhythmic cross-bedding type with dimensions in the millimeter range, has been named 'Crypto-cross-lamination' and is thought to represent rapid sedimentation in an area where only very weak bottom currents are present. It is found only in the deepest part of the basin. Relatively large sand grains, scattered within layers of clayey-silty matrix, seem to be transported by flotation. Thin section examination showed that the inner part of Eckernförder Bay carbonate grains (e. g. Foraminifera shells) were preserved throughout the cores, while in the outer part of the bay they were not present. Well defined tracks and burrows are relatively rare in all of the facies in comparision to the generally strongly developed deformation burrowing. The application of special measures for the deformation burrowing allowed to plot their intensity in profile for each core. A degree of regularity could be found in these burrowing intensity plots, with higher values appearing in the sandy facies, but with no clear differences between sand and silt layers in the transition facies. Small sections in the profiles of the deepest part of the bay show no bioturbation at all...|$|R
