30|$|Global {{concerns}} {{about the impact of}} toxic gases and effluents on the environment have led to the platinum industry leaders to adopt new strategies of recycling or capturing mine waste. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), for example, from coal-fired power stations and the environment is currently being captured and stored in coal seams underground [1, 2]. Hesselmann and Hough have reported the development of the technology of converting toxic oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from well-designed boiler burners using ammonia-based reagent and hydrocarbon into a flue gas containing NOx and some O 2 [3]. They found that at elevated temperatures the hydrocarbon auto ignites, forming plasma, and creating radicals. These radicals catalysed the NOx reduction reactions—autocatalysis—and the resulting flue gas was found to contain very low NOx and small level of ammonia slip. Other researchers have also reported on the concept of capturing SO 2 from fluidized-bed reactors during coal gasification using dolomite [4]. However, there is scanty literature on the application of acidic chloride solutions as a means of capturing SO 2 from flue gases and the same time precipitate the precious metals as sulphides. It is established that dissolved sulphur reacts readily with base and precious metal ions to form metal sulphides [5, 6, 7]. In <b>industrial</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>processes,</b> reduction of metal ions such as sulphides is accomplished by contacting metal-rich solutions with commercial H 2 S or SO 2 gases. To utilize commercial SO 2 gases or other sulphur-bearing gases for recovering metals from solution, it is necessary to put in place effective mechanisms for capturing and solubilizing gases.|$|R

This {{is a white}} paper that describes the role of Systems Engineering in Intelligent <b>Industrial</b> <b>Processes.</b> We first {{try to get a}} grasp of what we mean with Intelligent <b>Industrial</b> <b>Processes</b> and Systems Engineering. The state of the art for Systems Engineering is reviewed with systems life cycle processes and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). It is followed by current problems in process industry and presents MBSE as a partial solution for an industrial framework towards “Intelligent” <b>industrial</b> <b>processes.</b> The white pa- per clearly shows that a lack of consideration of Systems Engineering in <b>industrial</b> <b>processes</b> leads to a deficiency in understanding indus- trial processes and impacts its leadership. With an established need for Systems Engineering, a SWOT analysis and a triple road map for LTU is presented including potential collaborations. Godkänd; 2015; 20160221 (deventer) </p...|$|R

40|$|Software is an {{important}} part of <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control systems. However, the state-of-the-practice for developing <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control software still has several key challenges that need to be addressed (e. g., migration to platforms of different vendors, lack of automation). This paper introduces a model-driven engineering approach to the development of <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control software, which is based on the ProcGraph domain-specific modeling language. The paper discusses and offers solutions to several of the development challenges that have not been addressed by existing techniques in the process controls domain.

The approach is demonstrated by a case study focused on the development of a control system for a TiO 2 (titanium dioxide) pigment production subprocess. 1...|$|R
