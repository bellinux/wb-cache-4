5|$|Genes {{are made}} from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The {{biological}} information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> or a double helix.|$|E
5|$|The BRCA OB1 domain assumes an OB fold, which {{consists}} of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB1 has a shallow groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for weak <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA binding. The domain also binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> designed to fold into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{integrating}} the T-DNA into a host genome is {{the formation of a}} nick at the right border of the Ti plasmid. This nick creates a region of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA from the left border of the T-DNA gene over to the right border which was cut. <b>Single</b> <b>stranded</b> binding proteins then attach to the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. DNA synthesis will displace the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> region and then a second nick at the left border region will release the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> T-DNA fragment. This fragment can then be incorporated into a host genome.|$|R
50|$|This method generates {{libraries}} {{of hybrid}} genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides {{in the presence}} of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA is obtained.|$|R
50|$|Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 is a <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA {{virus that}} infects the {{species of the}} archaeal genus Halorubrum. It is unlike any other known virus infecting the archaea with a <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA genome and an {{external}} lipid envelope.|$|R
5|$|These guanine-rich {{sequences}} may stabilize chromosome ends {{by forming}} structures of stacked sets of four-base units, {{rather than the}} usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack {{on top of each}} other, to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5000|$|After {{digestion}} of the RNA, a <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA (ssDNA) is {{left and}} because <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> nucleic acids are hydrophobic, {{it tends to}} loop around itself. It {{is likely that the}} ssDNA forms a hairpin loop at the 3' end.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} DNA {{replication}} to continue, <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> binding proteins {{are needed to}} prevent the <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of DNA from forming secondary structures and {{to prevent them from}} re-annealing. In addition, DNA gyrase is needed to relieve the topological stress created by the action of DnaB helicase.|$|R
40|$|An {{in-vitro}} {{system is}} described {{allowing for the}} assembly of nucleosomes on preselected sites of a cloned tRNA gene. The system consists of a soluble nucleoprotein fraction, a histone source, and circular DNA containing a <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> stretch (sssDNA). Nucleosomes assemble on the sssDNA, if the three components are incubated as a highly concentrated solution {{in the presence of}} the four deoxyribonucleotidetriphosphates and of ATP. The <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> stretch is rendered double stranded during incubation. The middle axis of one assembled nucleosome always coincides roughly with the midpoint of the original <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA stretch...|$|R
25|$|Scientists encode {{large amounts}} of digital information, {{including}} the complete sonnets of William Shakespeare, on a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of synthetic DNA. DNA has immense potential as a storage medium, and may become commercially available for this purpose in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Astroviruses have a genome {{composed}} of a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of positive sense RNA. The strand has a poly A tail at the 3' end, but no 5' cap. With the exclusion of polyadenylation at the 3' end, the genome is between 6.87.9 kb long.|$|E
25|$|In {{the natural}} state, a hammerhead RNA motif is a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of RNA, and {{although}} the cleavage {{takes place in the}} absence of enzymes, the hammerhead RNA itself is not a catalyst in its natural state, as it is consumed by the reaction and cannot catalyze multiple turnovers.|$|E
40|$|A {{system based}} on {{electrical}} impedance measurements using chemically modified Silicon/Silicon dioxide electrodes with covalently bound <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> homo-oligonucleotides was developed for DNA detection. Silanating agents (3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3 -glycodoxyethylpropylamine) were used to modify the electrodes and immobilize <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. A method based on the electrochemical modification of Si substrates with bromobenzene diazonium was also used to immobilized <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. The DNA detection system is able to recognize any electrical changes occurring at the electrode through in-phase and out-of-phase impedance measurements. Hybridization of the complementary strands causes {{a shift in the}} flat band potential due to variations in charge accumulating at the modified oxide/electrolyte interface. With these measurements, we were able to make reliable comparisons between the electrical measurements and the quantification of immobilized and hybridized <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA through radiolabeling...|$|R

40|$|For the {{isolation}} of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> plasmid DNA, various E. coli and E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle plasmids were equipped with the phage f 1 replication origin. The transformation of some representative Streptomyces species with plasmid vectors occurred irrespective of whether <b>single</b> or double <b>stranded</b> DNA was used. In contrast, the transformation of Streptomyces was 10 to 100 times more efficient when an integration vector was in the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> form {{as opposed to the}} double stranded form. Streptomyces viridochromogenes was transformed by <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA integration vectors in order to replace the pat by the tsr gene and generate mutants unable to synthesize phosphinothricin-tripeptide (PTT) ...|$|R
25|$|Multiple Cas1 {{proteins}} {{have been}} characterised and their structures resolved. Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either (<b>single</b> <b>strand)</b> ssRNA- or (double strand) dsDNA- specific endoribonuclease activity.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II (Pol II) {{is responsible}} for the transcription of all mRNAs, some snRNAs, siRNAs, and all miRNAs. Many Pol II transcripts exist transiently as <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> precursor RNAs (pre-RNAs) that are further processed to generate mature RNAs. For example, precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs)are extensively processed before exiting into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore for protein translation.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{because of}} its {{potential}} use as a gene therapy vector, researchers have created an altered AAV called self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of DNA and requires the process of second-strand synthesis, scAAV packages both strands which anneal together to form double stranded DNA. By skipping second strand synthesis scAAV allows for rapid expression in the cell. Otherwise, scAAV carries many characteristics of its AAV counterpart.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of berberine with <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) structure was investigated {{using a combination}} of spectrophotometric, spectrofluorimetric, circular dichroic, viscometric, and thermodynamic studies. The interaction process was characterized by typical hypochromic and bathochromic effects in the absorption spectrum of berberine, enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine, increase of viscosity, and perturbation of circular dichroic spectrum of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA). Scatchard plot obtained from spectrophotometric analysis showed that berberine bound strongly to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) in a non-cooperative manner. In contrast, berberine does not show any significant effect (i) in its absorbance and fluorescence spectra on binding to double stranded poly(rA), (ii) alter the circular dichroic spectrum of double stranded poly(rA), or (iii) increase of viscosity of double stranded poly(rA) indicating that it does not bind at all to double stranded poly(rA) structure. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the binding of the alkaloid to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) is an endothermic process and entropy driven. All these findings, taken together clearly support that berberine binds strongly to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) structure by a mechanism of partial intercalation leading to its use in gene regulation in eukaryotic cells...|$|R
25|$|Scientists can encode {{vast amounts}} of digital {{information}} onto a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of synthetic DNA. In 2012, George M. Church encoded one of his books about synthetic biology in DNA. The 5.3 Mb of data from the book is more than 1000 {{times greater than the}} previous largest amount of information to be stored in synthesized DNA. A similar project had encoded the complete sonnets of William Shakespeare in DNA.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of DNA repair {{processes}} {{is considered}} one of main mechanism of inorganic arsenic genotoxicity. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) are the processes implicated in the repair of DNA base damage induced by ROS after arsenic exposure. In particular, the NER mechanism is the major pathway for repairing bulky distortions in DNA double helix, while the BER mechanism is mainly implicated in the repair of <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> breaks induced by ROS, but inorganic arsenic could also repress the BER mechanism.|$|E
25|$|After {{escaping}} the promoter and shedding {{most of the}} transcription factors for initiation, the polymerase acquires new factors for {{the next phase of}} transcription: elongation. Transcription elongation is a processive process. Double stranded DNA that enters {{from the front of the}} enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for RNA synthesis. For every DNA base pair separated by the advancing polymerase, one hybrid RNA:DNA base pair is immediately formed. DNA strands and nascent RNA chain exit from separate channels; the two DNA strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> RNA emerges alone.|$|E

25|$|Because of AAV's {{specialized}} {{gene therapy}} advantages, researchers {{have created an}} altered version of AAV termed self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of DNA and must wait for its second strand to be synthesized, scAAV packages two shorter strands that are complementary to each other. By avoiding second-strand synthesis, scAAV can express more quickly, although as a caveat, scAAV can only encode half of the already limited capacity of AAV. Recent reports suggest that scAAV vectors are more immunogenic than single stranded adenovirus vectors, inducing a stronger activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|Duplex {{sequencing}} is {{a library}} preparation and analysis method for next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms that employs random tagging of double stranded DNA to detect mutations with higher accuracy and lower error rate. This method uses degenerate molecular tags {{in addition to}} sequencing adapters to recognize reads originating from each strand of DNA. The generated sequencing reads then will be analyzed using two methods: <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> consensus sequences (SSCSs) and Duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly. Duplex sequencing theoretically can detect mutations with frequencies as low as 5 x 10−8 {{that is more than}} 10,000 fold higher in accuracy compared to the conventional next-generation sequencing methods.|$|E
25|$|Properly spaced <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> {{breaks in}} the host DNA can trigger {{homology}} directed repair, which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break. The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence {{is now part of}} the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that computations using DNA molecules as computing units may sometimes be simpler to carry out and less error prone if double stranded DNA molecules are used rather than the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> molecules currently being used.

40|$|Footprint {{competition}} assays are {{utilized to}} study the binding of Xenopus transcription factor A {{to a variety of}} single-stranded nucleic acids. The addition of Xenopus oocyte, yeast, or wheat germ 5 S RNA as footprint competitors reveals that factor A binds these 5 S RNAs with similar affinity. In contrast, factor A does not bind to E. coli 5 S RNA or wheat germ tRNA in this assay. Factor A binding to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA is also examined using footprint competition. Factor A binds preferentially to non-specific <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> (M 13) DNA versus double stranded (pBR 322) DNA.
