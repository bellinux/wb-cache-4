40|$|Introduction Previous work on Blind Source Deconvolution {{has focused}} {{mainly on the}} problem of deconvolving sound samples. It is assumed that the {{observed}} sound samples are temporally convolved versions of the true source samples. Blind Deconvolution algorithms have fallen into two types, those where the inverse of the convolution lter is learnt [1],[3] and those where the aim is to learn the lter itself [1]. When applying these ideas to the problem of deconvolving images two problems become apparent. Firstly in many real data sets (for instance the images generated by telescopes observing the sky or the power spectrum from a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer) the pixel values correspond to intensities. So the pixel values must be positive. The <b>standard</b> <b>blind</b> separation <b>approaches</b> of assuming that the sources are distributed as 1 cosh [3] or mixtures of Gaussians [2] lose this positivity of the source images. Deconvolution without a positivity co...|$|R

30|$|A {{major issue}} for the {{application}} of maximum-ratio-combining for multimicrophone setups is the estimation of the acoustic transfer functions. In telecommunications, the signal attenuation as well as the phase shift for each transmission path are usually measured to apply MRC. With speech applications we have no means to directly measure the acoustic transfer functions. There exists several <b>blind</b> <b>approaches</b> to estimate the acoustic transfer functions (see e.g., [14 – 16]) which were successfully applied to dereverberation. However, the proposed estimation methods are computationally demanding.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of minimizing the multicast decoding delay of generalized instantly decodable network coding (G-IDNC) over persistent forward and feedback erasure channels with feedback intermittence. In such an environment, the sender does not always receive acknowledgement from the receivers after each transmission. Moreover, both the forward and feedback channels are subject to persistent erasures, which can be modelled by a two state (good and bad states) Markov chain known as Gilbert-Elliott channel (GEC). Due to such feedback imperfections, the sender is unable to determine subsequent instantly decodable packets combination for all receivers. Given this harsh channel and feedback model, we first derive expressions for the probability distributions of decoding delay increments and then employ these expressions in formulating the minimum decoding problem in such environment as a maximum weight clique problem in the G-IDNC graph. We also show that the problem formulations in simpler channel and feedback models are special cases of our generalized formulation. Since this problem is NP-hard, we design a greedy algorithm to solve it and compare it to <b>blind</b> <b>approaches</b> proposed in literature. Through extensive simulations, our adaptive algorithm is shown to outperform the <b>blind</b> <b>approaches</b> in all situations and to achieve significant improvement in the decoding delay, especially when the channel is highly persisten...|$|R

This requires the design of a reference grid, i. e. a watermark space partition. We propose two specific functions and their resulting watermark spaces...|$|R
