5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Jurchens the <b>Song</b> dynasty was for centuries engaged in a {{stand-off}} against the Western Xia and the Khitan Liao dynasty. This balance was disrupted when the <b>Song</b> dynasty developed a military alliance with the Jurchens for the purpose of annihilating the Liao. This balance of power disrupted, the Jurchens then turned on the <b>Song,</b> resulting in the fall of the Northern <b>Song</b> and the subsequent establishment of the Southern <b>Song.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1127, Jin had conquered most of {{northern}} China and besieged the <b>Song</b> capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong of the <b>Song</b> was captured. The Jurchens took {{him and the}} <b>Song</b> royal family to Manchuria as hostages. Members of the <b>Song</b> court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, first in the <b>Song</b> southern capital (modern Shangqiu), and then in Hangzhou in 1129. The move of the <b>Song</b> capital south to Hangzhou signals {{the transition from the}} Northern <b>Song</b> era to the Southern <b>Song.</b> Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127; he is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozong. The Jurchen general Wuzhu crossed the Yangtze River in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across the Yangtze, where he fought off a stronger <b>Song</b> fleet commanded by Han Shizhong.|$|E

5|$|Diplomatic {{exchanges between}} the <b>Song</b> and Jin {{did not stop}} during the period {{preceding}} the war. The History of <b>Song</b> claims that the <b>Song</b> realized that the Jin were planning for an invasion when they noticed the discourtesy {{of one of the}} Jin diplomats. Some <b>Song</b> officials foresaw the impending war, but Emperor Gaozong hoped to maintain peaceful relations with the Song's northern neighbor. His reluctance to antagonize the Jin delayed the fortification of the <b>Song</b> border defenses. The <b>Song</b> quickly built just three military garrisons in 1161. Wanyan Liang departed from Kaifeng on October 15, 1161. The offensive comprised four armies, and Wanyan Liang personally led the army that entered Anhui. The Jin passed the Huai River boundary on October 28, advancing into <b>Song</b> territory. The <b>Song</b> resistance was minimal because they had fortified the southern shore of the Yangtze River and not the Huai.|$|E
