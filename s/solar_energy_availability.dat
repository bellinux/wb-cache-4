40|$|There is a {{paradoxical}} {{relationship between the}} density of solar housing and net household energy use. The amount of solar energy available per person decreases as density increases. At the same time, transportation energy, and to some extent, household operating energy decreases. Thus, an interesting question is posed: how does net energy use vary with housing density? This study attempts to provide insight into this question by examining three housing forms: low-density detached homes, medium-density townhouses, and high-density high-rise apartments in Toronto. The three major quantities of energy that are summed for each are building operational energy use, <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>availability,</b> and personal transportation energy use. <b>Solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>availability</b> is determined {{on the basis of}} an effective annual collector efficiency. The results show that under the base case in which solar panels are applied to conventional homes, the high-density development uses one-third less energy than the low-density one. Improving the efficiency of the homes results in a similar trend. Only when the personal vehicle fleet or solar collectors are made to be extremely efficient does the trend reverse—the low-density development results in lower net energy. ...|$|E

Solar cooling systems can be applied for greenhouse climate control in regions with high values of solar irradiation as alternative to traditional evaporative systems, allowing the reduction of primary energy consumption by exploiting the contemporaneity between the cooling requirements and the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>availability.</b> The plant consists of a single effect LiBr-H 2 O absorption chiller fed by evacuated-tube solar collectors; the model was developed in Matlab-Simulink and is able to simulate dynamically, with time steps up to 15 minutes, the greenhouse cooling demand and the production of the solar field.

The use of a solar dryer can decrease the wood biomass requested by the generation plant, resulting in higher thermal and electric efficiencies with respect to the integration with traditional solar water collectors.

Owing to {{increase}} in the energy costs and the adverse {{effect on the environment}} caused by the burning of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are being used worldwide to contribute in meeting the energy demand. Renewable energy denotes a clean, nontoxic energy source that cannot be exhausted. The primary renewable energy sources are the sun, wind, biomass, tide, waves and geothermal energy. Harnessing the abundance of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> {{has been one of the}} most attractive energy alternatives. The development of an efficient and economical <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> storage system is of major concern. Energy storage plays an important role in conserving available energy and improving its utilization. Electrical energy consumption varies during day time and night time. <b>Solar</b> <b>energy</b> is available only during the day. Hence its applications require efficient thermal energy storage so that the excess heat collected during sunshine hours may be stored for later use during the night time. The main problem while utilizing <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> is its <b>availability</b> which is often intermittent, variable and unpredictable. These problems can be addressed by the storage of thermal energy. Thermal energy storage (TES) will improve the efficiency and output of solar power. A thermal energy storage system mainly consists of three parts, the storage medium, heat transfer mechanism and containment system. Thermal energy storage (TES) applications have significantly increased because of the increase in the energy prices and environmental regulations. Latent heat storage (LHS) is one of the efficient ways of storing thermal energy. Unlike the sensible heat storage (SHS) method, the latent heat storage method provides much higher storage density with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. There are large numbers of phase change materials that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures. The reason behind using phase change materials is due to their advantages such as low cost, high storage density and isothermal operation.

In today’s deregulated electricity market, most participants (e. g., GENCOs, local distribution companies or LDCs) focus on maximizing their profits, and thus {{they need to be}} incentivized to invest in renewable generation and energy conservation, which are otherwise not profitable ventures. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel holistic generation expansion plan (GEP) model that enables the central planning authority to design optimal incentive rates for renewable integration and energy conservation targets, considering the investor interests and constraints. The model also determines the siting, sizing, timing, and technology required to adequately supply the projected demand over the planning horizon. The model is applied to the generation planning of Ontario, Canada, based on realistic data, to determine appropriate incentives for investors in renewable generation and energy conservation by LDCs. The obtained optimal incentives are shown to be similar to the ones currently in place in Ontario, with a slightly shorter pay-back period for investors.

Based on the latitude of our design area, a computed 71 degrees angle positioning between solar panel and roof so as to maximise the surface area and optimise the solar irradiance gathering. Based on the power output of approximately 116 kW these PV modules generated, we further analysed and selected SDP 30 KW inverter and Monocrystalline Silicon (1 SolTech 1 STH- 350 -WH (350 W) solar modules. Also we provide different car charging method by choosing the SAE J 1772 standard as one of specifications for dedicated vehicle charging and Clipper Creek HSC- 40 as our option of charger. With the data of the generating <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> every day, charging time, consuming power, we can estimate how many cars the system can handle to charge. Moreover, our system provides AC power from AC power network by general socket type F. We finally concluded that, our model for charging of electric car batteries was not only supportive but efficient in terms of extracting <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> from sunlight to charge electric cars, thus making the region an eco-friendly place...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>energy</b> is a {{vast and}} largely {{untapped}} resource. Australia has the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent in the world. <b>Solar</b> <b>energy</b> is used mainly in small direct-use applications such as water heating. It accounts for only 0. 1 per cent of total primary energy consumption, in Australia as well as globally. <b>Solar</b> <b>energy</b> use in Australia is projected to increase by 5. 9 per cent per year to 24 PJ in 2029 – 30. The outlook for electricity generation from <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> depends critically on the commercialisation of large-scale <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> technologies that will reduce investment costs and risks. Government policy settings {{will continue to be}} an important factor in the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> market outlook. Research, development and demonstration by both {{the public and private sectors}} will be crucial in accelerating the development and commercialisation of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> in Australia, especially large-scale solar power stations. 10. 1. 1 World <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> resources and market The world’s overall <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> resource potentia...|$|R
