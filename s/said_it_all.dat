500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was also}} a {{significant}} release during the burgeoning Hotlanta music scene. The scene started as a black music revival in Atlanta during the late 1980s, and developed {{with the success of}} LaFace Records and the national attention received by Atlanta-based recording artists and producers such as Toni Braxton, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri, and Babyface. The album offered realistic depictions of the city and veered from the Afrocentric themes of Arrested Development and Dupri's mainstream stylings. It was named the third best album of 1994 in ego trips list of [...] "Hip Hop's 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1980–98". Vibe included it as one of the [...] "150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era (1992–2007)". The magazine also included the album on their 2004 list of [...] "51 Essential Albums" [...] that represent [...] "a generation, a sound, and in many cases, a movement", writing that [...] " [...] determined the South had something to say, and after emerging form the Dungeon production lab, they <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> sometimes sang it all—pointedly, funkdafied, and putting on absolutely no East Coast pretense. Classic." ...|$|E

Asked if it would help his case if the paraphernalia was displayed next to signs [...] "reading generally, forget your troubles, escape from your anxieties, et cetera?" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> came to down {{to where it was}} displayed. If such a sign was next to the records, it would not factor into how the ordinance was enforced, he said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, {{athletic}} director Bobby Dodd {{requested that the}} band no longer play Dixie at basketball games. [...] Dodd later extended this request to football games as well. You've <b>Said</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> (Budweiser) was substituted for Dixie as the song played {{at the end of}} the third quarter of football games and during a later timeout in the second half of basketball games. The song was chosen because of the popularity of the song when the band had played it as part of an advertisement for the Atlanta Beverage Company.|$|E

2500|$|Rugby writers Peter Meares and Maxwell Howell gave {{an account}} of Australia's first 1991 World Cup pool match in Wallaby Legends, [...] "The Pumas made a game of {{it for the first}} twenty minutes, rarely {{allowing}} the Wallabies any possession. Whatever scraps came Australia's way were booted downfield by Michael Lynagh... Campese hadn't touched the ball. The body language <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He stood, hands on hips, legs crossed, leaning against a goalpost." [...] Campese later recalled that [...] "...I took a breather at one stage by leaning against a goalpost. I remember being asked how I could do such a thing during an important game. It was no big deal. Argentina had already had a few scrums on our line, and they were intent on getting a pushover try." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Olympic again {{struck a}} ship. The {{approaches}} to New York {{were marked by}} lightships and Olympic, like other liners, had been known to pass close by these vessels. On 15 May 1934, Olympic, inbound in heavy fog, was homing in on the radio beacon of Nantucket Lightship LV-117. Now {{under the command of}} Captain John Binks, the ship failed to turn in time and sliced through the smaller vessel, which broke apart and sank. Four of the lightship's crew went down with the vessel and seven were rescued, of whom three died of their injuries – thus there were seven fatalities out of a crew of eleven. The lightship's surviving crew and Olympics captain were interviewed soon after reaching shore. [...] One crewman <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> happened so quickly that they didn't know how it happened. [...] The captain was very sorry it happened but said Olympic reacted very quickly lowering boats to rescue the crew, which was confirmed by an injured crewman.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{off season}} for the Lightning began on June 15, 2015, when the {{lightning}} lost in the Stanley Cup final in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks. On June 17, 2015, during exit interviews, Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman stated that his number one priority was to sign Steven Stamkos to a long term contract. Stamkos also expressed his desire to remain with the team when stated that [...] "I've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> along, I want {{to win a championship}} with this group. It's been a great ride this year. I know we'll have some talks, whether it's in the next day or weeks, I don't know. But we'll definitely be getting something worked out hopefully shortly." [...] Yzerman expressed that Stamkos had done everything that the team asked of him and that Stamkos played through an injury during the playoffs. The nature and the extent of the injury were not revealed during exit interviews. Yzerman also addressed the teams goaltending and expected roster changes in his interview. Yzerman stated that he would be really comfortable with Ben Bishop and Andrei Vasilevskiy as the goalies heading into the season. Yzerman also added that he was not looking to move either goalies, and that he'd like to enjoy the tandem for another year or two. When answering questions on the roster, Yzerman said that he did not expect a lot of roster changes by pointing out that Vladislav Namestnikov, Jonathan Drouin, and Nikita Nesterov will get more opportunities with the team in the coming season. On the injury front, Lightning center Tyler Johnson revealed that he was not sure if his broken right wrist would require surgery in the off season. He said that he got hurt in Game one of the Stanley Cup Final when he landed on it after getting checked at mid-ice by Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook. Goalie Ben Bishop said that his groin tear suffered in the final will not require surgery, just rest in the off season.|$|E

Had Ostermore been different, perhaps it had been easier. I cannot say.
