5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, they <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> pincers {{and in some cases}} raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E

While foraging, they {{frequently}} <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|American Beauty was not {{considered}} an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened {{at the end of}} 1999, and US critics <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999, but while the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty, they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, American Beauty won Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay.|$|E

Having by this time spent several decades {{studying}} mysticism and astrology, Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England's rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee's acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico, {{which serves as a}} bridge between Les Invisibles' alien world and ours, and the means to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> influence on Earth. Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E
5|$|Corbulo {{had placed}} {{a large number}} of his {{auxiliaries}} in a line of forts near the Armenian frontier under a former primus pilus, Paccius Orfitus. Disobeying Corbulo's orders, he used some newly arrived auxiliary cavalry alae to stage a raid against the Armenians, who appeared to be unprepared. In the event, his raid failed, and the retreating troops even <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> panic amongst the garrisons of the other forts. It was an inauspicious start for a campaign, and Corbulo severely punished the survivors and their commanders.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Norsk Flytjenesete started {{negotiations}} with the Sandefjord-based conglomerate Kosmos, who were seeking {{to invest in a}} local airline. Kosmos had decided to start a diversification strategy to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> risk. Norsk Flytjeneste was at the time not making money on its routes, but Kosmos was willing to carry the loss as an investment. The airline was sold to Kosmos on 15 April 1985. At the time of the take-over, Norsk Flytjeneste had four Cessna 310s and one Piper Navajo. The airline's seven-passenger Beechcraft 200 and C90 King Airs were already owned by Kosmos. The company was changed from a sole propriatoriship to a limited company. Kjell Riege from Kosmos was appointed managing director while Tor Lundstrøm continued as chief pilot.|$|E

5|$|The Comanches {{operated}} as {{an autonomous}} power inside the area claimed by Spain but not controlled by it. The Comanches used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Mexicans, and Indians through thievery, tribute, and kidnappings, and the Spanish could {{do little to}} stop them because the Comanches controlled most of the horses {{in the region and}} thus had more wealth and mobility. Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanches created a centralized political system, based on a foraging market economy, and a hierarchical social organization.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnu Purana narrates {{another version}} {{of the origins of}} Badrinath. According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar and Narayanboth of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> {{religion}} and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief and}} {{practices}} of the Hanzhong Celestial Masters had a profound legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a significant change from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism a philosophical pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first Celestial Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements, {{as well as the}} medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first Celestial Masters.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera, {{which according to}} archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in {{the decline of the}} Minoan civilization of Crete. This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including Knossos, and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as Rhodes. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others {{did the same with}} a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E

Charlotte {{spent much of}} her time socialising with other ladies, where it was common to pursue activities such as skating, gossiping, and holding dinner parties. She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked and drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning their confidence, only to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> secrets to others.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Texas, Applewhite {{attended}} several universities and, {{as a young}} man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as {{the chair of the}} music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters. Starting in the 1770s, Johnson published more specifically Unitarian works, {{as well as}} texts advocating religious toleration; he also became personally involved in the Unitarian cause. He served as a conduit for information between Dissenters {{across the country and}} supplied provincial publishers with religious publications, thereby enabling Dissenters to <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> beliefs easily. Johnson participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the civil rights of Dissenters. In one six-year period of the 1770s, Johnson was responsible for publishing nearly one-third of the Unitarian works on the issue. He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in Parliament, and he published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they <b>spread</b> <b>their</b> forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
