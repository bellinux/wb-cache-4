40|$|A durable {{design for}} linear flow <b>split</b> <b>sheet</b> {{components}} requires suitable methods and transferability criteria {{which are not}} yet available for bifurcated structures. Knowledge of the cyclic material behaviour is essential for this. For this reason, the cyclic material parameters are determined {{as a function of}} the product's properties (level of deformation, microstructure, surface finish, residual stresses) and different loading parameters. However, since the determination of the cyclic parameters is associated with considerable experimental effort and costs, a cost-effective and easy method is sought to determine these parameters. A very promising approach for this is the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] since they have the ability to generate the influences on the fatigue strength from the manufacturing and environmental parameters using sensibly selected input parameters. They offer the possibility to access acquired knowledge and to thus construct a multidimensional map based on a few tests...|$|E

40|$|Understanding fire {{sprinkler}} sprays fills a critical {{gap in the}} modeling of fire suppression systems. Previous {{research has shown that}} a modeling framework consisting of an instability model coupled with a stochastic transport model can paint most of the sprinkler spray picture, but requires input {{in the form of the}} thickness and velocity of unstable fluid sheets. The model outlined forgoes traditional CFD to solve for water jet-deflector interactions, and instead describes the sheet formation as a potential flow boundary value problem, utilizing a free surface formulation and the superposition of the Green's function. The resulting model allows for the determination of the complete flow field over a {{fire sprinkler}} head of arbitrary geometry and input conditions. A hypothetical axisymmetric sprinkler is explored to provide insight into the impact of sprinkler head geometry on local fluid as well as complete spray behavior. The resulting flow <b>splits,</b> <b>sheet</b> thicknesses, and sheet velocities are presented for various sprinkler head geometries...|$|R
40|$|The {{backs of}} male hairless mice were daily exposed to {{ultraviolet}} radiation mostly composed of 2536 Å wavelength, 6 {{times per week}} {{for a total of}} 9 exposures. Skin specimens were taken 24 hours after the last exposure. Six hours prior to sacrifice, 40 μCi of tritiated thymidine was injected intradermally at each site irradiated. Frozen vertical sections and <b>split</b> epidermal <b>sheets</b> were incubated for the dopa reaction and then processed with auto-radiographic labeling technique. The uptake of tritiated thymidine by epidermal melanocytes was seen in the autoradiograms using vertical sections but not in those using <b>split</b> epidermal <b>sheets.</b> Cell counts revealed that approximately 1. 1 per cent of dopa-positive melanocytes were labeled. It seems unlikely, based on our results, that the populational increase in melanocytes during repeated ultraviolet radiation is due exclusively to the proliferation of melanocytes. Accordingly, it would suggest that the increase in melanocytes is induced through activation of pigment formation in inactive melanocytes or another possible mechanism as yet undemonstrated in addition to the proliferation of melanocytes...|$|R

By boiling, or exposing it to heat in hot sand, {{it is made}} quite soft, and can be moulded into whatever shape you will. Not only this, {{but it can also}} be welded by heating and pressing two edges together, which, however, must be quite clean and free from grease, even the touch of the hand taints them. Sheets of horn are a well-known substitute for glass, and are made as follows:--The horn is left to soak for a fortnight in a pond; then it is well washed, to separate the pith; next it is sawn lengthwise, and boiled till it can be easily <b>split</b> into <b>sheets</b> with a chisel; which sheets are again boiled, then scraped to a uniform thickness, and set into shape to dry. Tortoiseshell and whalebone can be softened and worked in the same way.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the relics of rock joints caulked with lead strips, unearthed {{by the authors}} in 2007 and 2008. The relics were in ancient quarry caverns in Shepan Island, Zhejiang Province, eastern China. The quarry activities were mainly carried out for production of regular tuff stone plates about 800 years ago. Each of the lead strips was sealed into a rock joint by punching manually and carefully. At present, the lead strips still contact tightly with the rock joints and new mineral cerussite is found to have formed at the contact surfaces between the lead strip and its caulked rock joint. The use of lead strips caulking rock joints in quarry caverns is found for prevention of water from seeping {{out of the country}} rocks into quarry cavern bases, where all of the in-situ intact tuff rock was manually and near-horizontally split into thin rock sheets one by one for production of regular tuff plates. Furthermore, it is found that the tensile <b>splitting</b> of tuff <b>sheets</b> at the cavern base required the intact rocks at the cavern base had to be dry. Through this horizontal base <b>splitting</b> for tuff <b>sheets</b> from the top to the bottom, a dome-shape interior space was formed for each rock cavern with the near horizontal imprints of thin sheet layers permanently on the sidewalls. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Geologically, the Breitenthal area is {{characterized}} by slate (stratigraphy: Hunsrück slate; petrography: claystone and siltstone with traces of sandstone). This arose from clayey/sandy depositions from great rivers on the Old Red Continent that were submerged in a deep sea, sinking to the sea floor in the Upper Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous. These deposits were later folded and, {{as part of the}} Variscan orogeny, once more lifted up. The tectonic forces along a southeast-northwest axis during this folding were what gave rise to the almost upright-standing slate areas, which were also thereby given the fissility that allowed them to be <b>split</b> into thin <b>sheets</b> that would be so important much later on to the local economy.|$|R
40|$|All {{conventional}} paper machines {{exhibit a}} profile of cross-machine direction (CD) shrinkage which is developed during the drying stage of production. This paper suggests {{a new approach to}} the understanding of these profiles by suggesting that CD shrinkage at a point in the paper depends on the distance of that point from both edges of the sheet and also on the length of the unsupported draws in the dryer section. The nature of the func-tion is unimportant as long as it can be made to fit data for one combination of machine width and effective draw length; substi-tuting other values will then change the shape appropriately. In this paper, a simple exponential decay of shrinkage with distance from the edge is used successfully. This approach is initially demonstrated for laboratory results from the literature, where it successfully predicts changes pro-duced by varying the length, width and by reversing the MD/CD orientation of samples. It is then shown to be consistent for changes of paper machine furnish, press section draw and sheet grammage produced in a series of trials on M-real, New Thames PM 6. It is finally shown that theses ideas explain the effect on CD shrinkage results from the literature for <b>splitting</b> the <b>sheet</b> at th...|$|R
40|$|Depigmentary {{effect of}} 4 -tertiary butyl {{catechol}} (TBC) on UV-stimulated melanocytes on the flanks and naturally active melanocytes of ears were compared in Uscd strain hairless mice. UVB irradiation, {{twice a week}} for 1 or 2 mo, induced brown-black pigmentation on the flanks. A 1 m TBC application twice a week for 1 mo not only prevented the UV-stimulated pigmentation, but also promoted fading of the post-UV tanning. Dopastained <b>split</b> epidermal <b>sheets</b> showed {{a decrease in the}} number of melanocytes to less than one-half during the first month of TBC treatment. Melanocytes were often enlarged or lost their dendrites and both premelanosomes and melanosomes showed ultrastructural changes. However, TBC application on the ears for 1 mo showed neither color change nor a {{decrease in the number of}} melanocytes. There were ultrastrutural changes in melanocytes but the degree of abnormality was much less than those seen in UV-stimulated melanocytes. Continuation of TBC application for 2 month with the UV irradiation on the flanks or the nonirradiated ears caused an increase in the number of melanocytes. These results suggest that the initial effect of TBC may be primarily cytotoxicity to melanocytes and may correlated with their cellular functions. The stimulatory effects of TBC on melanocytes seen during the longer period of times requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Using <b>split</b> {{epidermal}} <b>sheets</b> {{treated with}} colchicine, a quantitative study {{was carried out}} on hairless mouse epidermal melanocytes and those in mitosis, during 14 daily exposures to UV. It was demonstrated that the mitotic figures were first noted after 3 days of irradiation and their incidence varied with the duration of UV treatment; the number of cells in arrested mitosis during the 3 hour period was 0. 2 – 0. 4, 0. 6 – 0. 7 and 1. 0 – 1. 3 per cent of dopa-positive melanocytes, respectively, after 3, 5 and 7 to 14 days of exposure. Comparison of those values {{and the rate of}} population increase of melanocytes indicates that the numerical increase in melanocytes during the first 5 days is attributable largely to a mechanism other than the division of melanocytes. In addition, {{it is likely that the}} population increase between the 5 th to 14 th days is due, to a considerable extent, to a similar process. In regard to the mechanism accounting for the population increase in melanocytes, the following processes or possibilities, other than the division of melanocytes are discussed: the activation of pigment formation in amelanogenic melanocytes and the migration of dermal melanocytes into the epidermis...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{relativistic}} LDA Fermi surface of Sr(2) RuO(4) to direct experimental evidence of spin-orbit coupling from de Haas-van Alphen experiments. The k-dependence of the Zeeman splitting at the Fermi surface is modelled {{with a range}} of tight binding models of the quasi-particle bands. Only a very restricted class of parameters are consistent with evidence from the de Haas-van Alphen experiments for a strong k-dependent Zeeman splitting on the alpha Fermi surface sheet. The bare LDA bands do not lead to such a strong k-dependent Zeeman <b>splitting</b> on this <b>sheet,</b> and this suggests that additional charge transfer takes place as suggested by DMFT calculations.

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional P-wave {{velocity}} {{structure of}} the mantle beneath the South Pacific Superswell is determined through passive broadband seismic experiments {{on the ocean floor}} and islands between 2003 and 2005. We collected approximately 1500 relative times of long-period teleseismic P-waves by using a waveform cross-correlation. We analyzed this data set with relative time tomography to depths of 2000 km. The resultant structure shows lateral heterogeneity of approximately +/- 2 %, in which a distinct low velocity region is found beneath the center of the Superswell at a depth of 1600 km. At 1200 km depth, an elongated low velocity region is found beneath the Society to Pitcairn hotspots. At 800 km depth, two linear low velocity regions are located beneath Tuamotu and Austral islands. Isolated low velocity regions are identified beneath the Society, Marquesas, and Macdonald hotspots at 400 km depth.
