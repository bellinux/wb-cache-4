40|$|Introduction: Single sample TWA samples {{collected}} over an 8 -hour shift {{have the potential}} to mask elevated exposures, excursions or “peaks” that may have occurred thus permitting situations where workers are over-exposed or indeed over-dosed. The objectives of this study, undertaken in a small acrylic sheet manufacturing plant, are therefore to identify tasks that {{have the potential to}} exceed <b>short-term</b> occupational <b>exposure</b> levels and then simultaneously monitor employees undertaking these tasks for 8 -hour TWA and <b>Short-Term</b> <b>exposure</b> concentrations. The results obtained from this sampling are then compared to their respective legal limits and then finally correlated to establish their statistical significance. Materials and Methods: The study setting comprises a syrup room wherein two employees are assigned per shift. Employees in this setting manufacture an acrylic “syrup” which is achieved by dosing raw materials into any one of 13 mixing vessels. Whilst mixing, these vessels also heat the ingredients until the required viscosity is reached. This “syrup” comprising mostly of liquid methyl methacrylate, is then decanted into a pressure vessel from where it is pipe-fed into a casting chamber and finally poured between two glass sheets. When cured, the final product is stored and sold as a clear or tinted acrylic sheet. All operations with this area are therefore associated with facilitating the syrup manufacture. Personal 8 -hour TWA and Task- Based measurements of methyl methacrylate vapour were simultaneously obtained from the breathing zones of six employees over five separate shifts. These employees routinely work within the setting and also undertake tasks that have the potential to exceed the <b>Short-Term</b> Occupational <b>Exposure</b> <b>Limit</b> (ST-OEL) for methyl methacrylate vapour. Tasks were studied and those selected for quantitative monitoring were captured using a qualitative risk assessment tool. These selections were based on studying each task to establish the employee’s exposure probability and severity i. e. whether performing the task could indeed lead to excessive <b>Short-Term</b> <b>exposures.</b> Eight-hour TWA monitoring was undertaken using activated carbon 3 M 3500 passive monitoring badges which were attached to each of the subject’s breathing zone and left over 80...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of the Gilian TRACEAIR Organic Vapor Monitoring I (OVMI) Diffusive Badge in measuring <b>short-term</b> benzene <b>exposures</b> under field conditions. In general, a diffusive badge is a device which is capable of taking samples of gas or vapor pollutants from the atmosphere at a rate controlled by a physical process such as diffusion through a static layer. Diffusive badges continue to flood the industrial hygiene market as an alternative means to charcoal tubes for sampling organic vapors. The OVMI badge has been on the market since 1990, and is the only diffusive sampler that offers dual sampling rates for measuring organic vapors. This dual sampling rate feature allows one the flexibility of sampling at 3 5 to I 00 mL/@n depending on the vapors being sampled. The OVM I badge has been designed to monitor <b>short-term</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (STEL) and long-term limits with only negligible modifications to the badge housing. Side-by-side benzene STEL concentrations were measured in a Texas Gulf Coast refinery implementing two OVM I badges, an SKC charcoal tube, and a Tedlar bag used for gas chromatograph analyses. The results of the study indicated that a) no significant concentration {{differences were found between the}} badges; b) the badges overestimated the charcoal tube on average by 54 %, although their performance comparisons were highly predictable based on linear regression; and c) the results of the Tedlar baga?s chromatograph comparisons were inconclusive. Factors which might have contributed to the discrepancy between the charcoal tube and badges are possible concentration gradients and starvation effects occurring at the samplers' inlet face, interference from other competing vapors, and an overestimated badge sampling rate when sampling at the maximum uptake rate. Collectively, the outcomes of this research suggests that a correction factor in the badge's sampling rate might prove useful as a means of correcting for short-term overestimations when sampling for benzene under field conditions. It is hoped that the contents of this research serve as an useful aid for those specifically interested in the OVMI badge and for those whose line of work involve passive sampling...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This article compares 2 {{variants}} of logging technologies at the motor-manual level: variant A – cutting and delimbing {{by means of}} a petrol chainsaw, skidding {{with the use of a}} cable winch mounted on a tractor (67 – 74 kW); variant B – cutting {{by means of a}} petrol chainsaw, skidding, debranching and cutting to length by means of a processor aggregated with a farm tractor (61 kW). Material and Methods: Direct dosimetry and non-parametric (moving block bootstrap) methods were used in order to specify the characteristics of the collected sets. Results: Bootstrap average values show that the average CO concentration at a skidding tractor operator’s station during early thinning was 2. 54 mg×m– 3. At processor operator’s station it amounted to 10. 35 mg×m– 3. Such results allow to conclude that a higher CO concentration at the above-mentioned 2 work stations was observed during early thinning.

Alternatively, statistical models describing the dose-effect relations may be used. The duration of the toxicity study used may depend on the expected human exposure. By means of the RIVM programme PROAST (possible risk obtained from animal studies) the toxic effect can be estimated.

One possible cause of sensitization may be as a result of high exposures over short periods. Short-term sampling has been hampered by inadequate sampling and analysis techniques. This investigation has used two types of personal inhalable sampler, with ICP-MS analysis, to take 15 min TWA soluble platinum exposure measurements at three sites. The lower detection limit for soluble platinum salts was approximately 0. 01 ug m~ 3 for IS min samples, allowing exposures two orders of magnitude below the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> to be measured. It was found that the majority of <b>short-term</b> <b>exposure</b> levels were significantly below 0. 006 mg m~ 3. No evidence was found for altered work practices during sampling, indicating that either sensitization is occurring at airborne exposure levels below the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit,</b> or there is an alternate route of exposure. iCrown copyright © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
