This is a sheath knife that partially retracts {{into the}} handle, {{and has a}} small scabbard cap covering the remaining blade tip. The design utilizes a specialized belt hanger/holsters that grasps the retracted blade so the blade is pulled fully open when unholstering. It is a unique compact fixed blade alternative. During the 1990s, a similar sheath-activated sliding knife with embossed Red <b>Star</b> <b>handle</b> was sold in the United States, {{claimed to be a}} police knife from the People's Republic of China.

40|$|The 'modern ' {{bathroom}} is an {{area which}} poses considerable barriers to the elderly, specifically a mismatch between the shape and the placement of faucet handles and their physiological capabilities. Fifteen residents of a retirement facility, {{with a mean age}} of 79. 9 years, exerted their maximum turning torques in a randomized fully-crossed design incorporating the following factors: two positions (low- 21 inches and high- 42 inches), two angles (45 ' and 90 ') and three types of handles (acrylic, star, and lever). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the data indicated that the type of handle and the position, along with the covariates: age, gender and subject height, were significant at p<. O 5. Angle and the covariates: weight and arthritis were not significant, most likely because weight is correlated with height and arthritis with age. The second order interactions of handle-angle and position-angle were also significant at p<. 05. being 50 % greater than those from the acrylic and star handles. levels on the acrylic handle and the <b>star</b> <b>handle</b> were very similar, with the acrylic handle slightly superior in the 45 O-angled position and the <b>star</b> <b>handle</b> being slightly better in the 9 O 0 -angled position. Overall, the 45 O- 10 ~ position resulted in the lowest torques, while the 45 O high position resulted in the highest torques. Age had a profound effect, with torque values decreasing an average of 10 % over the 15 year age span of the subjects. Based on the study, it is recommended that plumbing systems with both high (42 inches) and low (21 inches) faucets with lever handles be installed where ever possible. The lever handle was clearly superior with average torques produced Torqu...|$|E

50|$|The American Line was a {{shipping}} company founded in 1871 and based in Philadelphia. It began {{as part of}} the Pennsylvania Railroad, although the railroad got out of the shipping business soon after founding the company. In 1902, it became part of the International Navigation Co., with the American Line generally handling traffic between the United States ports of Philadelphia and New York City and the British ports of Liverpool and Southampton. Sister company Red <b>Star</b> Line <b>handled</b> traffic between America and the European continent, primarily through Antwerp, Belgium. The company's most prominent president was Clement Griscom, who led the company from 1888 to 1902 and worked as a company executive for its entire existence. During its existence, the company was the largest American shipping company, rivalled only by the smaller, Baltimore-based Atlantic Transport Lines, although this distinction is a marginal one, as all American oceanic shipping concerns were dwarfed by British companies such as the White Star Line or Cunard Line and German ones such as HAPAG.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of a MIMO-CDMA communication system which is based on the concept of SPATIOTEMPORAL ARRAY (<b>STAR)</b> manifold for <b>handling</b> multipath fading channels. Firstly a MIMO frequency selective channel is modelled as a function of both transmitter’s and receiver’s antenna-array manifold vectors. Then, assuming knowledge of the channel parameters of the desired user, two linear receivers are proposed. The proposed receivers are ’nearfar’ resistant and expressed in terms of the STAR manifold vector of the desired user. The investigation is supported by computer simulation studies where the performance of the proposed receivers is compared to the performance of conventional MMSE and RAKE receivers which have been also extended in order to beexpressedintermsoftheSTARmanifoldvectors...|$|R
