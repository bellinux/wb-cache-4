The plant was designed, built and owned by Power Systems Engineering (PSE) in 1970-1972. (PSE was later incorporated into DESTEC Energy after being acquired by Dow in 1989. DESTEC later morphed into Dynegy a major independent power generating company.)Unlike most industrial generating plants, {{there was to be}} no process <b>steam</b> <b>requirement</b> for the Salt Grass plant; all output from the plant was to be in the form of electric energy. The design objective was to use the largest gas turbines available and, based on prior experience, to use unfired heat recovery boilers for operating simplicity and improved reliability. All steam was used to drive 4 identical 25MW steam turbines coupled to the gas turbines at the outboard end of the generators (which in turn were mounted on the cold compressor-end of the rotor). The plant comprised four separate single-shaft combined cycle units for maximum operating flexibility. It also included a start-up boiler to enable the steam turbines to be used to start the gas turbines.|$|E
50|$|The {{steaming}} area {{is covered}} with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The <b>steam</b> <b>requirement</b> is approximately 7-8 kg/m². The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.|$|E

Also, it is required to make to evaluate the amount of steam saved by the use of vapour compression. The use of vapour compression allows us to use the energy in the vapour leaving the last effect. Since evaporators are energy intensive system, use of vapour compression can considerably reduce steam consumption, but at the cost of electrical energy needed to run the compressor. To achieve above targets a model based on nonlinaer equations is developed to design the multiple effect evaporator system of seven effects to concentrate black liquor. For this system, first the live <b>steam</b> <b>requirement</b> will be evaluated for the evaporator without any vapour compression. Then vapour compression will be used and the live <b>steam</b> <b>requirement</b> will be calculated. Also the cost for compression of the steam should been taken into account.

40|$|AbstractThe {{overall goal}} of this work was to show {{experimentally}} using a CO 2 capture plant of reasonable capacity the contributions of plant and solvent optimization to minimizing the <b>steam</b> <b>requirement.</b> Experimental studies were conducted in an optimized CO 2 capture pilot plant to evaluate the performance of RS- 1 solvent and 5 molar aqueous MEA. The first objective was to test a highly improved plant configuration that can minimize both the amine circulation rate and the steam requirements below the values {{reported in the literature}} for a desired CO 2 recovery. The second objective was to show the superior performance of RS- 1 relative to 5  molar MEA. Both these strategies were aimed at reducing the <b>steam</b> <b>requirement</b> without increasing the size or complexity of the CO 2 capture plant. The pilot plant used for the tests was the highly optimized multi-purpose technology development plant at the International Test Center for CO 2 capture which processes 186  Nm 3 /h of flue gas to produce CO 2 with a nominal capacity of 1 tonne per day. This plant has 12 -inch ID for the absorber and stripper columns. The inlet flue gas temperature was 40 ∘C while the CO 2 concentrations in the flue gas were 4 and 8 % based on exhaust gases obtained respectively from a natural gas turbine-natural gas boiler combination, and a natural gas boiler. The results show that for flue gas containing 4 and 8 % CO 2 for a 90 % recovery or absorber efficiency, the steam duties using our optimized plant configuration were respectively 2. 03 and 1. 43  kg steam/kg CO 2 for MEA as compared to industry and literature values based on conventional plant configuration in the range of 1. 9 to 2. 5  kg steam/kg CO 2 depending on the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet out the <b>steam</b> <b>requirement,</b> to {{safeguard}} the boiler water tubes and to safe guard the turbine blades the boiler drum water level control {{plays an important role}} in thermal power station. The main objective of the boiler–turbine system control is to meet the load demand of electric power while maintaining the pressure and water level in the drum within tolerances This paper demonstrates the increase in efficiency and energy savings by using the three element mode method of drum level control and compares it to the the traditional DP mode. Traditionally in most power stations, the DP mode of operation is used because it is believed it provides more robust control of the throttle valve, however throttling losses do occur. This is primarily because it is a linear system of control. The linear system of control causes more losses and hence greater power consumption. Three element mode reduces these throttling losses by measuring the steam level, steam rate flow as well as the water level simultaneously, thereby resulting in a lesser loss of pressure and hence lesser demand. Pressure drop across the throttle valve can be optimized more efficiently using this method of control and the observations and results regarding this have been discussed. The results found were very encouraging and the method can be applied widely to all sub critical boiler systems across the power industry. KEYWORDS- boiler, three element, FRS, control valve.

Because the heat of fusion of ice (6. 01 kJ/mol) is six times less than the heat of evaporation of water (40. 65 kJ/mol), the energy required to separate the water as ice is significantly less than that required to separate it by evaporation. However, the energy costs for freezing will be dominated by the cost of electricity to the compressor as opposed to heating costs for Evaporative Crystallization which depend primarily on the <b>steam</b> <b>requirement.</b> This paper presents an EFC brine treatment protocol developed by the Crystallization and Precipitation Unit at the University of Cape Town {{for the treatment of}} multi-component, hypersaline brines.

40|$|A novel {{reactor system}} is {{presented}} and investigated {{for the production}} of a hydrogen rich gas stream for power or ammonia production, based on pre-combustion chemical looping (PCCL) technology using dynamically operated packed bed reactors. In this process, the oxygen carrier (OC) is alternately oxidized with a gas mixture of air and steam to produce a H 2 /N 2 product gas stream combining oxidation by air and water-splitting, and subsequently reduced with syngas producing a concentrated CO 2 stream. The process is carried out at elevated pressure, but at intermediate temperature (in the range of 600 - 900 °C), which allows circumventing the extremely high temperatures required in chemical-looping combustion. In addition, the N 2 /H 2 gas stream can be produced at the required composition for ammonia production, rendering this process also competitive with the conventional ammonia production. A preliminary experimental study has been carried out in a 2 kWth packed bed reactor using an iron-based oxygen carrier. The influence of the operating temperature and the initial solid composition during the oxidation cycle on the H 2 -rich gas yield has been investigated. The complete reduction to pure iron reduces the reactivity of the material due to sintering, whereas a controlled reduction to wüstite (FeO) allows to maintain a higher stability of the material, although the oxygen capacity is decreased. A preliminary thermodynamic assessment of the integrated PCCL plant for power production with natural gas has been carried out reaching an electrical efficiency of 49 - 51. 5 % (depending on the plant arrangement) with a carbon capture rate above 95 %.

30|$|In the {{bottling}} company. In this industry, it {{was observed}} that the electricity supply is 100 % from three 800 -kV A diesel generators, while thermal energy for the boiler is from low pour fuel oil (LPFO). Two out of the three diesel generators are run at a time (24 [*]h/day), and the other stays on standby. To say the least, this scenario is a replicate of most industries in Nigeria which is indeed a sad commentary of the electricity supply situation in the country. In terms of energy efficiency, the compounding wastes along the energy supply line are better imagined. The scenario in the bottling company in relation to energy efficiency is that a 10 -bar, 2 -tonnes/h capacity, LPFO-fired steam boiler produces steam at a pressure of 4 to 5 bars (about 140 °C to 150 °C) used in bottle washing that requires hot water at a temperature of about 80 °C to 90 °C. It was observed that the steam produced at a high temperature of about 140 °C has to be throttled to reduce the temperature to the required level for bottle washing. Ironically, the runoff water from the final washing stage comes out at a temperature of 60 °C to 70 °C and is emptied into the drain. While this practice is considered proper {{from the point of view}} of avoidance of contamination, it is suggested that a low pressure steam boiler operated at 2 bars can meet the <b>steam</b> <b>requirement</b> and thus save thermal energy. Furthermore, in the compressed air unit, the water-cooled single-stage compressor delivers at a temperature of about 80 °C, while the cooling water comes off at 60 °C and is again let off the drain.
