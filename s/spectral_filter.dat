40|$|Background/Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} what impact Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters</b> have on the sensory profile of students who have Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The intention was to add to the understanding of the sensory difficulties experienced by these students and the impact these difficulties have on student learning. Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters</b> are precision tinted (coloured) ophthalmic lenses, or contacts lenses, that may be used to relieve symptoms related to atypical visual sensory processing. Method: Six students who identified as having Autism Spectrum Disorder and who wore Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters</b> volunteered to participate in the study. The ages of the students ranged from 16 years of age to 51 years of age. The participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire and two Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) questionnaires. Each participant was asked to complete one AASP questionnaire to reflect their sensory experiences when they do not wear their Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters,</b> and the other AASP questionnaire to reflect their sensory experiences when the do wear their Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters.</b> Only three participants who returned the survey met the inclusion criteria. The participant’s sensory experiences, when they do not and when they do wear their Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters</b> were measured using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) questionnaire. Each of the participants AASP scores and their responses to each of the AASP sensory statements were compared. Results: When comparing the two AASP scores of each participant, it was noted that the participants’ scores in each sensory quadrant on the AASP varied between the two conditions, when they do not wear their Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters,</b> and when they do wear their Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters.</b> Two of the three participants indicated a reduction in sensory scores in every AASP sensory quadrant when they wear their Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters.</b> The other participant indicated a reduction in scores in three AASP sensory quadrants, and an increase in the fourth sensory quadrant. Conclusion: Irlen <b>Spectral</b> <b>Filters</b> may have an effect on the sensory behaviours exhibited by the students in this study. This effect may have a positive impact in their ability to engage in learning. The findings of this pilot study need to be confirmed with further research.

40|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> was {{compared}} with traditional mean spatial filters {{to assess their}} ability to identify and remove striped artefacts in digital elevation data. The techniques were applied to two datasets: a 100 m contour derived digital elevation model (DEM) of southern Norway and a 2 m LiDAR DSM of the Lake District, UK. Both datasets contained diagonal data artefacts that were found to propagate into subsequent terrain analysis. <b>Spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> used fast Fourier transformation (FFT) frequency data to identify these data artefacts in both datasets. These {{were removed from the}} data by applying a cut filter, prior to the inverse transform. <b>Spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> showed considerable advantages over mean spatial filters, when both the absolute and spatial distribution of elevation changes made were examined. Elevation changes from the <b>spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> were restricted to frequencies removed by the cut filter, were small in magnitude and consequently avoided any global smoothing. <b>Spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> was found to avoid the smoothing of kernel based data editing, and provided a more informative measure of data artefacts present in the FFT frequency domain. Artefacts were found to be heterogeneous through the surfaces, a result of their strong correlations with spatially autocorrelated variables: landcover and landsurface geometry. <b>Spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> performed better on the 100 m DEM, where signal and artefact were clearly distinguishable in the frequency data. Spectrally filtered digital elevation datasets were found to provide a superior and more precise representation of the landsurface and be a more appropriate dataset for any subsequent geomorphological applications...|$|R

50|$|AOPDF is a {{programmable}} <b>spectral</b> <b>filter.</b> From {{signal processing}} point of view, the AOPDF {{corresponds to a}} time-variant passive linear transversal filter with a programmable finite impulse response. Phase and amplitude filtering in the AOPDF is achieved by virtue of birefringent acousto-optic effect and can be represented by a convolution between the amplitude of the input optical signal Ein(t) and a programmable acoustical signal S(t/α) proportional to the electrical signal S(t) applied to the Piezoelectric transducer (made typically from lithium niobate). Here, α is a scaling factor equal to {{the ratio of the}} speed of sound v to the speed of light c times the index difference Δn between the ordinary and the extraordinary waves taken along the propagation axis in the crystal. In the limit of low diffraction efficiency the AOPDF behaves as a linear filter and the small value of the α (typically 10−7) allows for the quantitative control of optical signals with frequencies of tens to hundreds terahertz with electrical signals of tens of megahertz, which are readily produced by commercial waveform generators.|$|E

With the arrival of large-format detector arrays in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of new snapshot hyperspectral imaging techniques were developed {{to take advantage of}} the new technology: a method which uses a fiber bundle at the image plane and reformatting the fibers in the opposite end of the bundle to a long line, viewing a scene through a 2D grating and reconstructing the multiplexed data with computed tomography mathematics, the (lenslet-based) integral field spectrograph, a modernized version of Bowen's image slicer.

40|$|An {{important}} component of the cone photoreceptors of bird eyes is the oil droplets located in front of the visual-pigment-containing outer segments. The droplets vary in colour and are transparent, clear, pale or rather intensely yellow or red owing to various concentrations of carotenoid pigments. Quantitative modelling of the filter characteristics using known carotenoid pigment spectra indicates that the pigments' absorption spectra are modified by the high concentrations that are present in the yellow and red droplets. The high carotenoid concentrations not only cause strong <b>spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> but also a distinctly increased refractive index at longer wavelengths. The oil droplets therefore act as powerful spherical microlenses, effectively channelling the spectrally filtered light into the photoreceptor's outer segment, possibly thereby compensating for the light loss caused by the <b>spectral</b> <b>filtering.</b> The <b>spectral</b> <b>filtering</b> causes narrow-band photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, which are well suited for spectral discrimination, especially in birds that have feathers coloured by carotenoid pigments...|$|R
