50|$|Avian {{infectious}} bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens. The disease {{is caused by}} avian {{infectious bronchitis}} virus (IBV), a coronavirus, and characterized by respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge. In young chickens, severe respiratory distress may occur. In layers, respiratory distress, nephritis, decrease in egg production, and loss of internal (watery egg white) and external (fragile, soft, irregular or rough shells, <b>shell-less)</b> <b>egg</b> quality are reported.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} of eggshell quality to tibia status and production parameters in laying hens was evaluated in three trials. Hens were fed commercial-type layer diets for 12 wk, and {{data were collected}} for evaluation during the last 2 wk of egg production. Hens were killed at oviposition and 10 h postoviposition, and tibiae were removed to determine tibia status, tibia weight, tibia strength, and percentage bone. Eggs collected {{were used to determine}} shell quality, shell weight, shell thickness, shell strength, percentage shell, and specific gravity. There was no relationship between shell quality and tibia weight or tibia strength at oviposition. Percentage bone, however, was negatively correlated with shell quality (specific gravity,-. 308; shell weight,-. 363; and percentage shell,-. 265). At 10 h postoviposition, tibia strength was negatively correlated with shell quality (specific gravity,-. 184; shell weight,-. 195; percentage shell,-. 187) for birds with a <b>shell-less</b> <b>egg</b> in the oviduct. This negative relationship was also seen when birds had no egg in the oviduct (tibia strength and specific gravity,-. 501; tibia strength and shell weight,-. 181; tibia strength and percentage shell,-. 160). Results indicate a relationship between shell quality and tibia status during eggshell formation, suggesting possible resorption of the cortical bone of tibia in conjunction with the medullary bone during eggshell calcification.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of pre-incubation weight of eggs (EW) laid by 24 wk-old brown laying breeders on egg production from 18 (start of egg production) to 22 wk of age (average egg production across EW treatments of 87. 8 %). The experiment consisted in 7 treatments based on the initial EW (47 to 53 g with 1 g difference between groups) Average BW of the extreme groups varied at hatching from 32. 5 to 35. 4 g, respectively. Feed intake, egg production, and egg weight were recorded weekly by replicate {{as well as for}} the entire experiment (18 to 22 wk of age). Hens were weighed by replicate at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. From these data, ADFI, egg production, egg weight, egg mass, feed conversion ratio per kilogram of eggs and per dozen of eggs, and BW gain were calculated by week and for the entire experiment. Also, the number of dirty, broken, and <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs</b> was recorded daily by replicate in all eggs produced. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with 7 treatments differing in the initial pre-hatching EW. Effects of EW on the variables studied were partitioned into linear and quadratic components. EW did not affect the age at which pullets reached 50 % egg production, cumulative egg production, or BW gain of the hens from 18 to 22 wk of age. Egg weight and the proportion of dirty, broken, and <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs</b> were not affected by the BW of the pullets at hatching. In summary, small eggs (> 47 g) laid by young, healthy laying breeders, can be used successfully to produce high quality pullet...|$|R

40|$|The time-course of {{the changes}} in blood ionized calcium, and in plasma 1, 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) {{concentrations}} and its free index were studied in hens following suppression and resumption of shell formation and throughout the laying cycle in hens laying hard-shelled eggs, in hens fed a low or normal calcium diet and in hens laying <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs.</b> The respective roles of the calcium needs for shell formation and of the reproductive status in regulation of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 production were analysed. Plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 decreased 3 hr after suppression of shell formation following premature egg expulsion and remained lower than that of hens laying hard-shelled eggs when premature expulsion of the eggs was continued for several days. Circulating 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 tended to increase progressively when shell formation was resumed. Ablation of the parathyroid glands abolished this increase. In hens laying hard-shelled eggs, the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was higher during the period of shell secretion. Feeding hens a low calcium diet (1. 2 %) caused a marked increase in the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Ionized calcium levels tended to show reciprocal changes to plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 decreasing when calcification took place and increasing after its suppression. In hypercalcemic hens laying <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs</b> and fed a 3. 5 % Ca diet, the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was at a high level 4 hr after ovulation and diminished thereafter. This additive stimulation does not, therefore, involve the parathyroid gland and may involve hormonal changes induced by ovulation. Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in the plasma was at a high level in mature hens and was not affected by shell formation. Consequently, the free 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 index fluctuated in parallel with total level of this hormone in mature hens. It is concluded that the calcium demand for shell formation modulates, in the short term, plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, via the homeostatic regulation of blood calcium by PTH, but that a large part of its increase is independent of PTH and is associated with the endocrine events concomitant with ovulation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{inactivated vaccine}} was {{prepared}} from local isolates of egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus using aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. A total of 30 commercial layers {{at the age}} of 16 weeks were procured and divided in to two groups, A and B having 20 and 10 birds, respectively. The birds of group A were vaccinated with 0. 5 ml aluminium hydroxide gel adsorbed EDS vaccine. The birds of group B were kept as unvaccinated control. The serum samples were collected at a 14 -day interval till 6 weeks post vaccination. At 22 weeks of age group A was again divided into two groups A and A Birds of 1 2. group A and group B were challenged with a virulent EDS virus. The results revealed that birds of group 2 A had HI titer ranging from 1 : 128 to 1 : 512 at different times of sample collection with a geometric mean titer 116. Highest antibody response appeared on 4 th week post vaccination. Results also revealed that the vaccination protected the birds against challenge with the virulent EDS virus. Where there was a significant drop in egg production in unvaccinated challenged birds.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs,</b> and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of oviposition rate, type, and variability {{on the production}} of uncollectible eggs (UC, soft-shelled and <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs)</b> were studied in a pedigreed randombred flock of White Leghorn hens. These factors were investigated by using the chi-square test of association and by examining the genetic and environmental correlations between the percentage of uncollectible eggs (%UC), percentage of hard-shelled eggs (%HS), the interoviposition time (IOT), shell weight, percentage of shell (%SH), egg weight, contents weight (yolk + albumen), log variance of the interoviposition time (LV), and ZRUN, a statistic characterizing the randomness of the laying cycle. The results indicated that 51 % of the variation among birds for %UC was due to genetic causes. The correlations of %UC with IOT, %HS, LV, and ZRUN were small and conservatively nonsignificant (P>. 25). Thus, neither oviposition rate nor irregularities in the laying cycle appear to be affiliated with %UC production. By contrast, {{there was a significant}} (P<. 01) correlation (negative and genetic) between %UC and %SH. These results suggest that UC may be related to a problem with shell quality. The frequency association of UC with HS egg production snowed that the majority of UC were the result of a single oviposition; and if two eggs were produced in the same day, both were most likely to be HS. Also, the chi-square test indicated that the production of the two egg types was not independent. In particular, an excess of UC was produced as the only egg that day, indicating that the production of an UC egg precludes the production of a normal egg, and vice-versa.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -binding protein (DBP) was measured, by immunodiffusion, {{in the blood}} of chickens from embryonic stages to sexual maturity. Low levels of DBP and 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 were detectable {{in the blood of}} chick embryos from the 12 th and 17 th day of incubation respectively and stayed at the same low levels until hatching. The blood {{concentration of}} DBP doubled between the 1 st and 5 th days of life, then increased slowly and reached the mean level of the adult male at 7 - 8 weeks of age. The concentration of DBP was independent of vitamin D status in growing chickens. A large increase was observed in DBP blood levels in hens just before sexual maturity. This change, and those observed in moulting hens, followed the variations in plasma concentrations of oestradiol more closely than those of progesterone or testosterone. Moreover, a large increase in plasma DBP levels was induced in immature chickens by oestradiol (0. 5 mg/day), but not by testosterone or progesterone. Finally, the experimental suppression of egg shell formation and the associated decrease in 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 plasma levels had no effect on plasma DBP concentrations. However, 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 and DBP levels were higher in hens laying <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs</b> than in immature pullets. The increases in DBP levels at hatching, in immature pullets treated with oestrogens, in hens laying uncalcified eggs and at the onset of egg production were associated with increases in 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, suggesting a relationship between the levels of DBP and 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 in the blood. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal calbindin {{synthesis}} in {{laying hens}} was analyzed to assess controlling factors operating during egg formation. In {{the absence of}} vitamin D, calbindin was not induced by estrogen and testosterone. In immature vitamin D-replete pullet, blood levels of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 increased in response to estrogen but the duodenal concentration of calbindin and its mRNA were increased only when testosterone was given together with estrogen. The plasma concentration of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and the duodenal levels of calbindin and its mRNA were substantially higher in laying hens than in immature pullets. No differences in these parameters were observed between the stages of the ovulatory cycle. Suppression of shell formation for a week decreased the concentration of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and of duodenal calbindin but {{did not affect the}} level of its mRNA. When egg shell formation resumed in hens previously laying <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs,</b> the concentrations of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and of calbindin and its mRNA increased toward the end of shell formation. A most important factor regulating intestinal calbindin synthesis in laying hens turned out to be 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Intestinal calbindin mRNA is more stable in laying hens than in young birds as its concentration declines more slowly when the stimulation provided by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 is withdrawn, as occurs following suppression of shell formation and after parathyroidectomy in laying birds. Intestinal calbindin mRNA is therefore increased by a process other than increasing 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 formation. The factor influencing the stability of this mRNA in laying hens could be calcium. It is concluded that in hens the increased duodenal calbindin synthesis elicited by plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 at sexual maturity primarily involves a transcriptional process and the stabilization of the mRNA.

40|$|Probiotics {{are live}} {{microorganisms}} which may confer health benefits on the host when administered in appropriate amounts. Numerous {{studies have shown}} that probiotics improve bone health in humans and rodents with less information available on the skeletal health of avians given probiotics. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of probiotic supplementation on bone health of egg-laying and meat-type chickens. Dietary supplementation of a multi-species based probiotic reduced the percentage of <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs</b> beginning at 4 wk following treatment and increased tibial and femoral bone mineral density in egg-laying hens at 7 wk post-treatment. Similarly, bone mineralization accrual of the tibia and femur was improved in broilers subjected to daily cycling heating episodes fed the same probiotic for 6 wk. Broilers consuming the probiotic also had a lower incidence of lameness as characterized by an improved gait score and longer latency to lie. The effects of a single-species based probiotic fed to broilers beginning at 1 d of age on bone health were investigated. Bone mineral densities of the tibia and femur were increased at 43 d of age. Concomitantly, serum calcium concentrations were increased at 14 d of age, serotonin levels were up-regulated in the raphe nuclei, and the catecholamine concentrations of NE and DA were down-regulated in the hypothalamus at 43 d of age. With the exception of bone mineral density, the bone health of probiotic-fed broilers was maintained under elevated temperature as indicated by larger bones and higher bone mineral content of the tibia and femur at 43 d of age accompanied by reduced plasma concentrations of TNF-?, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Dietary inclusion of probiotics is a useful strategy for improving skeletal health in chickens under both normal and elevated ambient temperature. Probiotics enhance intestinal absorption of nutrients like calcium and may reduce sympathetic activity, thus improving mineralization of bone. Under the condition of daily cycling heating episodes, probiotics increased bone growth and bone size of broilers perhaps via inhibition of bone resorption resulting from the down-regulation of TNF-?, thereby reducing systemic inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Uterine {{concentrations}} of calbindin D 28 K mRNA were measured in immature pullets and laying hens by dot-blot hybridization using a [32 P]cRNA probe prepared from the calbindin cDNA. In immature pullets, estrogen increased the calbindin mRNA {{level and the}} plasma concentration of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3]. When testosterone was administered with estrogen there was a further increase in calbindin and its mRNA {{and an increase in}} the free 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 index calculated as the ratio of the molar {{concentrations of}} total 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). In laying hens the uterine concentration of calbindin mRNA was low 4 hr after ovulation, but increased most markedly 12 and 18 hr later, when shell calcification took place. Calbindin concentration remained unchanged during the different stages of egg formation but was much higher in laying hens than in pullets treated with sex steroids. Suppression of shell formation by premature expulsion of the egg decreased the concentrations of calbindin mRNA and uterine calbindin and the free 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 index in the plasma. A concomitant increase in calbindin and its mRNA was observed at resumption of shell formation in hens previously laying <b>shell-less</b> <b>eggs.</b> Withdrawal of food for 44 hr decreased the uterine concentration of calbindin and its mRNA without a change in the free 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 index in the blood. It is concluded that the synthesis of uterine calbindin is stimulated primarily at sexual maturity and at calcification of the first shell by transcriptional processes. The daily increase in calbindin mRNA associated with shell formation and the absence of a concomitant change in calbindin concentration suggest that post-transcriptional processes exist and that stimuli other than the sex steroid or the 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 are involved in regulation of calbindin synthesis in the uterus. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 564 plasma samples was {{collected}} from Leghorn hens {{to determine if}} inorganic phosphate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations differed in birds which had just laid soft-shelled (SS) or <b>shell-less</b> (SL) <b>eggs</b> when compared to control hens. Four groups, 141 observa-tions per group, were used. Group 1 consisted of hens which had just laid SS or SL eggs. Group 2 contained hens with SS or SL eggs in their uteri. Group 3 consisted of hens with hard-shelled (HS) eggs in their uteri. Group 4 represented those hens which had just laid HS eggs. In general, a lower concentration of plasma calcium and magnesium was found in hens which laid either SS/SL or HS eggs (Groups 1 and 4, respectively) when compared to hens with SS/SL or HS eggs in their uteri (Groups 2 and 3, respectively). Likewise, a lower concentration of plasma inorganic phosphate was observed in hens which laid HS eggs (Group 4) when compared to hens with HS eggs in their uteri (Group 3). However, a greater concentration of plasma phosphate was found in hens which laid SS/SL eggs (Group 1) when compared to hens with SS/SL eggs in their uteri (Group 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an {{inhibitor}} of prostaglandin synthesis. Many soft-shelled (SS) and <b>shell-less</b> (SL) <b>eggs</b> {{are laid}} prematurely. It is hypothesized that prostaglandins {{may be responsible}} for the premature expulsion of some SS or SL eggs. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether aspirin would reduce the incidence of SS or SL eggs and result in a concomitant increase in hard-shelled (HS) eggs. Layer breeders in their 15 th mo of production were divided into groups of high and low incidence SS or SL egg laying and fed either control or rations with. 05 % aspirin for 4 wk. A decrease (P< 0 S) in SL egg production occurred in the high incidence group of SS or SL egg layers fed aspirin as compared with controls, but there was no concomitant increase in HS eggs. The production of SS eggs was unaffected by dietary aspirin. It appeared that the aspirin-fed hens of the high incidence group of SS or SL egg layers were attempting to utilize more calcium for shell formation (fewer SL eggs) but at the expense of producing thinner shells for the HS eggs. Aspirin had no effect on the shell quality of HS eggs in the low incidence group of SS or SL egg layers. It was concluded that aspirin can reduce the production of SL eggs, but perhaps due to physiological limitations in calcium mobilization, these aged breeders were not able to convert the SL eggs to HS eggs...|$|R

A total of 50 flocks including broiler breeder (30), layer breeder (10) and commercial layers (10) were surveyed from September, 2002 to March, 2003. Paired serum samples were collected at random from 20 birds in each flock at fortnight interval and screened through haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. In broiler breeders, out of 30 flocks, 12 (40 %) were serologically positive for EDS. In layer breeders and commercial layers, 30 and 20 % flocks {{were found to be}} seropositive, respectively. On the basis of age, maximum seroprevalence (42. 85 %) was observed in birds between 21 - 40 weeks of age.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the extent}} of uncollectable egg production in a commercial-type egg operation. The influence of bird age, strain of bird and environmental conditions on the production of eggs were also determined. Sheets of metal were hung 30 cm. beneath the cages of 6, 652 birds from a population of three quarter million hens 8, 11, 14 and 17 months of age during the summer or winter. To obtain a 24 -hour sample, eggs were collected between 6 p. m. and 6 a. m. and at 2 -hour intervals between 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. All birds were caged 4 birds per cage in an open-type house and fed a commercial corn-soy diet. The results indicate that uncollectable <b>eggs</b> (<b>shell-less,</b> ultra-thin and thin-shell) are laid by pullets first coming into lay and the incidence increases as the age of the bird increases. The temperature or season of the year had little effect on the extent of uncollectable egg production.
