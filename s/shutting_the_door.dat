500|$|The {{novel is}} well known for its style, which is {{variously}} described as modern, hard-boiled, or understated. As a novice writer and journalist in Paris, Hemingway turned to Ezra Pound—who had a reputation as [...] "an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent"—to mark and blue-ink his short stories. [...] From Pound, Hemingway learned to write in the modernist style: he used understatement, pared away sentimentalism, and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning, most notably at the book's conclusion, in which multiple future possibilities are left for Brett and Jake. The scholar Anders Hallengren writes that because Hemingway learned from Pound to [...] "distrust adjectives," [...] he created a style [...] "in accordance with the esthetics and ethics of raising the emotional temperature towards the level of universal truth by <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on sentiment, on the subjective." ...|$|E
500|$|That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her {{and they}} fall asleep {{together}} in an embrace. Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him. [...] She hysterically tears {{her way through the}} room's metal door, severely cutting herself. [...] Before he can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. [...] Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. [...] In their symposium, the scientists explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. [...] The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. [...] Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of [...] "neutrino systems" [...] but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as [...] "the annihilator".|$|E
60|$|It {{really was}} tiny. One {{had to get}} into a bunk to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> That did not matter to me, I am no Titanic American. I pitched the {{knapsack}} on one bunk, the kitchenino on the other, and we <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> cabin disappeared into a maple-wood panel of the long, subterranean state-room.|$|R

500|$|Fourth Amendment protections {{expanded}} {{significantly with}} Katz v. United States (1967). In Katz, the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and {{ruled that a}} search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached {{to the outside of}} the glass. While there was no physical intrusion into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by entering the booth and <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him, had exhibited his expectation that [...] "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that [...] "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places". A [...] "search" [...] occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person's [...] "reasonable expectation of privacy." [...] Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and thus necessitated a warrant. The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] as Lot {{was sitting at}} the gate of Sodom in the evening, the two angels arrived, and Lot greeted them and bowed low to the ground. Lot invited the angels to spend the night at his house and bathe their feet, but they said that they would spend the night in the square. Lot urged them strongly, so they went to his house, and he {{prepared}} a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they had retired for the night, all the men of Sodom gathered about the house shouting to Lot to bring his visitors out so that they might be intimate with them. Lot went outside the entrance, <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him, and begged the men of Sodom not commit such a wrong. Lot offered the men his two virgin daughters for them to do with as they pleased, if they would not do anything to his guests, but they disparaged Lot as one who had come as an alien and now sought to rule them, and they pressed threateningly against him and the door. But the visitors stretched out their hands and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door and struck the people with blindness so that they were unable to find the entrance. The visitors directed Lot to bring what family he had out of the city, for they were about to destroy the place, because the outcry against its inhabitants had become so great. So Lot told his sons-in-law that they needed {{to get out of the}} place because God was about to destroy it, but Lot's sons-in-law thought that he was joking. As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot to flee with his wife and two remaining daughters, but still he delayed. So out of God's mercy, the men seized Lot, his wife, and daughters by the hand and brought them out of the city, telling them to flee for their lives and not to stop or look back anywhere in the plain. But Lot asked them whether he might flee to a little village nearby. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
