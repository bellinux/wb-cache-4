The <b>switching</b> <b>condition</b> from individual exploration to cooperative exploration is based on Razumikhin theorem, and the change of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) serves as the <b>switching</b> <b>condition</b> from cooperative exploration to individual exploration. A cooperative H ∞ filter is proposed when the agents are collaborating. Sufficient condi-tions are derived for the cooperative H ∞ filter to converge.

40|$|The {{headscarf}} conceals {{hair and}} other external {{features of a}} head (such as the ears). It therefore may have implications for {{the way in which}} such faces are perceived. Images of faces with hair (H) or alternatively, covered by a headscarf (HS) were used in three experiments. In Experiment 1 participants saw both H and HS faces in a yes/no recognition task in which the external features either remained the same between learning and test (Same) or switched (Switch). Performance was similar for H and HS faces in both the Same and <b>Switch</b> <b>condition,</b> but in the <b>Switch</b> <b>condition</b> it dropped substantially compared to the Same condition. This implies that the mere presence of the headscarf does not reduce performance, rather, the change between the type of external feature (hair or headscarf) causes the drop in performance. In Experiment 2, which used eye-tracking methodology, it was found that almost all fixations were to internal regions, {{and that there was no}} difference in the proportion of fixations to external features between the Same and <b>Switch</b> <b>conditions,</b> implying that the headscarf influenced processing by virtue of extrafoveal viewing.

40|$|International audienceGame {{semantics}} is {{a valuable}} source of fully abstract models of programming languages or proof theories based on categories of so-called games and strategies. However, there are many variants of this technique, whose interrelationships largely remain to be elucidated. This raises the question: what is a category of games and strategies? Our central idea, taken from the first author's PhD thesis, is that positions and moves in a game should be morphisms in a base category: playing move m in position f consists in factoring f through m, the new position being the other factor. Accordingly, we provide a general construction which, from a selection of "legal moves" in an almost arbitrary category, produces a category of games and strategies, together with subcategories of deterministic and winning strategies. As our running example, we instantiate our construction to obtain the standard category of Hyland-Ong games subject to the <b>switching</b> <b>condition.</b> The extension of our framework to games without the <b>switching</b> <b>condition</b> is handled in the first author's PhD thesis...|$|E
