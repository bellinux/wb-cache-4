In order to determine whether detecting differences in dust environments would depend on the <b>sampler</b> <b>type,</b> we compared different passive, settled dust sampling approaches with respect to displaying qualitative and quantitative aspects of the bacterial and fungal indoor microbiota. Results: Settled dust sampling approaches—utilizing plastic petri dishes, TefTex material, and electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs) —were evaluated in indoor spaces in the USA and Finland and in an experimental chamber study. The microbial content was analyzed with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify total bacterial and fungal biomass and through high-throughput sequencing to examine bacterial community composition. Bacterial composition and diversity were similar within a sampling environment regardless of the <b>sampler</b> <b>type.</b> The <b>sampling</b> environment was the single largest predictor of microbial community composition within a study, while <b>sampler</b> <b>type</b> was found to have much less predictive power. Quantitative analyses in indoor spaces indicated highest yields using a petri dish approach, followed by sampling with EDCs and TefTex.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) {{is a complex}} auto-immune disease. Gene expression {{studies have been conducted}} to identify SLE-related genes in various <b>types</b> of <b>samples.</b> It is unknown whether there are common marker genes significant for SLE but independent of <b>sample</b> <b>types,</b> which may have potentials for follow-up translational research. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify common marker genes across various <b>sample</b> <b>types</b> for SLE. Based on four public microarray gene expression datasets for SLE covering three representative <b>types</b> of blood-born <b>samples</b> (monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC; whole blood), we utilized three statistics (fold-change, FC; t-test p value; false discovery rate adjusted p value) to scrutinize genes simultaneously regulated with SLE across various <b>sample</b> <b>types.</b> For common marker genes, we conducted the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction analysis to gain insights into their functions. We identified 10 common marker genes associated with SLE (IFI 6, IFI 27, IFI 44 L, OAS 1, OAS 2, EIF 2 AK 2, PLSCR 1, STAT 1, RNASE 2, and GSTO 1). Significant up-regulation of IFI 6, IFI 27, and IFI 44 L with SLE was observed in all the studied <b>sample</b> <b>types,</b> though the FC was most striking in monocyte, compared with PBMC and whole blood (8. 82 - 251. 66 vs. 3. 73 - 74. 05 vs. 1. 19 - 1. 87). Eight of the above 10 genes, except RNASE 2 and GSTO 1, interact with each other and with known SLE susceptibility genes, participate in immune response, RNA and protein catabolism, and cell death. Our data suggest that there exist common marker genes across various <b>sample</b> <b>types</b> for SLE.

The Sigma wet-chemistry assay for determination of total cholesterol was used as the reference for assessment of bias of each of the <b>sample</b> <b>types.</b> Fingerstick whole blood, via the Reflotron method, produced a positive 5. 5 % bias when compared to the reference, failing to meet the current LSP goal for acceptable accuracy (± 5 % bias). Venous whole blood analyzed using the Reflotron met this goal with a bias of + 3. 3 %. Fingerstick plasma, via the Ektachem DT 60 method, produced a bias of + 2. 1 %, meeting the ideal LSP goal of ± 3 % bias. Venous plasma as measured by both the Reflotron and Ektachem DT 60 also met this ideal goal (+ 2. 0 % and + 1. 8 % bias, respectively).

As such, housekeeping genes and proteins are often used as internal normalization standards in quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blots. These proteins were designated as housekeeping because they are essential for the maintenance of basic cellular functions and are universally expressed in all cells of an organism. Some examples of classically used housekeeping proteins include ß-Actin, GAPDH, HPRT1, and RPLP1. Until recently, these proteins were considered to be expressed at a consistent, stable level under normal or pathophysiological conditions in any cell or tissue type. However, recent studies have shown that expression of housekeeping proteins can change across different cell types and biological conditions.

5000|$|RPA is one {{of several}} {{isothermal}} nucleic acid amplification techniques to be developed as a molecular diagnostic technique, frequently with the objective of simplifying the laboratory instrumentation required relative to PCR. A partial list of other isothermal amplification techniques include LAMP, NASBA, Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), and Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction (NEAR). The techniques differ in the specifics of primer design and reaction mechanism, and in some cases (like RPA) make use of cocktails of two or more enzymes. Like RPA, many of these techniques offer rapid amplification times with the potential for simplified instrumentation, and reported resistance to substances in unpurified samples that are known to inhibit PCR. With respect to amplification time, {{it should be noted that}} modern thermocyclers with rapid temperature ramps can reduce PCR amplification times to less than 30 minutes, particularly for short amplicons using dual-temperature cycling rather than the conventional three-temperature protocols. [...] In addition, the demands of sample prep (including lysis and extraction of DNA or RNA, if necessary) should be considered as part of the overall time and complexity inherent to the technique. These requirements vary according to the technique as well as to the specific target and <b>sample</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Brain {{volume is}} not a perfect account of intelligence: the {{relationship}} explains a modest amount of variance in intelligence - 12% to 36% of the variance. The amount of variance explained by brain volume may also depend {{on the type of}} intelligence measured. Up to 36% of variance in verbal intelligence can be explained by brain volume, while only approximately 10% of variance in visuospatial intelligence can be explained by brain volume. A 2015 study by researcher Stuart J Ritchie found that brain size explained 12% of the variance in intelligence among individuals. These caveats imply that there are other major factors influencing how intelligent an individual is apart from brain size. In a large meta-analysis consisting of 88 studies Pietschnig et al. (2015) estimated the correlation between brain volume and intelligence to be about correlation coefficient of 0.24 which equates to 6% variance. Taking into account measurement quality, and <b>sample</b> <b>type</b> and IQ-range, the meta-analytic association of brain volume in appears to be ~ [...]4 in normal adults. Researcher Jakob Pietschnig argued that the strength of the positive association of brain volume and IQ remains robust, but has been overestimated in the literature.
