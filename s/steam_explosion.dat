5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (<b>steam)</b> <b>explosion.</b> Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.

5|$|Over time Surtseyan eruptions tend to form maars, broad low-relief {{volcanic}} craters {{dug into}} the ground, and tuff rings, circular structures built of rapidly quenched lava. These structures {{are associated with a}} single vent eruption, however if eruptions arise along fracture zones a rift zone may be dug out; these eruptions tend to be more violent then the ones forming a tuff ring or maars, an example being the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Littoral cones are another hydrovolcanic feature, generated by the explosive deposition of basaltic tephra (although they are not truly volcanic vents). They form when lava accumulates within cracks in lava, superheats and explodes in a <b>steam</b> <b>explosion,</b> breaking the rock apart and depositing it on the volcano's flank. Consecutive explosions of this type eventually generate the cone.|$|E
2500|$|For {{several years}} after the large {{eruption}} in 1915, spring snowmelt water percolating down into Lassen Peak triggered <b>steam</b> <b>explosions,</b> an indication that magma {{beneath the surface of}} the volcano remained quite hot.

25|$|Use {{of water}} in fire {{fighting}} should also {{take into account the}} hazards of a <b>steam</b> <b>explosion,</b> which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, charcoal, or coke graphite, decompose the water, producing water gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} such explosions {{was seen in}} the Chernobyl disaster, {{although}} the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A <b>steam</b> <b>explosion</b> occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot zirconium.|$|E
50|$|North and South Twin Lakes are two nearly {{identical}} natural lakes in Deschutes County, Oregon.

5|$|At {{least one}} {{explosive}} subaqueous volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch. This subaqueous volcano, known as White Horse Bluff, {{is thought to}} have formed in three phases. Its first phase of activity was involved with water, possibly dammed by glacial ice which filled the Clearwater River valley. The volcano heated glacial water then flooded down the volcano's vent, creating violent <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> and broken lava fragments. Once the <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> had subsided, the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water, creating the unvolcano-like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite. The volcano ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the glacial water.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>explosions</b> are not {{normally}} chemical explosions, although {{a number of}} substances react chemically with steam (for example, zirconium and superheated graphite react with steam and air respectively to give off hydrogen, which burns violently in air) so that chemical explosions and fires may follow. Some <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> appear to be special kinds of boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE), and rely on the release of stored superheat. But many large-scale events, including foundry accidents, show evidence of an energy-release front propagating through the material (see description of FCI below), where the forces create fragments and mix the hot phase into the cold volatile one; and the rapid heat transfer at the front sustains the propagation.|$|R
25|$|However the {{dynamics}} of the movement of corium in and outside the reactor vessel is highly complex, and the number of possible scenarios is wide; slow drip of melt into an underlying water pool can result in complete quenching, while the fast contact of a large mass of corium with water may result in a destructive <b>steam</b> <b>explosion.</b> Corium may be completely retained by the reactor vessel, or the reactor floor or some of the instrument penetration holes can be melted through.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{consequences}} of radioactivity releases and core damage the Fukushima I nuclear accidents in 2011 {{were the worst}} experienced by the industry in addition to ranking among the worst civilian nuclear accidents, though no fatalities were caused and no serious exposure of radiation to workers occurred. The Tokaimura reprocessing plant fire in 1999 had 2 worker deaths, one more exposed to radiation levels above legal limits and over 660 others received detectable radiation doses but within permissible levels, well below the threshold to affect human health. The Mihama Nuclear Power Plant experienced a <b>steam</b> <b>explosion</b> {{in one of the}} turbine buildings in 2004 where five workers were killed and six injured.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The <b>steam</b> <b>explosion</b> resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
50|$|Littoral cones are {{a form of}} {{volcanic}} cone. They form from the interaction between lava flows and water. <b>Steam</b> <b>explosions</b> fragment the lava and the fragments can pile up and form a cone. Such cones usually form on aa lava flows, and typically require large lava flows to form. They have been found on Hawaii and elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Rootless cones {{are formed}} by <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, {{such as a}} swamp, a lake, or a pond. The {{explosive}} gases break through the lava surface {{in a manner similar}} to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.|$|R
5000|$|March-early June 1991: magma rising {{toward the}} surface from more than 32 {{kilometers}} beneath Mount Pinatubo triggered small earthquakes and caused powerful <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> that blasted three craters on the north flank of the volcano.

25|$|The U.S. Army {{also had}} a nuclear power program, {{beginning}} in 1954. The SM-1 Nuclear Power Plant, at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was the first power reactor in the U.S. to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid (VEPCO), in April 1957, before Shippingport. The SL-1 was a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station in eastern Idaho. It underwent a <b>steam</b> <b>explosion</b> and meltdown in January 1961, which killed its three operators. In the Soviet Union at The Mayak Production Association facility {{there were a number}} of accidents, including an explosion, that released 50–100 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste, contaminating a huge territory in the eastern Urals and causing numerous deaths and injuries. The Soviet regime kept this accident secret for about 30 years. The event was eventually rated at 6 on the seven-level INES scale (third in severity only to the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima).|$|E
25|$|In November 1891, Grove Karl Gilbert, chief {{geologist}} for the U.S. Geological Survey, {{investigated the}} crater {{and concluded that}} it {{was the result of a}} volcanic <b>steam</b> <b>explosion.</b> Gilbert had assumed that if it were an impact crater then the volume of the crater, as well as meteoritic material, should be present on the rim. Gilbert also assumed a large portion of the meteorite should be buried in the crater and that this would generate a large magnetic anomaly. Gilbert's calculations showed that the volume of the crater and the debris on the rim were roughly equivalent, so that the mass of the hypothetical impactor was missing, nor were there any magnetic anomalies. Gilbert argued that the meteorite fragments found on the rim were coincidental. Gilbert publicized his conclusions in a series of lectures. In 1892, however, Gilbert would be among the first to propose that the Moon's craters were caused by impact rather than volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Objects {{struck by}} {{lightning}} experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude. The heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a <b>steam</b> <b>explosion</b> that bursts the trunk. As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt, forming tubular structures called fulgurites. Even though roughly 90 percent of people {{struck by lightning}} survive, humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage. Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Lightning also serves {{an important role in}} the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.|$|E
5000|$|Littoral cones not primary {{volcanic}} vents and {{distinguishing between}} a littoral cone and a primary vent can be difficult. A littoral cone forms when lava flows from land into water. Interaction between {{the water and}} the lava leads to <b>steam</b> <b>explosions.</b> These explosions throw lava fragments into the air; under favourable circumstances these fragments pile up on land and form a cone. This activity may resemble that of fire fountaining. Repeated phases of magma-water mixing lead to the formation of bedded deposits. The <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> can lead to the formation of Pele's hair. The forming lava flows need to be sufficiently large; the minimum size of lava flows that have formed such cones in Hawaii is [...] Of these, about 5-6% of their volume is converted to fragments. Usually littoral cones are formed by aa lava as their fragmented nature allows ideal water-lava interactions, but pahoehoe and intermediary lavas can also form littoral cones. Other properties such as the speed of the lava flow and the structure of the flow front also influence the formation of littoral cones. Larger lava flow rates generate larger cones. In some littoral cones on Hawaii that were formed by pahoehoe lava flows, the collapse of a lava bench and subsequent <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> formed the cones instead. Pyroclastic flows can also form littoral cones, one such cone has been found on Lombok and formed during the 1257 Samalas eruption.|$|R
40|$|We report {{electric}} potential gradient measurements {{carried out at}} Sakurajima volcano in Japan during: (1) explosions which generated ash plumes, (2) <b>steam</b> <b>explosions</b> which produced plumes of condensing gases, and (3) periods of ashfall and plume-induced acid rainfall. Sequential positive and negative deviations occurred during explosions which generated ash plumes. However, no deflections from background were found during <b>steam</b> <b>explosions.</b> During periods of ashfall negative {{electric potential}} gradients were observed, while positive potential gradients occurred during fallout of plume-induced acid rain from the same eruption. These results suggest that a dipole arrangement of charge develops within plumes such that positive charges dominate in the volcanic gas-rich top and negative charges in the following ash-rich part of the plume. The charge polarity may be reversed for other volcanoes (Hatakeyama and Uchikawa 1952). We suggest that charge is generated by fracto-emission (Donaldson et al. 1988) processes probably during magma fragmentation within the vent, rather than by frictional effects within the plume...|$|R

25|$|Many {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain what caused this huge slab of rocks to start sliding and what allowed it to slide so far on such a low slope, fragmenting, thinning and extending as it went. Most geologists who have worked in the area agree that Absaroka volcanism {{played a role in}} the sliding and many suggest that a major volcanic or <b>steam</b> <b>explosion</b> initiated movement. Another model involves injection of numerous igneous dikes with the resulting heating of water within pores in rocks causing an increase in pressure which initiated sliding. Some geologists have suggested that hot pressurized water (hydrothermal fluids), derived from a volcano which sat north of Cooke City, Montana, effectively lubricated the sliding surface. Another possibility is that once the slide was moving, friction heated the limestone along the sliding surface, creating pseudotachylite, which then further broke down to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas (or supercritical fluid). The gas supported the slide in the way that air pressure supports a hovercraft, allowing the slide to move easily down the very low slope. When the rockslide stopped, the carbon dioxide cooled and recombined with calcium oxide to form the cement-like carbonate rock now found in the fault zone. The consensus favors catastrophic sliding and calculations suggest that the front of the sliding mass may have advanced at a speed of over 100 miles/hour (160km/h), meaning that the mountain traveled to its present location in approximately 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The Trout Lake Mudflow is the {{youngest}} large debris flow from Adams and the only large one {{since the end of}} the last Ice Age.

500|$|Roughly 27,000 years ago, a dacite lava dome quickly pushed its {{way through}} Tehama's {{destroyed}} north-eastern flank, becoming the approximately [...] shorter Lassen Peak. Lassen's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago during the Wisconsin glaciation. Since then, smaller dacite domes such as the 1,100-year-old Chaos Crags have formed around Lassen. Phreatic (<b>steam</b> <b>explosion)</b> eruptions, dacite and andesite lava flows along with cinder cone formation have persisted into modern times. Most notable {{of these is the}} mid to late 17th century eruption and formation (Tree Ring dates) of Cinder Cone and the early 20th century eruption of Lassen Peak. The only activity since then has been the constant bubbling of mud pots and steaming of fumaroles from the various geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park. However, a potential exists for renewed vigorous volcanic activity that could threaten life and property in the area.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1914 {{and lasting}} until 1921, Lassen Peak emerged from {{dormancy}} {{with a series}} of phreatic eruptions (<b>steam</b> <b>explosions),</b> dacite lava flows, and lahars (volcanic mud flows).
