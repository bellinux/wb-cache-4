Marshall said his entire professional career and adult personal life has been marred with symptoms of BPD, but only recently through treatment has he learned to consciously and effectively deal with the resulting problems of his actions that have been influenced by BPD. Marshall cited a recent study that suggests at least 35% of male prison inmates nationally, and 25% of female inmates, have been diagnosed with BPD. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> to help reduce the stigma of BPD, and encourage and lead others with the disorder to receive proper care. On October 10, 2013, Marshall donned a pair of bright green Nike cleats in support of Mental Illness Awareness Week.

Griffin {{reported}} that investigations are continuing into the Phoenix VA, including {{a review of}} [...] "possible criminal misconduct by VA senior hospital leadership". Griffin also reported that [...] "Since July 2005, OIG published 20 oversight reports on VA patient wait times and access to care yet VHA did not effectively address its access to care issues or stop the use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. When VHA concurred with our recommendations and submitted an action plan, VA medical facility directors {{did not take the}} necessary actions to comply with VHA’s program directives and policy changes." [...] In his spoken testimony, Griffin said that in [...] "three-fourths (of the VA facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data), we're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening, and we're pursuing those." [...] He also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> to complete his office's investigations into possible criminal misconduct by the end of 2014. If his office finds criminal misconduct, it will then refer cases to U.S. attorneys for possible prosecution. Senator Richard Burr said that the [...] "culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management and accountability is simply reprehensible." [...] In his testimony, Secretary Bob McDonald apologized [...] "to all Veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care at the Phoenix facility, and across the country. We at VA are committed to fixing the problems and consistently providing the high quality care our Veterans have earned and deserve in order to improve their health and well-being." [...] He discussed actions taken at the Phoenix VA facility in response to Inspector General findings, and he discussed national initiatives to change VA's culture, measure patient satisfaction, improve access to care, and improve accountability (including a restructuring of the Office of Medical Inspector).|$|E
