40|$|Knaysi, Georges (Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.). Further {{observations}} on the <b>spodogram</b> of Bacillus cereus endospore. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 453 – 455. 1965. —Endospore spodograms of Bacillus cereus C 3 were examined in dark contrast by use of the phase microscope with oil-immersion objectives. When the spodograms were mounted in air, their central part, or core, appeared bright; when mounted in water or oil, the central part appeared dark. The {{central part of the}} normal, unincinerated spore appeared bright in air and water, but dark in oil. This indicated that whether a body appears bright or dark when observed with the phase microscope does not depend only on its refringence relative to that of its surround, but also on its thickness and on the magnitude of the difference between its refractive index and that of its surround. Present observations showed that, contrary to a previous conclusion, mineral matter is more highly concentrated in the core than at the periphery of the endospore...|$|E
40|$|Knaysi, Georges (Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.). Effects of {{temperatures}} {{above the}} maximum for germination on the endospore of Bacillus cereus. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 1129 – 1136. 1964. —This is chiefly {{a study of}} heat activation and of the instability observed in spores of Bacillus cereus exposed to high temperatures. Temperatures up to 80 C for periods up to 6 hr were used. The spores were in colonies grown on collodion films, and were observed with the phase microscope, in dark contrast, for any evidence of change in their optical properties, the structure of their <b>spodograms,</b> and any other evidence of germination or growth. Exposure of the endospores to 80 C for 4 hr or more, whether in distilled water or in glucose broth, entirely eliminated stage II (i. e. the germcell stage, when the germinating spore begins to grow), and also tended to render the spores unstable and to produce uniformly dark <b>spodograms.</b> This instability involves some destructive processes and is not equivalent to normal entry into stage I (the initial stage). True heat-activation seemed to take place at a stage prior to the one which yielded uniformly dark <b>spodograms.</b> It was shown to consist of two factors: accumulation of germination-promoting components of the medium and activation of some spore components involved in germination. Activation of the medium components by preheating did not stimulate the spores of the strain employed. Unstable or activated spores can not be instantaneously stabilized, deactivated, or their changes arrested by exposure to acid buffers. It is concluded that the optimal temperature for activation, without danger of injury to the spore, in a given strain, is just above the maximum for stage I in that strain...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for the extraction of phytoliths from plant material {{to be used as}} reference in the analysis of archaeological phytolith samples: (1) <b>spodograms</b> or dry ashings; and (2) acid digestions or wet ashing. It has been suggested that these techniques may modify the resultant samples in different ways. Dry ashing, in particular, has been implicated as a cause of shrinkage and warping in phytolith assemblages when incineration occurs at ≥ 450 °C. The results of a morphometric comparative analysis between the dry ashing and wet ashing methods do not support these claims. This study establishes that differences in patterns of dimension and curvature of short bilobate phytoliths and of elongate phytoliths both subjected to dry and wet ash preparation are not statistically significant. There is, therefore, no detectable evidence of morphological impact {{as a result of these}} methods. This finding implies that any differences that do occur in phytolith size and curvature are typical, possibly random permutation within assemblages, or that they are the result of variation in leaf cell structure rather than the consequence of a particular extraction procedure. This suggests that the practice of using different methods of preparation of reference samples for fossil analysis can be reliably continued...|$|R
40|$|Knaysi, Georges (Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.). Determination, by spodography, of the {{intracellular}} {{distribution of}} mineral matter throughout the life history of Bacillus cereus. J. Bacteriol. 82 : 556 – 563. 1961. —The intracellular distribution of mineral matter throughout the life history of Bacillus cereus strain C 3 was investigated by microincineration {{for which the}} term spodography is suggested. The organism was grown in microcultures on collodion membranes supported by agar media. At various stages of development, microcultures were floated on distilled water, picked onto cover glasses, air-dried, and incinerated at 500 to 525 C. The mineral residue is deposited in situ and shows the distribution of mineral matter in the cells. Study of the <b>spodograms</b> thus obtained shows that in the spore mineral matter is concentrated in a peripheral layer surrounding a minerally poor core. As soon as the spore begins to germinate, often before one notes any change in its optical properties, the minerally rich layer increases in thickness while the core becomes gradually smaller and finally disappears. The germ cell appears nearly homogeneous, with evidence of mineral aggregation into discrete granules more readily seen in subsequent generations. The nuclei of the vegetative cells are sites of mineral accumulation. In the compound nuclei, minerals seem to be concentrated in a superficial ring around a minerally poor center. In the young forespore, mineral matter is homogeneously distributed. As the spore stage is approached, however, the mineral matter tends to occupy a peripheral position as in the completed spore. The {{results indicate that the}} calcium dipicolinate of the spore is principally in the minerally rich, peripheral layer. The relation of this layer to the other peripheral structures of the spore has not been determined. Observation was made with a phase microscope in dark contrast and using a dry objective...|$|R
