5|$|In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and {{was thus}} legally {{independent}} of his father. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted {{a few cases}} in {{justice of the peace}} courts, which did not require the practitioner to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year, continued his study of law, first while teaching <b>school,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary; he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was admitted to the New York bar, and declined offers from Buffalo law firms to return to East Aurora and establish a practice as the town's only lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the self-confidence to practice in the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice. On February 5, 1826, Millard and Abigail wed. They had two children, Millard Powers Fillmore (1828–1889) and Mary Abigail Fillmore (1832–1854).|$|E
5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary <b>School</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E
