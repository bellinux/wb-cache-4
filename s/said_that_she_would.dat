5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland. When pressed by the media she <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was some}} time before the lady came back, and Mr. Tolman was afraid she was not coming at all. But she did come, and asked for Mrs. Burney's [...] "Evelina."

5|$|In 1983, Mansour {{was offered}} {{money for the}} film rights {{to the story of}} her life. She <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> accept on {{condition}} that the money was enough to balance Michigan's state deficit, $900,000,000 at that time. No film rights were obtained. Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, Medicaid funds, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). She increased the investigation and conviction of fraud cases, and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support. She streamlined office procedures, and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers. She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Hayley Atwell, {{who played}} Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{not appear in}} the sequel. However Stanley Tucci, who played Dr. Abraham Erskine in the {{previous}} film, later said that Atwell would reappear in a flashback scene. Also in January, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D, and Anthony Mackie said filming would begin on April 1, 2013. Later that month, Toby Jones, who portrayed Arnim Zola in the first film, said that he would reprise the role in the sequel. By the end of the month, stages were being built for a shoot at Raleigh Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Elements of D.Gray-man first {{appeared}} in Hoshino's one-shot title, Zone, in which the Akuma, the exorcists, and the Millennium Earl plan to end the world. Although Allen Walker is male, his character is based on Zone female protagonist. Lavi {{is based on the}} protagonist of Hoshino's planned series, Book-man, that she originally wanted to write. Other characters, such as the Millennium Earl, Lenalee Lee, and Komui Lee, are based on real people whom Hoshino has not specifically identified; some are well-known scientists, and Komui is based on Hoshino's boss. The character of Yu Kanda, based on a samurai, was created to vary D.Gray-mans Western setting. Hoshino found the design of some characters difficult early in the series. In 2011, the author visited New York for research, and believed that the city had greatly influenced her work. Hoshino visited cemeteries, and was deeply impressed by her guides' comments at Ground zero of the World Trade Center (left after the September 11 attacks). She <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to spend more time in New York to gather data for the series.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows {{only one}} reelection. Many of her {{supporters}} proposed {{an amendment to}} the Constitution to allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either. The proposal was not taken to the Congress, as the FPV still lacked the required two-thirds majority to approve an amendment bill. It was rejected by many sectors of society. The first big demonstration (a cacerolazo) took place in September 2012. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using social networks. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both the government and the opposition. People also protested the 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media, rising crime rates, and the tight currency controls. Kirchner dismissed the demonstration, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> continue working as before. Most of the Kirchner loyalists, however, preferred simply to ignore the protest.|$|E
5|$|That month, Lovato also {{announced}} her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series; she later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return to acting {{when she felt}} confident doing so. Her departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season. Lovato released her third album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011. Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R and featured less pop rock. The album and the stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who saw a growth in musicianship because of her struggles and have praised Lovato's vocals but found the music more generic than her previous efforts. The record was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200, with sales exceeding 97,000 copies in its first week of release, and going on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, being certified Gold.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

50|$|Many Republicans speculated as {{to whether}} Martinez would be the vice presidential nominee on the Republican ticket in 2012 and 2016, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> {{numerous}} times <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not run.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Lynne McGranger {{who plays}} the character's {{on-screen}} mother Irene Roberts <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doubted Finlay <b>would</b> ever return to the series because Thomsen had quit acting and became a mother.|$|R
5|$|In the 1973 state election, the LM largely ran a {{separate}} campaign from the LCL as a whole. The {{majority of the}} LCL's metropolitan candidates were also within the LM, and {{it was hoped that}} enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power, but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re-elect Hall as leader. To do this, they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide. This also meant the conservatives in the LCL would be better off losing to Labor if they wanted to maintain their hold on the party, as Labor's vulnerable seats were in all in the city, and a Labor loss meant a LM gain. The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party. While the LM ran an innovative campaign, the LCL itself faltered, losing support in the country to {{a separate}} Country Party and to Labor in metropolitan Adelaide. One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party. The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL's defeat. The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL, more in tune with urban mainstream, but {{there was no evidence that}} urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide. LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates, but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide.|$|E

5000|$|Saunders first {{married the}} {{television}} director Arthur Rue [...] "Tommy" [...] Thompson (1927-2000), who was two months her junior.
