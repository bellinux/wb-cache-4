Based on these tests, it was revealed that higher elevations had been negatively impacted by farming practices and erosion had completely removed any indication of habitation. In contrast, on the slopes of the <b>site,</b> <b>test</b> pits revealed a 10 cm thick dark soil that appeared to be redeposited from a higher level. [...] The dark soil was situated directly above a second darkened 10 cm soil horizon that had survived apparently undisturbed.

50|$|Site 74-2 {{is one of}} its oldest sites, and {{is located}} on a terrace {{overlooking}} the river. It occupies the lowest of a series of terraces, where the higher ones have a geology less favorable to Native use, where test pits yielded no finds. At the time of the site's listing on the National Register in 1984, it had only been subjected to test excavations. These yielded two important artifacts, a Neville phase point dated to c. 5,500 BCE, and a stone bayonet dated to c. 1,800 BCE. Significant quantities of fire-cracked rocks (indication of cooking activity) were found in test pits throughout the <b>site.</b> <b>Test</b> pits were only dug into the plow zone, so the possibility of even older artifacts exists. Notably for archaeological sites in the interior of Maine, no ceramic artifacts of any kind were found. This strongly suggests that the site was abandoned before c. 1,000 BCE. These types of sites are extremely rare in Maine, and provide a means to investigate shifting habitation patterns over time.|$|E
