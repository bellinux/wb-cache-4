5|$|I침치rritu had {{stated that}} he {{originally}} wanted to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> film chronologically, a process that would have added $7 million to the film's production budget. I침치rritu later confirmed that the film was shot in sequence, despite Hardy's statement that the film could not be shot chronologically, due to weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Ip Man {{began in}} March 2008, and {{was completed by}} the end of August. A majority of the film focuses on events surrounding Ip Man that took place in Foshan in the 1930s and 1940s during the Sino-Japanese War. Since the buildings in modern-day Foshan are architecturally different from the ones of the film's period, the filmmakers decided to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> film in Shanghai.|$|E

50|$|In the Power Plant room, <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> {{power plant}} once will disable it, and all robots {{in the room}} will stop moving. In the Central Computer room, <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> {{computer}} will cause all the robots to start moving and firing erratically. While they are in such a state, the walls can kill them. The Robot Factory will continue to spit out additional robots while the player remains in the stage, taunting as it does so. <b>Shooting</b> <b>the</b> factory normally has no effect; however, in <b>the</b> Coleco port, <b>shooting</b> <b>the</b> factory will disable it and stop the endless stream of robots.|$|R

5|$|The {{winds of}} Donna {{can be seen}} in the feature film Blast of Silence (1961); a fist fight scene on Long Island had been {{previously}} scheduled, and the filmmakers decided to go ahead and <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> exterior scene despite the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> {{also brought}} under {{scrutiny}} {{the use of}} no-knock warrants, which exist to prevent drug offenders from having time to destroy evidence. After <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> state senate voted to tighten restrictions, {{making it more difficult}} to obtain the warrants. The Atlanta Police Department was also forced to tighten its warrant requirements after an investigation sparked by <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> <b>The</b> police department also said it would review its use of confidential informants after <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> As a result of <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> police chief placed Atlanta's eight-man narcotics team on administrative leave. A civilian review board was created in the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> in <b>the</b> context of the public outrage that resulted. [...] Eventually, the narcotics team was increased from eight to thirty officers, and all former members of the team were replaced.|$|R
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|After several sightings, the Fringe team {{move into}} some nearby storm drains to bait the chimera with its larvae. Feeling {{somewhat}} responsible, Walter locks himself {{in with the}} chimera and ingests some poison that will kill him within the hour, believing that if it kills him, the chimera will only be killing itself. He manages to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> chimera in time however, and they use its blood {{to find a cure}} for Charlie.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Take Me Out to the Ball Game, Freed gave Donen and Kelly the chance to direct On the Town, {{released}} in 1949. The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City {{and was the first}} musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.|$|E
5000|$|In-camera editing is a {{technique}} where, instead of editing the shots in a film into sequence after <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> director or cinematographer instead <b>shoots</b> <b>the</b> sequences in strict order.

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast <b>shoot,</b> <b>The</b> Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles.

Garland's dressing room was a 110ft 칑 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> victim, but {{the victim is}} aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} The Argentine, Soderbergh depicts Guevara's {{derailment}} of {{a freight}} train during the Battle of Santa Clara. In filming the sequence, Soderbergh balked at the digital effects solution and managed to reallocate $500,000 from the overall $58 million budget to build a real set of tracks and a train powered by two V-8 car engines. To film the scene, they had six rehearsals, and could only <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> scene once.|$|E

5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5|$|Danganronpa: Unlimited Battle was {{an action}} video {{game in the}} Danganronpa series, {{developed}} by Spike Chunsoft.
