40|$|Interest {{in sport}} {{activities}} and among them, also in racket sports, {{has grown in}} recent years because {{of the increase in}} leisure time as well as the belief that general health can be enhanced by improved physical fitness. As a result of increasing participation, intensity, demands and longer training periods, the potential risk of injuries in racket sports seems to increase on all levels. As all four racket sports have developed during the last decade and player’s techniques have improved, the ball’s speed and spin have become too fast and which is why rallies are quicker <b>and</b> <b>shorter.</b> Therefore the movements are often <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>and</b> this can cause some injuries of the human’s loco motor system.

40|$|Last {{fifteen years}} have {{witnessed}} {{an explosion of}} interest among researchers in using nonlinear models. The idea that time series {{are subject to change}} over time gave rise to the development of regime switching models in which dynamic behaviour is state dependent. This paper employs various models of this class to analyze the cyclical pattern of the Turkish economy. Following Hansen (1997) and Hamilton (1989), Threshold Autoregression (TAR), Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregression (SETAR) and Markov-switching (MS) models are fitted to post- 1987 quarterly GNP and post- 1986 monthly IPI data. The method to determine endogenous structural breaks suggested by Hansen (2001) is also applied to assess the estimation results. In a highly non-standard testing environment, specification tests of the models are conducted by taking advantage of the simulation methods. We capture the asymmetry over the different phases of the business cycle in which recessions are <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> while expansions are moderate and highly persistent. We also discuss the striking events of the time in the light of our results. Most importantly, we find strong evidence that the Turkish economy has experienced structural breaks in the considered period, of the type presented in the literature...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} multiproxy {{analysis from}} westernmost Mediterranean hemipelagic sediments has provided further insights into natural climate variability and forcing mechanisms {{in this region}} {{during the last two}} millennia. Two deep-sea marine records, with a robust age model provided by the activity-depth profiles of 210 Pb and 137 Cs, together with 14 C dating, allowed us to perform a detailed reconstruction of paleoenvironmental and paleoceanographic responses during the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA), the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA), the Industrial period (IP) and the second-half of the 20 th century. Decreasing trends of fluvial-derived element (Si) and a increasing eolian input (Zr/Al ratio) characterized the MCA and the second-half of the 20 th century as prevalent dry periods, while generally humid conditions are evidenced during the LIA and the IP, in accordance to a positive and a negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively (Trouet et al., 2009). The LIA developed as a sequence of successive <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> dry-humid phase alternation. Furthermore, a noteworthy and sharp decrease of redox-sensitive elements (V/Cr and Ni/Co ratios) and coarser sortable silt at ad 1450 and 1950 yr, support more energetic hydrodynamic conditions at this time (oxygenated bottom waters and faster bottom currents), likely promoted by strengthened cooler waters flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. © The Author(s) 2013.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} climatic and {{environmental}} changes {{during the last}} millennium in NE Europe based on a ca. 8 -m long high-resolved and well-dated marine sediment record from the deepest basin of Gullmar Fjord (SW Sweden). According to the 210 Pb- and 14 C-datings, the record includes {{the period of the}} late Holocene characterised by anomalously cold summers and well known as the Little Ice Age (LIA). Using benthic foraminiferal stratigraphy, lithology, bulk sediment geochemistry and stable carbon isotopes we reconstruct various phases of this cold period, identify its timing in the study area and discuss the land-sea interactions occurring during that time. The onset of the LIA is indicated by an increase in cold-water foraminiferal species Adercotryma glomerata at ~ 1350 AD. The first phase of the LIA was characterised by a stormy but milder climate, which is indicated by a presence of Nonionella iridea. Maximum abundances of this species are likely to mirror a <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> warming event at ~ 1600 AD. It is likely that due to land use changes {{in the second part of}} the LIA there was an increased input of terrestrial organic matter to the fjord, which is indicated by lighter &delta; 13 C values and an increase of detritivorous and omnivorous species as Textularia earlandi and Eggerelloides scaber. The climate deterioration during the climax of the LIA (1675 – 1704 AD), as suggested by the agglutinated species, caused some carbonate dissolution, variations in primary productivity and a decline of N. iridea dependant on fresh phytodetritus. It is also assumed that an increase of Hyalinea balthica could be indicative of climate warming trends at 1600 – 1743 and 1813 – 1940 AD...|$|R
40|$|The Holocene {{climate is}} known to be rather stable {{although}} with few abrupt changes that lasted few decades. The present study is related the climate changes and their environmental impacts during the last 6000 years from a fossil record collected in the Middle Atlas, Morocco. Reconstruction of three climate variables (January temperature (Tjan), annual precipitation (P ann) and a precipitation seasonal index (SI)) was based on pollen data and analyzed various bio and geo-chemical elements. Then we evaluated the relationships between all the environmental variables. Climate over the last 6000 years was rather stable with a smooth trend of aridity towards the present. Tjan has varied within about 2 °C range and P ann within less than 100 mm yr − 1. Despite such overall climate stability, after ca. 3750 cal BP some important changes were observe in the ecosystem composition, the carbon isotopic contents of organic matter in lake sediments (δ 13 C), the total organic carbon and nitrogen amount and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C / N). These environmental changes are related to the transition in the conifer forest between the Atlas cedar, which expanded after 3750 cal BP, and the pine forest. These vegetation changes have impacted the sedimentation type and composition into the lake. Between 5500 and 5000 cal BP an abrupt change is recorded in all bio and geo-chemical indicators {{as well as in the}} pollen data. The multi-proxy analysis, taking into account the climate variables, tends to indicate that it was mainly a decrease in temperature without a significant change in the overall amount of precipitation. In summary, the present study confirms the overall climate stability over the last 6000 years and highlights the presence of <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> climate events...|$|R
40|$|It is well known, that {{tones of}} Lithuanian {{language}} {{for the first}} time have been described and illustrated using musical notes in the mid of 19 th century by Friedrich Kurschat (lt. Frydrichas Kuršaitis). No single attempt was made in order to analyze in-depth what specific prosodic features were covered by this material since the article of prof. A. Girdenis appeared in 2008. He concluded, that tone distribution is generally based on pitch range and contour differences (i. e. rising vs falling tone opposition). An alternative way of reconstruction proposed here reveals additional features which should be taken in to account as well. Measurements of prosodic parameters (i. e. pitch range, shape and vowel length) show that tones differ in terms of rate of pitch change and duration. Rising tone (or to be more precise – sustained tone) can be defined as having longer duration and less intensive rate of pitch change while the falling tone has opposite parameters – <b>shorter</b> duration <b>and</b> <b>abrupt,</b> steep pitch change. The phonetic nature of Lithuanian language tones therefore should be considered as a complex one...|$|R
40|$|A multi-proxy record (lithology, XRF, CaCO 3 content, {{carbonate}} δ 18 O and δ 13 C) {{was acquired}} from a sediment core drilled in the intermountain Sulmona basin (central Italy). Tephrostratigraphic analyses of three volcanic ash layers ascribe the investigated succession to the MIS 12 -MIS 11 period, spanning the interval ca. 500 – 410 ka. Litho-pedo facies assemblage indicates predominant lacustrine deposition, {{interrupted by a}} minor sub-aerial and lake low stand episode. Variations in major and minor elements concentrations are related {{to changes in the}} clastic input to the lake. The oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate (δ 18 Oc) intervals is interpreted mainly as a proxy for the amount of precipitation in the high-altitude catchment of the karst recharge system. The record shows pronounced hydrological variability at orbital and millennial time-scales, which appears closely related to the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation pattern and replicates North Atlantic and west Mediterranean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fluctuations. The MIS 12 glacial inception is marked by an abrupt reduction of precipitation, lowering of the lake level and enhanced catchment erosion. A well-defined and isotopically prominent interstadial with increased precipitation maybe related to insolation maxima-precession minima at ca. 465 ka. This interstadial ends abruptly at ca. 457 ka and it is followed by a phase of strong short-term instability. Drastic lake-level lowering and enhanced clastic flux characterized the MIS 12 glacial maximum. Lacustrine deposition restarted about 440 ka ago. The MIS 12 –MIS 11 transition is characterized by a rapid increase in the precipitation, lake-level rise and reduction in the clastic input, interrupted by a <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> return to drier conditions. Comparison with marine records from the Iberian margin and western Mediterranean suggests that major events of ice rafted debris deposition, related to southward migrations of the polar front, match the harshest periods in central Italy. This indicates strong teleconnections between Northern hemisphere ice sheet dynamics, North Atlantic oceanic conditions and Mediterranean continental hydrology...|$|R

40|$|On 23 December 1994, Gordon Brown and I {{were walking}} the North Platte River below Keystone Dam {{as part of}} the Lake McConaughy Christmas Bird Count (CBC). At {{approximately}} 8 : 30 a. m. MST, about 0. 5 mi below the dam, we observed a group of 8 Killdeer and a smaller shorebird, which we immediately recognized as a 2 ̆ 2 peep. 2 ̆ 2 We studied the bird for about 30 minutes at distances as close as 40 feet and then returned in the afternoon to photograph it. The size and black legs immediately eliminated Least Sandpiper, and the dark rump eliminated White-rumped Sandpiper. The remaining possibilities were semipalmated, western, and Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpipers, or the remote possibility of something like a stint. The bill was straight, thin, and pointed, very unlike the bill of a Semipalmated. Additionally, the bird had a very elongate body shape like a Baird 2 ̆ 7 s and unlike either Semipalmated or Western. This and other features led us to conclude that it was a Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpiper (Calidris bairdii). The following is {{a detailed description of the}} bird. Its size was about half that of a Killdeer, though it was proportionally slimmer and longer-winged. The slender shape was accentuated by the <b>short</b> legs, <b>and</b> by wingtips that extended beyond the tail tip. The bill was black, straight, and thin, pointed at the tip. The throat was white, neatly separated from the buff-colored breast. The crown, face, and upper breast were buff-colored. There were no obvious darker streaks on the breast. The lower belly and undertail were white. A clear line separated the buff upper breast from the white underparts, like that of a Pectoral Sandpiper. The supercilium was faintly white and most visible when looking at the bird head-on. The mantle was uniformly gray-brown, lacking pale feather edgings. The scapulars were paler and appeared worn. The upperwing on the perched bird was uniformly dark brown, except that the outer two primaries (and possibly the third) were worn, and appeared pale brown and tattered near the tips. We were unable to ascertain the amount of wear on the inner primaries. The legs were <b>short</b> <b>and</b> jet black. The bird vocalized several times when flushed, uttering a high-pitched 2 ̆ 2 kreep, 2 ̆ 2 <b>short</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrupt.</b> The call seemed <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> higher-pitched than that of a Pectoral Sandpiper, and was immediately recognizable as the call note of a Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpiper...|$|R

40|$|How {{the brain}} reconstitutes {{consciousness}} and cognition after a major perturbation like general anesthesia {{is an important}} question with significant neuroscientific and clinical implications. Recent empirical studies in animals and humans suggest that the recovery of consciousness after anesthesia is not random but ordered. Emergence patterns have been classified as progressive <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> transitions from anesthesia to consciousness, with associated differences in duration and electroencephalogram (EEG) properties. We hypothesized that the progressive <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> emergence patterns from the unconscious state are associated with, respectively, continuous and discontinuous synchronization transitions in functional brain networks. The discontinuous transition is explainable {{with the concept of}} explosive synchronization, which has been studied almost exclusively in network science. We used the Kuramato model, a simple oscillatory network model, to simulate progressive <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> transitions in anatomical human brain networks acquired from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 82 brain regions. To facilitate explosive synchronization, distinct frequencies for hub nodes with a large frequency disassortativity (i. e., higher frequency nodes linking with lower frequency nodes, or vice versa) were applied to the brain network. In this simulation study, we demonstrated that both progressive <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> transitions follow distinct synchronization processes at the individual node, cluster, and global network levels. The characteristic synchronization patterns of brain regions that are “progressive and earlier” or “abrupt but delayed” account for previously reported behavioral responses of gradual <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> emergence from the unconscious state. The characteristic network synchronization processes observed at different scales provide new insights into how regional brain functions are reconstituted during progressive <b>and</b> <b>abrupt</b> emergence from the unconscious state. This theoretical approach also offers a principled explanation of how the brain reconstitutes consciousness and cognitive functions after physiologic (sleep), pharmacologic (anesthesia), and pathologic (coma) perturbations...|$|R
