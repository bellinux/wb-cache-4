5|$|The Oaks {{finished}} second in the league behind the Seals in 1946, winning {{the first round of the}} playoffs against Los Angeles before losing to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finals. They finished fourth in 1947, beating <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round before losing to Los Angeles. Stengel managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster heavy with former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old shortstop Billy Martin. Stengel was impressed by Martin's fielding, baseball acuity, and, when there were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the Seattle Rainiers to win the Governors' Cup. The Sporting News named Stengel the Minor League Manager of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{was also}} {{discovered}} in Southern California {{but on a}} much smaller scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{for the murder}} of {{homosexual}} prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it was found in a garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as a suspect after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house {{at the time of the}} murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is a fireboat {{owned by}} State of California and {{operated}} {{by the city of}} <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Bay since 1955. Phoenix is known for helping to save Marina District buildings from further destruction by fire following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Her worthy assistance resulted in a second vintage fireboat obtained for the city. Both Guardian and Phoenix are based at Firehouse No. 35 at Pier 22½ of the Port of San Francisco. Phoenix often leads parades of ships, and takes part in welcoming ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Timothy Ludwig Pflueger (September 26, 1892 – November 20, 1946) was a {{prominent}} architect, interior designer and architectural lighting designer in the San Francisco Bay Area {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. Together with James R. Miller, Pflueger designed some of the leading skyscrapers and movie theaters in <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, and his works featured art by challenging new artists such as Ralph Stackpole and Diego Rivera. Rather than breaking new ground with his designs, Pflueger captured the spirit of the times and refined it, adding a distinct personal flair. His work influenced later architects such as Pietro Belluschi.|$|E

5|$|As Sadness reinstalls {{the core}} memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives {{home to her}} parents and breaks down crying, confessing that she misses Minnesota. As her parents comfort her, they tell her that they also miss Minnesota and Joy and Sadness work the console together, {{creating}} a new core memory that combines their emotions; a new island forms representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, a year later {{at the age of}} 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted a few new ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories from combinations of her emotions). Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a new expanded console with room for them all, allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E
5|$|US 50 {{was created}} in 1926 {{as part of the}} {{original}} U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada east to Annapolis, Maryland along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway, Midland Trail, and the National Old Trails Road. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento, California east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to U.S. Route 6 in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, replacing U.S. Route 48; this was reversed in 1964 when Interstate 580 replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of U.S. Route 213. US 50 had two split configurations into U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed.|$|E
