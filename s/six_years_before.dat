2500|$|Classical {{scholarship}} in the 6th to 4th century BCE believed he existed <b>six</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Xerxes I invasion of Greece in 480 BCE (Xanthus, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Hermippus), {{which is a}} possible misunderstanding of the Zoroastrian four cycles of 3000 years i.e. 12,000 years. This belief is recorded by Diogenes Laërtius, and variant readings could place it <b>six</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Xerxes I, somewhere before 1000 BCE. However, Diogenes also mentions Hermodorus's belief that Zoroaster lived five thousand <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the Trojan War, which would mean he lived around 6200 BCE. The 10th-century Suda, provides a date of [...] "500 <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Plato". Pliny the Elder cited Eudoxus who also placed his death <b>six</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Plato, c. 6300 BCE. Other pseudo-historical constructions are those of Aristoxenus who recorded certain Zaratas the Chaldeaean to have taught Pythagoras in Babylon, or lived {{at the time of}} mythological Ninus and Semiramis. According to Pliny the Elder, there were two Zoroasters. The first lived thousands of years ago, while the second accompanied Xerxes I in the invasion of Greece in 480 BCE. Some scholars propose that the chronological calculation for Zoroaster was developed by Persian magi in the 4th century BCE, and as the early Greeks learned about him from the Achaemenids, this indicates they did not regard him as a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, but as a remote figure.|$|R

The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.|$|E
