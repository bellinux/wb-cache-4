5000|$|There {{has been}} much {{controversy}} as to the identification. Philippe Champault decides in favour of the Peganum harmala (of the order Rutaceae), the <b>Syrian</b> or African <b>rue</b> (Greek [...] ), from the husks of which the vegetable alkaloid harmaline is extracted. The flowers are white with green stripes. Victor Bérard relying partly on a Semitic root, prefers the Atriplex halimus (atriplex, a Latin form of Greek , and , marine), order Chenopodiaceae, a herb or low shrub common on the south European coasts. These identifications are noticed by R. M. Henry, who illustrates the Homeric account by passages in the Paris and Leiden magical papyri, and argues that moly is probably a magical name, derived perhaps from Phoenician or Egyptian sources, for a plant which cannot be certainly identified. He shows that the [...] "difficulty of pulling up" [...] the plant is not a merely physical one, but rather connected with the peculiar powers claimed by magicians. In Tennyson's The Lotos-Eaters, the moly is coupled with the amaranth ("propt on beds of amaranth and moly"). Carl Linnaeus referenced the mythical plant with Allium moly, the scientific name for golden garlic, though of course the perianth of this species is yellow, not white.|$|R

50|$|Several {{alkaloids}} {{that function}} as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) {{are found in}} the seeds of Peganum harmala (also known as Harmal or <b>Syrian</b> <b>Rue),</b> as well as tobacco leaves including harmine, harmaline, and harmalol, which are members of a group of substances with a similar chemical structure collectively known as harmala alkaloids. These alkaloids are of interest for their use in Amazonian shamanism, where they are derived from other plants. The harmala alkaloid harmine, once known as telepathine and banisterine, is a naturally occurring beta-carboline alkaloid that is structurally related to harmaline, and also found in the vine Banisteriopsis caapi. Tetrahydroharmine is also found in B. caapi and P. harmala. Dr. Alexander Shulgin has suggested that harmine may be a breakdown product of harmaline. Harmine and harmaline are reversible MAOIs of the MAO-A isoform of the enzyme, and can stimulate the central nervous system by inhibiting the metabolism of monoamine compounds such as serotonin and norepinephrine.|$|E

40|$|Peganum harmala L., {{also known}} as <b>Syrian</b> <b>rue</b> or Pègano, is a {{herbaceous}} plant belonging to the Zygohpyllaceae family, and is widely used in traditional medicine. The chemical composition of essential oils of P. harmala seeds from five different regions of Northern Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia) was studied by GC and GC-MS analyses. A total of 105 compounds were identified, the main components being oxygenated monoterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. Eugenol is the main component in all oils. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils was assayed against some bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus (DSM 25693), Bacillus cereus (DSM 4313), Bacillus cereus (DSM 4384), Escherichia coli (DMS 857) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 50071).

40|$|ABSTRACT Background. Peganum Harmala (<b>Syrian</b> <b>rue,</b> Nitrariaceae) has a {{long and}} {{widespread}} history of ethnopharmacological use. Due to its rich and diverse alkaloid content, the traditional application of whole plant material or full alkaloid extract is inherently unspecific and therefore susceptible to side effects. Simultaneously, incorrect phytochemical procedures for its use in ayahuasca-analogues cause intoxications in misinformed users. Aim of the study. Providing harm-reduction by developing easily applicable, safe and effective isolation protocols for harmine, harmaline (dihydroharmine) and tetrahydroharmine (leptaflorine) from Peganum Harmala seed. Materials and methods. Only commonly available equipment and reagents were used for isolating the alkaloids. Following extraction, harmine and harmaline were separated using 2 low-tech methods (selective precipitation using sodium bicarbonate or pH-metry). Then, zinc-acetic acid reduction of both harmine and harmaline was attempted. The identity and purity of the obtained alkaloids were confirmed using microscopy and melting point determination. Results. Using pH-metry for the separation of harmine and harmaline proved rapid, effective and recovered 91 % of alkaloids. Selective precipitation of the alkaloids with sodium bicarbonate had a yield of 76 %. Hydrogenation of harmaline to tetrahydroharmine using zinc-acetic acid had a yield of 83 %. Harmine however could not be hydrogenated by zinc-acetic acid. The melting ranges of the obtained alkaloids were narrow and consistent with literature. Based on these results, isolation protocols were developed. Conclusions. Harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine can be isolated with good yields from Peganum Harmala seed following protocols that are applicable in traditional and other low-tech settings. This study showed zinc-acetic acid {{to be effective in}} the reductive synthesis of tetrahydroharmine and also proposes a rapid, precise and high yielding method for the bulk separation of harmine and harmaline using basic pH-metry...|$|E
