Victims say the betting and investment software does not work and they lost their money when the companies suddenly closed. In 2011, private investigator, Ken Gamble, {{acting on behalf of}} groups of victims, provided evidence of {{millions of dollars worth of}} fraud to the Queensland Police Service, but says the fraud squad failed to investigate.

40|$|In {{order to}} remain on store shelves and stay {{competitive}} among the overwhelming number of packaged goods on today’s <b>shelves,</b> <b>companies</b> continue to cut packaging material and increase sustainability. Current packaging has made use {{of a variety of}} paperboard materials including Solid Bleached Sulfate (SBS), Coated Recycled Board (CRB) and Uncoated Recycled Board (URB), also known as Kraft. While both SBS and CRB feature a smooth, white printing surface ideal for high quality graphics, Kraft is typically associated with a dull printing surface and lower-quality graphics. Companies and brands interested in marketing to the eco-friendly consumer are printing a simulated Kraft look on SBS and CRB board rather than utilizing a natural Kraft substrate. The packages printed on natural Kraft substrate (URB) or simulated Kraft substrate (CRB) may or may not affect attention of the consumer when shopping. This research sought to investigate this by using eye-tracking metrics collected from participants in a retail-shopping environment. Statistical analysis yielded no significant difference for participant’s attention when shopping for packages made from (URB) or (CRB). This study illustrates how consumer attention can factor into purchasing products packaged with Kraft substrate compared to products packed with simulated Kraft substrate...|$|R
