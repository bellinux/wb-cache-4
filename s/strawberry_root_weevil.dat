50|$|The adult <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> {{is about}} six {{millimeters}} long, and is dark brown/black in color. They are {{often found in}} the leaves and foliage of the plants they feed on. The adult weevil's elytra are fused together, which means {{they are unable to}} fly.The larvae can be up to thirteen millimeters long when fully grown and they are found near the roots of the plants they are infesting. The larvae are white, legless, with a darker colored head and are often C-shaped.|$|E
50|$|Otiorhynchus ovatus, {{also called}} the <b>Strawberry</b> <b>Root</b> <b>Weevil,</b> occurs across Canada and the {{northern}} United States {{and is one of}} the many species in the weevil family (Curculionidae). Its name comes from its affinity for strawberry plants, which form a large part of its diet. They are, however, known to feed on other plants as well. Occasionally the larvae cause serious damage to seedlings and young transplants in plantations and nurseries (Rose and Lindquest 1985). It is known to be one of the major pests threatening sub-tropical strawberry farming.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants that}} the <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> feeds on include strawberry, raspberry, rhododendron, grape, and {{peppermint}} {{and they have}} also been known to feed on grasses. Adults feed nocturnally on leaves and stems, leaving notches and causing slight damage, while the larvae cause significantly more damage by feeding on the roots and crowns of the plant, even as they overwinter, if the temperatures are mild. The plants that are fed upon by the larvae are stunted and have reddish leaves that curl exposing the underside, and the plant wilts as the fruits form, especially in dry weather. The fine roots and sometimes even the hard fibrous roots are destroyed, allowing for the plants to be easily pulled from the soil. These plants have significantly shortened lives, poor yields that result in losses in revenue. Fields with significant damage can be up to 0.2ha. Since adults do not fly, plants bordering older plantings show damage the first season, with damage spreading each year the planting is kept.Controlling the <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> includes {{a wide variety of}} methods {{such as the use of}} insecticides, plowing under old crops and crop rotation, cleaning farm equipment before moving to a new field, and fall plowing infested beds or fields. Another control method is the use of entomopathogenic nematodes, though results have varied.|$|E

50|$|Otiorhynchus (often spelt Otiorrhynchus) {{is a large}} genus of weevils in {{the family}} Curculionidae. Many species of the genus, {{particularly}} the black vine weevil (O. sulcatus) and the <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> (O. ovatus), are important pests, both as larvae and as adults. Larvae feed on plant roots. Adults are flightless with fused elytra and feed at night on plant foliage. In many species of the genus at least some races are polyploid and parthenogenetic, {{while the rest of}} the races and species are diploid and bisexual. Otiorhynchus weevils, particularly O. scaber, have been a popular subject for studies of the evolution of parthenogenesis. The genus is native to the Palearctic region. However, sixteen species were inadvertently introduced to North America and have become widespread there.A number of species are troglobites, cave-dwelling animals that lack eyes.|$|E

Choice assays were conducted in an Y-tube olfactometer filled with moist sand. Infective juveniles were activated {{by the presence of}} intact <b>roots</b> of both <b>strawberry</b> and thuja plants. Some nematodes aggregated in the compartments with roots but most moved away from the roots to the opposite side. Given a choice, IJs showed a preference for <b>strawberry</b> <b>roots</b> above O. sulcatus larvae. No difference in preference was observed between thuja roots and O. sulcatus larvae.

40|$|Physical {{exclusion}} {{shows some}} {{potential as a}} novel <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> control strategy, but barriers to <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> immigration may also exclude beneficial insects, such as ground beetles. A field study was undertaken in 1997 {{to assess the impact}} of two physical barriers—portable plastic trenches and aluminum fences with Teflon tape—on <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> and ground beetle immigration into plots of strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa (Duchesne). Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman) and Nemocestes incomptus (Horn), each comprised 43 % of the <b>root</b> <b>weevils</b> caught at the site. Most (86 %) of the ground beetles caught in control plots were longer than 1 cm, the width of the gap in the portable trench top. Trenches excluded 75 and 63 % of B. pellucidus and N. incomptus, respectively, without significantly reducing immigration of large (< 1 cm) ground beetles. Fences excluded 65, 84, and 99 % of B. pellucidus, N. incomptus, and large ground beetles, respectively. Adding diatomaceous earth to trenches did not increase their efficacy, and fences without Teflon tape excluded ground beetles but not <b>root</b> <b>weevils.</b> The reduction in the population of <b>root</b> <b>weevils</b> and other <b>strawberry</b> pests caused by the use of barriers reduced damage to strawberry plant leaves and increased strawberry plant survival relative to unprotected control plots.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{life history}} of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus ovatus (L.), on {{peppermint}} was studied in the Willamette Valley of Oregon to provide the information necessary to develop effective control measures. Adult weevils emerged from the soil from late May until mid- June and were active in the field until late July. Active feeding by adults occurred between one and seven hours after sunset. No significant migration {{for the purpose of}} feeding or oviposition was observed and no adults were found to overwinter. Oviposition occurred from mid-June until September in the laboratory but ceased by late July in the field. Egg incubation periods averaged 13 days in the laboratory with fertility rates of 70 to 80 percent. Fertility declined substantially in the laboratory after late July. Larvae occurred in the peppermint root systems from early June until late May of the following year with pupation occurring from mid-April until the first of June. Carabid beetles, Omaseus melanarius, were found to be predaceous on adult strawberry root weevils but no other predators or parasites were discovered.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The temperature-dependent {{development}} of pupae and adults of <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> (SRW) Otiorhynchus ovatus (L.) was studied in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. var. 'Totem'). The {{development of}} pupae and adults was investigated at constant temperatures from 3 - 33 °C at 3 °C intervals. Major {{emphasis was on}} the development of a weighted linear temperature-based pupal prediction model. The predictive ability of this weighted model was compared to a traditional non-weighted linear degree-day model by relating predictions to the observed occurrence of SRW lifestages determined by field sampling. The upper thermal lethal limit for SRW pupae was between 30 and 33 °C. Pupae did not eclose below 6 °C. Mean pupal duration was 127 d at 6 °C and 7 d at 30 °C. Rate of development (1 /days) was greatest at 30 °C. The weighted linear pupal prediction model produced a developmental threshold of 4. 3 °C and a degree-day requirement of 227. 3. The non-weighted linear pupal prediction model produced a developmental threshold of 6. 2 °C and a degree-day requirement of 163. 9. Adults fed at all temperatures from 3 - 33 °C and oviposited at temperatures between 18 and 30 °C. The longest preoviposition period (32. 8 d) and the least total number of eggs (2. 2) were observed at 18 °C. The shortest preoviposition period (15. 1 d) and the greatest total number of eggs (282. 5) were observed at 27 °C. A temperature range of 21 to 27 °C appeared to be optimum for oviposition; i. e. relative to other temperatures, preoviposition time was short, mortality was low, and total number of eggs laid was high...|$|E

There are various options for controlling and mitigating the impact of these pests, and biological controls offer one potentially valuable solution. Economic analysis of these pests are vital to forming an appropriate policy response at the government level. Much of the literature on bio-security and biological controls focusses on a biological perspective rather than an economic one. This dissertation presents a more comprehensive framework for economic valuations of plant pests, with the use of a modified cost-benefit analysis (incorporating inputs from partial equilibirum trade modelling) to test the economic impact of plant pests and controls responses in New Zealand. Specifically, two case studies are examined: clover <b>root</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitona lepidus), and its biological control Microctonus aethiopoides; and glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis), and its biological control Gonatocerus ashmeadi. The analysis shows the impacts of clover <b>root</b> <b>weevil,</b> and glassy-winged sharpshooter, if left unchecked, are –NZ$ 604 million, and –NZ$ 5 million per year respectively.

Three <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> types were sampled—structural roots; feeder roots without secondary tissues; and suberized, black perennial roots. Both lesion and root-knot nematodes primarily infected feeder roots from structural roots or healthy perennial roots. Few nematodes were recovered from soil, diseased roots, or suberized roots. Lesion nematode recovery was correlated with healthy roots. In both 1997 and 1998, P. penetrans populations peaked about day 150 (end of May) and then declined. The decline in numbers corresponded to changes in total <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> weight and root type distribution. The loss of nematode habitat resulted from loss of roots due to disease and the transition from structural to suberized perennial roots.
