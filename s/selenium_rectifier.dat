40|$|By {{means of}} a Braun tube, we made a {{graphical}} investigation on wave distortions of <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> under temperatures and voltages higher than the usual ones, and have given a theoritical explanation for them. We assume that <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> have an insulating layer and that the thickness {{is the value of}} 10 ^ to 10 ^ cm (according to the Mott and Schottky 2 ̆ 7 s diffusion theory).

50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, Partridge Wilson {{embraced a}} new technology, {{imported}} from America, for the fast charging of batteries. They showcased their Davenset fast charger at the 1948 Commercial Motor show. It used a <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier,</b> came mounted on a wheeled chassis {{to make it easier to}} move around a garage, and could charge a starter battery in about an hour. They also exhibited a new pistol grip battery tester.|$|E
50|$|A <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{is a type}} {{of metal}} rectifier, invented in 1933. They were used in power {{supplies}} for electronic equipment, and in high current battery charger applications until they were superseded by silicon diode rectifiers in the late 1960s. The arrival of the alternator in some automobiles was the result of compact, low cost, high current silicon rectifiers. These units were small enough to be inside the alternator case, unlike the selenium units that preceded silicon devices.|$|E

2500|$|In 1874, German {{scientist}} Karl Ferdinand Braun {{discovered the}} [...] "unilateral conduction" [...] of crystals. Braun patented the crystal rectifier in 1899. Copper oxide and <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were developed for power {{applications in the}} 1930s.|$|R
50|$|There were various vacuum/gas devices, such as {{the mercury}} arc rectifiers, thyratrons, ignitrons, and vacuum diodes. Solid-state {{technology}} was in its infancy, represented by copper oxide and <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> All of these gave excessive forward voltage drop at high currents. One answer was mechanically opening and closing contacts, if this could be done quickly and cleanly enough.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{is about}} the same size as copper oxide rectifiers, but much larger than a silicon or {{germanium}} diode. Selenium rectifiers have a long but not indefinite service life of 60,000 to 100,000 hours depending on rating and cooling. The rectifier can show some unforming of the rectifier characteristic after long storage. [...] Each cell can withstand a reverse voltage around 25 volts, and has a forward voltage drop around 1 volt, which limits the efficiency at low voltages. Selenium rectifiers have an operating temperature limit of 130 °C, and are not suitable for high-frequency circuits.|$|E
50|$|On-site {{manufacturing}} capability covered {{every part of}} the engineering spectrum other than electron beam welding.There were acres of machine shops containing almost every variety of machine tool, extensive press shops, iron and non-ferrous foundries together with pattern shop and core shop, extensive drop-stamp forge, die-casting shops and tool room, tin-smiths' shop, copper oxide and <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> shops, electro-plating shop. The assembly and erection shops included wiring shops for signalling equipment, rectifier equipments, colliery equipment, railway signaling relays. The list is almost endless. Support activities included a well-equipped and staffed medical centre and apprentice training school and hostel. Apprentices fell into Trade, Craft, Student and Graduate categories.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Tweed" [...] 5F10 model, {{launched}} in 1955, {{but not in}} time for the Fender catalog of that year, was a 10-watt amplifier utilising a 6AV6 (from 1956 a 6AT6) preamplifier tube, 12AX7 phase inverter tube, a pair of 6V6GT power amplifier tubes, and one 5Y3GT rectifier tube, with a Jensen P10R 10-inch speaker. The amplifier had a very simple circuit and used only a single channel with a two-stage preamp, with just a volume and (treble-cut) tone control. The Harvard was a fixed bias amplifier, using a basic cathodyne phase inverter, but did include a <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> in the bias circuit. The 5F10 was discontinued in 1961.|$|E
50|$|<b>Selenium</b> <b>{{rectifiers}}</b> {{were once}} widely used as high-tension rectifiers in transformerless radio and TV sets, before cheaper silicon diodes became available. Although they were reasonably efficient in this application, (at least compared to vacuum-tube rectifiers), their internal resistance tended {{to increase as}} they aged. Apart from reducing the available high voltage, this tends to make them run hotter, producing an unpleasant smell as the selenium starts to evaporate.|$|R
50|$|Power {{electronics}} {{started with}} the development of the mercury arc rectifier. Invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902, it was used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid-controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Uno Lamm developed a mercury valve with grading electrodes making them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933 <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were invented.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to later}} silicon or {{germanium}} devices, copper-oxide rectifiers {{tended to have}} poor efficiency, and the reverse voltage rating was rarely {{more than a few}} volts. A number of rectifier discs would need to be used in series to provide an adequate reverse breakdown voltage figure - a bridge rectifier for a 12V battery charger would often use 12 metal <b>rectifiers.</b> <b>Selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were generally more efficient than metal-oxide types, and could handle higher voltages. However, considerably more skill was required for their construction.|$|R
50|$|Although four-, six-, {{and even}} a few rare eight-tube radios were produced, they were not common. The four-tube version with vacuum tube {{rectifier}} was of inferior performance, as they typically had no IF amplifier tube, although some four-tube designs with a <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> in place of the rectifier tube avoided this problem. The six-tube versions added either a RF amplifier tube, a push-pull audio power amplifier tube, or a beat frequency oscillator tube (to listen to Morse code or single-sideband modulation transmissions). However, these radios cost significantly more and sold in smaller quantities. The eight-tube versions cost even more, adding two or more of the features of the six-tube versions and sometimes an extra IF amplifier tube.|$|E
5000|$|The T/O was a dual-powered radio receiver; {{it could}} operate from {{electrical}} service AC or DC and via {{a pair of}} [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] dry cell batteries for portability. The batteries are obsolete but the early T/O models live on either due {{to the ability to}} use AC line or a battery made of modern cells (6 Ds for the [...] "A" [...] power and 10 9 volt transistor batteries for [...] "B") or an inverter. Zenith used a <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> of later versions of the T/O, replacing rectifier tubes used on the earlier models. Inserting the power plug into a socket on the chassis or the side of the radio (depending on model) switched the T/O to battery operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{vibrator}} was {{a device}} with switch contacts on flexible metal strips. When the vibrator was operated the strips vibrated rapidly {{in such a}} way as to make contacts presenting a 6 or 12V DC from the battery in alternating sense, rapidly exchanging positive and negative, effectively generating a square wave. Unlike DC, an alternating voltage applied to the terminals of the primary winding of a transformer will induce a different (and often higher) voltage of any desired value at the secondary; this voltage can be rectified by a thermionic diode or copper-oxide or <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier,</b> or by an additional set of mechanical contacts making the vibrator output a synchronous rectifier. The rectified output is then filtered, ultimately converting a DC voltage to a higher one, with some losses dissipated as heat.|$|E
25|$|Once common until {{replaced}} by more compact and less costly silicon solid-state rectifiers in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and {{took advantage of}} the semiconductor properties of selenium or copper oxide. While <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube rectifiers, they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable to use at low frequencies.

5000|$|The Fleming valve, {{also called}} the Fleming {{oscillation}} valve, was a vacuum tube (or [...] "thermionic valve") invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming as a detector for early radio receivers used in electromagnetic wireless telegraphy. It was the first practical vacuum tube and the first thermionic diode, a vacuum tube whose purpose is to conduct current {{in one direction and}} block current flowing in the opposite direction. The thermionic diode was later widely used as a rectifier — a device which converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) — in the power supplies {{of a wide range of}} electronic devices, until beginning to be replaced by the <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier</b> in the early 1930s and almost completely replaced by the semiconductor diode in the 1960s. The Fleming valve was the forerunner of all vacuum tubes, which dominated electronics for 50 years. The IEEE has described it as [...] "one of the most important developments in the history of electronics", and it is on the List of IEEE Milestones for electrical engineering.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} known that {{applying}} a mechanical vibration perpendicularly {{to the surface of}} the commercial <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier,</b> then the piezo-electromotive force across the sample with the same frequency of the mechanical vibration was generated. The selenide layers of Cd, Pb, Bi and Sn were constituted by evaporating these materials onto Se substrate respectively, in order to investigate that any selenide layer contributed most to the piezo-electromotive force of the commercial <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifier.</b> The characteristics of piezo-electromotive force and the barrier electrostatic capacities were measured for each samples. The results are as follows : 1. The magnitudes of piezo-electromotive force of the commercial samples and of the samples with Cd-selenide layer increase proportionally to the square root of the reverse bias voltage from zero up to minus one volt, but the magnitudes of piezo-electromotive force of the samples with Pb-, Bi- and Sn-selenide layer increase slowly with increasing reverse bias voltage. 2. The magnitudes of the diffusion potential V_D and of the impurity density N obtained from the C^ -V_a characteristics of the samples with Cd-selenide layer are nearly same values of that of the commercial samples, but these values of the samples with Pb-, Bi and Sn-selenide layer are larger than that of the commercial samples and of the samples with Cd-selenide layer. 3. The values of V_ 0 obtained from the υ- V_a characteristics, which seem to be equal to V_D, are smaller than V_D obtained from both I-V_a and C^ -V_a characteristics. 4.

50|$|<b>Selenium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> had {{a shorter}} {{lifespan}} than desired. During catastrophic failure they produced significant quantities of malodorous and highly toxic fumes that let the repair technician {{know what the}} problem was. By far the most common failure mode was a progressive increase in forward resistance, increasing forward voltage drop and reducing the rectifier's efficiency. During the 1960s they began to be superseded by silicon rectifiers which exhibited lower forward voltage drop, lower cost, and higher reliability. They are still manufactured for exact replacement purposes but are not designed into new equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{semiconductor}} doping were long known empirically in such devices as crystal radio detectors and <b>selenium</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> For instance, in 1885 Shelford Bidwell, and in 1930 the German scientist Bernhard Gudden, each independently {{reported that the}} properties of semiconductors were due to the impurities contained within them. The doping process was formally first developed by John Robert Woodyard working at Sperry Gyroscope Company during World War II, with a US Patent issued in 1950. The demands of his work on radar denied Woodyard the opportunity to pursue research on semiconductor doping.|$|R

40|$|Buildings 7740 and 7741 {{are a part}} of {{a former}} nuclear weapon`s storage and {{maintenance}} facility located in the southeastern portion of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. This underground tunnel complex was originally used as a classified storage area beginning in 1949 and continuing until 1969. Staff from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory recently completed a detailed Relative Risk Site Evaluation of the facility. This evaluation included (1) obtaining engineering drawings of the facility and associated structures, (2) conducting detailed radiological surveys, (3) air sampling, (4) sampling drainage systems, and (5) sampling the underground wastewater storage tank. Ten samples were submitted for laboratory analysis of radionuclides and priority pollutant metals, and two samples submitted for analysis of volatile organic compounds. No volatile organic contaminants were detected using field instruments or laboratory analyses. However, several radionuclides and metals were detected in water and/or soil/sediment samples collected from this facility. Of the radionuclides detected, only {sup 226 }Ra may have come from facility operations; however, its concentration is at least one order of magnitude below the relative-risk comparison value. Several metals (arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, and antimony) were found to exceed the relative-risk comparison values for water, while only arsenic, cadmium, and lead were found to exceed the relative risk comparison values for soil. Of these constituents, it is believed that only arsenic, beryllium, mercury, and lead may have come from facility operations. Other significant hazards posed by the tunnel complex include radon exposure and potentially low oxygen concentrations (< 19. 5 % in atmosphere) if the tunnel complex is not allowed to vent to the outside air.
