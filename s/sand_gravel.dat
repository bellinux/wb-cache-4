5|$|Much of {{the human}} history of South Dakota was shaped by its geology. Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills, and {{quarrying}} was an important economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota. Mines and quarries in present-day South Dakota produce gold, Sioux quartzite, Milbank granite, <b>sand,</b> <b>gravel,</b> limestone, mica, and uranium. The state also produces a very limited amount of oil and natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous {{limestone}} uplands in Britain. They are composed of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for building stone and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. <b>Sand,</b> <b>gravel</b> and peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E

40|$|In {{studying}} the problems on sediment transport {{in a stream}} and stabilities of astream channel, the criterion for mvement of <b>sands</b> and <b>gravels</b> by action of fljw, theso-called critical tractive force, becomes generally important. The present paper dealswith the hydraulic approach to solve the mechanism of the critical tractive force ofgraded <b>sand</b> <b>gravels.</b> In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force of graded <b>sand</b> <b>gravels,</b> especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical condition for movement and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment of <b>sand</b> <b>gravels</b> proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the critical tractive force of graded <b>sand</b> <b>gravels,</b> and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand gravels. In the second part, a theory for the critical tractive force of graded <b>sand</b> <b>gravels</b> isdeveloped, based on the author's procedure to solve the criterion for movement of sandgravels and the existence of wakes behind <b>sand</b> <b>gravels.</b> It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the critical tractive force of graded <b>sand</b> <b>gravels</b> expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation of graded sand gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two. Based on the above consideration,an empirical formula for the critical tractive force of graded <b>sand</b> <b>gravels</b> is proposedand compared with some other formulas proposed by authorities...|$|R

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, <b>sand,</b> <b>gravel,</b> or dead vegetation {{in which to}} lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of Australia and {{on the west coast}} of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.|$|E

25|$|During {{at least}} three glacial periods, {{including}} the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago, ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines, valleys, and hills.

During glaciation, what is now Flushing Meadows Park was formed just north of the terminal moraine that runs across Long Island, which consisted of <b>sand,</b> <b>gravel,</b> clay and boulders. The moraine created a drainage divide, with rivers north of the moraine such as the future Flushing River emptying into the north shore. The Flushing Meadows site became a glacial lake, and then a salt marsh after the ice melted. Into the 19th Century, the site continued to consist of wetlands straddling Flushing River.
