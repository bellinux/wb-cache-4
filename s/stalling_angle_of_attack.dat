5000|$|In a {{conventional}} blown flap, {{a small amount}} of the compressed air produced by the jet engine is [...] "bled" [...] off at the compressor stage and piped to channels running along the rear of the wing.

Injecting high energy air into the boundary layer produces an increase in the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and maximum lift coefficient by delaying boundary layer separation from the airfoil. Boundary layer control by mass injecting (blowing) prevents boundary layer separation by supplying additional energy to the particles of fluid which are being retarded in the boundary layer.

50|$|Aircraft have {{a flight}} {{envelope}} that describes its safe performance limits {{in regard to}} such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength. Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop pilots from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope. For example, if the pilot uses the rearward side-stick to pitch the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection will prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> As a result, even if the pilot tried to apply more and more rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command. Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply in an emergency maximum control forces while not {{at the same time}} inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.|$|E

In particular, the simulation involving the horizontal tail, {{which consists of}} stabilizer and an elevator, was carried out to study the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> for 11 elevator deflection cases at certain Reynolds and Mach numbers of the incident airflow. The horizontal tail geometry was firstly obtained using SolidWorks 2012 and analyzed.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{investigation was}} carried out in the Merril Wind Tunnel at the California Institute of Technology to determine the effect on low speed lift of retracting the leading edge of a thin, circular-arc airfoil. Several configurations were tried, some with a spanwise slot milled into the upper surface so that the leading edge recess formed by retraction could be utilized as an air intake to improve the flow. A comparison was made between the configurations with the leading edge retracted to various positions and the basic airfoil. The investigation showed that leading edge retraction caused a linear loss of maximum lift proportional to the percent reduction in chord up to a critical position where lift and the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increased abruptly. Thereafter, maximum lift was reduced at a rate higher than the chord reduction. The effect of the slot was negligible. The critical position phenomenon warrants further study...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of leading-edge retraction {{as a possible}} high-lift device for thin, sharp-nosed airfoils was investigated. Experimental results are presented for a symmetrical, 6 %-thick, circular-arc airfoil configuration, such that the forward 9. 5 % section of the chord is retractable up to a distance of 20 % chord into the wing. The results include direct force measurements, limited surface pressure surveys and limited single-tuft surveys. Tests were made with varying amounts of retraction in combination with variable stagger between leading edges of upper and lower surfaces and with several upper surface slot configurations. One retracted configuration was tested with a 20 % chord, split-flap. The results show that retraction is ineffective in increasing maximum lift. In general the effect on maximum lift was as follows: (1) Retracting up to approximately 9 %, decreased maximum lift {{in proportion to the}} loss in wing area, (2) With exactly 9. 06 % retraction and with certain configurations of stagger and/or slots, the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was increased 2 [degrees] and the maximum lift was equal to that of the unaltered airfoil, (3) Retracting more than 9. 06 % resulted in a disproportionate loss of maximum lift, approximately 20 % less than the unaltered airfoil...|$|E

The nature and magnitudes of the ground interference effects on the aerodynamic characterlstlcs of the sweptback wing are, in general, com-parable to those obtained on unswept wings.

The prescribed surface curvature distribution blade design (CIRCLE) method {{is applied to}} a symmetrical airfoil NACA 0012 and a non-symmetrical airfoil E 387 to remove their surface curvature and slope-of-curvature discontinuities. Computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to investigate the effects of curvature distribution on aerodynamic performance of the original and modified airfoils. An inviscid–viscid interaction scheme is introduced to predict the positions of laminar separation bubbles. The results are compared with experimental data obtained from tests on the original airfoil geometry. The computed aerodynamic advantages of the modified airfoils are analyzed in different operating conditions. The leading edge singularity of NACA 0012 is removed and it is shown that the surface curvature discontinuity affects aerodynamic performance near the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The discontinuous slope-of-curvature distribution of E 387 results in a larger laminar separation bubble at lower angles of attack and lower Reynolds numbers. It also affects the inherent performance of the airfoil at higher Reynolds numbers. It is shown that at relatively high angles of attack, a continuous slope-of-curvature distribution reduces the skin friction by suppressing both laminar and turbulent separation, and by delaying laminar-turbulent transition. It is concluded that the surface curvature distribution has significant effects on the boundary layer behavior and consequently an improved curvature distribution will lead to higher aerodynamic efficiency...|$|E

The lift-to-drag ratio is improved as well at higher AOA and lift coefficient range. The vorticity contours of tip vortices of two types of wings show that, the vortices cores move outboard due to the ground effect. The concentrated vorticity distribution of the prototype wing is scattered by the tip sails, and spread over a larger area. For the tip-sails wing, the vortices at h*= 0. 15 are scattered much more than the vortices at h*= 0. 5 and the intensity of the vortex is much lower. The dissipation of the tip vortices is accelerated due to the inhibition by the ground clearances and the spreading by the tip sails to the vortices...|$|E

A highfidelity ice-casting simulation of a runback ice accretion was attached to the model leading edge. For Re 16 : 0 106 and M 0 : 20, the artificial ice shape decreased the maximum lift coefficient from 1. 82 to 1. 51 and decreased the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 18. 1 to 15. 0 deg. In general, the iced-airfoil performance was insensitive to Reynolds and Mach number changes over the range tested. Aerodynamic testing was also conducted on a quarter-scale NACA 23012 model [18 in.

Higher-fidelity simulations of the runback ice accretion that included geometrically scaled threedimensional features resulted in larger performance degradations than those measured on the full-scale model. Based upon this research, a new subclassification of spanwise-ridge ice is proposed that distinguishes between short and tall ridges.

Aerodynamic performance tests were conducted at the ONERA F 1 pressurized wind tunnel over a Reynolds number range of 4. 7 ? 10 (exp 6) to 16. 0 ? 10 (exp 6) and a Mach (M) number ran ge of 0. 10 to 0. 28. For Re = 16. 0 ? 10 (exp 6) and M = 0. 20, the simulated runback ice accretion on the airfoil decreased the maximum lift coe fficient from 1. 82 to 1. 51 and decreased the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 18. 1 deg to 15. 0 deg.

40|$|Unsteady vortex {{structures}} and vorticity convection over the airfoil (NACA 0012), oscillating in the uniform inflow, are studied by flow visualization and velocity measurements. The airfoil, pivoting at {{one-third of the}} chord, oscillates periodically near the static <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> (AOA) at high reduced-frequency. The phase-triggering and modified phase-averaged techniques are employed to reconstruct the pseudo instantaneous velocity field over the airfoil. During the down stroke cycle, the leading-edge separation vortex is growing and the vortex near the trailing edge begins to shed into the wake. During the upstroke cycle, the leading-edge separation vortex is matured and moves downstream, and the counter clockwise vortex is forming near the trailing edge. Convection speeds and wavelength of the unsteady vortex structure over the airfoil {{equal to that of}} the counter clockwise vortex shed into the wake. This kind of vortex structure is termed as "synchronized shedding" type. The wavelength of unsteady vortex structure over the airfoil is significantly different from that at low reduced-frequency. Consistent convection speeds of the leading-edge separation vortex are acquired from the spatial-temporal variations of local circulation and local surface vorticity generation, and equals that predicted from flow visualization. Spatial-temporal variations of the local surface vorticity generation clearly reveal the formation and passage of the leading-edge separation vortex only in the region where the flow does not separate completely from the surface. Significant amounts of the surface vorticity are generated within the leading-edge region of the airfoil during the upstroke cycle. Only negligible amount of surface vorticity is produced within the region of complete flow separation. During the down stroke cycle, the surface vorticity generation is mild along the airfoil surface, except the leading-edge region where a small scale leading-edge separation vortex is forming and growing.
