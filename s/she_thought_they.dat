5|$|The {{screenplay}} for Ruma Maida {{was written by}} Ayu Utami, her first such work; mainly known for her novels, she had avoided screenplays as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were generally too commercially oriented. She wrote the screenplay {{over a period of}} six months beginning in 2008, when Lamp Pictures – which produced the film with Karuna Pictures– requested that she write a story about nationalism; according to the director Teddy Soeriaatmadja, who was brought in while the screenplay was still on its first draft, he and Utami read seven drafts of the screenplay before they agreed on the story. Considering the screenplay a way to encourage the younger generation to study Indonesian history, which she said could be fun, Utami decided to focus on education, diversity, and history.|$|E

Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were Mike's. The attack on Ed was personal and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on Ed was personal after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails. Mike protests his innocence, and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) finds evidence which makes Mike innocent. Throughout the day, Megan tries to rebuild her relationship with Lacey (Mary Mouser), carpooling Lacey and her friends, Sarah (Teresa Celentano) and Betsy (Anna Friedman).|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

500|$|Throughout her career, Paine {{generally}} made {{oil paintings}} on 1/2 inch wood panels {{of which the}} sides and back were washed in red, gray-green, or green-blue. The subjects of the paintings were often portrayed in a confident manner in half-length poses. Their accessories, hair, and clothing were often [...] "elaborately detailed". The placement of hands, tables, and other objects could be awkward. She {{had a tendency to}} paint the sitters with long hands, light flesh tones, doelike eyes and round faces. Paine was known to take liberties in the portrayal of her subjects; she once painted a gray-eyed man's portrait with black eyes because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were more attractive.|$|E

In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, and his wife, Elena, though privately <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had [...] "blood on their hands".

In August 2014, Inside Soap's Michael Cregan {{expressed}} {{his love for}} the character, commenting [...] "We love Neighbours Naomi and her flirty ways." [...] Cregan also thought the storyline involving Josh was [...] "saucy stuff". While Stephen Downie from TV Week quipped, [...] "The romance between Josh and Naomi has a use-by date but, much like the couple, we're willing to enjoy this ride while it lasts." [...] Claire Crick from All About Soap praised the couple, even though <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were complete opposites. Crick also loved their [...] "hilarious secret hook-ups". O'Reilly was concerned about how her character would be received by viewers, especially when she went after Toadie, but she {{was pleased with the}} positive reaction to Naomi.|$|E

500|$|At Yekaterinburg, Tatiana {{occasionally}} {{joined her}} younger sisters in chatting {{with some of}} the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death," [...] and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She [...] "would be pleasant to the guards if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner," [...] recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family. She also {{spent a great deal of}} time sitting with her mother and ill brother, reading to her mother or playing games to occupy the time. At the Ipatiev House, Tatiana and her sisters were required to do their own laundry and make bread. Her nursing skills were called upon at the end of June 1918 when she gave an injection of morphine to Dr. Eugene Botkin to ease his kidney pain.|$|E

He sends a text from Craig's phone asking Sarah to come upstairs to see him. Safe in the knowledge that Sarah is on her way, JP sets about seducing Craig. When she walks in, she can't believe what she's looking at..." [...] Sarah tried to recover from this and Batley said: [...] "I don't think she got over Rhys, either. Craig more so, though. He absolutely destroyed her happiness and belief in men. Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life and she put so much effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her." [...] Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well. However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: [...] "John Paul was her confidante and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were best friends - it's hard to say which part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience. It was the betrayal from both of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{daughter}} of a former staff member described Clark and her mother as not [...] "odd or strange" [...] but rather [...] "quiet, loving, giving ladies".

2500|$|In 1968, she {{was offered}} the role of Sally Bowles in the musical Cabaret. As Sheridan Morley later reported: [...] "At first <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were joking. She had never done a musical and she has an unusual croaky voice which sounds {{as if she has}} a {{permanent}} cold. So frightened was she of singing in public that she auditioned from the wings, leaving the pianists alone on stage". But when it opened at the Palace Theatre in February 1968, Frank Marcus, reviewing for Plays and Players, commented that: [...] "She sings well. The title song, in particular, is projected with great feeling." ...|$|E

After critiquing each outfit, Stacy and Clinton presented a more [...] "appropriate" [...] outfit to the participant to help illustrate the [...] "rules" [...] for the participant to follow when shopping for new clothes.

The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, [...] "Hut tut, what has happened now?" [...] On another occasion, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family the entity had visited his family in England and apologized for his skepticism.|$|E
2500|$|Muir's {{friendship}} with Jeanne Carr had a lifelong influence on {{his career as}} a naturalist and writer. They first met in the fall of 1860, when, at age 22, he entered a number of his homemade inventions in the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society Fair. Carr, a fair assistant, was asked by fair officials to review Muir's exhibits to see if they had merit. [...] <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> did and [...] "saw in his entries evidence of genius worthy of special recognition," [...] notes Miller. As a result, Muir received a diploma and a monetary award for his handmade clocks and thermometer. [...] During the next three years while a student at the University of Wisconsin, he was befriended by Carr and her husband, Ezra, a professor at the same university. According to Muir biographer Bonnie Johanna Gisel, the Carrs recognized his [...] "pure mind, unsophisticated nature, inherent curiosity, scholarly acumen, and independent thought." [...] Jeanne Carr, 35 years of age, especially appreciated his youthful individuality, along with his acceptance of [...] "religious truths" [...] that were much like her own.|$|E

2500|$|Blixen {{worked on}} a novel she called Albondocani for many years, hoping to produce a volume {{in the style of}} [...] by Jules Romains, with {{interwoven}} stories across several volumes. The main character, Harun al-Rashid, was taken from One Thousand and One Nights. She worked on several collections at once, categorizing them according to their themes and whether <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were mostly to make money or literary. She jumped between writing the collections of stories for Albondocani to Anecdotes of Destiny to New Gothic Tales and New Winter’s Tales. Almost all of Blixen's tales from the 1940s and 1950s follow a traditional style of storytelling, weaving Gothic themes such as incest and murder with myth and bewitchment as a means of exploring identity, morality and philosophy. Most also take place against the background of the 19th century or earlier periods. Concerning her deliberately old-fashioned style, Blixen mentioned in several interviews that she wanted to express a spirit that no longer existed in modern times, one of being rather than doing. Her narratives hover between skillfully crafted illusion and romanticism, with a keen knowledge of the preferred tastes of her audience. Blixen crafted her English tales in a more direct manner and her Danish tales in a 19th-century writing style which she felt would appeal more to them. Because she simultaneously worked on different collections, works written in this period were not published until almost a decade after they were originally written.|$|E
