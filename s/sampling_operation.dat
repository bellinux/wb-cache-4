40|$|Due {{to their}} simple and {{cost-effective}} implementation Sigma-Delta ADCs are preferred converters in many low frequency applications. However, despite the high demand, {{there are still}} only a few designs that achieve high performance for bandwidths in the MHz range and above. A main difficulty in utilizing Sigma-Delta converters for higher frequency bandwidths comes from the basics of their operation, namely from {{the need for a}} high oversampling ratio. This high oversampling ratio is usually obtained by a high frequency <b>sampling</b> <b>operation</b> and high quality decision switches. In Sigma-Delta converters, those switches operate on weak high-speed signals and can introduce performance degrading effects like asymmetry, metastability or excessive loop delays. In this paper an alternative implementation of the sampling circuit as suggested in [1] is described. Instead of a single phase clock, the sampler generates N equally spaced clock phases that are synchronized to an external reference clock {{with the help of a}} Delay Lock Loop (DLL). This poly-phase sampling allows for a high overall oversampling ratio with a much lower effective sampling speed. In this way the <b>sampling</b> <b>operation</b> is parallelized and the requirements towards the speed and accuracy of the individual decision switches are significantly decreased. In this paper the implementation of an eight-phase, 1 GHz poly-phase sampler is shown. The circuit level design requirements for a single delay element, chain of delay elements and a complete DLL are discussed and the basic tradeoffs are described...|$|E
30|$|Analog {{to digital}} (A/D) convertors are key in many {{applications}} of {{digital signal processing}} (DSP) and communication systems[1]. Conventional A/D converters consist of two steps: a <b>sampling</b> <b>operation</b> followed by a digital quantization. For uniform sampling, a common clock is operated in order to convert analog signals to digital values[2, 3]. In a sigma–delta modulator (SDM), the original signal is highly oversampled and the internal clock operates {{at a much higher}} rate than the bandwidth of the signal; however, the oversampled signal is downsampled at the last stage of the A/D conversion. The noise introduced by signal distortion due to quantization degrades the A/D performance[4 – 6].|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} objectives of fluid sampling using wireline formation testers (WFT) is to ensure that representative samples of the different fluids encountered in the formation are obtained. Usually the wireline or LWD petrophysical logs will guide the sample acquisition program. This typically means that resistivity and nuclear logs are used to infer basic fluid types, caliper log is used to verify that the borehole is suitable for sampling, and NMR logs are used to gauge if permeability is sufficient for a sample to be taken. However these logs are not able to capture variations in the hydrocarbon column to allow the operator to ensure that all representative fluids are sampled. The most important information, a continuous fluids type and property log, is still not widely used in the industry. Modern NMR logging tools can deliver – in addition to conventional porosity and permeability information – a continuous fluid log of oil, gas, water and OBM filtrate (OBMF) at multiple depths of investigation. The radial fluid profiling allows discrimination of OBMF versus native oil. Additionally, within the hydrocarbon column the NMR measurements can be used to provide continuous logs of oil viscosity and gas-oil ratio (GOR). With this information acquired before the <b>sampling</b> <b>operation,</b> it is easier to ensure that a full suite of representative samples are acquired and that we do not indulge in needless over sampling. When NMR data is acquired after the <b>sampling</b> <b>operation,</b> the continuous logs of viscosity and GOR can be calibrated with WFT data to provide fluid information in place...|$|E

If these problems happen frequently, the “sawing” type increment borer may be a better option.
