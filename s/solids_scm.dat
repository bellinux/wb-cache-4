40|$|Long term use of {{inorganic}} fertilisers {{and reduced}} organic matter inputs {{have contributed to}} acidification of agricultural soils. This strongly affects the soil dwelling fauna and nutrient mineralisation. Organic fertilisers such as <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> resurge as an option to overcome this acidification problem and to provide the required blend of essential macro- and micronutrients for plant growth. We assessed the effects of earthworm density (400 or 700 m- 2) at two levels of soil pH (ambient and increased), with or without application of <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM),</b> on herbage nitrogen (N) uptake, and CO 2 and N 2 O emissions {{over a period of}} 134 days using undisturbed soil cores from an acid peat grassland in a mesocosm experiment. Liming proved to be beneficial for earthworm performance and grassland productivity. A higher soil pH and earthworm density resulted in a higher soil biological activity measured as soil respiration. The combined application of lime and earthworms increased herbage apparent N recovery from SCM by 83 % compared to SCM only. In the manured treatments, herbage N uptake was positively correlated with earthworm density (R 2 = 0. 92). N 2 O emissions increased by 37 % when SCM was applied compared to the unfertilised control. Following SCM application, the cumulative increase in herbage N uptake was almost ten times greater than the measured total N 2 O losses. No relationship was observed between earthworm density and level of N 2 O emission. N mineralisation and herbage N uptake from SCM in acidic peat grasslands were greatly stimulated by the combined increase in soil pH and earthworm density. This stimulated the activity of soil biota, resulting in an increased herbage N recovery from the applied SCM...|$|R

Osmotic stress {{is one of the}} universal chemical stress factors in the application of microencapsulation technology. In order to understand the effect and mechanism of the encapsulated microenvironment on protecting cells from hyper-osmotic stress, yeast cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y 800 were encapsulated in calcium alginate micro-gel beads (MB), alginate-chitosan-algin ate (ACA) <b>solid</b> core microcapsules (<b>SCM),</b> and ACA liquid core microcapsules (LCM), respectively. The stress-induced intracellular components and enzyme activity including trehalose, glycerol and super oxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Free cell culture was used as control. The survival of encapsulated cells and the cells released from MB, SCM and LCM after osmotic shock induced by NaCl solution (1, 2 and 3 M) was evaluated. An analysis method was established to probe the effect of encapsulated microenvironment on the cell tolerance to osmotic stress. The results showed that LCM gave rise to the highest level of intracellular trehalose and glycerol, and SOD activity, as well as the highest survival rate of encapsulated cells or cells released from microcapsule. It was demonstrated that LCM was able to induce the highest stress response and stress tolerance of cells, which was adapted during culture, while SCM failed. The theoretical analysis revealed that it was the liquid alginate matrix in microcapsule that {{played a central role in}} domesticating the cells to adapt to hyper-osmotic stress. This finding provides a very useful guideline to cell encapsulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of Dutch farmers perceive that mouldboard ploughing prior to potato planting is necessary, despite its negative impacts on inherent soil fertility and soil structure. An innovative agronomic practice in Dutch organic agriculture {{is the use}} of cut-and-carry fertilizers with which above-ground biomass of crops with high nitrogen content (e. g. grass/clover) is harvested and transferred to other fields as plant-based fertilizers. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the interactive effects of two tillage systems (reduced tillage (RT), standard tillage (ST)) and three organic fertilizer amendments (<b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM),</b> lucerne pellets (LP), grass/clover silage (GCS)) on crop performance and nitrogen utilization of organic potato. Use of RT decreased tuber yield by 13. 4 % compared to ST due to lower average tuber size which was related to higher soil bulk density and increased vulnerability to drought stress during tuber bulking. On the other hand, use of RT positively affected nitrogen utilization and tuber quality in terms of specific gravity, dry matter and starch contents. However, the price premium associated with enhanced tuber quality may not offset the observed yield gap between RT and ST. Plant-based fertilizers enhanced nitrogen utilization in terms of apparent nitrogen recovery compared to animal-based. Although use of LP resulted in the highest yield for both tillage systems, its high price may be cost-inhibitive. An integrated approach taking into account N release patterns, environmental conditions, final yields, and production costs is needed in order to optimize resource use efficiency and overall profitability for farmers...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{evidence}} from forest ecosystems that litter decomposition is highest in its home habitat, the so-called home field advantage (HFA), we tested whether HFA also occurs in production grasslands, to which <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> was applied. Two dairy farms were selected which differed in type of home-produced SCM (stacked or composted) and soil type (sand or peat). Disappearance patterns of manure dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) were monitored from litterbags (4 mm mesh size) during the grass growing season. At the same time, apparent herbage N recovery (ANR) of SCM, applied at two rates (200 and 400 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1), was measured. On average, manure DM and N disappearances {{on the home}} farms were 20 and 14 % greater, respectively, than on away farms. Differences in ANR were also very pronounced (on average 14 and 53 % higher at home than away for the two respective application rates). The two SCM types were also studied on two neighbouring dairy farms (one on sand and one on peat soil) where no SCM had been applied for many years. Here, manure DM and N disappearances from the litterbags were much lower (P < 0. 01). This experiment provides strong evidence for a home field advantage in production grasslands differing in fertilization history, showing that site-specific manure management affects the soil–plant interactions regulating plant N-availability. These findings {{have to be taken}} into account when changing fertilization regimes in production grasslands. This is the first report to quantify a HFA from an agricultural ecosystem.

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the interactions between animal manure and soil types on N mineralization and total plant N recovery (shoots¿+¿roots) during one growing season. Methods - A pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during a growth period of 180 days. Experimental treatments included <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM),</b> cattle slurry (CS) and poultry manure (PM), all applied to sandy, clay and peat soils sown with perennial ryegrass. Total N application rate was 120 kg ha- 1. Results - There were clear interactions (P¿¿sandy¿>¿clay. In case of the peat soil, net mineralization of the applied organic N was on average 90 % from PM, 39 % from SCM and 26 % from CS. However, in the clay soil a positive net N mineralization occurred only from PM (42 %). Besides, significant proportions of the applied mineral N from SCM (17 %) and CS (35 %) were immobilized in this soil type. Consequently, apparent total plant N recovery was highest in the peat soil with values of 80, 57 and 50 % from PM, CS and SCM, respectively. In contrast, these values were only 57, 28 and 15 % for the clay soil. Conclusions - It is concluded that wide variations do exist in the extent of net N mineralization and plant N recovery from a given animal manure type when applied to diverging soil types.

40|$|We studied two {{different}} grassland fertiliser management regimes on sand and peat soils: above-ground {{application of a}} combination of organic N-rich slurry manure and <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> vs. slit-injected, mineral N-rich slurry manure, whether or not supplemented with chemical fertiliser (non-SCM). Measurements of field N mineralisation as estimated from herbage N uptake in unfertilised plots were compared with (i) potential N mineralisation as determined from a standard laboratory soil incubation, (ii) the contribution of groups of soil organisms to N mineralisation based on production-ecological model calculations, and (iii) N mineralisation calculated according to the Dutch fertilisation recommendation for grasslands. Density and biomass of soil biota (bacteria, fungi, enchytraeids, microarthropods and earthworms) as well as net plant N-uptake were higher in the SCM input grasslands compared to the non-SCM input grasslands. The currently used method in Dutch fertilisation recommendations underestimated actual soil N supply capacity by, on average, 102 kg N ha- 1 (202 vs. 304 kg ha- 1 = 34 %). The summed production-ecological model estimate for N mineralisation by bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and enchytraeids was 87 – 120 % of the measured potential soil N mineralisation. Adding the modelled N mineralisation by earthworms to potential soil N mineralisation explained 98 – 107 % of the measured herbage N uptake from soil. For all grasslands and soil biota groups together, the model estimated 105 % of the measured net herbage N uptake from soil. Soil biota production-ecological modelling is a powerful tool to understand and predict N uptake in grassland, reflecting the effects of previous manure management and soil type. The results show that combining production ecological modelling to predict N supply with existing soil N tests using aerobic incubation methods, can add to a scientifically based improvement of the N fertilisation recommendations for production grasslands...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} {{for the first time}} that home field advantage (HFA) of litter decomposition also exists in agricultural production systems, in addition to earlier reports from natural ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence that adaptation of the soil decomposer community to differences in the chemical composition of <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> explains the HFA. Two dairy farms were selected which differed in type of home-produced SCM (high-quality stacked or low-quality composted SCM) and soil type (sand or peat). Manure was exchanged between these two farms. Also, manure was incubated in fields of two neighbouring non-SCM farms. Using litterbags with three different mesh-sizes (125 μm, 1. 5 mm, and 4 mm), we investigated the contribution of microbiota, mesofauna and macrofauna, to SCM dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) disappearance after 60, 120 and 240 days of litterbag placement. Home field advantage was estimated after accounting for effects related to structural differences in manure quality (quality index) and grassland soil biota communities (ability index). We found HFA in meso- (14 – 34 %) and macro-mesh (19 – 31 %) size litterbags. In micro-mesh litterbags, the HFA for dry matter and nitrogen disappearance was significant only after 120 days (18 and 26 %, respectively). With time, trends of initial increase and then decrease in HFA of both aforementioned parameters were observed, but these were not significant. The quality index indicated that the composted manure had a lower dry matter and nitrogen disappearance rate compared to the stacked manure, irrespective of the location of incubation. The difference between the two manure types for N disappearance had vanished at day 240. Also, the chemical composition of the manure that remained in the litterbags changed over time. After 120 days, the C:N ratio of SCM at home was significantly higher compared to the translocated SCM (...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the effects of contrasting composted methods of <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> ondry matter (DM) yield and crop apparent N recovery (ANR) following manure application to maize land. Fresh SCM was stored as stockpiled, roofed, covered and composted heaps. After storage, the manures were incorporated in a sandy soil, and maize ANR both {{as a proportion of}} field applied N (ANRF) and collected N from the barn (ANRB),and DM yield was established at three successive growth stages: end of juvenile phase, start of grain filling, and physiological maturity. During the storage period, on average 6 % of the initial Ntotal was lost from covered, whereas this fraction was 12, 21 and 33 % from roofed, stockpiled, and composted heaps, respectively. DM yield of maize increased with the application of all the manure types as compared to the unfertilized control, at the end of Juvenile (2. 2 vs. 3. 1 - 3. 4 Mg ha- 1), grain filling (11. 2 vs. 13. 6 - 16. 4 Mg ha- 1) and physiological maturity stages (13. 9 vs. 15. 3 - 15. 9 Mg ha- 1). At a given growth stage, the greatest value was obtained from covered than roofed, stockpiled and composted manures. Maize ANRF was the highest at start of grain filling (20, 29, 31, and 39 % of the applied N for composted, stockpiled, roofed and covered treatments, respectively) but lower values were obtained at physiological maturity (12 - 21 %). The respective values in case of maize ANRB were 13, 23, 27 and 37 % of total N taken from barn at the start of grain filling while it was also lower (8 - 20 %) at physiological maturity. It is concluded thatstorage of SCM under an impermeable plastic cover reduce N losses, increased DM yield and ANR thereby improves on-farm N cycling as compared to traditional stockpiling or composting. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{application}} methods in which manure is simply broadcast {{on the soil}} surface are being replaced by innovative methods that place the manure in the soil in bands, potentially increasing efficiency of manure nutrient utilization by crops and reducing losses to the environment. Limited information exists on the pools and mobility of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in soils receiving repeated applications of animal manure using different {{application methods}}. The overall objective of the thesis research {{is to determine the}} fate of manure nutrients applied using new subsurface banding technology, as it affects crop response and uptake, residual nutrients in the soil, and transport (lateral and vertical) by water off-site. Specific objectives were: 1) to determine yield response to <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> and the recovery of SCM and liquid hog manure (LHM) P and N using broadcast manure placement and new subsurface banding technology, 2) to determine the amount of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and N that is transported in snowmelt water moving across soils receiving different rates and methods of application of manure, and 3) to determine the amount and proportion of SRP and N that are transported downward in a SCM amended soil profile with leaching water as influenced by manure rate and placement. In-soil placement of SCM in bands had a small impact on improving crop yield and nutrient uptake in a 3 year crop rotation in east-central Saskatchewan compared to broadcast, and broadcast and incorporate application strategies. In-soil placement of manure was also not effective in reducing P and N export in snowmelt water. Export of P and N downward in leachate water in intact cores was increased by in-soil manure placement, especially when placed in bands. This is attributed to reduced fixation of manure N and P and enhanced solubilization when manure is placed in soil in bands versus a broadcast application. Overall, nutrient export was significantly lower in frozen versus thawing soils, and export of P in soils receiving liquid hog manure was much less than in soils receiving solid cattle manure which is attributed to the higher P content in cattle manure...|$|R
40|$|Concern over excess {{phosphorus}} (P) {{input and}} loading in some soils of the Canadian prairie region {{has led to}} a need for {{a better understanding of the}} fate of added manure and fertilizer P. Information on the effects of manure application over long term (i. e., years) and short term (i. e., weeks, months) as related to management practices and manure form is still lacking. Knowledge of the P forms and species present in soil following application of manure and inorganic P fertilizers, and linking this to potential P availability and mobility is needed to make sound P management recommendations. The objective of this thesis project was to assess the speciation of soil P in different manures and inorganic fertilizer-amended Saskatchewan soils as affected by time, presence and absence of plants, landscape position, soil type, and management practices including rate and placement. Three studies were conducted (growth chamber and field-based experiments) to study P behavior in soils. These studies closely followed a time scale, beginning with speciation and fate followed over the very short-term (i. e., days to weeks) to a short-term period (i. e., months to a year) following amendment application, and finally the effects of repeated annual manure additions made over the long term (i. e., 11 years). Soils used in this study were loamy textured Brown and Black Chernozems. <b>Solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> and liquid hog manure (LHM) were applied at low and high rates in the very short-term and long-term studies. The low rate of SCM and LHM application was 7. 6 T ha- 1 yr- 1 (dry weight) and 37, 000 L ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively which was equivalent to approximately 100 kg total N ha- 1 yr- 1 application (agronomic N rate). The high rate was four times this amount. Inorganic fertilizer (mono-ammonium phosphate blended with urea) at rate of 54 kg N ha- 1 and 12 kg P ha- 1 and SCM at rate of 60 T ha- 1 were applied in the short-term study. A sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to fractionate P in very short-term and short-term studies and different soil test phosphorus (STP) methods were used to determine effects on the labile P in the long-term study. Changes in P speciation with time and their relative proportions in fertilizered soils were also assessed using the synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy in all studies. This study has revealed that manure, especially SCM elevates labile P over all time frames examined. Over the very short-term (i. e., weeks to a month), P was added as manure tends to remain in labile forms like brushite and adsorbed P that is accessible to plants for uptake. In the manure band (months to a year), manure P was relatively unchanged over a period of months while in the mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer band, adsorbed and Ca-P was readily formed from fertilizer P. Aging over several years (one to eleven years), along with high soil pH and high Ca:P ratio enhanced formation of more stable Ca-P minerals like apatite, especially in SCM amended soil. Overall, the unique combined use of wet chemical analysis and synchrotron-based techniques in this thesis research has improved our understanding of fate and transformation of P added to prairie soils. It is suggested that future studies of fate of applied P in soil also utilize a combination of wet chemical and spectroscopic techniques, as this was shown to be a rewarding approach...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} The number of domesticated cattle {{in the world}} has steadily increased during the last decades, and thereby also the amount of manure produced annually. The excrements of grazing cattle are dropped in pastures and left unmanaged, but that of confined and housed cattle are collected and managed. The collected manure is often a variable mixture of urine, faeces, bedding material and spoiled feed and (drinking) water. On most modern farms, excrements are usually collected in leak-tight storages and handled as slurry: a mixture of urine, faeces and spoiled water. However, on a significant fraction of farms, cattle excrements are ‘source-separated’ in a liquid fraction and a solid fraction. The <b>solid</b> cattle manure (<b>SCM)</b> is usually a mixture of faeces and bedding material with some absorbed urine. The production of SCM is increasing due to the renewed interest in straw-based housing systems for better animal health and welfare. It has been observed that a significant loss of N can occur, especially from the storage and application phases of the SCM management chain. This N loss pollutes the air, groundwater and surface waters, and also reduces its N fertiliser value. Thus the challenge is to develop an effective SCM management system that retains as much of the excreted N in the system as possible, and thereby improving on-farm N cycling through the cattle-manure-soil-crop continuum (Chapter 1). Themain objective of this PhD thesis research was to increase the understanding of the factors controlling N losses during storage and after field application, and to develop and test strategies to decrease N losses and improve crop utilisation of N from SCM. The specific objectives were: To study the interactions between a number of animal manures and soil types on N mineralisation and plant N recovery (Chapter 2) To investigate the effects of storage conditions on (i) magnitude and pathways of C and N losses during storage of SCM, and (ii) crop apparent N recovery (ANR) and DM yield (Chapter 3) To examine manure disappearance rates, N release pattern and herbage ANR during the year of application and the year thereafter from surface applied SCM subjected to different storage conditions (Chapter 4), and To analyse the effect of various application strategies on NH 3 emission and/or crop ANR from applied SCM to grassland and arable (maize) land (Chapters 3 and 5) To pursue these objectives a pot experiment in a glasshouse (Chapter 2) and a number of field experiments (Chapters 3 to 5) were conducted on experimental facilities of Wageningen University, the Netherlands. The pot experiment dealt with net N mineralisation and herbage ANR from SCM, cattle slurry and poultry manure, all applied to peat, sandy and clay soils. The field experiments examined (i) total C and N losses from stockpiled, composted, covered and roofed SCM heaps, (ii) manure decomposition, N release and herbage ANR after surface application of fresh and stored SCM on grassland, and (iii) the effects of irrigation and soil incorporation after SCM application, and lava meal as an additive on NH 3 emission and/or crop ANR by grassland herbage or arable maize.   Major findings of the thesis Results of the pot experiment showed that net N mineralisation and herbage ANR varied as function of manure storage method and soil type. Irrespective of the manure types, net N mineralisation and herbage ANR were highest in peat soil, which was characterised by the greatest N delivering capacity. Between the clay and sandy soils, both having similar N delivering capacity, net N mineralisation and herbage ANR were lower in the clay soil than in the sandy soil, likely because of immobilisation and fixation of ammonium-N by its inherited higher clay content. On each soil type,ANR was lower from SCM than cattle slurry and poultry manure (Chapter 2). The N recovery fraction was low when SCM was stored traditionally (i. e. stockpiling or composting) due to (i) loss of the initial mineral N content and readily degradable organic N compounds, and (ii) conversion of part of the remaining N into more stable forms as compared to that originally present before storage. Up to 31 % of the initial total N from the stockpiled and 46 % from the composted SCM heaps were lost during a period of about four months. Covering and roofing of SCM heaps reduced the losses down to 6 and 12 %, respectively. Of the total N losses from each storage method, only about one fourth could be traced back as NH 3 -N and N 2 O-N emissions, and/or N leaching. The remainder could not be accounted for and constituted, in all probability, of harmless N 2 gas. Of the total measured gaseous and liquid N losses together, N leaching contributed the most. The leaching N losses were reduced by almost three times through protection of SCM heap against precipitation either by its covering or roofing when compared to its stockpiling or composting in the open air. Although stockpiling of SCM under a roof significantly reduced overall total N losses, NH 3 and N 2 O emissions were much higher as compared to stockpiling of SCM in the open air. Composting of SCM resulted in higher gaseous N emissions as well as N leaching with respect to the other storage methods. In view of these finding I conclude that covering of SCM heaps with an impermeable sheet is the best option to reduce storage N losses (Chapters 3 and 4).                      In addition, because of N conservation and slow mineralisation of the organically bound N during the covered storage, mineral N content of SCM increased {{at the end of the}} storage phase. This, together with high mineralisation activities after field application of covered SCM, led to greater crop ANR and DM yield especially when compared to composted SCM, both in the year of application and in the subsequent year. When N losses during storage was taken into account to arrive at the crop ANR of the collected manure from the barn, it turned out that the ANR value was about three times larger in case of covered storage compared to composting of SCM, both for grassland (21 vs. 7 %; Chapter 4) and arable land (37 vs. 13 %, Chapter 3). Interestingly, despite of some N losses during covered storage (~ 10 % of the initial N), crop ANR and DM yield were significantly larger from covered than fresh SCM taken directly from the barn, again in both situations.             Irrigation immediately after SCM spreading and use of lava meal as an additive significantly (i) reduced NH 3 emission and (ii) improved crop ANR as well as DM yield (Chapters 3 and 5). Irrigation at a level of 5 mm immediately after surface application of fresh and covered SCM to grassland reduced NH 3 emission by 30 and 65 %, respectively, whereas it was not effective in case of composted SCM, likely because of its greater DM content. Addition of lava meal before application at a rate of 80 g per kg of covered SCM resulted in an emission reduction of 46 %. By combining it with 10 mm irrigation, an almost 100 % reduction in NH 3 emissions from covered SCM was realised, whereas herbage ANR increased from 18 to 26 % of the applied N over a growing period of five months (Chapter 5). Incorporation of SCM just before sowing of maize resulted in an ANR value of 39 % from covered SCM, whereas this fraction was 20, 29 and 31 % in case of composted, stockpiled and roofed manure, respectively (Chapter 3).                                                                                                            Overall conclusions The ANR from applied manure in harvested herbage depends on manure type and soil type, and varies widely. It is lower from SCM than from cattle slurry Total N losses during storage of SCM can be reduced remarkably by covering the heap with an impermeable sheet. Covering reduced two N loss pathways: (i) gaseous N emissions to air, and (ii) N leaching to surface waters and groundwater. Field application of SCM that was covered by a sheet during storage, decomposed faster and more N was available for plant uptake, both in the year of application and the subsequent year, when compared to SCM that was stored in traditional ways Emission of NH 3 following land application of SCM can be reduced greatly by irrigation or incorporation immediately after SCM spreading, and using lava meal as an additive. Irrigation appeared to be more effective in reducing NH 3 emission than the addition of lava meal. All these NH 3 emission abatement measures substantially increased crop ANR and DM yield Overall, combining covered storage with either direct irrigation following application of SCM to vegetated soil or direct incorporation in the soil following application of SCM to arable land is the best practical option to reduce losses and improve utilisation of N from SCM management systems. Depending on the farm infrastructure, losses may be further reduced by the use of lava meal, preferably as a bedding additive in the barn   Implication for efficient manure management In many industrialised countries, animal manure is a major source of environmental pollution. In contrast, in most of the developing countries animal manure is considered as a key nutrient source to maintain or improve crop productivity and therefore N losses from manure management are more seen as ‘loss of plant nutrient’ rather than ‘pollution problems’. In either case development of efficient SCM management systems is highly important. Based on the results of this thesis, I propose some key management actions to improve the agro-environmental value of SCM. If economically attractive, apply lava meal to straw bedding in the barn (Chapter 5) Store the barn-produced SCM under impermeable sheet (Chapters 3 and 4) Crop and soil-specific SCM application rates must take into account the potential available N (Chapter 2) and degradability of organic N compounds (Chapter 4) Incorporate the SCM from covered storages directly into the soil when applied to arable land (Chapter 3) In situations where incorporation is not feasible, like on grassland, spread SCM just before a predicted rainfall event or apply irrigation otherwise (Chapter 5) Take into account the expected residual N contribution from earlier manure input when determining the manure application rate(Chapter 4) </ul...|$|R
