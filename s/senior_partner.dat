5|$|<b>Senior</b> <b>partner</b> Anil Kumar, {{described}} as Gupta's protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and {{pleaded guilty in}} January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's consulting services to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks — an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year — as a <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the <b>senior</b> <b>partner.</b> He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E
5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either <b>senior</b> <b>partner,</b> though {{the manner in which}} it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E

5|$|In 293, emperor Diocletian {{created a}} new {{administrative}} system (the tetrarchy), to guarantee security in all endangered regions of his Empire. He associated himself with a co-emperor (Augustus), and each co-emperor then adopted a young colleague given the title of Caesar, to share in their rule and eventually to succeed the <b>senior</b> <b>partner.</b> The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 {{and a few years}} later Constantine I reunited the two administrative divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In July 1954, Allen was {{involved}} in the selection of the MCC team to tour Australia in 1954–55, as the MCC's representative. That winter, he travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts and was present when England won three Test matches, which ensured victory in the series.

5|$|Meanwhile, back in England, Brock's brother William faced {{financial}} difficulties, as {{the bank}} {{in which he was}} a <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> failed.

Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of his salary to his brother Irving, to be used for whatever was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E

[...] "What if it means that…I’m not the one?" [...] Angel wonders. Elsewhere in L.A., Eve enters an apartment and undresses while gloating to someone off-camera that Angel and Spike fell for the cup story and Sirk disappeared without the <b>Senior</b> <b>Partners</b> knowing anything. In addition, the gang is wondering if they can trust the <b>Senior</b> <b>Partners.</b> She crawls into bed and it is revealed that she is with a tattooed Lindsey McDonald.

From 1960 until 1977, when he retired, Paton was the responsible partner for the firm's involvement in the supervision of the $1.2 billion World Bank Indus Basin Project. This included the construction of the Mangla Dam between 1962 and 1968.|$|E
5|$|After the 1987 {{resignation}} of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded {{his own private}} equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as <b>senior</b> <b>partner.</b> Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm {{was responsible for the}} 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign {{of the end of the}} 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in , and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.|$|E
5|$|Corzine also chaired {{a presidential}} {{commission}} on capital budgeting for Bill Clinton {{and served as}} Chairman of the U.S. Treasury Department's borrowing committee. As the Goldman Sachs <b>senior</b> <b>partner,</b> he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund's collapse {{in the fall of}} 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine did not get along with co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring the bailout, Paulson seized control of the firm. As co-chairman of the firm, he oversaw its expansion into Asia. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine's departure, Corzine made $400million.|$|E

50|$|Angel and Spike {{attempt to}} have a board meeting, {{but they are the}} only ones who show up, as the entire office is grief-stricken over Fred's death.

He does not want to wait for them to do something, so Spike suggests finding a link to them. The two head to Eve’s apartment, but she will not help them. Eve berates Angel for letting the <b>Senior</b> <b>Partners</b> take Lindsey. Angel notes that Eve is hiding from the <b>Senior</b> <b>Partners</b> because they will take her if they find out where she is. As the building starts shaking, Eve blames Angel, thinking he told the <b>Senior</b> <b>Partners</b> where she is. The protective symbols in the apartment dissolve, and Eve says that she will tell him anything he wants to know if he takes her with him. As a man in a suit (Adam Baldwin) arrives, Angel, Spike and Eve flee to Wolfram and Hart. They ask Gunn if he has jurisdiction to protect Eve.

5|$|Gruffydd {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Gwynedd, and later in 1136 the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan, Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, led an army to Ceredigion. Their combined forces won a decisive victory over the Normans at the Battle of Crug Mawr. Ceredigion was reclaimed from the Normans, but was annexed by Gwynedd as the <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> in the alliance. Gruffydd ap Rhys continued his campaign against the Normans in 1137, but died later that year. The leadership of the family now passed to Rhys's half-brother Anarawd ap Gruffydd. In 1143, when Rhys was eleven, Anarawd was murdered by the bodyguard of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, brother of Owain Gwynedd, king of Gwynedd. Owain punished Cadwaladr by depriving him of his lands in Ceredigion.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Chico left Sidley & Austin {{to become}} a <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> of Altheimer & Gray. Oscar D’Angelo, a friend of Richard M.

In 2003, while Chico was chairman and simultaneously running for the US Senate, Altheimer became insolvent and dissolved. Some partners blamed the bankruptcy on poor management by Chico, while an attorney who sat on two financial committees blamed an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1922, Howard Roark is {{expelled}} from the architecture department of the Stanton Institute of Technology because he will not adhere to the school's preference for historical convention in building design. Roark goes to New York City and gets a job with Henry Cameron. Cameron was once a renowned architect, but now gets few commissions. In the meantime, Roark's popular, but vacuous, school roommate Peter Keating (whom Roark sometimes helped with projects) graduates with high honors. He too moves to New York, {{where he has been}} offered a position with the prestigious architecture firm, Francon & Heyer. Keating ingratiates himself with <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> Guy Francon and works to remove rivals within his firm. Eventually, he is made a partner.

5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured {{a job as a}} law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been to the Democratic Party, following his father's beliefs. The firm's <b>senior</b> <b>partner,</b> Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} partnered {{through a}} sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior {{partner in the}} LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated {{with one of the}} three largest broadcast television networks). The stations may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station. Alternatively, the stations may consolidate their news programming under a single joint brand.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{eventually}} {{concentrated on}} the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking cigars and of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O'Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while building his thriving law practice. He invested wisely in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough Gas Company, the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley.|$|E

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.|$|E
5|$|After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pflueger {{continued}} his grade-school education, graduating at age 13 {{in a mass}} ceremony held in Golden Gate Park for all the city's devastated public schools.

In 1911, Pflueger joined the San Francisco Architectural Club (SFAC), an organization that helped budding architects receive training in the informal Atelier Method where older experts taught the practical side of architecture including waterproofing, lighting and structural concerns to students who had no hope or wish to study Beaux-Arts in an established school abroad. Pflueger became thoroughly involved with SFAC's collegial activities and was chosen director in 1914.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the <b>senior</b> <b>partner</b> in their relationship.|$|E
