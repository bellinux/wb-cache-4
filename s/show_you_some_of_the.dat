Accordingly, we walked back towards the place where we had left our mules and servants, and, when we came thither, there was a complete camp fixed, three very handsome tents raised, and a bar set up at a distance, where the mules were tied one to another to graze, and the servants and the baggage lay together, with an open tent over them.|$|E

I have a friend, Thomas Neat, 2d N.Y. Cavalry, wounded in leg, now home in Jamaica, on furlough; he will probably call. Then possibly a Mr. Haskell, or some of his folks, from western New York: he had a son died here, and I was with the boy a good deal. The old man and his wife have written me and ask'd me my Brooklyn address; he said he had children in New York, and was occasionally down there.

Perhaps you don't know, or don't want to know, that it was I who got up this 'Library and Home Circle of the Sisters of Tasajara' which we are to open to-day. And can you imagine why? You remember--or have you forgotten--that you once affected to be concerned at the social condition of the young ladies on the plains of Sidon? Well, Mr. Grant, this is gotten up in order that the future Mr. Grants who wander may find future Miss Billingses who are worthy to converse with them and entertain them, and who no longer wear men's hats and live on the public road." ...|$|E

Now take the rest of these people here at the farm--nice folks, you understand, mighty well-traveled, broad-gauged, intelligent folks, and all that. There's a Mr. and Mrs. Cannon; he's some kind of an executive in the Chicago stock-yards--nice, fat, responsible job. And he was saying to me, 'Mr. Schwirtz,' he says, 'Mrs. C. and I had never been to New England till this summer, but we'd toured every other part of the country, and we've done Europe thoroughly and put in a month doing Florida, and now,' he says, 'I think we can say we've seen every point of interest that's worth an American's time.' They're good American people like that, well-traveled and nice folks. But books--Lord! they can't talk about books no more than a Jersey City bartender. So you can imagine how pleased I was to find you here.... World's pretty small, all right. Say, I just got here yesterday, so I suppose we'll be here about the same length o' time. If you wouldn't think I was presumptuous, I'd like mighty well to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country around here. We could get up a picnic party, ten or a dozen of us, and go up on Bald Knob and see the scenery and have a real jolly time. And I'd be glad to take you down to Lesterhampton--there's a real old-fashioned inn down there, they say, where Paul Revere stayed one time; they say you can get the best kind of fried chicken and corn on cob and real old-fashioned New England blueberry pie.

6000|$|Washington, Oct. 27, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER,--Yours and George's letter came, and {{a letter}} from Jeff too--all good. I had {{received}} a letter {{a day or so}} before from George too. I am very glad he is at Camp Nelson, Kentucky, and I hope and pray the reg't will be kept there--for God knows they have tramped enough for the last two years, and fought battles and been through enough. I have sent George papers to Camp Nelson, and will write to-morrow. I send him the Unions and the late New York papers. Mother, you or Jeff write and tell me how Andrew is; I hope he will prove to be better. Such complaints are sometimes very alarming for awhile, and then take such a turn for the better. Common means and steadily pursuing them, about diet especially, are so much more reliable than any course of medicine whatever. Mother, I have written to Han; I sent her George's letter to me, and wrote her a short letter myself. I sent it four or five days ago. Mother, I am real pleased to hear Jeff's explanation how it is that his wages is cut down, and that it was not as I fancied from the meanness of the old coons in the board. I felt so indignant about it, as I took it into my head, (though I don't know why) that it was done out of meanness, and was a sort of insult. I was quite glad Jeff wrote a few lines about it--and glad they appreciate Jeff, too. Mother, if any of my soldier boys should ever call upon you (as they are often anxious to have my address in Brooklyn) you just use them as you know how to without ceremony, and if you happen to have pot luck and feel to ask them to take a bite, don't be afraid to do so. There is one very good boy, Thos. Neat, 2nd N. Y. Cavalry, wounded in leg. He is now home on furlough--his folks live, I think, in Jamaica. He is a noble boy. He may call upon you. (I gave him here $1 toward buying his crutches, etc.) I like him very much. Then possibly a Mr. Haskell, or some of his folks from Western New York, may call--he had a son died here, a very fine boy. I was with him a good deal, and the old man and his wife have written me, and asked me my address in Brooklyn. He said he had children in N. Y. city and was occasionally down there. Mother, when I come home I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters I get from mothers, sisters, fathers, etc.--they will make you cry. There is nothing new with my hospital doings--I was there yesterday afternoon and evening, and shall be there again to-day. Mother, I should like to hear how you are yourself--has your cold left you, and do you feel better? Do you feel quite well again? I suppose you have your good stove all fired up these days--we have had some real cool weather here. I must rake up a little cheap second-hand stove for my room, for it was in the bargain that I should get that myself. Mother, I like my place quite well, better on nearly every account than my old room, but I see it will only do for a winter room. They keep it clean, and the house smells clean, and the room too. My old room, they just let everything lay where it was, and you can fancy what a litter of dirt there was--still it was a splendid room for air, for summer, as good as there is in Washington. I got a letter from Mrs. Price this morning--does Emmy ever come to see you? ...|$|E

You will be hearing everything from traditional ballads to Irish fiddling, from bagpipes to bluegrass, from Nashville country music to blues and gospel, and European lute to Indian sitar. During the afternoon you will have the opportunity of examining crafts as exhibited by local craftsmen. Among the displays will be one on dulcimer making, one on the construction of the “clogging man”, as well as marionette making, quilting, rug braiding and special children’s crafts. In short, our emphasis is on people doing things themselves, providing their own entertainment rather than sitting back and having someone else provide it for them. We hope more and more of you will realize that what we do ourselves is the most fun of all, and surely the most fulfilling.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{first thing}} {{that you need to}} know is that SAS ® {{software}} stores dates and times as numbers. However, this is not the only thing that you need to know, and this presentation will give you a solid base for working with dates and times in SAS. It will also introduce you to functions and features that will enable you to manipulate your dates and times with surprising flexibility. This paper will also <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible pitfalls with dates (and times and datetimes) in your SAS code, and how to avoid them. We’ll show how the SAS System handles dates and times through examples, and close with a discussion of Excel conversions. WHAT’S THE FIRST THING I NEED TO KNOW? The first thing is of course that the SAS System stores dates, times and datetimes as numbers. Dates are counted in days from a zero point of January 1, 1960. Times are counted in seconds from a zero point of midnight of the current day, and datetimes are counted in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1960. Each day that passes increments the day counter by 1, and each second that passes increments the time and datetime counters by 1. This makes it easy to calculate durations in days and seconds. Unfortunately, most references to dates and times do not use the lowest common denominator of days and seconds, respectively, and they certainly don’t use January 1, 1960 and midnight as their central references. That’s where the first problem comes up: how to get SAS to speak about dates and times the way we do. How do you tell SAS that the date is January 14, 1967...|$|E
