40|$|Many {{problems}} arising {{in traffic}} planning can be modelled and solved using discrete optimization. We {{will focus on}} recent developments which were applied to large scale real world instances. Most railroad companies apply a hierarchically structured planning process. Starting with {{the definition of the}} underlying network used for transport one has to decide which infrastructural improvements are necessary. Usually, the rail system is periodically scheduled. A fundamental base of the schedule are the lines connecting several stations with a fixed frequency. Possible objectives for the construction of the line plan may be the minimization of the total cost or the maximization of the passenger's comfort satisfying certain regulations. After the lines of the system are fixed, the train schedule can be determined. A criterion for the quality of a schedule is the total transit time of the passengers including the waiting time which should be minimized satisfying some operational constraints. For each trip of the <b>schedule</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> consisting of a locomotive and some carriages is needed for service. The assignment of rolling stock to schedule trips has to satisfy operational requirements. A comprehensible objective is to minimize the total cost. After all strategic and tactical planning the schedule has to be realized. Several external influences, for example delayed trains, force the dispatcher to recompute parts of the schedule on-line. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the novel}} The Taking of Pelham One Two Three by Morton Freedgood and its film adaptations (the 1974 {{original}} and the 1998 and 2009 remakes), the train that gets hijacked leaves the Pelham Bay Park station at 1:23 p.m. (hence the title). Realizing {{that it would}} become {{too much of a}} reminder to the public, after the 1974 film's release, the New York City Transit Authority, for many years, banned any <b>schedule</b> of <b>a</b> <b>train</b> leaving this station either at 1:23 in the afternoon or in the morning. Eventually this policy was rescinded, but due to the superstitions involved, dispatchers have continued to avoid <b>scheduling</b> <b>a</b> Manhattan-bound <b>train</b> to leave at 1:23.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a greedy {{algorithm}} to detect conflict cliques in interval graphs and circular-arc graphs is analysed. In a graph, a stable set requires that at most one vertex is chosen for each edge. It {{is equivalent to}} requiring that at most one vertex for each maximal clique is chosen. We show that this algorithm finds all maximal cliques for interval graphs, i. e. it can compute the convex hull of the stable set polytope. In case of circular-arc graphs, the algorithm {{is not able to}} detect all maximal cliques, yet remaining correct. This problem occurs in the context of railway <b>scheduling.</b> <b>A</b> <b>train</b> requests the allocation of a railway infrastructure resource for a specific time interval. As one is looking for conflict-free train schedules, the used resource allocation intervals in <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> must not overlap. The conflict-free choices of used intervals for each resource correspond to stable sets in the interval graph associated to the allocation time intervals...|$|R

40|$|An {{operation}} control {{approach for}} heavy haul trains to optimize their performance, including operation safety, service quality and energy consumption, is proposed. Following a model predictive control method, the controller {{is capable of}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> to operate optimally during a long section of the rail track. In the cost function, two penalty factors are presented, one for the braking forces and one for coupler damping effects. The penalty for braking forces is employed to reduce energy waste incurred by braking. The penalty for coupler damping is introduced to alleviate the cyclic vibration of couplers, which link adjacent cars in the train. The damping penalty {{is also expected to}} reduce energy wasted by coupler damping and corresponding maintenance/replacement cost of the dampers. In addition, the weight of the velocity tracking term in the objective function is modified to vary dynamically according to the train’s velocity to improve the train’s overall performance. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. Discussions over the impacts of the two penalty factors and dynamic weight method are provided together with some suggestions on their applications. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>train</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{problem in}} <b>a</b> {{single-track}} railway can be modeled as <b>a</b> job-shop <b>scheduling</b> problem. We use a mixed graph model {{for such a}} job-shop problem with appropriate criteria. There are several performance evaluations for <b>a</b> <b>train</b> <b>schedule.</b> Optimizing <b>a</b> <b>train</b> <b>schedule</b> subtends minimizing total tardiness of the trains, minimizing the sum of train transit times, minimizing the makespan for <b>a</b> <b>train</b> <b>schedule,</b> etc. Since the corresponding job-shop problems with the above three criteria are NP-hard, several constructive heuristics have been developed using different priorities based on the release times of the jobs, the job due-dates and the job completion times. Experiments on a computer were used for evaluating the quality and efficiency of the heuristic algorithms developed for appropriate job-shop problems. The release times, due-dates and completion times of the jobs {{have been used as}} input parameters (priorities) to see the effect of them {{on the quality of the}} schedules with different objective functions. The efficiency of the developed heuristics was tested on a set of 118 randomly generated instances of small and large sizes with up to 2000 operations...|$|R
