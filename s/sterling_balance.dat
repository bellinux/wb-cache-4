25|$|The loan {{was made}} subject to conditions, the most {{damaging}} {{of which was the}} convertibility of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of convertibility was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International <b>sterling</b> <b>balances</b> became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with <b>sterling</b> <b>balances</b> (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange for dollars) had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend convertibility and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure. The rapid loss of dollar reserves also highlighted the weakness of sterling, which was duly devalued in 1949 from $4.02 to $2.80.|$|R

This arguably marked the end of the Sterling Area. During the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s the remaining <b>sterling</b> <b>balances</b> were wound down to a level that represented the significance of Britain in contemporary world trade.|$|R

With the help of favourable boundary changes he won by 1,814 votes.

40|$|This {{article will}} restate {{what might be}} {{labelled}} the ‘traditional view’. It will do so first by examining the position on devaluation among the core executive {{at the time the}} Labour Government took office. It will then turn to look at the problems the government faced with sterling in 1965 before considering the wider context to the management of sterling, including the National Plan, the <b>sterling</b> <b>balances,</b> the discussion on the EEC and international liquidity. After briefly revisiting the 1966 sterling crisis, the article will confront Newton’s challenge that ‘the question historians need to address is why the position in October to November [1967] should have led to a change in the rate’. Finally, the paper will draw larger conclusions on the management of sterling between 1964 and 1967...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{topic of}} the conference was the convertibility and liquidity of Pound sterling into American dollars and British concerns that non-sterling Commonwealth countries were building up <b>sterling</b> <b>balances</b> {{for the purpose of}} conversion into American dollars, the future of the Pound sterling area, and the alleviation of Commonwealth trade restrictions and imperial preference, particularly {{in the light of the}} surging American economy and the desire of Commonwealth countries such as Australia for American investment in order for economic development to occur against British concerns that American economic dominance threatened Britain's economic position. This discussion was necessary as the Commonwealth, with the exception of Canada, had a common pool of gold and dollar reserves. Little was accomplished in the economic discussion with the final communique being described as an [...] "agreement in platitudes".|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is to}} study in detail how British economic interests retreated from Uruguay after the Second World War. It also throws some light on how certain Latin American countries behaved as creditor nations: we know much about their behaviour as debtors but almost nothing about how they used their creditor status. In these negotiations, where financial and economic aspects were closely linked, Uruguay accepted most of Britain’s demands, including the use of its <b>sterling</b> <b>balances</b> for the nationalization of the British owned railways. By doing this, and not buying back its foreign debt, Uruguay was soon in need to ask for a credit to Britain and thus return to an old pattern of indebtedness...|$|R

2500|$|... 1967 was a {{bad year}} for the British travel industry.

50|$|Butler {{inherited}} {{a balance of}} payments crisis caused, in part, by Labour defence spending {{around the time of}} the Korean War. Butler correctly predicted a doubling of living standards by 1970. Butler initially planned to let the pound float (in practice, devalue) and become partially convertible ("Operation ROBOT"). ROBOT was struck down by Lord Cherwell and his adviser Donald MacDougall, who prepared a paper for Churchill. The counterargument was that the balance of payments would have worsened, as any reduction in demand for imports would have been swamped by the rise in prices of imported goods. Furthermore, 90% of other countries' <b>sterling</b> <b>balances,</b> kept in London, were to be frozen: they too would have been devalued, which would have angered Commonwealth countries and broken the rules for the International Monetary Fund and would not have been allowed under the new European Payments Union. Butler's junior minister, Arthur Salter was also opposed. Lord Woolton, insisted that Eden have a say on ROBOT, as it affected relations with other countries. Eden opposed it in a rare intervention in domestic politics. It was finally buried at two Cabinets, on 28 and 29 February 1952.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, the Hong Kong dollar slumped to {{the bottom}} of its band against the US dollar but Hong Kong did not have US dollar {{reserves}} to defend the rate. The government was forced to sell sterling for US dollars to then buy Hong Kong dollar to support the rate. In July 1973, the Hong Kong dollar was dragged down against sterling due to the continued devaluation of the US dollar {{as a result of the}} outflow of capital from Hong Kong. In August 1973, Governor Murray MacLehose and Haddon-Cave attempted to end the historic commitment to sterling reserves but the idea was rejected by London. The British government offered a unilateral agreement in return to guarantee <b>sterling</b> <b>balances</b> at a new slightly higher rate. In July 1974 the price of US$1 fell below HK$5.05 which force Haddon-Cave to announce the Hong Kong dollar to float free from its link to the US dollar on 27 November. However, the floating exchange caused the serious problem of inflation in the 1970s in an annual rate of 9.5%. He followed Cowperthwaite line to insist the colony did not need active monetary policies because of the economy's automatic adjustment mechanism although he later came close to admit that the era of automatic adjustment was over.|$|R

6000|$|If we {{give credit}} to him, it was not {{necessary}} to have recourse to any new impositions whatsoever, to put the receipts of France on a balance with its expenses. He stated the permanent charges of all descriptions, including the interest of a new loan of four hundred millions, at 531,444,000 livres; the fixed revenue at 475,294,000: making the deficiency 56,150,000, or short of 2,200,000 l. <b>sterling.</b> But to <b>balance</b> it, he brought forward savings and improvements of revenue (considered as entirely certain) to rather more than the amount of that deficiency; and he concludes with these emphatical words (p. 39):--"Quel pays, Messieurs, que celui, où, sans impôts et avec de simples objets inaperçus, on peut faire disparoître un déficit qui a fait tant de bruit en Europe!" [...] As to the reimbursement, the sinking of debt, and the other great objects of public credit and political arrangement indicated in Monsieur Necker's speech, no doubt could be entertained but that a very moderate and proportioned assessment on the citizens without distinction would have provided for all of them to the fullest extent of their demand.|$|R
