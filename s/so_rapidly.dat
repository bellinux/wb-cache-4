5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy {{in a small}} room in his house on Old Compton Street. His audience grew <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and {{advanced}} <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that their forces quickly threatened to outflank the New Zealand positions. On 9 April the 4th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn and began moving {{south to the}} Servia Pass. Here, the 18th Battalion was positioned in the hills above the town of Servia {{and to the right}} of 19th Battalion, which was defending the pass itself. From 11 April, Stukas mounted air raids on the New Zealand positions before the Germans brought artillery to bear two days later as their ground forces approached. It was during an artillery barrage on 15 April that the battalion suffered its first fatality of the war. The same day, the 18th Battalion fended off initial probing attacks by elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were unable to prevent the Germans from occupying Servia.|$|E

25|$|Potassium {{channels}} {{function to}} conduct potassium ions down their electrochemical gradient, doing <b>so</b> both <b>rapidly</b> (up to the diffusion rate of K+ ions in bulk water) and selectively (excluding, most notably, sodium despite the sub-angstrom difference in ionic radius).|$|R

5|$|South Africa {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the origins of Scouting. Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the movement, spent most of the years from 1884 to 1905 as a soldier in Southern Africa. South Africa's most prominent role in the origin of Scouting was the Siege of Mafeking in 1899–1900. Baden-Powell successfully lead the defense of the town for 217days. During the siege, he was inspired by the boys of the Mafeking Cadet Corps, and later used them as an example of bravery in the first chapter of his handbook Scouting for Boys. The Mafeking Cadets are not regarded as the first Boy Scouts, as Scouting was only born later, in 1907 at Brownsea Island in Britain. However, it was Mafeking that resulted in Baden-Powell becoming a national hero in Britain, and it was his fame that enabled his Scout movement to catch on <b>so</b> <b>rapidly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, {{where he}} is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume {{compared}} to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, Mr. Garrison announces the food drive is a failure because students have brought {{in only a few}} cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during show and tell, after which Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria tell the boys they will have to call Red Cross and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey DNA is growing <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
50|$|The build {{needs to}} {{complete}} <b>rapidly,</b> <b>so</b> {{that if there}} is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified.|$|R
50|$|Phosphorus-32 is a {{radioactive}} isotope of phosphorus. The nucleus of phosphorus-32 contains 15 protons and 17 neutrons, one more neutron {{than the most}} common isotope of phosphorus, phosphorus-31. Phosphorus-32 only exists in small quantities on Earth as it has a short half-life of 14.29 days and <b>so</b> decays <b>rapidly.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{both cases}} the blackouts were rolled fairly <b>rapidly,</b> <b>so</b> that no area had {{to spend more than}} one hour without power.|$|R
5|$|Matilda {{received}} Stephen {{in person}} at her court in Gloucester, before having him moved to Bristol Castle, traditionally used for holding high-status prisoners. Matilda now {{began to take}} the necessary steps to have herself crowned queen in his place, which would require the agreement of the Church and her coronation at Westminster. Stephen's brother Henry summoned a council at Winchester before Easter {{in his capacity as}} papal legate to consider the clergy's view. Matilda had made a private deal with Henry that he would deliver the support of the Church in exchange for being granted control over Church affairs. Henry handed over the royal treasury to her, which proved to be rather depleted except for Stephen's crown, and he excommunicated many of her enemies who refused to switch sides. Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was unwilling to declare Matilda queen <b>so</b> <b>rapidly,</b> however, and a delegation of clergy and nobles, headed by Theobald, travelled to Bristol to see Stephen, who agreed that, given the situation, he was prepared to release his subjects from their oath of fealty to him.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{suddenly}} appeared in Hamburg, spreading <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that, {{in a few}} weeks, {{more than a thousand}} people died. The sickness swept through eastern Europe as an epidemic causing high mortality rates. It arrived in Switzerland in December, then was carried northwards to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and eastwards to Lithuania, Poland and Russia.|$|E
25|$|Not all tornadoes {{are easily}} seen. A tornado funnel can be {{transparent}} until reaching {{an area with}} loose dirt and debris. Also, some tornadoes have been seen against sunlit areas, but rain or nearby low-hanging clouds has obscured other tornadoes. Occasionally, tornadoes have developed so suddenly, <b>so</b> <b>rapidly,</b> that little, if any, advance warning was possible.|$|E
40|$|Prevalence of new attacks or attack {{variants}} {{presents an}} interesting challenge for autonomic cyber-defense: {{how does the}} autonomic defense mechanism learn from previous failures, acquiring immunity with experience, and do <b>so</b> as <b>rapidly</b> as possible. In the limiting case, only a single a single observed failure may be available for learning...|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} cases {{show that}} by using LOLP and ENENS within the analysis, a system operator (<b>SO)</b> can <b>rapidly</b> identify the main hours of {{risk for the}} system. The use of ENENS decomposition also avoids reliability problems arising from network congestion at peak hours, and/or unexpected increases on the demand at any time.|$|R
50|$|Each {{stacking}} pattern {{will give}} different {{information on the}} behaviour of accommodation space, a major control of which is relative level. <b>So</b> a <b>rapidly</b> progradational pattern will be indicative of falling sea level, rapidly retrogradational is evidence for rapidly transgressing sea level and aggradational will be indicative of gently rising sea level.|$|R
25|$|The {{response}} of the Ollie K. Wilds, commercial towboats, and the local Coast Guard units was commendable. Had the ferry not overturned <b>so</b> <b>rapidly,</b> their immediate response would have been instrumental in saving a number of lives. Unfortunately, the first rescuers were only able to find and rescue two survivors from the river; other survivors made their way onto the overturned hull.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precautions}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines including oxazepam are lipophilic drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in floppy infant syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In July Glover and Stanning {{started to}} be coached by Robin Williams. They were ranked 16th and 17th in their event and were also {{regarded}} as reserves for the women's eight. They improved <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that at the 2010 World Rowing Championships at Lake Karapiro in New Zealand in November they won a silver medal behind Juliette Haigh and Rebecca Scown of New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of treatment}} {{is that many}} genotoxic drugs are effective on cancerous cells and normal cells alike. Selectivity of a particular drug's action {{is based on the}} sensitivity of the cells themselves. <b>So,</b> while <b>rapidly</b> dividing cancer cells are particularly sensitive to many drug treatments, often normal functioning cells are affected.|$|R
50|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was also}} difficult. Andover was also housing refugees from London <b>so</b> the town <b>rapidly</b> filled up. School staff had to undertake fire-watching duties.|$|R
50|$|Electrotonic {{potentials}} {{are conducted}} faster than action potentials, but attenuate <b>rapidly</b> <b>so</b> are unsuitable for long-distance signaling. The phenomenon was first {{discovered by the}} Eduard Pflüger.|$|R
25|$|After losing {{both his}} parents {{by the age}} of 10, Maugham was raised by a {{paternal}} uncle who was emotionally cold. Not wanting to become a lawyer like other men in his family, Maugham eventually trained and qualified as a physician. The initial run of his first novel, Liza of Lambeth (1897), sold out <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> that Maugham gave up medicine to write full-time.|$|E
25|$|There {{was not one}} innings {{that will}} be remembered in years to come; not even one that left behind {{pleasant}} memories after the day was over. This Test will be remembered - if, indeed, it is recalled at all in after years - because the fortunes changed <b>so</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{and because of the}} deed of individuals, chiefly the bowlers. Some, but only a few, came out with their reputations enhanced.|$|E
25|$|Cryofixation – {{freezing}} {{a specimen}} <b>so</b> <b>rapidly,</b> in liquid ethane, and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even liquid helium temperatures, {{so that the}} water forms vitreous (non-crystalline) ice. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called cryo-electron microscopy has branched from this technique. With the development of cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), {{it is now possible}} to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.|$|E
50|$|The {{living species}} are smooth-skinned and lack both sebaceous glands and sweat glands. The outer {{epidermis}} is relatively thin, <b>so</b> hippos dehydrate <b>rapidly</b> in dry environments.|$|R

50|$|These tool buckets {{are first}} kept near the mix table {{and then as}} the plaster starts to set are {{moved closer to the}} wall that is being worked on. Time becomes a big factor here as once the plaster starts to harden (set) it will do <b>so</b> fairly <b>rapidly</b> and the {{plasterer}} has a small margin of error to get the wallsmooth.|$|R
