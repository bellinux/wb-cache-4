Following ischaemia and reperfusion, CLP hearts showed more rapid recovery of functional measures, despite <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> baseline function, and infarct size was <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> in septic hearts (Figure  3). These results strongly support a preconditioning effect of polymicrobial sepsis.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E

CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures.

While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E

The airport would only operate direct flights to certain cities in Brazil. The plan also called for a study of the expansion of São Paulo's two current airports and the construction of a third airport in the metropolitan area.|$|E

Tatum was opposed to it, as it greatly increased the difficulty of scheduling and had caused the reduction in number of home games.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the risk to shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E

5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} epistaxis, other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and thalidomide or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with prescribing thalidomide to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms of nausea and the terrible birth defects that followed, thalidomide is a last resort therapy. Additionally, thalidomide can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by tinkering with dosages and prescribing its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the severity of epistaxis without side effects.|$|E
