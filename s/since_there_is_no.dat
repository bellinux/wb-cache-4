5|$|Malcolm II {{was born}} to Kenneth II of Scotland. He was {{grandson}} of Malcolm I of Scotland. In 997, the killer of Constantine is credited as being Kenneth, son of Malcolm. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> known and relevant Kenneth alive at that time (King Kenneth having died in 995), it is considered an error for either Kenneth III, who succeeded Constantine, or, possibly, Malcolm himself, the son of Kenneth II.

5|$|Huene {{felt the}} {{vertebrae}} of BMNH R3078 had proportions different enough from Cetiosaurus to warrant its own genus. Also, {{the fusion of}} centra with minimal osseous proliferation is manifest in the caudal vertebrae of Cetiosauriscus. The Cetiosaurus specimen OUMNH J13695 has a low horizontal ridge on each of its lateral surfaces, creating a slightly subhexagonal transverse cross-section, and is also seen on Cetiosauriscus, {{as well as the}} anterior caudals of Haplocanthosaurus, and caudals 15 to 30 of Omeisaurus. Also, the area around the periphery of each articular face is flattened, creating a 'bevelled' appearance, and also occurs in Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus. A whiplash tail was apparently found in the same deposits but it is not certain it belongs to the same individual. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> overlapping material, this assignment to Cetiosauriscus should be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E
5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.|$|E

The club responded by stating it will appeal the decision. However, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> appeal process with the FA and its Council, the decision is final. On 11 September 2014, Allam confirmed an appeal has been submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> real number x such that , {{the value of}} b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Scots and the Irish {{were mostly}} {{competing}} with Sri Lanka {{for the title}} as the best non-Test nation at the time– indeed, Ireland drew with Sri Lanka in a rain-hit first-class match in 1979, Ireland scoring a total of 341 for 7 in two innings, while Sri Lanka made 288 for 6 in one innings. Ireland, along with Scotland and the Netherlands, has at times played in competitions for English county cricket sides, including the Benson & Hedges Cup and the Friends Provident Trophy (previously the C Trophy). <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> nationality restriction in county cricket, non-Irish people were allowed to compete for Ireland in these matches. For example, Hansie Cronje of South Africa played for Ireland in 1997, as did New Zealander Jesse Ryder in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds {{should be subject to}} cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American wars of {{independence}} had repercussions in Puerto Rico; due to widespread privateering and other naval warfare, maritime commerce suffered heavily. Cabo Rojo {{was among the}} municipalities affected most, with its ports at a virtual standstill. African slaves took to the sea in an attempt at freedom; merchants were assessed higher taxes and harassed by foreigners. Under these conditions, Cofresí was born to Francisco and María Germana. The youngest of four children, he had one sister (Juana) and two brothers (Juan Francisco and Ignacio). Cofresí was baptized into the Catholic Church by José de Roxas, the first priest in Cabo Rojo, when he was fifteen days old. María died when Cofresí was four years old, and an aunt assumed his upbringing. Francisco then began a relationship with María Sanabria, {{the mother of his}} last child Julián. A don by birth, Cofresí's education was above average; <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence of a school in Cabo Rojo at that time, Francisco may have educated his children or hired a tutor. The Cofresís, raised in a multicultural environment, probably knew Dutch and Italian. In November 1814 Francisco died, leaving a modest estate; Roberto was probably homeless, with no income.|$|E
