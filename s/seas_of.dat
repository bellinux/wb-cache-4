5|$|More than 330 {{species of}} birds were {{recorded}} in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region {{in the winter and}} autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.|$|E
5|$|The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) {{is a large}} flippered {{marine mammal}} with a {{discontinuous}} distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the Northern Hemisphere. The walrus is the only living species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus. This species is subdivided into three subspecies: the Atlantic walrus (O. r. rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. r. laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the storm dropped {{moderately}} heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides {{on the west}} coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7million (1959USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> up to 49ft (15m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959CAD, $781,000 1959USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area {{includes}} nine known exposed formations, all {{visible in}} Zion National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation {{in that part}} of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large deserts of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} very stable, {{primarily}} because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps {{thrive in the}} clean <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{period the}} Reformation {{produced}} a gradual shift to Protestantism, {{and much of}} London passed from church to private ownership. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England {{were likely to be}} Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.|$|E

5000|$|From 2003 to 2008, Japan {{conducted}} {{a number of}} surveys of different collections. In 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) published their conclusions; they found that among 1,332 maps from the Berlin Library, 279 used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Korea, Oriental <b>Sea,</b> or East Sea (or some combination thereof), 579 used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan exclusively, 47 used China Sea (with or without other names), 33 used another term, and 384 used no term. MOFA said the Struck collection (a collection of antiquarian maps owned by a European map collector) showed that out of 79 maps, 35 used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan, 9 used the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Korea, 2 used Oriental Sea, and 33 were unmarked. MOFA reported that among four Russian libraries and document archives holding 51 maps, 29 used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan, 8 used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Korea, 1 used Korea Strait, 1 used East Sea, 1 used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> China, and 11 used no name. [...] MOFA said that 1,213 maps from the U.S. Library of Congress, ones that gave a name for this body of water, showed that 87 percent used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan, 8 percent used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Korea, 5 percent used other terms, and none used Oriental Sea or East Sea. Similarly, MOFA said that 58 maps from the British Library and the University of Cambridge showed 86 percent used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan, 14 percent used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Korea, and none used Oriental Sea, East Sea, or other terms. MOFA said that they looked at 1,485 maps in the French National Library. They reported that 95 percent of 215 French maps used <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan.|$|R
40|$|To characterise food-habit {{differences}} in Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini juveniles we compared diets, prey diversity and nutritional states between two groups, i. e., {{one in the}} <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan {{and the other in}} the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk around northern Hokkaido, Japan. Juveniles were collected with a sledge net along the sea bottom at depths of 8 - 50 m in August 2010 and 2011. In the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan, 63 were analysed (23 in 2010 and 40 in 2011). In the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk, 88 were analysed (55 in 2010 and 33 in 2011). There were no {{differences in}} standard lengths <b>of</b> juveniles (the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan: 27. 0 mm in 2010 in median; 28. 8 mm in 2011; the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk: 28. 3 mm in 2010; 29. 2 mm in 2011) or in bottom water temperatures at the study sites. However, stomach content volume and Fulton's condition factor K were higher in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk than in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan. High feeding intensities in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk may have led to a higher nutritional status in fish collected from this sea. In both seas, the diet comprised mainly harpacticoid copepods, gammarids and polychaetes, with some additional bivalves being observed in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan. The value of the prey-diversity index (Delta*) was lower when the K value of juveniles was higher...|$|R
5|$|In {{the event}} of invasion, the Royal Navy would have sailed to the landing places, {{possibly}} taking several days. It is now known that the Germans planned {{to land on the}} southern coast of England; one reason for this site was that the narrow <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the English Channel could be blocked with mines, submarines and torpedo boats. While German naval forces and the Luftwaffe could have extracted a high price from the Royal Navy, they could not have hoped to prevent interference with attempts to land a second wave of troops and supplies that would have been essential to German success—even if, by then, the Germans had captured a port essential for bringing in significant heavy equipment. In this scenario, British land forces would have faced the Germans on more equal terms than otherwise and it was only necessary to delay the German advance, preventing a collapse until the German land forces were, at least temporarily, isolated by the Royal Navy and then mounting a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed {{the strongest and}} most likely to survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's growing might was {{displayed}} in 942, when Emperor Romanos I dispatched a squadron to the Tyrrhenian Sea. Using Greek fire, the squadron destroyed {{a fleet of}} Muslim corsairs from Fraxinetum. In 949, however, another expedition of about 100 ships, launched by Constantine VII (945–959) against the Emirate of Crete, ended in disaster, due to the incompetence of its commander, Constantine Gongyles. A renewed offensive in Italy in 951–952 was defeated by the Fatimids, but another expedition in 956 {{and the loss of}} an Ifriqiyan fleet in a storm in 958 temporarily stabilized the situation in the peninsula. In 962, the Fatimids launched an assault on the remaining Byzantine strongholds on Sicily; Taormina fell on Christmas Day 962 and Rometta was besieged. In response, a major Byzantine expedition was launched in 964 but ended in disaster. The Fatimids defeated the Byzantine army before Rametta and then annihilated the fleet at the Battle of the Straits, notably through the use of divers bearing incendiary devices. Both powers focusing their attention elsewhere, a truce was concluded between Byzantium and the Fatimids in 967, which curbed Byzantine naval activity in the West: the <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> Italy were left to the local Byzantine forces and the various Italian states until after 1025, when Byzantium again actively intervened in southern Italy and Sicily.|$|E

5|$|The Mary Rose {{first saw}} battle in 1512, {{in a joint}} naval {{operation}} with the Spanish against the French. The English were to meet the French and Breton fleets in the English Channel while the Spanish attacked them in the Bay of Biscay and then attack Gascony. The 35-year-old Sir Edward Howard was appointed Lord High Admiral in April and chose the Mary Rose as his flagship. His first mission was to clear the <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> French naval forces between England to the northern coast of Spain {{to allow for the}} landing of supporting troops near the French border at Fuenterrabia. The fleet consisted of 18 ships, among them the large ships the Regent and the Peter Pomegranate, carrying over 5,000 men. Howard's expedition led to the capture of twelve Breton ships and a four-day raiding tour of Brittany where English forces successfully fought against local forces and burned numerous settlements.|$|E
