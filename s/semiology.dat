25|$|As he {{developed}} his work throughout the 1980s, {{he moved from}} economic theory to mediation and mass communication. Although retaining his interest in Saussurean semiotics and the logic of symbolic exchange (as influenced by anthropologist Marcel Mauss), Baudrillard {{turned his attention to}} the work of Marshall McLuhan, developing ideas about how the nature of social relations is determined by the forms of communication that a society employs. In so doing, Baudrillard progressed beyond both Saussure's and Roland Barthes's formal <b>semiology</b> to consider the implications of a historically understood version of structural <b>semiology.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Midline epileptiform {{discharges}} {{are rare}} compared with discharges at other scalp locations. Neuroimaging results and semiologic seizure characteristics {{of patients with}} midline spikes are not adequately described. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the neuroimaging findings and detailed seizure <b>semiologies</b> in patients with midline spikes. Methods: We reviewed the EEG database of the University of Michigan Medical Center and identified 35 patients with midline spikes. Information about seizure types and neuroimaging results was obtained from a review of medical records. The seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria and semiologic classification. Results: Twenty-nine (83 %) patients had a history of seizures. Complex partial seizures and simple partial seizures were the most common seizure types, experienced by 66 % of patients. The age at seizure onset was within the first 10 years in 90 % of patients. According to the semiologic seizure classification, automotor seizures and tonic seizures were the most common seizure types. Neuroimaging studies were abnormal in 45 % of patients. When focal abnormalities were detected, they were lateralized to one of the frontal lobes in all cases. Conclusions: Our results indicate that in the majority of patients, midline spikes represent focal epileptiform activity rather than fragments of generalized discharges, and are most commonly associated with seizures of partial onset. Automotor seizures and tonic seizures are the most common <b>semiologies.</b> Focal radiologic abnormalities tend to be lateralized to one of the frontal lobes...|$|R
40|$|Epilepsy is a {{clinically}} and genetically heterogeneous {{group of}} disorders. The advent of molecular genetics brings unprecedented advancement in diagnostic molecular pathology and reduces over-reliance on traditional clinical classification. Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic infantile-onset epilepsy. We report two unrelated Hong Kong Chinese patients with this condition presenting with febrile seizures, epilepsy with different <b>semiologies,</b> psychomotor retardation, and recurrent status epilepticus.

25|$|In most medical programs, {{the first}} two years deal with basic {{scientific}} courses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology, histology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how it is organized in different schools, but is usually organ system-based pathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, parasitology, immunology, and medical genetics are also taught in this block). In {{the first two}} years, the programs also usually begin the courses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include biostatistics), a clinical skills track (<b>semiology</b> and the clinical examination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and communication skills track. Modes of training vary, but are usually based on lectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning sessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three, most schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with accompanying academic courses (these include {{but are not limited to}} internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics, emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology). Elective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though as in the case of the non-elective rotations, the hospitals the medical students may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on the medical schools. This is important in terms of the medical training, given the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and skills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most schools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many specialties.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, Sloterdijk {{attempts}} {{to trace the}} Reception History of Kant's three Critiques and their various interpretations up to contemporary times. He {{attempts to}} show that Kant's [...] "critical trade" [...] became instrumentalized via the premise of Francis Bacon's aphorism that [...] "knowledge is power," [...] and was finally subverted and neutered by it. Moreover, he uses the ancient Greek Cynicism as a foil for the contemporary, inhumane cynicism that evolved, so Sloterdijk claims, {{through a combination of}} middle-class <b>semiologies</b> and grand philosophical ambitions. Sloterdijk concludes that, unlike the ancient Greek version, Cynicism no longer stands for values of the natural and ethical kind that bind people beyond their religious and economically useful convictions. Rather, it has become a mode of thought that defines its actions in terms of a [...] "final end" [...] of a purely materialistic sort and reduces the [...] "ought" [...] to an economic strategy aimed at maximizing profit. This contemporary sort of Cynicism remains silent, however, when it comes to social, anthropogenous, and altruistic goals {{having to do with the}} [...] "in" [...] and [...] "for" [...] of the [...] "good life" [...] the original Cynics were seeking.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether there are clinicoelectrical differences between anterior lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ALTLE) and posterior lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (PLTLE), taking medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) as a reference. Met h ods: We analyzed the historical information, ictal <b>semiologies,</b> and ictal EEGs of temporal lobe epilepsy patients with a documented favorable surgical outcome (Engel class I or II) at follow-up after more than one year. LTLE was defined when a discrete lesion on MRI or an ictal onset zone in invasive study was located outside the collateral sulcus. LTLE was further divided into ALTLE and PLTLE by reference to the line across the cerebral peduncle. Total 107 seizures of 13 ALTLE, 8 PLTLE and 21 MTLE patients were reviewed. Resul t s: Initial hypomotor symptom was frequently observed in PLTLE (P< 0. 001). Oroalimentary automatism (OAA) was not observed initially in PLTLE. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred significantly earlier in PLTLE than in ALTLE or MTLE (P< 0. 001). Ictal scalp EEG was not helpful in differentiating between ALTLE and PLTLE. Concl usi ons: Frequent hypomotor onset, the absence of initial oroalimentary automatism, and early generali-zation are characteristic findings of PLTLE, although they are insufficient to differentiate it from ALTLE or MTLE.

40|$|Entre as diversas semióticas e semiologias atualmente existentes, devem-se distinguir dois projetos gerais: o de origem saussureana e o de origem peirceana. O primeiro recolhe da ciência lingüística seu modo de proceder e as características gerais do signo. O segundo pertence à tradição crítica filosófica. Para a inteligência capaz de aprender com a experiência, a dimensão {{temporal}} e histórica é essencial. O signo peirceano implica as relações de um tempo irreversível. À produção presente do signo cabe a função poética, a qual é essencial à vida de toda inteligência.

The first finds its mode of proceeding and the general features of sign in the science of linguistics. The other belongs to the critical philosophic tradition. For the intelligence that can learn with the experience, the temporal and historic dimension is essential. The peircean sign supposes the relations of an irreversible time. To the present production of sign should be related the poetic function, which is essential to life of all intelligence. The scientific hypothesis, the social revolutions in their originary moment and the artistic production make new signs, draw new objects and open sets of possibilities for the conduct in the future...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe {{confrontation}} of Ernst Cassirer’s {{philosophy of the}} symbolic forms and Lévi-Strauss’ structural anthropology makes necessary to clear their definitions of morphology transformation traductibility. We will expose the morphological field where Cassirer’s aesthetics grows by placing him in relation with Goethe, who represents as for Lévi-Strauss himself an important source. Defining the concept of transformation supposes to follow how he modifies the key ideas of the German poet and biologist, by taking account of the new point of view provided by the theory of groups of transformation which the mathematician Felix Klein developed into the “circle of Erlangen”. Then we will give {{an idea of the}} manner by which Edgar Wind, a brilliant student of Cassirer, invents a morphological aesthetics to provide art history with a methodology, and we will give some examples of the application of the concept of building series of pictures into the field of art history. We will interrogate the global functioning of the tables of Aby Warburg’s Atlas Mnemosyne, Erwin Panofsky’s well-known iconological interpretation of the Melencolia I of Dürer and then, by contrast, the creation of a virtual and “then” real series of masks through a ruled imaginative variation, which Lévi-Strauss creates to give sense to a particular Amerindian mask which he finds during his investigations. To conclude, we will interrogate the problems appearing by the definition of transformation as traductibility in both Cassirers’ and Lévi-Strauss’ <b>semiologies.</b> We will ask for the use both make of the model of translation in linguistics so as to compare different forms of structural homologies...|$|R
2500|$|Music <b>semiology</b> (semiotics) is {{the study}} of signs as they pertain to music on a variety of levels.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Oppositions, a defining text for both deconstructivism and postmodernism was Robert Venturi's Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966). It argues against the purity, clarity and simplicity of modernism. With its publication, functionalism and rationalism, {{the two main}} branches of modernism, were overturned as paradigms. The reading of the postmodernist Venturi was that ornament and historical allusion added a richness to architecture that modernism had foregone. Some Postmodern architects endeavored to reapply ornament even to economical and minimal buildings, described by Venturi as [...] "the decorated shed." [...] Rationalism of design was dismissed but the functionalism of the building was still somewhat intact. This {{is close to the}} thesis of Venturi's next major work, that signs and ornament can be applied to a pragmatic architecture, and instill the philosophic complexities of <b>semiology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Several social {{thinkers and}} {{academics}} have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it in toto. The French hermeneutic philosopher Paul Ricœur (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping {{the limits of}} validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as [...] "a Kantianism without a transcendental subject". Anthropologist Adam Kuper (1973) argued that [...] "'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement {{and some of its}} adherents felt that they formed a secret society of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was {{not just a matter of}} accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation." [...] Philip Noel Pettit (1975) called for an abandoning of [...] "the positivist dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for semiology" [...] arguing that <b>semiology</b> is not to be placed among the natural sciences. Cornelius Castoriadis (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain symbolic mediation in the social world; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the [...] "logicist" [...] theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations on the basis of the binary logic of oppositions. Critical theorist Jürgen Habermas (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science (see Performative contradiction and Foucault–Habermas debate). Sociologist Anthony Giddens (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of social systems is merely [...] "a mechanical outcome".|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Ictal {{behaviors}} during psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (NES) {{vary considerably}} among individuals, and can closely resemble common <b>semiologies</b> of epileptic seizures (ES). We tested {{the hypothesis that}} behaviors during NES in patients who have temporal spikes would more closely resemble behaviors during ES in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than would behaviors during NES in patients {{who do not have}} EEG spikes. Methods: We identified 20 patients who had interictal temporal EEG spikes and EEG-video recorded NES (Study Group), 133 patients with temporal EEG spikes and recorded ES, without NES (Epileptic Group), and 24 patients with recorded NES and no epileptiform EEG abnormalities, without ES (Nonepileptic Group). Results: The hypothesis was supported with regard to ictal motor behaviors. Motionless staring or complex automatisms occurred mainly during NES in the Study Group and during ES in the Epileptic Group. In contrast, convulsive movements or flaccid falls were most common during NES in the Nonepileptic Group. Duration of unresponsiveness was longer, and there were fewer postictal states in NES both in the Study and Non-epileptic Groups. Unresponsiveness was briefer and postictal states were more consistent in ES in the Epileptic Group, however. Conclusions: Stereotyped motor activities during NES presumably represent learned behaviors. Processes underlying acquisition of ictal behaviors of NES probably differ in patients with interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities compared to those without. Prior experiences and temporal lobe dysfunctions that are associated with epilepsy, and psychological characteristics that are unrelated to interictal epileptic dysfunctions, may determine ictal behaviors during NES...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To report {{results of}} linkage {{analysis}} {{in a large}} family with autosomal dominant (AD) familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (FMTLE). BACKGROUND: Although FMTLE is a heterogeneous syndrome, one important subgroup {{is characterized by a}} relatively benign course, absence of antecedent febrile seizures, and absence of hippocampal sclerosis. These patients have predominantly simple partial seizures (SPS) and infrequent complex partial seizures (CPS), and intense and frequent déjà vu phenomenon may be the only manifestation of this epilepsy syndrome. No linkage has been described in this form of FMTLE. METHODS: We identified a four-generation kindred with several affected members meeting criteria for FMTLE and enrolled 21 individuals who gave informed consent. Every individual was personally interviewed and examined; EEG and MRI studies were performed on three affected subjects. DNA was extracted from every enrolled individual. We performed a genome-wide search using an 8 cM panel and fine mapping was performed in the regions with a multipoint lod score > 1. We sequenced the highest priority candidate genes. RESULTS: Inheritance was consistent with AD mode with reduced penetrance. Eleven individuals were classified as affected with FMTLE and we also identified two living asymptomatic individuals who had affected offspring. Seizure <b>semiologies</b> included predominantly SPS with déjà vu feeling, infrequent CPS, and rare secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. No structural abnormalities, including hippocampal sclerosis, were detected on MRI performed on three individuals. Genetic analysis detected a group of markers with lod score > 3 on chromosome 4 q 13. 2 -q 21. 3 spanning a 7 cM region. No ion channel genes are predicted to be localized within this locus. We sequenced all coding exons of sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (SLC 4 A) gene, which {{plays an important role in}} tissue excitability, and cyclin I (CCNI), because of its role in the cell migration and possibility of subtle cortical abnormalities. No disease-causing mutations were identified in these genes. CONCLUSION: We report identification of a genetic locus for familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The identification of a disease-causing gene will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsies. Journal ArticleResearch Support, N. I. H.
