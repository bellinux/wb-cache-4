25|$|Hot Pants is a Steel Ball Run {{participant}} {{from the}} United States, {{and a former}} nun. She uses the Stand Cream Starter, which {{takes the form of}} a <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> that can turn flesh into a foam-like substance and spray it to fuse the flesh with people's bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a C, saying [...] "In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, {{is that no}} one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots doesn't break any new ground in the {{storytelling}} department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience {{all the way up the}} line." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has about half as much entertainment value." [...] Olly Richards of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic <b>spray</b> <b>bottle.</b> And thank goodness the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal." [...] Stan Hall of The Oregonian gave the film a B, saying [...] "Puss in Boots isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done." ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{packages}} have closures {{or other}} dispensing systems {{that change the}} contents from a liquid to an aerosol. These are used for products ranging from precision inhalers for medications to <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> of household cleaners.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{convenience}} dispensing features can be built into closures. <b>Spray</b> <b>bottles</b> and cans with aerosol spray (valves, actuator) have special closure requirements. Pour spouts, triggers, sprayer cap, measuring attachments, sifting devices, etc. are common caps.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> with trigger-style {{actuators}} appeared and quickly became popular, as this design was less fatiguing to use. The original pump-style bottle remained more popular for applications like non-aerosol deodorants, where size {{was a factor}} and repeated pumps were not required.|$|R

50|$|Spritz {{blocking}} involves spraying {{the garment}} with water. This relaxes the fibres more than steam blocking {{but less than}} wet blocking. Most often, a <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> is used.|$|E
25|$|The beads are {{approximately}} five millimeters {{in diameter and}} come {{in a wide range}} of colours. Bindeez are available in various different kits with accessories such as a drying fan, applicator pen, design templates for the beads, and water <b>spray</b> <b>bottles.</b> The product is labelled for ages four and above.|$|R
50|$|Setting spray (also {{finishing}} spray, makeup setting spray, finish spray, or makeup spray) is {{a cosmetic}} {{product designed to}} preserve applied make-up long periods of time. Usually sold in small <b>spray</b> <b>bottles,</b> setting <b>spray</b> is applied by spritzing mist over the face, keeping the make-up application moist for several hours.|$|R
50|$|A piston pumper {{is another}} version of this system. They are {{generally}} bigger than squirt guns and <b>spray</b> <b>bottles.</b> Piston pumpers do not have triggers. Instead, they fire by moving the pump back and forth. Although the piston pumper has greater output than squirt guns, {{they tend to be}} less powerful than pressurized water guns.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>bottle,</b> used to spritz the {{audience}} upon asking {{how many of}} them took a bath that morning, which was usually a segue into a commercial for bath soap.|$|E
5000|$|Some beekeepers {{are using}} [...] "liquid smoke" [...] as a safer, more {{convenient}} alternative. It is a water-based solution that is sprayed onto the bees from a plastic <b>spray</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a <b>spray</b> <b>bottle,</b> the {{dispensing}} {{is powered}} by the user's efforts, {{as opposed to the}} spray can, in which the user simply actuates a valve and product is dispensed under pressure.|$|E
50|$|Many early small water guns {{used the}} same trigger based pumping {{mechanism}} used for <b>spray</b> <b>bottles.</b> In this type of device, the trigger actuates a positive displacement pump shaft. With the aid of two check valves, often using small balls, fluid is drawn into the pump from a reservoir, then forced out the nozzle upon squeezing the trigger. The simplicity of the spraying mechanism allowed these toys to be manufactured cheaply, and allowed {{the majority of the}} body to be used as the reservoir. The primary limitation with this design is the volume of water that can be effectively moved per pump. Increasing pump volume would require more user effort to push the fluid out, making larger designs impractical. However, this technology remains widely used today both in <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> as well as small water guns that {{can be found in a}} wide variety of shapes and colors.|$|R
5000|$|Aerogard is an Australian {{brand of}} outdoor insect repellent, that is applied {{directly}} to the skin.It comes in aerosol <b>sprays,</b> <b>bottled</b> creams and roll-ons.Together with its sister product Mortein, a household insecticide, Aerogard {{has become something of}} a [...] "household name" [...] in Australia. Recent promotion includes advertisements featuring former Australian tennis champion John Newcombe and the catchphrase [...] "Avagoodweekend".|$|R
50|$|While <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> existed {{long before}} {{the middle of the}} 20th century, they used a rubber bulb which was {{squeezed}} to produce the spray; the quickly-moving air siphoned fluid from the bottle. The rapid improvement in plastics after World War II increased the range of fluids that could be dispensed, and reduced the cost of the sprayers because assembly could be fully automated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{convenient}} {{method is}} to use a cheap small <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> to spray water onto the lens rather than pouring it on. Another good lens-cleaning agent is a 50-50 mixture of rubbing alcohol and water. After it is mixed it should be put into a <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> for use. Use only a clean cloth on the mask; paper towels will scratch the lenses. Anti-fog spray is also available, which coats the lens in a temporary fog-resistant film. Some new lenses will come [...] "pre-treated" [...] by anti-fog, or the lens will say [...] "fog-resistant" [...] â€” with these lenses, it is advised that anti-fog chemicals are never used as the chemicals can damage the lens beyond further use.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> is {{a bottle}} that can squirt, spray or mist fluids. A common use for spray bottles is {{dispensing}} cool cleaners, cosmetics, and chemical specialties. Another wide use of spray bottles is mixing down concentrates such as pine oil with water.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} animals, spanking or hitting a skunk is not recommended, since {{it will cause}} them to become vengeful or hand-shy. Discipline {{should be in the}} tone and volume of voice. A squirt of water from a <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> may be helpful.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the rubber}} bulb {{dispenser}} which primarily moved {{air with a}} small amount of fluid, modern <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> use a positive displacement pump that acts directly on the fluid. The pump draws liquid up a siphon tube from the bottom of the bottle and forces it through a nozzle. Depending on the sprayer, the nozzle may or may not be adjustable, so as to select between squirting a stream, aerosolizing a mist, or dispensing a spray.|$|R
50|$|Electoral stain {{is used as}} an {{effective}} security feature to prevent double voting in elections. Ink is normally applied to the left hand index finger, especially to the cuticle where {{it is almost impossible}} to remove quickly. Ink may be applied in a variety of ways, depending on circumstance and preference. The most common methods are via dipping bottles with sponge inserts, bottles with a brush applicators, <b>spray</b> <b>bottles,</b> and marker pens. With all methods the finger should be left to dry for 15-30 seconds and exposed to light before being cleaned to ensure the mark remains visible for the desired length of time.|$|R
50|$|The {{lobby is}} {{inspired}} by the Spanish Renaissance style. The art glass panels in the ceiling give the hotel's single largest space an atrium effect. There is a separate glass roof above this one for protection. The ceiling beams are cast plaster with faux wood graining. Over time, much of the detail on these was lost to the eye due to decades of smoke in the lobby - both from the wood-burning fireplace and cigars/cigarettes. When the beams were cleaned in the renovation of 2000 - with <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> of Simple Green and toothbrushes - the burgundy, teal, and gold colors appeared as they were when new.|$|R
50|$|Volumes of snow {{output by}} home snowmakers {{depend on the}} air/water mixture, temperature, wind variations, pumping capacity, water supply, air supply, and other factors. Using a {{household}} <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> will not work unless temperatures are well below the freezing point of water.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of dirt or [...] "soil" [...] are {{detritus}} {{and common}} spills and stains {{that exists in}} the home. Equipment used with a cleaner might be a bucket and sponge or a rag. A modern tool is the <b>spray</b> <b>bottle,</b> but the principle is the same.|$|E
5000|$|Have a floor {{cleaning}} solution or <b>spray</b> <b>bottle</b> for the appropriate floor. If you are cleaning stone floors (marble, granite, travertine, etc.), {{make sure the}} cleaning agent states that it is for stones. An acidic tile {{cleaning solution}} {{can be used on}} ceramic and porcelain floors ...|$|E
5000|$|The Drackett company, {{manufacturers}} of Windex glass cleaner, {{was a leader}} in promoting <b>spray</b> <b>bottles.</b> Roger Drackett raised soybeans, converted the soybeans to plastic using technology purchased from Henry Ford, and was an investor in the Seaquist company, an early manufacturer of sprayers and closures. Initially, the brittle nature of early plastics required that sprayers be packaged in a cardboard box, and the sprayer inserted in the glass Windex bottle by the consumer. The cost in the manufacturing sprayers was also a factor; consumers would reuse the sprayers with bottle after bottle of glass cleaner. As plastics improved {{and the cost of}} sprayers dropped, manufacturers were able to ship products with the sprayer already in the bottle.|$|R
50|$|During live {{performances}} on 1992-93's Zoo TV Tour, lead singer Bono would <b>spray</b> a <b>bottle</b> of champagne towards the audience. It was played 136 {{times out of}} the 159 times on the tour, but has not been performed since then. However, it was snippeted at three concerts during the final leg of the U2 360 Tour in July 2011.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} is to assist instructors in the selection and modification of demonstrations {{to account for the}} physical and safety limitations of the instructional setting. The classic flame test demonstration will be used to illustrate how a demonstration can be scaled up or down as dictated by such limitations. For small classrooms, Q-tips Â® dipped in aqueous solutions of metal salts can be placed in a candle, burner, or alcohol lamp flame [3, 4, 6]; for medium sized rooms methanol solutions of the salts in <b>spray</b> <b>bottles</b> can be <b>sprayed</b> into the flame of a meeker burner [2]. And, for very large lecture halls and for outdoor performances, one can ignite balloons containing water/methanol mixtures of the salts and hydrogen gas [1].

2500|$|The iconic {{nature of}} Champagne {{has long been}} used as a means of effusive ritual celebration, in which the wine is not {{consumed}} so much as [...] "sacrificed". The Champagne bottle traditionally smashed off the bow of a ship or aeroplane at its launch is believed to originate in the rather more reserved celebrations surrounding the christening of a baby. It is not uncommon to see champion sporting teams <b>spraying</b> <b>bottles</b> of champagne around their dressing rooms during celebrations, and indeed a bottle of champagne is a common gift to player-of-the-match award winners in football or cricket. The contents of a <b>bottle</b> agitated and <b>sprayed</b> over onlookers from the winners' podium of Formula 1 motor racing and other sports has origins in the earlier patronage of prestige sporting events by the social elite; the extravagant [...] "waste" [...] of the highly valued wine being an expression of the spirit of the Belle Ã‰poque. Rock band U2 famously end their concerts in similar fashion, spraying the audience with Champagne before leaving the stage. The act of pouring out champagne in the sink (so called sinking) has arisen in Sweden due to a ban on spraying champagne in bars.|$|R
5000|$|Euclide created {{beautiful}} detailed temporary ink {{designs on}} classroom dry erase boards, for relaxation during his 25 minute lunch break, while teaching {{high school students}} in the Minnesota River Valley, and then wiped them clean. He used classroom objects lying around including whiteboard erasers, paper towels, <b>spray</b> <b>bottles,</b> brushes and Japanese Sumi ink. He wanted to show his students the possible achievements that happen in a short space of time and the impermanence of existence. [...] "In our culture, there is a strong emphasis on reproduction and the original seems less important. My students were shocked when I would erase the original, because they saw it firsthand, and they were disturbed that it was destroyed. People who do not see the original have no problem only looking at it on a screen or as a print, but once you see the original it is hard to let it go or believe that it could be destroyed." [...] Euclide sees the concept of accepting impermanence to societyâ€™s impact on the natural world. When he casually wiped away his art creations, the students reacted with extreme dismay making Euclide decide to release a series of the temporary ephemeral artworks.|$|R
40|$|Soft {{ripened cheese}} (SRC) caused over 130 {{foodborne}} illnesses in British Columbia (BC), Canada, during two separate listeriosis outbreaks. Multiple agencies investigated {{the events that}} lead to cheese contamination with Listeria monocytogenes (L. m.), an environmentally ubiquitous foodborne pathogen. In both outbreaks pasteurized milk and the pasteurization process were ruled out as sources of contamination. In outbreak A, environmental transmission of L. m. likely occurred from farm animals to personnel to culture solutions used during cheese production. In outbreak B, birds were identified as likely contaminating the dairy plantâ€™s water supply and cheese during the curd-washing step. Issues noted during outbreak A included the risks of operating a dairy plant in a farm environment, potential for transfer of L. m. from the farm environment to the plant via shared toilet facilities, failure to clean and sanitize culture <b>spray</b> <b>bottles,</b> and cross-contamination during cheese aging. L. m. contamination in outbreak B was traced to wild swallows defecating in the plantâ€™s open cistern water reservoir and a multibarrier failure in the water disinfection system. These outbreaks led to enhanced inspection and surveillance of cheese plants, test and release programs for all SRC manufactured in BC, improvements in plant design and prevention programs, and reduced listeriosis incidence...|$|R
