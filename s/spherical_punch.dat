Large deflection theory {{has been used for}} analyze two cases of study: a simply supported circular thin plate stamped by a <b>spherical</b> <b>punch</b> and a simply supported circular thin plate formed with vacuum forming technique. If the edges are free to displace radially, thin plates will develop radial wrinkles near the edge at a central deflection approximately equal to four plate thicknesses w 0 /ℎ≈ 4 if they’re stamped by a <b>spherical</b> <b>punch</b> and w 0 /ℎ≈ 3 if they’re formed with vacuum forming technique. Initially, there are four symmetrical wrinkles, but the number increases if the central deflection is increased. By using experimental results, the “Snaptrhough” phenomenon is described...|$|E

The influence of cylindrical, conical and <b>spherical</b> <b>punches</b> on the load modes of burring and work of deformation was determined. The final geometry of detail, mode of deformation, strengthening and ratio of metal plasticity resource after deformation were determined.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of road texture on normal pressure distribution for tyre/road contact in statics, {{within the framework of}} rolling noise prediction. A contact model is developped in statics where the tyre tread is modelled by an elastic half-space and the road surface by several perfectly rigid asperities. The problem is solved using a Two-scale Iterative Method (TIM) which is fast and efficient. The numerical results give high resolution contact patterns for real road surfaces. Predicted results are compared to contact pressures measured between a slick tyre and several road surfaces. The agreement is fairly acceptable by keeping in mind both the precision of the measurement device and the simplicity of the model. The best correlations are obtained for model surfaces composed of <b>spherical</b> <b>punches</b> and real road surfaces of moderated or high macro-texture. The results are less conclusive for road surfaces of fine macro-texture. The efficiency of the TIM at a tyre/road contact scale is an encouraging first step before introducing dynamical effects...|$|R

In this paper, the forming limit diagram (FLD) of QP steel was experimentally studied using <b>spherical</b> <b>punch</b> test. The forming limit curves (FLC) of QP steel in room temperature under two pressing velocities (20 mm/s, 2 mm/s) were obtained. It {{has been found}} that the deformation velocity affects the FLC obviously; the FLC declines with the increase of pressing velocity.

40|$|The {{method of}} matched {{asymptotic}} expansions {{is used to}} study a contact problem for a system consisting {{of a large number}} of small punches situated along a given curve on the boundary of an elastic half-space. The cases of cylindrical punches (the linear problem) and <b>spherical</b> <b>punches</b> (the structurally non-linear contact problem) are considered. In the linear case the reduced logarithmic capacity of the contact area is shown to possess the property of monotonicity and its asymptotic behaviour is determined. The resultant integral equations for the average density of linear pressures are derived. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. FORMULATION OF THE LINEAR CONTACT PROBLEM Let F be a simple smooth closed curve of length 2 /in the (xl, x 2) plane. Let (s, n) be a local system of coordinates introduced in its neighbourhood, where s is the length of the arc and n is the distance (taking the sign into account) along the interior normal. Let N be a large natural number and let e = 1 /N be a small parameter. Let c 01 denote a domain in the plane of &quot;expanded &quot; coordinates ({ 1, ~ 2) contained in a disk of radius l, and let m 2 be the domain obtained from co 1 by N-fold contraction. We define a periodically varying narrow set along the contour F by In other words, F(e) is the union ofN pairwise disjoint domains m ~ (j = 0, 1, [...] ., N- 1) of small diameter (of order of magnitude 2 v_/) that have the form of the domain m ~ in local coordinates.

40|$|In this paper, Finite Element {{method and}} {{full-scale}} experiments {{have been used}} to study a hot forging method for fabrication of a spindle using reduced initial stock size. The forging sequence is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the hot rolled cylindrical billet is pre-formed and pierced in a closed die using a <b>spherical</b> nosed <b>punch</b> to within 20 mm of its base. This process of piercing or impact extrusion leads to high strains within the work piece but requires high press loads. In the second stage, the resulting cylinder is placed in a die with a flange chamber and upset forged to form a flange. The stock mass is optimized for complete die filling. Process parameters such as effective strain distribution, material flow and forging load in different stages of the process are analyzed. It is concluded from the simulations that minor modifications of piercing punch geometry to reduce contact between the punch and emerging vertical walls of the cylinder appreciably reduces the piercing load. In the flange chamber, a die surfaces angle of 52 ° instead of 45 ° is proposed to ensure effective material flow and exert sufficient tool pressure to achieve complete cavity filling. In order to achieve better compression, it is also proposed to shorten both the length of the inserted punch and the die “tongues” by a few mm. </p...|$|R
40|$|Large {{deflection}} {{theory is}} used to determine when wrinkling occurs in a simply supported circular elastic plate loaded at the center by a <b>spherical</b> <b>punch.</b> If the edges are free to displace radially, thin plates stamped by intermediate radius punches will develop radial wrinkles near the edge at a central deflection approximately equal to four plate thicknesses, w 0 h ≈ 4. Initially, there are either three or four wrinkles, but the number increases if the central deflection is increased. With larger radius punches, thin plates do not wrinkle. It is calculated that elastic wrinkling occurs in thin plates (a h > 80) when a 2 Rh > 8, where a is the plate radius and R is the punch radius...|$|E
40|$|Undesired wall {{thickness}} distribution and flanging cracking easily occur in reverse drawing–flanging combined processes of steel spokes when improper process parameters are used. Thus, based on GRA (grey relational analysis) and FEM (finite element method), a GRA {{model for a}} reverse drawing–flanging combined process for high strength steel B 550 CL spoke was established and validated. The results show that: (1) the most significant factors affecting uneven {{wall thickness}} distribution and excessive thinning in the mounting zone and center hole cracking are the friction coefficient and the shape of punch, respectively; (2) the non-uniformity of wall thickness U increases {{with the increase of}} the friction coefficient. The conical punch has a lower thinning ratio T, the <b>spherical</b> <b>punch</b> has a lower value of damage D; (3) considering synthetically the indexes of uneven wall thickness distribution, the excessive thinning in the mounting zone and center hole cracking, optimal results for the process parameters are obtained...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA unified {{treatment}} of axisymmetric adhesive contact problems is provided using the harmonic potential function method for axisymmetric elasticity problems advanced by Green, Keer, Barber and others. The harmonic function {{adopted in the}} current analysis {{is the one that}} was introduced by Jin et al. (2008) to solve an external crack problem. It is demonstrated that the harmonic potential function method offers a simpler and more consistent way to treat non-adhesive and adhesive contact problems. By using this method and the principle of superposition, a general solution is derived for the adhesive contact problem involving an axisymmetric rigid punch of arbitrary shape and an adhesive interaction force distribution of any profile. This solution provides analytical expressions for all non-zero displacement and stress components on the contact surface, unlike existing ones. In addition, the newly derived solution is able to link existing solutions/models for axisymmetric non-adhesive and adhesive contact problems and to reveal the connections and differences among these solutions/models individually obtained using different methods at various times. Specifically, it is shown that Sneddon's solution for the axisymmetric punch problem, Boussinesq's solution for the flat-ended cylindrical punch problem, the Hertz solution for the <b>spherical</b> <b>punch</b> problem, the JKR model, the DMT model, the M-D model, and the M-D-n model can all be explicitly recovered by the current general solution.

This test is the inward drawing of sheet blank with stretching methodology. In this test a <b>spherical</b> <b>punch</b> is used to evaluate the formability characteristics of sheet metals. This test deforms the blank into the shape of hemispherical dome. The formability characteristics such as Erichsan number and peak load can be determined through the Erichsan cupping test. In general drawing process the sheet is formed to cup shape. The tensile forces produced sheet metal and it is stretched radially, but it circumferentially compressed due to punch force. In Erichsan cupping test, a single specimen with required dimension drawn into cup until the fracture occurred at dome of cup by the force applied through continuous movement of hemispherical punch into specimen of sheet metal. In this test the cup height at fracture and peak load is measured. These are used as a measure of the formability index. Cup height at fracture in ‘mm ’ is measured as Erichsan number.
