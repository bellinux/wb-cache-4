25|$|Troy Percival was {{activated}} {{from the}} disabled list on September 2. In Toronto for his second outing since his return, he allowed a walk-off grand slam with two outs when the Rays were ahead by a single run and in position {{to win the game}} in extra innings. Against Boston during another extra inning game, Percival came in to close with a three-run lead and allowed the first three batters to reach base. He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer. The reason for Percival's removal from the game against Boston was a stiff back, and not for the game's situation, or for any sort of leg injury that had plagued him throughout the year. Percival stated that because of warming up multiple times throughout the game, only to not come in until the Rays took a lead, was what pained his back. Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, {{he would be able to}} get the job done. As a result of the game, the Rays decided to not use Percival too often on consecutive nights, and using him in a tie game if the situation of the game changes while he is warming up. He would still be listed as the team's closer.|$|E
500|$|On December 6, The Washington Posts media critic Erik Wemple {{called for}} all Rolling Stone staff who were {{involved}} with the story to be fired. Wemple posited that the claims presented by the magazine were so incredible that editors <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> for further inquiry before publication. [...] "Under the scenario cited by Erdely", Wemple wrote, [...] "the Phi Kappa Psi members are not just criminal sexual-assault offenders, they're criminal sexual-assault conspiracists, planners, long-range schemers. If this allegation alone hadn't triggered an all-out scramble at Rolling Stone for more corroboration, nothing would have." [...] An editorial in the Boston Herald declared: [...] "a fifth-grader would've done some basic fact-checking before potentially ruining men's lives" [...] before repeating the call for the firing of Rolling Stone staff involved in the story.|$|E
500|$|Galarraga's near-perfect {{game was}} the tenth time {{in major league}} history that the 27th batter in a game broke up what was (to that point) a perfect game. One other {{instance}} of this occurrence also involved a missed call by an umpire, who later admitted to his mistake. On July 4, 1908, Hooks Wiltse of the New York Giants, perfect through 26 batters, hit Philadelphia Phillies pitcher George McQuillan on a 2–2 count in a scoreless game. Umpire Cy Rigler later admitted that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the previous pitch strike three, which would have ended the inning. Wiltse pitched on, winning 1–0 in ten innings, with the hit-batsman the only lapse separating him from a perfect game. [...] On May 19, 1981, Jim Bibby allowed a leadoff hit and then retired the next twenty-seven batters.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{words of}} the {{declaration}} represented the first expression of public support for Zionism by a major political power. The term [...] "national home" [...] had no precedent in international law, and was intentionally vague as to whether a Jewish state was contemplated. The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified, and the British government later confirmed that the words [...] "in Palestine" [...] meant that the Jewish national home {{was not intended to}} cover all of Palestine. The second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage antisemitism against Jews worldwide. Whilst the declaration called for political rights in Palestine for Jews, rights for the Palestinian Arabs, who composed {{the vast majority of the}} local population, were limited to the civil and religious spheres. The British government acknowledged in 1939 that the local population's views should have been taken into account, and recognised in 2017 that the declaration <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> for protection of the Palestinian Arabs' political rights.|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign he has got other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Balfour {{stated in}} February 1919 that Palestine was {{considered}} an exceptional case in which, referring to the local population, [...] "we deliberately and rightly decline to accept the principle of self-determination," [...] although he considered that the policy provided self-determination to Jews. Avi Shlaim considers this the declaration's [...] "greatest contradiction". This principle of self-determination had been declared on numerous occasions subsequent to the declarationPresident Wilson's January 1918 Fourteen Points, McMahon's Declaration to the Seven in June 1918, the November 1918 Anglo-French Declaration, and the June 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations that had established the mandate system. In an August 1919 memo Balfour acknowledged the inconsistency among these statements, and further explained that the British {{had no intention of}} consulting the existing population of Palestine. The results of the ongoing American King–Crane Commission of Enquiry consultation of the local population – from which the British had withdrawn – were suppressed for three years until the report was leaked in 1922. Subsequent British governments have acknowledged this deficiency, in particular the 1939 committee led by the Lord Chancellor, Frederic Maugham, which concluded that the government had not been [...] "free to dispose of Palestine without regard for the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of Palestine", and the April 2017 statement by British Foreign Office minister of state Baroness Anelay that the government acknowledged that [...] "the Declaration <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> for the protection of political rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, particularly their right to self-determination." ...|$|E

2500|$|St. Augustine {{mentions}} {{his fellow}} African Apuleius in his The City of God. When Apuleius lived was an age, Augustine elsewhere decries, of damnabilis curiositas. In discussing Socrates and Plato on 'the souls of gods, airy spirits, and humans,' Augustine refers to [...] "a Platonist of Madaura", Apuleius, {{and to his}} work [...] Augustine, holding {{the view that the}} world was under the lordship of the devil, challenged the pagans their reverence for particular gods. Referring to what he found as moral confusion or worse in stories of these gods, and their airy spirits, Augustine suggests a better title for Apuleius' book: [...] "he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> it De Daemone Socratis, of his devil." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Dion's version, [...] "I Drove All Night" [...] is dance-pop. It {{was also}} {{considered}} [...] "{{a little bit}} dance-club, a little bit rock & roll." [...] Lyrically, she recalls a feverish trek for sexual gratification. She sings in the first verse, [...] "Maybe I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> you first, but I was dying to get to you/I was dreaming while I drove the long, straight road ahead." [...] In the chorus, she sings, [...] "Woke you from your sleep {{to make love to}} you/Is that all right?/I drove all night." [...] In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison's original recording. Instead of singing, [...] "no matter where I go I hear the beating of our heart," [...] Dion sings, [...] "our one heart." [...] Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.|$|E
2500|$|This was the {{opposite}} of what happened to the English leg-spinner Doug Wright, a notorious no-baller with a [...] "long, springy run and windmill action" [...] that saw him overstep the line too many times. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "He waves his arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps." [...] Jack Fingleton called the no-ball [...] "Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history", It was easier for the umpires to call Wright for no-balling as be bowled at a slow-medium pace and Lindwall’s fast bowling was more difficult to judge, but they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> them equally if their feet were over the line. Incidentally, Wright had a habit of licking his hand before bowling each ball which the umpires forbade in the 1950-51 Ashes series and upset his rhythm, but was allowed by Scott and Bowick in 1946-47.|$|E

2500|$|For his part, Melcher {{defended his}} actions by {{explaining}} that the band's performances in the studio were lackluster and that the orchestration was needed {{to cover up the}} album's musical shortcomings. [...] In a 1977 interview with The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, Melcher attempted to illustrate the situation in the recording studio during the making of the album and also explain his rationale for the orchestral additions: [...] "Several members of the group were involved in divorces and they were hiding from their wives. It was complete bedlam in the studio. Everyone had too many problems. There was a lack of interest on everybody's part. I was trying to save the album, but it was a mistake. I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> a halt." [...] Melcher also succinctly highlighted his lack of confidence in the quality of the material that the band had recorded: [...] "I think the orchestration was a big mistake, but the songs were weak." [...] As for not obtaining the band's consent for the overdubs, Melcher explained [...] "I admit that I wasn't in consultation with them a lot and I didn't really deal with Clarence, Battin or Parsons on these matters. But I'm sure it was inconceivable that McGuinn did not know about the orchestration." ...|$|E
2500|$|F. L. ("Peter") Lucas {{grew up in}} Blackheath and {{was educated}} at Colfe's, where his father F. W. Lucas (1860–1931) was headmaster, and from 1910 at Rugby, where he was tutored by the Sophocles scholar Robert Whitelaw (1843–1917) in his last year before retirement. He won a {{scholarship}} to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1913 to read for the Classical Tripos, adding the Pitt Scholarship and the Porson Prize in 1914. In January 1914 he was elected Apostle – the last Apostle elected before the War – coming {{under the influence of}} G. E. Moore. Believing Cambridge threatened with the fate of Louvain, he volunteered, aged 19, in October 1914 and was commissioned in November, serving from 1915 as second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion The Royal West Kent Regiment in France. From August 1915 he was in the Somme trenches opposite Fricourt and Mametz; he was wounded by shrapnel in May 1916. He returned to the front as lieutenant in January 1917, went into battle near Grandcourt on 17 February in the Ancre Offensive, was mentioned in despatches on 22 February, and was gassed on 4 March. In all he spent seventeen months in war-hospitals. By September 1917 he felt that the cause of honour and justice had been lost in the lust of Victory [...] ("We were too ready to go on fighting without offering terms" [...] ). Passed fit for garrison duty at Chatham, he sought the help of fellow-Apostle John Maynard Keynes to return to France, and from August 1918 to the Armistice he was Staff lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps (Third Army HQ), examining German prisoners near Bapaume and Le Quesnoy. His life hung in the balance in November 1918 shortly after the Armistice, when his lung wounds reopened in the influenza pandemic. He returned to Cambridge in January 1919. Fell-walking in the Lake District [...] "on Easter morning [...] on Kidsty Pike, between Hawes Water and Hayes Water, a blinding spring sun on snowy ridge beyond ridge, from Fairfield to Blucathra, brought a moment of such ecstatic intoxication that, were I a mystic, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> it a mystical experience." ...|$|E
