40|$|International audienceFungal endophytes {{are known}} to produce {{secondary}} metabolites. The synthesis of vanillin and its precursors have never been clearly elucidated. Given fungi can produce such metabolites, it is speculated that fungal endophytes <b>in</b> <b>vanilla</b> could be contributing to vanillin and its precursors. An investigation was thus carried to find whether fungal endophytes are present <b>in</b> <b>Vanilla</b> planifolia. Additionally, vanilla flavor varies across cultivation regions; hence, the distribution of endophytes across regions was also assessed and found to differ. The metabolic changes brought by the fungi on vanillin and its precursors <b>in</b> <b>vanilla</b> pods were also evaluated. Out of 434 isolated fungal endophytes, two candidates emerged: Pestalotiopsis microspora and Diaporthe phaseolorum. However, P. microspora increased the most the absolute amounts (quantified by 1 H NMR in μmol/g DW green pods) of vanillin (37. 0 [*]×[*] 10 − 3), vanillyl alcohol (100. 0 [*]×[*] 10 − 3), vanillic acid (9. 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 3), and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (87. 9 [*]×[*] 10 − 3) when cultured on green pod-based media. Given the physical proximity of fungi inside pods, endophytic biotransformation {{may contribute to the}} complexity of vanilla flavors...|$|R
