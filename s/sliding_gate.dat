2500|$|The Voyages {{station is}} themed as a 17th-century ship, with the {{basement}} being the cargo hold, {{the second level}} being the deck, and the ride operator's controls being the [...] "Captain's Quarters". The station has three levels: a ground floor, a second floor, and a basement. Before entering the station, guests may be redirected to several outdoor queue switchbacks. Once the switchbacks have been navigated, guests enter {{the ground floor of}} the station. The ground floor includes two staircases to the basement; however, most of it is composed of maintenance areas. Depending {{on the size of the}} line, the park may or may not open the basement. If the basement is open, guests will walk down the stairs immediately after entering the ground floor of the station. The basement is filled with nothing but queue switchbacks. Once these switchbacks have been navigated, guests will walk up the stairs to the ground floor before continuing up the stairs to the second floor. The second floor of the station holds the roller coaster's loading and unloading areas, as well as the two transfer tracks and maintenance bays. On the loading side of the station there are fourteen air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train. On the unloading side of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings for the duration of the ride. The unloading side is also home to the ride operator's controls and two exit gates: a <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> near the front of the train and a swinging gate near the rear of the train. Beyond the unloading side of the station is an area that holds two maintenance bays. These allow unused trains to be stored during normal operation and also provides an additional area for maintenance crews to inspect the roller coaster trains.|$|E

50|$|The PMN-1 mine is armed by {{removing}} a steel ring-pull {{at the end}} of the horizontal fuze. When in position, the pin on the end of the ring-pull holds a spring-loaded striker back from the stab-detonator. Pulling out the ring-pull starts an arming delay, which comprises a thin steel wire (held under tension by the spring-loaded striker) which must cut through a small strip of lead before it is freed. The process of cutting through the lead strip takes between 2 and 12 minutes, depending on ambient temperature. After the wire has completely cut through the lead strip, the spring-loaded striker is freed and slides forward a few millimetres before stopping, blocked by the <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> of the pressure plate mechanism. At this point the mine is fully armed i.e. the only thing holding back the spring-loaded striker from the stab-detonator is a weak creep-spring on the pressure plate mechanism. Subsequently, any downward pressure on the pressure plate (i.e. when someone steps on the mine) overcomes the upward pressure of the creep-spring and pushes down the <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> that holds back the spring-loaded striker. This action frees the striker which flips forward into the stab detonator, firing both it and the adjacent tetryl booster which triggers detonation of the main TNT explosive filling. It is not a blast resistant mine.|$|E

The damn is eight bays across with an overflow section in the two end bays. It utilizes a gate structure of three small vertical <b>slide</b> <b>gates.</b> Both sanitary and storm sewer lines flow through the dam. It anchors the southern end of the historic district. Anchoring the northern end is the Center Street dam. It is also the terminal point for the river walls. Built in 1917, it is a concrete, multiple arch and buttress type dam.

40|$|The inter-related {{effects of}} nozzle clogging, argon injection, tundish bath depth, <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> opening {{position}} and nozzle bore diameter on the flow rate and pressure in tundish nozzles are quantified using three-dimensional multiphase turbulent numerical fluid flow models. The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce air aspiration by increasing the minimum pressure below the <b>slide</b> <b>gate.</b> More argon is needed to do this at intermediate casting speeds and in deeper tundishes. Argon flow should be reduced during shallow tundish and low casting speed conditions (such as encountered during a transition) in order to avoid detrimental effects on flow pattern. It should also be reduced at high casting speed, when the <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> is open wider and the potential for air aspiration is less. The optimal argon flow rate depends on the casting speed, tundish level, and nozzle bore diameter and is quantified in this work for a typical nozzle and range of conditions...|$|R
50|$|The first {{firearms}} {{to incorporate}} a cylinder were the snaphance and flintlock types. The lock mechanisms {{were very similar}} and used {{the same type of}} cylinder. The chambers did not penetrate completely through the cylinder. The back of each chamber had a small touch hole drilled through the side of the cylinder. For each touch hole, a small flash pan was created at the cylinder’s surface. Each pan with touch hole had a <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> to cover it. This prevented the gunpowder from falling out as the cylinder was turned. Assuming that each pan was filled with powder and that each chamber was charged, the operator manually turned the cylinder to align a chamber with the barrel, opened the pan cover, and was then ready to fire. Compared to the single-fire musket, the manufacturing process for this type of firearm was very expensive, which kept their numbers fairly low.|$|E
5000|$|The Colt-Burgess rifle {{is similar}} in design to Winchester's lever-action rifles, such as the Winchester Model 1873. It was {{produced}} in two versions chambered for the [...]44-40 Winchester cartridge: a rifle version with a 25+1/2 in barrel, and a carbine with a 20 in barrel. [...] The rifle features either a full octagon, half-octagon, or round barrel, with the full octagon barrels being the most numerously produced among rifle variants. [...] A tubular magazine is located under the barrel in similar fashion to other lever-action rifles with a capacity of 15 rounds in the rifle version or 12 rounds in the carbine version. The receiver on the Burgess rifle is smaller than the Winchester 1873's, providing for a lighter firearm. The rifle's action, though similar to the Winchester 1873's, {{is considered to be}} a stronger design. The action utilizes a toggle-joint system to lock the breechblock. The extension of the loading lever is the lower part of the toggle-joint; the upper part of the toggle-joint is linked to the breechblock. Located on the receiver is a sliding loading gate from which cartridges are fed into the magazine; the <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> design is in contrast to Winchester's tilting gate. Burgess rifles are finished with either a blued or browned barrel featuring walnut stock and case hardened receiver, hammer, and lever.|$|E

40|$|Primarily, a Gated-Viewing (GV) system {{provides}} range gated imagery. By increasing the camera delay time from frame to frame, a so-called <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence is obtained by which 3 -D reconstruction is possible. An important parameter of a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence is the step size {{by which the}} gate is shifted. In {{order to reduce the}} total number of required images, this step size should be as large as possible without significantly degrading the range accuracy. In this paper we have studied the influence of the gate shift step size on the resulting range accuracy. Therefore, we have combined the Intevac Gated-Viewing detector M 506 with a pulsed 1. 57 µm illumination laser. The maximal laser pulse energy is 65 mJ. The target is a one-square-meter-plate at a distance of 500 m. The plate is laminated with a Spectralon layer having Lambertian reflection behavior with a homogeneous reflectance of 93 %. For the measurements, this plate was orientated diagonally to the line of sight of the sensor in order to provide a depth scenario. We have considered different combinations of the two parameters »gate length« (13. 5 m, 23. 25 m, 33 m) and »signal-to-noise ratio« (SNR) (2 dB, 3 dB, 5 dB, 6 dB, 7 dB, 8 dB). For each considered set of parameters, a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence of the target was recorded. Per range, 20 frames were collected. The gate shift step size was set to the minimal possible value, 75 cm. By skipping certain ranges, a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence with a larger gate shift step size is obtained. For example, skipping the ranges 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, [...] . (equivalent: taking the ranges 1, 4, 7, [...] .) results in a gate shift step size of 2. 25 m. Finally, the range accuracies were derived {{as a function of the}} gate shift step size. Additionally, the influence of frame averaging on these functions was studied...|$|R

40|$|The <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> {{plate that}} {{controls}} steel {{flow through the}} tundish nozzle sometimes cracks leading to air aspiration and safety concerns. To evaluate possible mechanisms for crack formation, this research applies a 3 -D finite-element model of the thermal and mechanical stress in a sliding-gate plate during preheating and casting induced by thermal expansion and/or mechanical movement. The thermal model is first validated with previous temperature histories measured during preheating and casting in a ladle plate. The model of a tundish <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> nozzle is then used to investigate thermal-mechanical behavior and cracking due to the temperature variations during preheating and casting. The model predictions of the maximum stress location and orientation match well with the crack location observed in used plates from POSCO.

The first involves exterior tensile stress during heating stages, and the second is due to excessive compression from non-optimal placement of guide points on the steel cassette...|$|E
50|$|<b>Slide</b> <b>gate</b> {{operators}} are commonly {{installed at the}} end of the gate in the closed position but can also be installed by the end of the gate in the open position. In America the most common form of automation is a chain attached across the gate near the bottom and passing through the operator, which shuttles it back and forth.
