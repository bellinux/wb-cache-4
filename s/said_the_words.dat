500|$|According to Rahman, [...] "Jai Ho" [...] {{was meant}} to create [...] "a vision {{of the whole world}} celebrating this victory". The song {{contains}} a mix of [...] "multiple motifs from the traditional pieces on the soundtrack" [...] with [...] "the big drums and blasting horns of the present". It was originally composed and shortlisted for Subhash Ghai's 2008 film Yuvvraaj. Although Rahman was excited about the song, Ghai [...] "wasn't too kicked about it". Ghai felt it was [...] "too subtle and soft to be picturized on the character played by Zayed Khan". Rahman and Gulzar believed the song had [...] "immense potential" [...] and used it in Slumdog Millionaire. Following the song's win at the Oscar's, Rahman stated that: [...] "He [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> had a positive feel. It was like a prayer. I honestly didn't think the song would win me an Oscar though. But like the film Slumdog suggests, everything has its own destiny".|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by G4TV, Bungie representatives saw part of {{the mixed}} and {{negative}} reception as stemming from their own marketing of the title—first as an expansion pack, then a full game. [...] "If {{you look at the}} lower scores, they almost all cite an issue in perceived value based on an initial expectation that was set for an 'expansion' and then a feeling that they were overcharged for the final product," [...] Jarrad said, echoing Staten's comment that [...] "if we'd never <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'expansion pack' we would have seen an appreciable increase in the review scores". Other elements they wish they had improved had they the time were the pacing and navigation of the nighttime segments and matchmaking for Firefight. Halo manager 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said that he was glad ODST [...] "didn't take off", in his view, because it allowed people to focus on Reach and its launch and marketing.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} was John Cena versus Batista for the WWE Championship in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match, where {{the object of}} the match is to force an {{opponent}} to say [...] "I Quit". As the bell rang to signal the start of the match Batista gave Cena the chance to quit immediately, but Cena refused and hit Batista with the microphone. Despite this, Batista was able to take control, and locked in a submission hold, but Cena refused to say [...] "I quit". Cena eventually countered the move into his own submission hold, the STF, and Batista passed out. As he had not <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "I Quit" [...] however, he had to be revived so the match could continue. Batista fought back, and was able to powerslam Cena through the announce table. As Cena was bleeding, the match was briefly halted so his wound could receive attention. The two fought into the crowd before ending up near the entrance ramp, with Batista hitting Cena with a steel chair. On the entrance stage, Batista got into a car, which had been placed on the stage for decoration, and attempted to run over Cena. Cena avoided it, and was able to pull Batista {{out of the car and}} slam him onto it. Cena performed his Attitude Adjustment on Batista onto the car, but when Batista refused to quit, Cena went for the move again. Batista quit, making Cena the winner, but Cena performed the Attitude Adjustment again anyway, sending Batista through the stage to the floor. As Cena was celebrating retaining the championship, Sheamus attacked Cena with a Brogue Kick to end the show.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Knight was {{nominated}} for eight Academy Awards for the 81st Ceremony, breaking the previous record of seven held by Dick Tracy for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip, or graphic novel. The Dark Knight won two awards: Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger and Best Sound Editing. It was additionally nominated for six others, these being Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Film Editing. Heath Ledger was the first posthumous winner of the Best Supporting Actor award, and only the second posthumous acting winner ever (Peter Finch posthumously won the Best Actor award for his performance in the 1976 film Network). In addition, Ledger's win marked the first win {{in any of the}} major Oscar categories (producing, directing, acting, or writing) for a superhero-based film. Notably, Richard King's win in the Sound Editing category blocked a complete awards sweep of the evening by the eventual Best Picture winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Although it did not receive a Best Picture nomination, the show's opening song paid homage to The Dark Knight along with the five Best Picture nominees, including host Hugh Jackman riding on a mockup of the Batpod made out of garbage. In spite of the film's critical success, the film was noticeably absent from the Best Picture nominee list, prompting controversy and led many to criticize the Academy Awards for [...] "snubbing" [...] the film. There was speculation that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences later changed their number of Best Picture nominees to ten, instead of the traditional five, because of the film's omission. In a question-and-answer session that followed the announcement, the Academy's then president Sidney Ganis said; [...] "I would not be telling you the truth if I <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Dark Knight did not come up." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 10:22a.m., {{an anonymous}} man phoned the 16th Street Baptist Church. The call was answered by the acting Sunday School secretary: a 14-year-old girl named Carolyn Maull. To Maull, the anonymous caller simply <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "Three minutes", before terminating the call. Less than one minute later, the bomb exploded as five children were present within the basement assembly, changing into their choir robes {{in preparation for}} a sermon entitled [...] "A Love That Forgives". According to one survivor, the explosion shook the entire building and propelled the girls' bodies through the air [...] "like rag dolls".|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} when the High Priest anointed for battle {{addressed}} the people, he spoke in Hebrew. The High Priest spoke the words [...] "against your enemies" [...] in [...] {{to make clear that}} it was not against their brethren that the Israelites fought, and thus if they fell into the enemies' hands, the enemies would not have mercy on them. The High Priest said [...] "let not your heart faint" [...] in [...] to refer to the neighing of the horses and the brandishing of swords. He said [...] "fear not" [...] in [...] to refer to the crash of shields and the tramp of the soldiers' shoes. He said [...] "nor tremble" [...] in [...] to refer to the sound of trumpets. He said [...] "neither be afraid" [...] in [...] to refer to the sound of battle-cries. He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "for the Lord your God goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you" [...] in [...] to make clear that the enemies would come relying upon the might of flesh and blood, but the Israelites came relying upon the might of God. The High Priest continued, saying that the Philistines came relying upon the might of Goliath, and his fate was to fall by the sword, and the Philistines fell with him. The Ammonites came relying upon the might of their captain Shobach, but his fate was to fall by the sword, and the Ammonites fell with him. Thus the High Priest <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of [...] to allude to the camp of the Ark of the Covenant, which would go to battle with the Israelites..|$|E

The two armies met on November 10, 1444 near Varna in eastern Bulgaria. Accounts vary as to how many troops were present but the Crusaders may have been 30,000 strong whilst the Ottoman forces were two to three times larger. Nonetheless, Hunyadi's successful defense wagons held the line until King Ladislas led a charge to his death against the Turkish lines. His head was mounted on a spear where all the defeated Crusaders could see it. Few Crusaders survived the battle, although Hunyadi did escape with his life.|$|E

Then Caleb said, [...] "He brought us out of Egypt, divided the sea, and fed us manna. If he were to ask us to get ladders and climb to heaven, should we not obey?

2500|$|Hashizume and Ida begin {{searching for}} a place to live together, but no one wants to rent an {{apartment}} to two unrelated men, saying they would be messy and less reliable for payments and renewing. Kobayashi wonders if it's an excuse to avoid renting to a gay couple. Ida suggests one of them adopt the other, which would be the equivalent of gay marriage. This would also allow them to say that they are brothers for the purposes of renting. Hashizume initially rejects the idea, causing Ida to think he does not love him. They have an argument in which Ida accuses Hashizume of having never said [...] "I love you" [...] and Hashizume ends up slapping Ida and running off. Crying alone, Ida remembers how they first became a couple and that Hashizume <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> the first time they kissed. Hashizume returns, bringing the adoption forms as well as an old marriage registry showing he had wanted the same thing for a long time.|$|E

2500|$|However, Powell {{lost his}} seat in the {{election}} by 731 votes to the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before. The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign {{for the number of}} MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion {{for the rest of the}} United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, [...] "For the rest of my life when I look back on the 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart". He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Edmund Burke used on the death of candidate Richard Coombe: [...] "What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue".

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told what}} {{happened}} in [...] after Moses asked to behold God's Presence in [...] Moses foretold that he would behold God's Glory and make atonement for the Israelites' iniquities on Yom Kippur. On that day, Moses asked God (in the words of [...] ) [...] "Show me, I pray, Your Glory." [...] God told Moses that Moses {{was not able to}} see God's Glory lest he die, as [...] reports God said, [...] "men shall not see Me and live," [...] but for the sake of God's oath to Moses, God agreed to do as Moses asked. God instructed Moses to stand at the entrance of a cave, and God would cause all God's angels to pass before Moses. God told Moses to stand his ground, and not to fear, as [...] reports, [...] "And He said, I will make all My Goodness pass before you." [...] God told Moses that when he heard the Name that God had spoken to him, then Moses would know that God was before him, as [...] reports. The ministering angels complained that they served before God day and night, and they were unable to see God's Glory, but this man Moses born of woman desired to see God's Glory. The angels arose in wrath and excitement to kill Moses, and he came near to death. God intervened in a cloud to protect Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord descended in the cloud." [...] God protected Moses with the hollow of God's hand so that he would not die, as [...] reports, [...] "And it shall come to pass, while My Glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand." [...] When God had passed by, God removed the hollow of God's hand from Moses, and he saw traces of the Shechinah, as [...] says, [...] "And I will take away My hand, and you shall see my back."

God told Moses that if he had asked God then to pardon the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations, God would have done so, as it was the appropriate time.
