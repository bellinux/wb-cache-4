50|$|Totally {{drug-resistant}} tuberculosis (TDR-TB) is a generic term for tuberculosis strains that {{are resistant to}} {{a wider range of}} drugs than strains classified as extensively {{drug-resistant tuberculosis}}. TDR-TB has been identified in three countries; India, Iran, and Italy. The emergence of TDR-TB has been documented in four major publications. However, it is not yet recognised by the World Health Organization. TDR-TB has resulted from further mutations within the bacterial genome to confer resistance, beyond those seen in XDR- and MDR-TB. Development of resistance is associated with poor management of cases. Drug resistance testing occurs in only 9% of TB cases worldwide. Without testing to determine drug resistance profiles, MDR- or XDR-TB patients may develop resistance to additional drugs. TDR-TB is relatively poorly documented, as many countries do not test patient samples against a broad enough range of drugs to diagnose such a comprehensive array of resistance. The United Nations' Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases has set up a TDR Tuberculosis <b>Specimen</b> <b>Bank</b> to archive specimens of TDR-TB.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{environmental}} <b>specimen</b> <b>banks</b> (ESB) {{have emerged}} in many countries. Their highly standardised sampling and archiving strategies make them a valuable tool in tracing time trends and spatial distributions of chemicals in ecosystem compartments. The present article intends to highlight the potential of ESBs for regulatory agencies in the European Union (EU). The arguments are supported by examples of retrospective monitoring studies conducted under the programme of the German ESB. These studies have evaluated the success of regulatory and industry provisions for substances of concern (i. e. PCB, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds, alkylphenol compounds, organotin compounds, triclosan/methyl-triclosan, musk fragrances). Time trend studies revealed for example that levels of organotin compounds in marine biota from German coastal waters decreased significantly after the EU had decided on a total ban of organotin-based antifoulings in 2003. Similarly, concentrations of commercially relevant congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers decreased in herring gull eggs from the North Sea only after an EU-wide ban in 2004.

In fact, some mass spectral data banks have been recently built {{at the level of}} the research community but outside from conventional ESBs arena and without complete raw data storage, which reduce potential data reprocessing.

50|$|First, a {{suitable}} strain of Bb (Botryococcus braunii) must be found.

However, in selecting Bb strains for high Botryococcene production, it is likely that other beneficial attributes may be bred out. For instance, resistance to disease, competitive advantages against other organisms, and survivability in less than ideal climates. In this case, a photobioreactor may be needed.
