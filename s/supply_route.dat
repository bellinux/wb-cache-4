That night, Walker released control of the 23rd Infantry, less the 1st Battalion, to the US 1st Cavalry Division with orders for it to clear the North Koreans from the road and the commanding ground overlooking the main <b>supply</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1852, he was {{commissioned}} by the Ottoman authorities {{to prevent the spread}} of a Druze rebellion from Hauran to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies. Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> which the Ottomans used to send ammunition to their troops in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.|$|E
5|$|It {{seems likely}} that Urbicus planned his {{campaign}} of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Having secured an overland <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> for military personnel and equipment along Dere Street, Urbicus very likely set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs before proceeding against the Damnonii.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} was {{tasked with}} patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea {{in support of}} a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> between England and France. During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.|$|E
5|$|During the First English Civil War {{between the}} {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, Mersea Fort saw no action; after the victory of Parliament in 1646, the fort's garrison was demobilised. Conflict flared again in 1648 with {{the outbreak of the}} Second English Civil War, and Colchester was taken by the Royalists. The town was immediately besieged by General Thomas Fairfax, who quickly seized Mersea Fort, which controlled the <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> by river into Colchester, before the Royalists could do so. The fort had contained five pieces of artillery: two culverins, two sakers and one drake. A Royalist raiding party of 300 soldiers was sent to recapture the fort, but without success.|$|E
5|$|In January 1954, Muong Khoua was re-occupied by Laotian forces, {{which were}} {{subsequently}} overrun once {{more by the}} 316th Division of the Viet Minh. The Laotian commander, {{who lived in the}} village itself with his wife, was killed in his home before the attack. Battalions of the French Foreign Legion and Laotian forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.|$|E

5|$|In May, General Gaskin began {{planning}} to retake {{the city of}} Karmah, which sat astride a main <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold. Unlike other locales, Karmah had no definable perimeter, making it easy for outsiders to access, as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being pushed out of Baghdad. Gaskin sent one of his aides to Jordan to meet with Sheikh Mishan, head of Karmah's largest tribe, the Jumayli. Sheikh Mishan fled to Jordan in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI. Gaskin's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June, partnered with 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. By October, insurgent attacks had dropped to almost zero.|$|E
5|$|Justinian also {{strengthened}} {{the borders of}} the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground cisterns (see Basilica Cistern). To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town Dara, an advanced arch dam was built. During his reign the large Sangarius Bridge was built in Bithynia, securing a major military <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called Justiniana Prima, which was intended to replace Thessalonica as the political and religious centre of Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{worked for}} the State Defence Committee during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). As Deputy Chairman of the Council of Evacuation, his task was to {{evacuate}} industry from territories soon to be overrun by the Germans. He broke the Leningrad Blockade by organising {{the construction of a}} <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> and a pipeline on the bottom of Lake Ladoga. Kosygin was a candidate member of the Politburo from 1946 to 1949, and became a full member toward the end of Joseph Stalin's rule; he lost his seat in 1952. He briefly served as Minister of Finance in 1948, and as Minister of Light Industry from 1949 to 1953.|$|E

50|$|The Mediterranean was a {{traditional}} focus of British maritime power. Outnumbered {{by the forces}} of the Regia Marina, the British plan was to hold the three decisive strategic points of Gibraltar, Malta, and the Suez Canal.

It provided a needed stop for Allied convoys and a base from which to attack the Axis <b>supply</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{commander}} of the Japanese XVIII Army, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, ordered Katagiri to launch another counterattack. The supply situation was acute by this stage, with ammunition running low and troops being limited to one-third of their daily rations, nevertheless the counterattack was scheduled for 23/24 November. However, the Australian occupation of Pabu and the threat it posed to the Japanese <b>supply</b> <b>route,</b> forced the Japanese commander to bring his schedule forward, and to divert some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen and upon the Australian forces advancing towards Sattelberg in the south.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November, the JNA {{reached the}} {{strategic}} suburb of Lužac, between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar, cutting {{one of the}} two roads linking the town centre with its northern suburb. Meanwhile, the ZNG (which had been renamed the Croatian Army) attempted to retake the villages of Marinci and Cerić to reopen the <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> to Vukovar. It mounted a heavy bombardment of the JNA's access routes to Vukovar and launched a tank attack on the JNA's lines. On 4 November, JNA General Mladen Bratić was killed when his tank was hit by a shell. The JNA's advantage in artillery and rockets enabled it to halt the Croatian advance and inflict heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Operation Winter '94 was {{the first}} in a series of {{successful}} advances made by the HV and the HVO in or near the Livanjsko field, an elongated flat-bottomed valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were primarily designed to draw the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the besieged city of Bihać. The secondary objective was threatening the single direct <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> between Drvar in the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of the Croatian Serb Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|The Allied commanders {{planned to}} defeat Turkey and force a <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea. As such they planned a land {{invasion}} on the Gallipoli Peninsula. On {{the afternoon of}} 25 April 1915, Murray's 16th Battalion landed at Ari Burnu, Gallipoli. Setting their machine gun on Pope's Hill, Black and Murray fired their gun throughout the afternoon and into the night. The following day, the battalion's two machine gun crews sniped at the Turkish soldiers on Russell's Top, and Murray and his gunner continued fighting during the counterattack on 26–27 April, despite being wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: Bitka za Kupres) was {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, fought between the Bosnian Croat Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) {{supported}} by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) troops {{on one side and}} the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA), augmented by the Bosnian Serb TO on the other at the Kupres Plateau, on 3–11 April 1992. During the fighting on 8 April, the Bosnian Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO). The objective of the battle was to control the strategic Kupres Plateau, a major <b>supply</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Sihanouk Trail was a {{logistical}} {{supply system}} in Cambodia {{used by the}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and its National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or Viet Cong) allies during the Vietnam War (19601975). Between 1966 and 1970, this system operated {{in the same manner}} and served the same purposes as the much better known Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese) which ran through the southeastern portion of the Kingdom of Laos. The name is of American derivation, since the North Vietnamese considered the system integral to the <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> mentioned above. U.S. attempts to interdict this system began in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
