The Infiernillo porphyry copper (molybdenum) deposit {{is located in the}} San Rafael Massif, <b>south</b> <b>-</b> <b>central</b> part of the province of Mendoza, Argentina. It is hosted by and genetically related to Lower Permian Gondwanan volcanism, which represent a magmatic arc tectonic setting. The alteration zone has an oval shape about 3 km x 2 km in size, with NNE strike. It consists of a small central quartz plug with appreciable hematite surrounded by an intense quartz-injected zone with local pervasive potassic alteration. Outwards there is a well-developed phyllic halo with intense bleaching which consists of pervasive and in veins silicification, sericitization and pyritization. Cu and Mo anomalies are approximately coincident and are located between the silicified zone and the phyllic halo. In the outer part of the alteration zone, small epithermal polymetallic veins with pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite and electrum mineralization in quartz gangue crop out. From Level 3 A radiance at sensor, digital processing techniques such as (VNIR+SWIR), band ratio and spectral mapping methods were used for discriminating hydrothermal alteration minerals. A round zoning pattern was clearly observed in VNIR+SWIR band combination. Spectral analysis of the surface reflectance SWIR detects 2. 20 ìm and 2. 26 ìm absorptions.

The 2002 – 2005 Hi - CLIMB experiment consisted of 233 stations distributed along a dense 800 km linear north - south array extending from the Himalayan foreland into the central Tibeta n Plateau. The main array was flanked by a 350 km x 350 km sub - array in southern Tibet and central and eastern Nepal. Our dataset provides an opportunity to obt ain seismic event locations for ground truth (GT) evaluation, with emphasis on depth, to determine source parameters, and to study distance evolution of seismic coda for yield estimation in low Q regions. Event detection and preliminary automatic loca tion analysis show tens of thousands, otherwise undetected, local seismic events. We will obtain high - quality event locations from manual P- and S- wave picks by joint inversion for location and 2 D and 3 D velocity structure. We will also perform relative locations to resolve spatial relations of several highly active event clusters. Besides GT - compatibility, high - quality locations are essential for the source parameter and coda evolution portions of the study. We will perform moment tensor inversions in a wi de magnitude range (1. 5 ≤ Mw ≤ 6), paying particular attention to event depth and size. Full waveform m oment - tensor depth is important for validating traveltime - derived depth; seismic moment calibrates spectral coda levels and local and regional magnitudes. The dense station spacing of the Hi - CLIMB array is unique for any highly attenuating crustal path region, permitting fine - scale analysis of decay properties for multiple coda types, which is a globally important, unresolved issue in monitoring research. The GT - level locations and moment tensor depths will contribute to Seismic Location Baseline Model (SLBM) tomographic efforts, allow evaluation of depth mislocation for crustal models, and enhance model accuracy throughout central and southern Asia...|$|E
40|$|The Black Sea is an {{important}} ecosystem in Turkish marine fisheries. The early stages of economical fishes of the Black Sea can be considere d well known; however, there are significant data deficiencies on ichthyoplankton assemblages and their structures. Therefore, seasonal changes of structure and dynamics of ichthyoplankton assemblages of Sinop coasts (<b>South</b> <b>-</b> <b>Central</b> of the Black Sea, Turkey) were investigated in this study. For this purpose monthly vertical and horizontal standard plankton net tows had been conducted at six sampling stations from two different regions (Inner and Outer Harbours) between 2002 and 2005. Species richness, divers ity, abundance and similarity structures were used as ecological indicators to investigate ichthyoplankton assemblages. Planktonic stages of 27 fish species were collected during the studying period. The maximum species richness expectancy was 34 species. Seasonal changes of richness were significant (P < 0. 05). The groupings of similarity matrices were also explained by seasonal effects for both embryonic and larval stages (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, the ichthyoplankton assemblage structures of the studying are a were generally shaped by seasonal spawning patterns of adult populations.

40|$|Two digital- {{computer}} {{models of the}} ground -water reservoir of the Tucson basin, in <b>south</b> <b>-</b> <b>central</b> Arizona, were constructed to study errors in digital models and to evaluate the worth of additional basic data to models. The two models differ primarily in degree of detail [...] the large -scale model consists of 1, 890 nodes, at a 1 / 2 -mile spacing; and the small -scale model consists of 509 nodes, at a l -mile spacing. Potential errors in the Tucson basin models were classified as errors associated with computation, errors associated with mathematical assumptions, and errors in basic data: the model parameters of coefficient of storage and transmissivity, initial water levels, and discharge and recharge. The study focused on evaluating the worth of additional basic data to the small -scale model. A basic form of statistical decision theory was used to compute expected error in predicted water levels and expected worth of sample data (expected reduction in error) over the whole model associated with uncertainty in a model variable at one given node. Discrete frequency distributions with largely subjectively- determined parameters were used to characterize tested variables. Ninety -one variables at sixty - one different locations in the model were tested, using six separate error criteria. Of the tested variables, 67 were chosen because their expected errors {{were likely to be}} large and, for the purpose of comparison, 24 were chosen because their expected errors were not likely to be particularly large. Of the uncertain variables, discharge /recharge and transmissivity have the largest expected errors (averaging 155 and 115 feet, respectively, per 509 nodes for the criterion of absolute value of error) and expected sample worths (averaging 29 and 14 feet, respectively, per 509 nodes). In contrast, initial water level and storage coefficient have lesser values. Of the more certain variables, transmissivity and initial water level generally have the largest expected errors (a maximum of 73 per feet per 509 nodes) and expected sample worths (a maximum of 12 feet per 509 nodes); whereas storage coefficient and discharge/ recharge have smaller values. These results likely are not typical of those from many ground -water basins, and may apply only to the Tucson basin. The largest expected errors are associated with nodes at which values of discharge /recharge are large or at which prior estimates of transmissivity are very uncertain. Large expected sample worths are associated with variables which have large expected errors or which could be sampled with relatively little uncertainty. Results are similar for all six of the error criteria used. Tests were made of the sensitivity of the method to such simplifications and assumptions as the type of distribution function assumed for a variable, the values of the estimated standard deviations of the distributions, and the number and spacing of the elements of each distribution. The results are sensitive to all of the assumptions and therefore likely are correct only in order of magnitude. However, the ranking of the types of variables in terms of magnitude of expected error and expected sample worth is not sensitive to the assumptions, and thus the general conclusions on relative effects of errors in different variables likely are valid. Limited studies of error propagation indicated that errors in predicted water levels associated with extreme erroneous values of a variable commonly are less than 4 feet per node at a distance of 1 mile from the tested node. This suggests that in many cases, prediction errors associated with errors in basic data are not a major problem in digital modeling...|$|E
40|$|Two {{sandy beaches}} were studied in <b>south</b> <b>-</b> <b>central</b> Chile (ca., 39 degrees S), during 17 months {{to analyze the}} {{seasonal}} variability in population abundances and zonation {{of the most common}} species of the intertidal macroinfauna. The beaches displayed differences in mean grain size, Dean's parameter (a composite index of wave and sediment characteristics) and beach face slope. The peracarids Orchestoidea tuberculata Nicolet (Amphipoda, Talitridae), Excirolana braziliensis Richardson and Excirolana hirsuticauda Menzies (Isopoda, Cirolanidae), and the anomuran crab Emerita analoga (Stimpson) (Hippidae) were the most common organisms at both beaches, being E. analoga and E. hirsuticauda the top contributors to abundance. O. tuberculata tended to occur in higher abundance, either during autumn - early winter or late summer - early autumn; E. braziliensis was more abundant during summer - early autumn, while the abundances of E. hirsuticauda and E. analoga were quite erratic throughout seasons. In general, the temporal patterns of abundance did not show significant correlations with the beach physical factors considered. The species showed a clear pattern of zonation: O. tuberculata occurred in the upper beach levels (around the drift line); E. braziliensis occurrred in the mid - upper levels of the retention zone; E. hirsuticauda occurred throughout all the retention zone and also in the upper and middle levels of the resurgence zone, while E. analoga was mostly found in the swash zone and lower levels of the resurgence zone. Although, seasonal changes in the intertidal distribution was observed, {{it can be seen that}} each physical zone of the beaches is biologically distinct through seasons.
