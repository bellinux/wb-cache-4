2500|$|In 1977, David Bowie and Iggy Pop {{received}} {{a tape of}} Devo demo songs from the wife of Michael Aylward, guitarist in another Akron, Ohio band, Tin Huey. Both Pop and Bowie, as well as Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, expressed interest in producing Devo's first release. [...] At Devo's New York debut show in 1977, Bowie proclaimed that [...] "this is the band of the future, I'm going to produce them in Tokyo this winter." [...] Eventually, Eno was chosen to produce the album at Conny Plank's studio located near Cologne, Germany. Bowie was busy with filming Just a Gigolo but helped Eno produce the record during weekends. Two tracks, [...] "Come Back Jonee" [...] and [...] "Shrivel-Up", were recorded at Different Fur in San Francisco, California. All tracks were mixed at Conny Plank's studio named Conny's Studio. Since Devo was without a record deal, Eno paid for the flights and <b>studio</b> <b>cost</b> for the band, confident that the band would be signed to a record contract. In return {{for his work on}} the album, Eno asked for a share of any subsequent deals.|$|E

5000|$|Songs by Tom Lehrer was {{recorded}} in a single one-hour session on January 22, 1953 at the TransRadio studio in Boston for the total <b>studio</b> <b>cost</b> of $15. The first pressing was an issue of 400 copies, produced at Lehrer's own expense in the 10" [...] LP record format. Records were sold for $3.50, and later $3.95. Later releases were issued in 10" [...] and 12" [...] LP format.|$|E
50|$|For some of album's {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the album, the band announced {{the ability to}} watch to livestream half-hour or hour intervals of the band in the <b>studio,</b> <b>costing</b> $175 for a half-hour, or $300 for a full hour.|$|R
5000|$|Production costs: The cost of {{producing}} the film includes crew wages, production design, live set and <b>studio</b> <b>costs,</b> costumes, catering, accommodation, transportation, travel, hotel stay, etc. The director of photography is usually the highest paid {{member of the crew}} at about $500,000 to $1 million.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{recorded}} our album at NRG <b>studios,</b> which <b>cost</b> roughly $350,000. We also shot our video at Universal <b>Studios,</b> which <b>cost</b> roughly $250,000. Let('s) do the math: $500,000 advance (we had a 5-piece band) + $350,000 recording + $250,000 video = $1,150,000. And we had {{not even}} hit the road yet!" ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>studio</b> <b>cost</b> 7 guilders a {{month to}} rent, and Mauve lent van Gogh 100 guilders to furnish it, insisting {{he had to have}} a bed. Van Gogh {{decorated}} the studio with his own studies, with prints from a complete set of The Graphic between 1870 and 1880 that he had acquired at a bargain price, and with flowers and a couple of boxes of bulbs. He declared himself happy and content with the result. Nevertheless, the accommodation was of the simplest kind. Arnold Pomerans remarked that {{it was the beginning of}} a long series of plainly furnished rooms, of which the Bedroom in Arles would eventually become a world-famous symbol.|$|E
5000|$|McKinnon {{mentioned}} that the band had financed the recording themselves and been recording at McKinnon's home studio, built specifically for the making of this album. The recording <b>studio</b> <b>cost</b> $40,000 (£25,000) McKinnon and producer Andrew Wade to build; {{the rest of the}} band members paying $20,000 of the total. Dan Korneff helped build various equipment for the studio, such as several audio compressors. Wade and Korneff had a trial and error system based on what Wade liked and disliked in a studio, which as McKinnon commented, [...] "we built the whole studio around that ... It took us a few months to get up and running". Mastering was handled by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, and mixing by Ken Andrews.|$|E

5000|$|.....But Lucas, {{like some}} other radio managers, wonders whether the high {{standards}} of IBA studio specifications are always necessary. 'A significant proportion of <b>studio</b> <b>costs</b> comes in sound-proofing them'; says Lucas. 'Would it really matter if the listener heard the occasional lorry rumbling past outside? With most stations operating on close mic techniques anyway, peripheral noise can be minor'".|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} of studio Bee Train's other works, the entire Madlax soundtrack was {{composed}} by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and Kōichi Mashimo's fifth project together. In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save <b>studio</b> <b>costs,</b> and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the movie apart from the fact it was a low-budget melodrama shot {{outdoors}} to save on <b>studio</b> <b>costs.</b> The story included scenes at the Ascot racecourse in Melbourne, a fight on the brink of the Werribee Gorge, timber felling in the Dandenong Rangers, and an escape by the hero in an aeroplane at the Essendon Aerodrome.|$|R

5|$|Oddfellows is {{the fourth}} studio album by musical {{supergroup}} Tomahawk. The album {{is the first to}} feature new bass player Trevor Dunn, who has replaced previous member Kevin Rutmanis. Oddfellows was recorded live in the Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, after a brief period of rehearsal. Guitarist Duane Denison favored the location as its cheaper <b>studio</b> <b>costs</b> allowed for longer periods of song-writing.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} June 1984, The Sisters of Mercy {{went with}} {{producer}} Dave Allen into the Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, near Manchester, for five weeks to record their first <b>studio</b> album. <b>Studio</b> <b>costs</b> were £500 a day and £3,250 a week. Eldritch spent the whole five weeks inside the studio and, according to Dave Allen, used large amounts of amphetamine on a daily basis.|$|R

50|$|Haber {{established}} a band Sunrise in 1992 {{with his friend}} Jan Hohenthal. Hohenhthal left the band in 2002 as he wanted to focus on his solo career. In 2002 Haber changed the band name to Sunrise Avenue. Between 2002 and 2005 Haber visited 102 record companies and agents {{trying to find a}} label for Sunrise Avenue's music. The first album was made with financial help from Haber's friend Mikko Virtala, who sold his house to pay the <b>studio</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Social Distortion {{took part}} in the tour with Youth Brigade (as chronicled in the {{documentary}} Another State of Mind) and broke up shortly afterwards. However, because of the tour's success, the band reconciled not long afterward and decided to begin work on their first album. Mommy's Little Monster was recorded at The Casbah in Fullerton, California, on December 24, 1982. They recorded the album in a single session for numerous hours to cut down <b>studio</b> <b>costs,</b> which explains low budget production.|$|R
25|$|With {{previous}} album sessions, {{the band}} had always looked to maximise their labels resources, working with different producers and in expensive studios - but had always ended up {{coming back to}} Sapone. It was decided early on by the band that they would work with Sapone, using his studio. This would also allow the band to remain local to their homes while recording, and also allow them to spend their advance from the label on general living costs, as opposed to production and <b>studio</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The SP-1200 is {{strongly}} associated with hip hop's golden age. Its ability to construct the bulk of a song within one piece of portable gear, a first for the industry, reduced <b>studio</b> <b>costs</b> and increased creative control for hip-hop artists. In 2007, Ben Detrick explained, [...] "The machine rose to such prominence that its strengths and weaknesses sculpted an entire era of music: the crunchy digitized drums, choppy segmented samples, and murky filtered basslines that characterize the vintage New York sound are all mechanisms of the machine." ...|$|R
50|$|Independent label {{contracts}} typically resemble contracts {{offered by}} major labels {{because they have}} similar legal liabilities to define before representing an artist. There are differences, however, usually with regards to less advances, lower <b>studio</b> <b>costs,</b> lower royalties, but fewer album options. Due to financial constraints, independents typically spend much less on marketing and promotion than major labels. But with lower royalties rates typically paid to artists and lower production and promotion costs, independent labels generally can turn a profit off lower volumes of sales than a major label can.|$|R
500|$|Drummer John Stanier has {{described}} the band as [...] "the absolute simplest, most professional ensemble I have ever been involved with, by far". The band planned to meet and rehearse for a week before recording the album, but upon getting together again, Patton experienced {{a death in the}} family which resulted in him leaving for several days. The band eventually reconvened to rehearse for what Stanier recalls as [...] "a day and a half". Denison felt positively about the process of recording in Nashville, finding that the cheaper <b>studio</b> <b>costs</b> meant he could allow his compositions to [...] "gestate" [...] for longer during his writing process.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the band}} was trying to {{maintain}} their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound gave the album an experimental feel, causing critics to attack their musical integrity. According to John Densmore in his biography Riders On The Storm individual writing credits were noted {{for the first time}} because of Morrison's reluctance to sing the lyrics of Robby Krieger's song [...] "Tell All the People". Morrison's drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. <b>Studio</b> <b>costs</b> piled up, and the Doors came close to disintegrating. Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band's fourth hit album.|$|R
5000|$|Hays {{attempted}} to reduce <b>studio</b> <b>costs</b> (and improve the industry's image in general) by advising individual studios {{on how to}} produce movies to reduce {{the likelihood that the}} film would be cut. Each board kept its [...] "standards" [...] secret (if, indeed, they had any standardization at all), so Hays was forced to intuit what would or would not be permitted by each board. At first he applied what he called [...] "The Formula" [...] but it was not particularly successful; from that he developed a set of guidelines he called [...] "The Don'ts and Be Carefuls". In general his efforts at pre-release self-censorship were unsuccessful in quieting calls for federal censorship.|$|R
5000|$|The group {{recorded}} the single {{in their new}} high-tech <b>studio</b> (reportedly <b>costing</b> £2.5 million), that {{was built in the}} grounds of their family home, Stone Court, in Ascot, Berkshire. However, the single wasn't a commercial success and only reached #54 in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{relying on}} London <b>studios,</b> rising <b>costs</b> {{encouraged}} him to found the Mancunian Film Studios in his hometown in 1947, on £70,000 capital. The studios produced a sequence of profitable films, often on shoestring budgets, until Blakeley's retirement in 1953. He died in Stockport.|$|R
50|$|She donated {{some twenty}} pounds {{of her own}} red hair during a war scare about {{a year before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II. Munitions employed the use of some fine human hair. The hair was received by the Max Factor <b>studios.</b> It <b>cost</b> $17 an ounce in twenty-two inch lengths.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{the band}} was signed to Slash/Warner Bros and {{traveled}} to Los Angeles to begin work on their debut record shortly thereafter. The album was recorded at Sunset Sound with T-Bone Burnett along with engineers David Tickle and Tchad Blake. Due to his in-demand role as a producer, Burnett was often absent {{for days at a}} time during tracking and would return to check the band's progress and give direction. There was some tension during the sessions over how elaborate the production should be. Burnett believed that some of the band's ideas did not fit the simplicity of their songs. In addition, {{the band was}} running up high <b>studio</b> <b>costs</b> and was forced to complete the album before they felt it was finished. Despite this, the band was happy with the album and it has often been regarded as their finest work.|$|R
50|$|The band {{released}} its sixth <b>studio</b> album, The <b>Cost,</b> on 22 September 2006. They {{appeared on the}} setlist at Lollapalooza 2006 just 12 days afterward.|$|R
50|$|Many {{independent}} American {{television production}} companies shot their series outside the United States in the 1950s. Not only did this give audiences {{a chance to}} see new locations not shot in a <b>studio</b> but <b>costs</b> were much cheaper, especially as these runaway productions did not have to pay residuals or pay American film union wages.|$|R
50|$|End of the Century is a 1996 album by Wisconsin {{punk rock}} band, Boris the Sprinkler, which covers the fifth album by the Ramones in its entirety. It was {{recorded}} for under $500 in bassist Eric No. 2's basement <b>studio,</b> a <b>cost</b> {{of less than}} one-half {{of one percent of}} the recording cost of the original album.|$|R
50|$|Because of the record's high {{recording}} {{budget of}} $800,000, {{there were many}} worries {{about whether or not}} the album would be successful, and the album almost had to top charts internationally just to break even with <b>studio</b> <b>costs.</b> Break the Cycle debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of at least 716,000 copies. It remained at the top the following week with 329,299 copies. In the third week it was number one again with 244,698 copies. In the fourth week it dropped to number 2 with 221,179 copies. It sold over 1,000,000 copies in the first 3 weeks. As of June 2006, it sold 5,467,000 copies in the U.S. alone. Break the Cycle also topped the UK charts, where it was certified platinum, in New Zealand and in Canada, where it had the multi-platinum status. The world sales are around 8 million copies.|$|R
5000|$|According to an {{interview}} with Novaleaf Game <b>Studios,</b> the game <b>cost</b> $100,000 USD [...] to make, higher than other XBLIG games. A PC-version was released in March 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Fragile {{is formed}} of nine tracks; four are [...] "group {{arranged}} and performed" [...] {{with the remaining}} five being [...] "the individual ideas, personally arranged and organised" [...] by the five members. Squire reasoned this approach was necessary in part to save time and reduce <b>studio</b> <b>costs,</b> as money was used to purchase keyboard equipment for Wakeman. According to Bruford: [...] "There was this endless discussion about how the band could be used ... I felt we could use all five musicians differently ... So I said—brightly—'Why don't we do some individual things, whereby we all use the group for our own musical fantasy? I'll be the director, conductor, and maestro for the day, then you do your track, and so on.'" [...] Wakeman commented on the album's structure. [...] "Some critics thought this was just being flash. The thinking behind this was that we realised {{there would be a}} lot of new listeners coming to the band. They could find out where each individual player's contribution lay." ...|$|R
