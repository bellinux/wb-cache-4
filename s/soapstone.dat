5|$|When the Vijayanagara Empire was {{in power}} in the 15th and 16th centuries, its {{workshops}} preferred granite over <b>soapstone</b> as the building material for temples. However, an archaeological discovery within the royal center at Vijayanagara has revealed the use of <b>soapstone</b> for stepped wells. These stepped wells are fashioned entirely of finely finished <b>soapstone</b> arranged symmetrically, with steps and landings descending to the water on four sides. This design shows strong affinities to the temple tanks of the Western Chalukya–Hoysala period.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, temple {{projects}} began employing <b>soapstone,</b> {{a form of}} greenish or blueish black stone, although temples such as the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi, the Kallesvara Temple at Kuknur, and {{the temples}} at Konnur and Savadi were built with the formerly traditional sandstone in the dravida articulation.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of <b>soapstone</b> and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on <b>soapstone</b> shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

5000|$|The Janesville Caloric Company factory existed from 1908 to 1924. It {{manufactured}} the Caloric Cooker, a “fireless cook stove” and {{precursor to}} modern day slow cookers. The company operated {{out of an}} old furniture factory. The Caloric Cooker consisted of an insulated cabinet {{with one or more}} deep wells fitted with <b>soapstones</b> on the top and on the bottom. After the stones were heated and the food was put into the wells; one stone was placed at the top and the bottom of the stove. You could close the lid and the meal would be cooked without danger of its burning. About 150 men were employed by this company when it was in full production. The cookers sold for $8.50 - $15, depending on the number of wells, and came with a 160-page book on how to use it. The company moved operations to Pennsylvania in 1924. In the 1960s, the Caloric Company launched the iconic ad slogan “Now you’re cooking with gas.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasing}} worldwide {{demand for the}} sculptures, as yet little of what McEwen feared might just be an [...] "airport art" [...] style of commercialisation has occurred. The most dedicated of artists display {{a high degree of}} integrity, never copying and still working entirely by hand, with spontaneity and a confidence in their skills, unrestricted by externally imposed ideas of what their [...] "art" [...] should be. Now, over fifty years on from the first tentative steps towards a new sculptural tradition, many Zimbabwean artists make their living from full-time sculpting and the very best can stand comparison with contemporary sculptors anywhere else. The sculpture they produce speaks of fundamental human experiences - experiences such as grief, elation, humour, anxiety and spiritual search - and has always managed to communicate these in a profoundly simple and direct way that is both rare and extremely refreshing. The artist 'works' together with his stone and it is believed that 'nothing which exists naturally is inanimate'- it has a spirit and life of its own. One is always aware of the stone's contribution in the finished sculpture and it is indeed fortunate that in Zimbabwe a magnificent range of stones are available from which to choose: hard black springstone, richly coloured serpentine and <b>soapstones,</b> firm grey limestone and semi-precious Verdite and Lepidolite.|$|R
5|$|Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in {{the form}} of {{ceremonial}} axe representing clan's strength and power. These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou. The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished with stones and shells. The axe is polished smooth like a disc. Carvings made of <b>soapstone</b> are also popular.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used <b>soapstone</b> almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala temples have {{distinct}} {{parts that}} are merged {{to form a}} unified organic whole, {{in contrast to the}} temples of Tamil country where different parts of a temple stand independently. Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft <b>soapstone</b> (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.|$|E
5000|$|In {{furnishing}} {{their homes}} they kept {{everything in the}} center of the huge rooms, leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment. Lighting, in the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably electro-chemical in nature. Both on land and under water they used curious tables, chairs and couches like cylindrical frames - for they rested and slept upright with folded-down tentacles - and racks for hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming their books.Government was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw. There was extensive commerce, both local and between different cities - certain small, flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money. Probably the smaller of the various greenish <b>soapstones</b> found by our expedition were pieces of such currency. Though the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock raising existed. Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the race expanded. For personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air, and water movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of burden - Shoggoths under the sea, and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land existence. - H.P.

5000|$|Th {{reign of}} the Hoysala Empire {{occurred}} between the 10th and 14th centuries over the western region of Karnataka. Many temples were built with chlorite stones or <b>soapstones</b> and the architecture which evolved was called the Hoysala architecture, known for architectural detailing. The unique features of this style comprise a central hall linked to three star shaped shrines, and the temple towers are laid in horizontal tiers. Dorasamudra, known as Halebid, was the dynastic capital. Hoysaleswara Temple {{is dedicated to the}} Hindu god Shiva as the family deity of the Hoysalas. Bittiga, the ruler of the Hoysala empire, converted from Jainism to Hinduism. He was given the name Vishnuvardhana by Ramanuja, one of the three eminent social reformers and religious heads of Hinduism who consecrated the Hoysaleswara Temple built in 1121. Dedicated to Shiva, it has two sanctum sanctorums and the deities are in the form of lingas named Hoysaleshvara and Shantaleshvara, after the king and queen. Built over a period of 70 years, it was left incomplete. It has an enormous Nandi, the mount of Shiva. There is a small Surya (Sun god) temple behind the sanctorum deified with a Surya (Sun) image which is 2 m in height. The walls of the temple have been carved with scenes of Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita epics; they are crafted on the external and internal walls, with Yabancharya named as the architect. The town was ravaged by Muslim invaders in 1327.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Maevatanana {{deposits}} {{consist of}} gold-bearing quartz–sulphide veins crosscutting banded iron formation (BIF) within a metamorphosed 2. 5 Ga greenstone belt. The host rocks {{are dominated by}} a sequence of migmatites, gneisses, amphibolites, magnetite-rich quartzites and <b>soapstones,</b> intruded by large granitoid batholiths (e. g. the 0. 8 Ga Beanana granodiorite). In the mineralised rocks, pyrite is the dominant sulphide, in addition to accessory chalcopyrite and galena. Outside the immediate ore zone, the BIF is dominated by quartz + magnetite ± hematite, accompanied by cummingtonite, albite and biotite. Gold occurs as globular grains (usually < 500 μm) within quartz crystals close to the sulphides and as invisible inclusions within pyrite and chalcopyrite (up to 2, 500 ppm Au content). Fluid inclusion textural and microthermometric studies indicate heterogeneous trapping of a low-salinity (∼ 3. 6 wt. % eq. NaCl) aqueous fluid coexisting with a carbonic fluid. Evidence for fluid-phase immiscibility during ore formation includes variable L/V ratios in the inclusions {{and the fact that}} inclusions containing different phase proportions occur in the same area, growth zone, or plane. Laser Raman spectroscopy confirms that the vapour phase in these inclusions is dominated by CO 2 but shows that it may contain small amounts of CH 4 (< 1 mol%), H 2 S (< 0. 05 mol%) and traces of N 2. Fluid inclusion trapping conditions ranged from 220 to 380 °C and averaged 250 °C. Pressure was on the order of 1 – 2 kbar. The abundant CO 2 and low salinity of the inclusions suggest a metamorphic origin for the fluid. Likewise, the presence of H 2 S in the fluid and pyritisation of the wall-rock indicate that gold was likely transported by sulphide complexing. Fluid immiscibility was probably triggered by the pressure released by fracturing of the quartzites during fault movements due to competence differences with the softer greenstones. Fracturing greatly enhanced fluid circulation through the BIF, allowing reaction of the sulphide-bearing fluids with the iron oxides. This caused pyrite deposition and concomitant Au precipitation, enhanced by fluid phase separation as H 2 S partitioned preferentially into the carbonic phase...|$|R
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (<b>Soapstone)</b> enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{districts of}} the Western Ghats and the {{southern}} districts of the state have popular eco-tourism locations including Kudremukh, Madikeri and Agumbe. Karnataka has 25 wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks. Popular among them are Bandipur National Park, Bannerghatta National Park and Nagarhole National Park. The ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi and the monuments of Pattadakal are {{on the list of}} UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. The cave temples at Badami and the rock-cut temples at Aihole representing the Badami Chalukyan style of architecture are also popular tourist destinations. The Hoysala temples at Belur and Halebidu, which were built with Chloritic schist (<b>soapstone)</b> are proposed UNESCO World Heritage sites. The Gol Gumbaz and Ibrahim Rauza are famous examples of the Deccan Sultanate style of architecture.

5|$|The stellate plan found {{popularity}} in the <b>soapstone</b> constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, {{with the exception of}} the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees. The upper tiers of the seven-tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents. The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at Lakshmeshwara are examples of extreme variants of a basic dravida articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods.|$|E
40|$|The Scandinavian Caledonides {{have been}} long studied, yet their ever {{unfolding}} complexity renders them {{far from being}} fully understood. It has been recognized that the Caledonian Allochthons have neither a linear nor straightforward along-strike relationship. A mélange unit has been recently identified as a separate tectonic unit. This unit is structurally positioned below crystalline nappes previously assigned to the Middle Allochthon. The mélange comprises meta-sediments and minor meta-basalt/gabbro, but most intriguingly, numerous solitary meta-peridotites. These occur as Alpine type meta-peridotites, serpentinites, <b>soapstones</b> and detrital serpentinites. This thesis presents results of a field study of the mélange in the Bøverdalen area structurally below the Jotun nappe, and suggests that this provides evidence that the regional mélange unit was formed in a hyperextended passive margin. The meta-peridotites represent exhumed serpentinized mantle and are intimately associated with meta-sediments. The sediments are garnetiferous chlorite-muscovite schists, graphitic schists, phyllites, amphibolites, meta-sandstones as well as quartzite-pebble dominated conglomerates. It is suggested that this highly heterogeneous mélange unit formed {{during the early stages}} of rifting and hyperextension along the Baltican passive margin. Characteristics of the detrital peridotites suggests that serpentinite-talc protrusions may have formed islands. The processes involved are observed in modern margins where the best-studied example is the Iberia-Newfoundland passive margin. Work in present-day margins (mostly seismic reflection data) elucidate the large-scale structure of hyperextended margins, while studies of ancient exposed examples in mountain belts provide insight into the lithology, geochemistry and details of these margins. The widespread distribution of hyperextended margins in modern margins and the increasing number of recognizable ancient margins in mountain-belts indicates the importance of hyperextension during {{the early stages of the}} Wilson cycle. Samples collected from the melange unit in the Samnanger area (Bergen) have been dated using U-Pb data from ID-TIMS (isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry) analysis of zircon and rutile. These yielded two age groups, ~ 420 Ma and ~ 476. 23 - 487 Ma, however, both of these bodies are thought to represent intrusive activity post-dating the development of the mélange. Tectonic reconstructions that account for such complexity may not only explain the origin of peridotite bearing mélange units, they may also aid the understanding of the exotic terranes identified in the Scandinavian Caledonides...|$|R
5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} the lathe turned (tuned) pillars and use of <b>Soapstone</b> (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
5|$|According to Settar, {{surveys in}} modern times have {{indicated}} that 1000–1500 structures were built by the Hoysalas, of which about a hundred temples have survived to date. The Hoysala style is {{an offshoot of the}} Western Chalukya style, which was popular in the 10th and 11th centuries. It is distinctively Dravidian, and according to Brown, owing to its features, Hoysala architecture qualifies as an independent style. While the Hoysalas introduced innovative features into their architecture, they also borrowed features from earlier builders of Karnata like the Kadambas, Western Chalukyas. These features included the use of chloritic schist or <b>soapstone</b> as a basic building material. Other features were the stepped style of vimana tower called the Kadamba shikhara, which was inherited from the Kadambas. Hoysala sculptors made use of the effect of light and shade on carved walls, which poses a challenge for photography of the temples. The artistry of the Hoysalas in stone has been compared to the finesse of an ivory worker or a goldsmith. The abundance of jewellery worn by the sculpted figures and the variety of hairstyles and headdresses depicted give a fair idea of the lifestyles of the Hoysala times.|$|E
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, <b>soapstone</b> and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} island {{groups of}} Miyako and Yaeyama {{are known for}} their peculiar archaeological development: a pottery culture was followed by a potteryless culture and then by another pottery culture. Kamuiyaki, together with white glazed wares, <b>soapstone</b> cauldrons and brown glazed wares, were found at the Ōdomaribama Site (circa 12th century) of Hateruma, the Yaeyama Islands, which Okinawan archaeologists consider represents the final stage of the potteryless culture. The Sumiya Site of Miyako Island has kamuiyaki and <b>soapstone</b> cauldrons but no white glazed ware. Kamuiyaki were excavated more often in Miyako than in Yaeyama.|$|E
25|$|Inuit {{industry}} relied {{almost exclusively}} on animal hides, driftwood, and bones, although some tools were also made out of worked stones, particularly the readily worked <b>soapstone.</b> Walrus ivory was a particularly essential material, used to make knives. Art played {{a big part in}} Inuit society and continues to do so today. Small sculptures of animals and human figures, usually depicting everyday activities such as hunting and whaling, were carved from ivory and bone. In modern times prints and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as <b>soapstone,</b> serpentinite, or argillite have also become popular.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} artefacts {{recovered from the}} Monument are the eight Zimbabwe Birds.

25|$|Populations in the African Great Lakes are {{not known}} for their sculpture. However, one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and {{decorated}} with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects.

The culture known from Great Zimbabwe left more impressive buildings than sculpture but the eight <b>soapstone</b> Zimbabwe Birds appear {{to have had a}} special significance and were mounted on monoliths. Modern Zimbabwean sculptors in <b>soapstone</b> have achieved considerable international success. Southern Africa’s oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} that the Etruscans preceded the Greeks in their awareness of {{at least some of the}} regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery near Padua (in Northern Italy) in the late 19th century of a dodecahedron made of <b>soapstone,</b> and dating back more than 2,500 years (Lindemann, 1987).|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the combination of kamuiyaki, <b>soapstone</b> cauldrons and white glazed wares, Miyako and Yaeyama departed from a distinct potteryless culture and entered a pottery culture, which is sometimes known as the Suku Culture.
