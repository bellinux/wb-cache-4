40|$|Firms are key actors {{interfering with}} the {{negotiations}} of international environmental agreements. However, their ability to engage in collective lobbying via the establishment of business transnational coalitions has received little attention so far. In order to fill this gap, this article conducts a micro–macro analysis of corporate lobbying during the negotiations <b>of</b> two <b>sub-agreements</b> <b>of</b> the Convention on Biological Diversity. In particular, it scrutinises the degree of transnationalisation of two senior business lobby coalitions in these negotiations: the Global Industry Coalition and the International Chamber of Commerce. In contrast to former studies of business lobbying on environmental agreements, the analysis stresses the variety of business interests represented in international negotiations and underlines the bargaining processes taking place inside each transnational business coalition. Transnational business lobby coalitions are found useful for business networking activities, either as tactical tools or as information platforms. Yet corporate lobbying efforts are still conducted predominantly on an individual basis. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Alfred Chandler, in Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism (1990), {{suggests}} that the acquisition of targets is an alternative to direct investment {{in research and development}} (R&D). Chandler {{suggests that}} the failure of accounting to recognize investment in R&D as an asset may have made R&D less attractive. This study focuses on the relationship between investment in R&D and capital expenditures and a set of partitions based on Chandler's three technology types ("hightech," "stable-tech," and "low-tech") and three possible merger activity classes (acquirer next year, target next year, and neither acquirer nor target next year). Chi-square contingency tables are used to test the independence of merger class and technology type, a frequency test. Regression is used to test the relationship between R&D and sales and between capital expenditures and sales, with the sample partitioned by technology type and by merger class in a 3 -by- 3 research design. The sample is 23, 146 firm years from 1974 - 1988 for 2, 659 firms categorized into industry groups based on Chandler's criteria. The financial data are from COMPUSTAT data files. The frequency of being an acquirer is the same for high-tech and stable-tech firms (11. 2 versus 11. 5 percent of firm years) and higher for low-tech firms (13. 9 percent of firm years). High-tech firms that are acquirers next year have 79 % lower investment in R&D (. 044 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus. 056 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> and 77 % lower investment in capital expenditures (. 071 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus. 092 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> than "high-tech" firms that are neither acquirers nor targets next year ("baseline" firms) as measured by the estimated slope coefficient in regression.
