5000|$|The {{notions of}} culture, power and gender/subject {{formation}} that dominate Bordo’s writing arise in some degree from poststructuralist thought. Susan Hekman {{points out that}} “like {{an increasing number of}} contemporary feminist theorists Bordo argues for a selective use of postmodern theories” and one way Bordo’s work can be seen in a poststructuralist/postmodernist light is through her usage of Foucauldian methodology. Bordo appropriates the ideas of Michel Foucault in critiquing, analyzing and bringing to light “the normative feminine practices of our culture”. As Bordo points out, Foucault saw power not “as the possession of individuals or groups” but “as a dynamic or network of non-centralized forces”, and such a depiction of power relations is therefore useful in a critique of gender formation/regulation. If, in a Foucauldian sense, power works from below, then “prevailing forms of selfhood and subjectivity (gender among them) are maintained, not chiefly through physical restraint and coercion (although social relations may certainly contain such elements), but through individual <b>self-surveillance</b> and self-correction to norms”. Foucault’s theories of power and discipline along with theories on sexuality serve contemporary feminist aims in revealing how cultural normative practices, expressed through popular media, work to influence femininity (and gendered bodies in general) into homogeneity {{while at the same time}} seeming freely chosen. “Like Foucault, Bordo focuses on the discourses through which society produces, understands, defines, and interprets the female body.” ...|$|E

In 2000, he completed the low-budget comic/horror fiction film Frankenstein's Little Monster, a re-visioning of Mary Shelley's novel focusing on the monster's frenzied sexual desires and eventual spiritual awakening. It included Beat Generation poet Peter Orlovsky {{in the role of}} Hindu holyman Rick Shaw. The documentary La Hamburguesa Magica (2003) presents a plagued and near-fatal Mexico misadventure undertaken by Israel and then-girlfriend Elyse Allen.

He buys her a <b>self-surveillance</b> device called a Wasp, a flying drone designed to record her life which she retains after his death. When the unnamed narrator meets and marries her, she has adjusted to the Wasp {{as a part of}} her life despite considering it unnecessary. The two enjoy many happy excursions, especially alpine skiing before separating. The narrator is separated from, yet on good terms with Georgie when he hears she has died. After her death, Georgie's recorded life is downloaded into a system called The Park, a type of digital cemetery in which her memories can be accessed by loved ones after her death. The narrator visits Georgie's [...] "memories" [...] but finds them distant, covering mostly memories he does not remember or care for and only accessible at random, with no organization allowing him to specify memories. Annoyed, the narrator queries the director, who explains that due to legal interests, recordings are required to be random to avoid legal vulnerability or screening and deleting of memories considered legal evidence. Based on this decision, developers of the technology based their memory systems [...] "on the molecular level", yielding both extremely economic storage, but leaving access random. The narrator returns, accessing videos of Georgie alone, before and after his time with her. Noticing that the video appears to lose clarity, the narrator returns to the director, who informs him that over time, a small amount of degradation will happen to video quality. Returning later, the narrator finds even more degradation, resulting in video snow. The director, at this point, explains that he has explained the most he knows about loss of quality, and that other Park users have had similar problems. He relates the story as well, that his previous job working at a stock footage warehouse yielded the opposite set of complaints; producers frequently requested stock image of scenes from everyday life, and such footage could almost never be found. At The Park, often users only want access to significant memories, but are faced with far more footage of scenes from everyday life.Much later, the narrator reveals he no longer uses The Park, and reflects on the nature of memory. While he can almost never remember specific details of significant memories, he finds himself very sharply [...] "sleepwalking" [...] into memories. He finds his memories of Georgie that most affect him, especially as he ages, are those that come naturally to him, which do not age either in his memory, unlike those artificially recorded.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{a sample}} of low-income African American and Latina girls, {{the goal of the}} present {{investigation}} was to examine the relevance of self-objectification and <b>self-surveillance</b> to body dissatisfaction and self-worth. Body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and perceived athletic competence were examined as moderators of these relations. Participants were 10 - to 14 -year-old African American and Latina girls recruited from a summer camp targeting low-income, urban girls. Surveys that include measures of self-objectification, <b>self-surveillance,</b> body dissatisfaction, self-worth, and perceived athletic competence were individually administered to participants by a research assistant. Height and weight were measured to calculate BMI. Ethnicity information was obtained from surveys completed by parents. Results indicated that self-objectification and <b>self-surveillance</b> were related, and older girls reported higher levels of each. No main effects of self-objectification were found, however, higher levels of <b>self-surveillance</b> were associated with lower self-worth. Among African American girls with higher BMI, self-objectification was associated with less body dissatisfaction. Among Latina girls with higher perceived athletic competence, higher self-objectification was associated with lower self-worth. Findings indicate that self-objectification and <b>self-surveillance</b> are indeed experienced by low-income, ethnic minority girls and increase across the transition to adolescence. <b>Self-surveillance</b> may be particularly important to address in interventions targeting self-worth of ethnic minority girls. Finally, results suggest the importance of ethnicity, BMI, and perceived athletic competence in understanding how self-objectification and <b>self-surveillance</b> relate to well-being among ethnic minority girls...|$|E

One hundred predominantlyWhite, British undergraduate women completed self-report measures of impression management, global selfesteem, interpersonal sexual objectification, <b>self-surveillance,</b> body shame, and three components of cosmetic surgery attitudes.

40|$|It {{has become}} cliché {{to observe that}} new {{information}} technologies endanger privacy. Typically, the threat is viewed as coming from Big Brother (the government) or Company Man (the firm). But for a nascent data practice we call “self-surveillance,” the threat may actually come from ourselves. Using various existing and emerging technologies, such as GPS-enabled smartphones, {{we are beginning to}} measure ourselves in granular detail – how long we sleep, where we drive, what we breathe, what we eat, how we spend our time. And we are storing these data casually, perhaps promiscuously, somewhere in the “cloud,” and giving third-parties broad access. This data practice of <b>self-surveillance</b> will decrease information privacy in troubling ways. To counter this trend, we recommend the creation of the Privacy Data Guardian, a new profession that manages Privacy Data Vaults, which are repositories for <b>self-surveillance</b> data. In addition to providing technical specifications of this approach, we outline the specific legal relations, which include a fiduciary relationship, between client and Guardian. In addition, we recommend the creation of an evidentiary privilege, similar to a trade secret privilege, that protects <b>self-surveillance</b> data held by a licensed Guardian. We also answers objections that our solution is implausible or useless.

Before <b>self-surveillance</b> becomes a widespread practice, some new innovation is needed. In our view, that innovation is a new “species,” the Personal Data Guardian, created through a fusion of law and technology and released into the current information ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} body guilt (i. e., feeling regret and remorse {{over how}} the body looks and a desire for reparative action to “fix” the body) {{within the framework of}} objectification theory among predominantly White British undergraduate women. In Study 1 (N = 225), participants completed self-report measures of interpersonal sexual objectification, <b>self-surveillance,</b> body shame, body guilt, and eating restraint. Path analyses indicated support for the inclusion of body guilt in the objectification model, with body shame and body guilt fully mediating the relationship between <b>self-surveillance</b> and eating restraint. In Study 2 (N = 85), participants reported higher body guilt, <b>self-surveillance,</b> body shame, and eating restraint when self-objectification was situationally activated, compared to the activation of body empowerment or a neutral condition. Path analyses in the second study replicated the objectification model from Study 1 with a state measure of self-objectification. These findings suggest that women also feel guilt (in addition to shame) about their bodies when attention is directed toward their physical appearance and wish to “correct” their body via disordered eating. Acknowledging women’s feelings of guilt in relation to not meeting restrictive beauty standards furthers our understanding of women’s experience of objectification and provides an additional target for reducing women’s mental health risks...|$|E

In addition, following exposure to benevolent sexism only, women planned more future behaviors pertaining to appearance management than did men; this effect was mediated by <b>self-surveillance</b> and body shame.

40|$|Personalization {{services}} are developing in England {{as a social}} policy response to user demands for more tailored, effective and flexible forms of health and social care support.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has documented that self-objectification {{is associated with}} numerous negative outcomes including body shame, eating disorder (ED) pathology, and negative affect. This exploratory open study investigated whether or not an evidence-based body image improvement program that targets thin-ideal internalization in university women also reduces self-objectification. A second aim {{of the study was}} to determine if previous findings showing that body shame mediated the relationship between self-objectification and eating disorder pathology at a single time point (consistent with self-objectification theory) but did not mediate longitudinally (inconsistent with self-objectification theory) would be replicated in a new sample under novel conditions. Methods: Ninety-six university women completed a peer-led dissonance-based intervention, along with assessment measures at pre-, post-intervention, 8 -week and 8 -month follow-up. To address the open trial nature of this study, a planned manipulation check was included to make sure that peer-led dissonance decreased thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, eating disorder pathology, and negative affect with effect sizes being similar to past randomized controlled trials. We hypothesized that all three subscales of the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (i. e., <b>self-surveillance,</b> body shame, and appearance control beliefs) would be reduced. In addition, we hypothesized that body shame would mediate the relationship between self-objectification (i. e., <b>self-surveillance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Michel Foucault {{described}} self-policing as {{the modern}} replacement for external, authoritarian, methods of surveillance and social regulation. Today, discipline is instilled within, and punishment, if we waver from the norm, self-induced. This paper identifies self-policing practices {{in relation to}} the experience and construction of ‘premenstrual syndrome ’ (PMS). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 36 British and 34 Australian women, it is argued that women’s experience of distress or anger premenstrually, their positioning of this experience as pathology, and their self-positioning as a ‘PMS sufferer’, is connected to the self-policing practices of self-silencing, <b>self-surveillance,</b> over-responsibility, self-blame, and self-sacrifice. This is closely associated with hegemonic constructions of idealized femininity: the positioning of women as emotional nurturers of others, necessitating self-renunciation; the juxtaposition of the ‘good ’ and ‘bad ’ woman; and the positioning of woman as closer to nature, with subjectivity tied to the body. Premenstrually, a rupture in self-silencing occurs, yet this is followed by increased <b>self-surveillance,</b> leading to guilt, shame, and blaming of the body. Identifying self-policing practices allows women to develop more empowering strategies for reducing or preventing premenstrual distress, developing an ethic of care for the self, and no longer blaming the body for premenstrual anger or depression...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effect that modern <b>self-surveillance</b> {{technologies}} have on subjectivity {{and the ways in}} which bodies are regulated by modern institutional power, while addressing several branches of existing scholarship and criticism on this subject matter. First, a brief overview of a very recent <b>self-surveillance</b> movement (the Quantified Self) is provided, then situated in relation to selected moments of key evolutions in the history of self-tracking practices. In so doing, this thesis charts the increasing formalization of methodology and focus on physicality that has produced modern data-based approaches, while arguing that these new forms in fact create more agency and autonomy for individual users. In the process, however, these new practice also create a new type of subjectivity: the algorithmic body, which utilizes data gathered about individuals to compile digital representations of them. These ?data doubles,? the thesis shows, are increasingly becoming a requirement of participation in modern society, as evidenced by their important role that they have played in recent years in legal cases and insurance programs. Finally, the thesis closes by showing that the algorithmic body is increasingly becoming favored over the physical one, which creates a situation in which modern subjectivity is increasingly focused on the curation of one?s data?a data that makes one?s self knowable to the self, but also more portable and easily knowable to others, which allows for far more subtle degrees of influence and control (which are in fact direct extensions of Michel Foucault?s conceptions of institutional power) ...|$|E

40|$|Genetic medical {{technologies}} {{have increased the}} possibilities for detecting future illness in those who appear healthy and asymptomatic. These developments broaden the scope of medicine, complicating distinctions between health, illness and disease. Genetic counselling practice extends health promotion seeking to 'inform' individuals of their own risks {{so that they can}} minimise possible negative implications for their own lives (Lupton 1995). An extension of disease prevention has been associated with a shift in health such that health is no longer a given but has to be achieved by individuals. While post-structuralist accounts have positioned health promotion as part of an increasing <b>self-surveillance</b> of health, they have rarely based these accounts on empirical studies of individuals' experiences. This paper explores how 'early' diagnosis positions people as 'at-risk'. Findings inform narratives of social change centred on the individualisation of health, the extension of <b>self-surveillance</b> and the blurring of boundaries between health and disease. Narrative accounts from interviews and observations of clinical consultations with 18 adults who had been told that they had inherited a late onset, degenerative kidney disease (Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease) are used to explore how individuals discursively achieve health and appropriate health protection. This analysis challenges the idea that knowledge of genetic aetiology will reduce individual responsibility for health. Rather than a grand shift to a continuum of health and the disappearance of 'old' binaries, these participants appear to use the health/disease dualism to re-position themselves with respect to risk on a moment-by-moment basis.

40|$|Self-objectification is {{the process}} by which women take on a third-person {{perspective}} in evaluating their physical appearance and sexual attributes. Objectification theory states that self-objectification may lead to negative mental health outcomes in women; a growing body of cross-sectional and experimental research supports the connection between self-objectification and the experience of shame, disordered eating, depression, and sexual dysfunction. This study sought to evaluate an intervention designed to reduce self-objectification behaviors and beliefs in order to prevent the development of disordered eating, depression, and sexual dysfunction. An efficacious prevention program using cognitive dissonance induction was adapted to target self-objectification. The efficacy of the self-objectification dissonance intervention was evaluated in comparison to an expressive writing control condition. The self-objectification intervention was also compared to an existing empirically supported cognitive dissonance intervention targeting beliefs regarding the thin-ideal {{to determine whether or not}} this intervention provided added benefits in reducing risk factors for disordered eating and depression. A sample of 119 undergraduate females was recruited to participate in the study. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: the self-objectification dissonance intervention, the thin-ideal dissonance intervention, or the expressive writing control group. All participants completed a baseline assessment and two intervention sessions over a three week period. One month following the completion of the second intervention session, participants were asked to complete a follow up assessment. Change in target outcome variables from baseline to post-intervention were evaluated using hierarchical linear models. Maintenance of treatment outcomes from post-intervention to 1 month follow up was evaluated using mixed factor analysis of variance. Results indicated that significant changes in outcome variables (body shame, disordered eating, body satisfaction, depression symptoms, and sexual self-consciousness) and mediating variables (<b>self-surveillance,</b> self-objectification, thin-ideal internalization) were associated with all three groups. The self-objectification dissonance intervention was associated with a greater reduction in <b>self-surveillance</b> compared to the control group but not with the thin-ideal dissonance intervention. For all groups, there were no significant changes in outcome and mediating variables from post-intervention to 1 month follow up. Participants in the self-objectification dissonance intervention, though, did continue to experience a decrease in <b>self-surveillance</b> over the one month follow up period compared to the thin-ideal dissonance group. Overall, results did not support that a self-objectification dissonance intervention is associated with significant reductions in eating disorder and depression risk factors above and beyond a general expressive writing task and existing intervention programs.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{a review}} of {{scholarly}} articles about the concept of empowerment, the author argues {{that the idea of}} empowerment has been deployed in three main ways.

The second conceptualises empowerment as a technique of governance, a way of disciplining modern citizens into a regime of <b>self-surveillance.</b> The third identifies empowerment, divorced amongst educationalists from wider social and political movements, as a distraction, which dissipates the potential for real educational change.

In this paper a backside polishing detector is presented that is sensitive to the thickness of the bulk silicon existing below the transistors, a numerical signature is generated which is related to this. The detector implements built-in <b>self-surveillance</b> techniques which protect it from being tampered. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the natural}} and civilized worlds {{establish}} a context within which I may understand my own existence. My search for “self” and the emotive qualities of life within these contexts provides the impetus for my work. I create juxtapositions: from found art assemblages to, more recently, intimate experiences in public park environments. Within these curated experiences I challenge myself {{to open up to}} unknown experiences derived from my relationship to the landscape and the life forms found within. My videos are a kind of <b>self-surveillance</b> fostering absurdly promiscuous behavior when I am alone, in front of a camera. These conjured “secret acts” appear to exist within a realm of magic, science fiction or spirituality. They are sincere attempts at socialization, which more accurately convey the ineffective, naive and pathetic tenderness of a rookie’s efforts...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{education}} in the UK has undergone profound and rapid change in the past 20 years. Policy initiatives aimed at the sector have led to research investigating impacts upon the participation and exclusion of potential student groups. In addition, employment conditions for academic staff have come under scrutiny. This article investigates the ambiguous position of the academic from a working class background, {{particularly in light of}} these policy changes. It makes use of Bourdieu's conceptual schema to understand the multi-dimensional nature of class position and corresponding mental structures. Techniques of external audit and <b>self-surveillance</b> are also investigated in relation to their differential impact upon groups of academic staff. Finally, a plea is made for more detailed empirical work which places class at the centre of the analysis in UK higher education...|$|E
