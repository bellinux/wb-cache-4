5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the <b>Solarium</b> Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|The bailey was {{designed}} to include a number of spacious domestic buildings. These include a great hall, a <b>solarium,</b> kitchen, buttery and pantry, with a luxuriously large number of gardrobes and fireplaces. The large towers provided additional accommodation. The design of the domestic buildings was skilfully interlocked to support the defensive arrangements of the bailey. The great hall for example, , {{was placed in the}} strongest position overlooking the river Wye, allowing it to benefit from multiple large windows and a huge fireplace without sacrificing defensive strength. Water for the castle was originally raised from the courtyard well, but was later piped in from a spring across the valley; the castle kitchens had acquired running water {{by the beginning of the}} 17th century. The design of the buildings ensured that the servants and nobility were able to live separately from one another in the confined space of the castle, revolutionary at the time.|$|E

Tanning has been a phenomenon since the 1800s, with medical use of phototherapy, emerging popularity of sunbathing, and in the 1970s, with tanning salons and <b>solariums</b> becoming increasingly popular, had developed into a worldwide tanning industry. Although the tanning industry in Australia is relatively small by international standards, it has quadrupled in size since 1992. The tanning industry promotes tanning as a process to stimulate higher levels of vitamin D, associating it with reduced likelihood of sunburn and skin cancer, with increased well being and feelings of happiness.|$|R

25|$|After the {{remainder}} of Riis Park was relinquished by the Navy, in fall 1930 Queens Parks Commissioner Albert C. Benninger proposed {{the construction of a}} bathing pavilion at Jacob Riis Park. Benninger had been inspired by the design of the bathhouse at Jones Beach State Park, completed in August 1929 by then-Long Island Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. Prior to this, beach-goers were forced to change their clothes in their cars. The designs were prepared by architect John L. Plock in November 1930. The project was approved by the mayor's office in February 1931. The foundation of the building was completed in August 1931. Contracts were let for building construction in September 1931. Later that month, Benninger requested an additional $105,000 for the project from the New York City Board of Estimate, on top of the initial $425,000 appropriated. Construction began on November 23, 1931. The bathhouse was opened on August 6, 1932. At the time, it was only 60 percent completed. Additional work was completed in May 1933, including lockers, the restaurant, and the <b>solarium.</b> The <b>solarium</b> was expected to be the largest in the world at the time. A seawall running in front of the bathhouse along the beach and parking facilities for 5,000 cars were also completed by 1933.|$|E
