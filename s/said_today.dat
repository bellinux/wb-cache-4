500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I {{just thought it was}} funny to write a song that <b>said</b> <b>today</b> is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out." [...] They played the song live {{for the first time on}} September 20, 1993 on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1948 the music analyst Hans Keller, {{summarising}} Britten's impact on 20th-century opera to that date, compared {{his contribution to}} that of Mozart in the 18th century: [...] "Mozart may in some respects {{be regarded as a}} founder (a 'second founder') of opera. The same can already be <b>said</b> <b>today,</b> as far as the modern British – perhaps not only British – field goes, of Britten". In addition to his own original operas, Britten, together with Imogen Holst, extensively revised Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1951) and The Fairy-Queen (1967). These [...] "realisations" [...] brought Purcell, who was then neglected, to a wider public, but have themselves been neglected since the dominance of the trend to authentic performance practice. His 1948 revision of The Beggar's Opera amounts to a wholesale recomposition, retaining the original melodies but giving them new, highly sophisticated orchestral accompaniments.|$|E

2500|$|Arnett {{wrote the}} {{following}} {{in one of}} his most iconic dispatches, published on 7 February 1968, about the provincial capital Bến Tre: [...] "'It became necessary to destroy the town to save it,' a United States major <b>said</b> <b>today.</b> He was talking about the decision by allied commanders to bomb and shell the town regardless of civilian casualties, to rout the Vietcong." [...] The quotation was distorted in subsequent publications, eventually becoming the more familiar, [...] "We had to destroy the village in order to save it." [...] The accuracy of the original quotation and its source have often been called into question. [...] Arnett never revealed his source, except {{to say that it was}} one of four officers he interviewed that day. US Army Major Phil Cannella, the senior officer present at Bến Tre, suggested that the quotation might have been a distortion of something he said to Arnett. The New Republic at the time attributed the quotation to US Air Force Major Chester L. Brown. In Walter Cronkite's 1971 book, Eye on the World, Arnett reasserted that the quotation was something [...] "one American major said to me in a moment of revelation." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a {{presentation}} at an emergency {{session of the}} Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand [...] "Don't wait for the translation, answer 'yes' or 'no'!" [...] When Zorin replied that [...] "I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put {{to me in the}} manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course", Stevenson retorted, [...] "I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over." [...] Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist. Stevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members [...] "intemperately upbraided Stevenson... outraged and shrill." [...] However, President Kennedy remarked [...] "You have to admire Adlai, he sticks to his position even when everyone is jumping on him", and Robert Kennedy wrote that [...] "Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, and I might add that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time." [...] Stevenson remarked [...] "I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I <b>said</b> <b>today,</b> but perhaps we need a coward in the room when we are talking about nuclear war." [...] In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. [...] The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.|$|E
