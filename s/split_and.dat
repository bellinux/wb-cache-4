5|$|From the well-fortified {{position}} in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area.

5|$|On 15 November at 6:42a.m., the Kaštela TG {{commenced}} a naval {{bombardment of}} targets in <b>Split</b> <b>and</b> {{on the islands}} of Brač and Šolta. The order was issued aboard VPBR-31 <b>Split</b> <b>and</b> the JNA Maritime Military Sector command and JNA bases in Split were advised of the attack. The JNA based in Split did not join the bombardment. Letica notified the JNA Maritime Military Sector commanding officer Major General Nikola Mladenić of the attack, but Mladenić {{said he could not}} control the situation because his headquarters was denied a supply of electricity. The European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) was also notified; they promised to make efforts to stop the bombardment. Shortly after, Letica ordered the coastal artillery to commence fire against the Kaštela TG. Besides several near-misses, the coastal artillery fire scored a direct hit against VPBR-31 Split, that was attributed to the Marinča Rat-based battery on Šolta. Croatian sources said Mladenić ordered the bombardment in retribution for the loss of Mukos.|$|E
