500|$|The writers had {{to fight}} Fox's {{executives}} to retain the Phoenix plot, as the studio only wanted the cure story as it provided a reason for Magneto's conflict with the X-Men. Still the disputes made them not add much for Jean Grey to do {{in most of the}} film's second half, as the executives considered the tone of the Phoenix story too dark for a mainstream summer movie, and that its appeal would be limited to hardcore fans rather than a general audience. Penn defended the divergences from the original Dark Phoenix stories, stating that the Phoenix was not a firebird-shaped cosmic force [...] "because it doesn't fit into the world," [...] and that Cyclops did not have as much screentime as Wolverine because the latter was more popular and [...] "with Cyclops, you can't <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> It's a harder character to relate to for the audience." [...] Killing Cyclops was Fox's decision, based on the availability of actor James Marsden, who was cast in Singer's Superman Returns. The studio considered killing him off-screen with a dialogue reference, but Kinberg and Penn insisted that Jean kill him, emphasizing their relationship. Xavier's death was intended to match the impact of Spock's demise in , as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point. Kinberg and Penn were originally cautious, but grew to like the idea of killing off Xavier. They decided to write a post-credits scene suggesting the character's return for a sequel.|$|E
500|$|Other Enterprise {{crew members}} include the ship's first officer William Riker, played by {{director}} Jonathan Frakes. Frakes {{said he did}} not have much difficulty directing and acting at the same time, having done so on the television series. Brent Spiner portrays the android Data; rumors before the film's release suggested that since Data's skin had been largely removed {{at the end of the}} story, it would allow another actor to assume the role. LeVar Burton plays Geordi La Forge, the ship's chief engineer. La Forge is a blind character, and for the television series and previous film had worn a special visor to see. Burton lobbied for many years to have his character's visor replaced so that people could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> since the [...] "air filter" [...] he wore prevented the audience from seeing his eyes and limited his acting ability. Moore finally agreed, giving the character ocular implants that were never explained in the film, beyond showing they were artificial. Gates McFadden plays Beverly Crusher, the ship's doctor. McFadden considered Star Trek women finally on par with the men: [...] "We've come a long way since Majel Barrett was stuck in the sick bay as Nurse Chapel in the [...] and made to dye her hair blond." [...] Crusher was instrumental in helping Picard set the auto-destruct sequence, to prevent the Borg from completely assimilating the Enterprise and Earth. Ship's counselor Deanna Troi is portrayed by Marina Sirtis. The actress missed working on the television show, and was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for First Contact were high: [...] "we were scared that people thought we couldn't cut it without the original cast", she said. Other Starfleet members included former Enterprise chief of security, and commander of the USS Defiant, Worf (Michael Dorn). The Defiant is badly damaged in the battle with the Borg but is left salvageable. An early screenplay draft called for the Defiant to be destroyed, but Deep Space Nine executive producer Ira Steven Behr objected to the destruction of his show's ship and so the idea was dropped. Neal McDonough plays Hawk, the Enterprise helmsman who aids in the defense of the ship until he is assimilated and killed. McDonough was cavalier about his role as an expendable [...] "redshirt", saying that since one of the characters in the deflector dish battle had to die, [...] "that would be me".|$|E
2500|$|Davey {{arrived at}} Talladega the {{following}} week wearing dark shades to hide eyes severely bruised in the Pocono crash, Allison famously told a reporter asking to <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> at the press conference, [...] "You can see it, but its ugly". His arm was in a cast {{that allowed him to}} drive, and velcro attachments to his glove and the car's shifter knob helped him drive with less exertion, but Bobby Hillin, Jr. would relieve Davey after the initial laps of the DieHard 500. [...] Under NASCAR rules, the driver who takes the green flag is the one assigned to the points for all drivers that drive that car during the race. [...] Hillin drove the No. 28 Texaco-Havoline Ford Thunderbird to a third-place finish at Talladega, helping Davey and the team keep pace with Elliott. [...] The team was a strong contender for the win until suffering a jack failure on a pit stop. The following week, veteran road racer Dorsey Schroeder would relieve Allison, but he could only manage a 20th-place finish.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{never see}} their bodies," [...] said the lantern-bearer, slowly, as he peered earnestly in front, [...] "we {{only see the}} sparkle of one eye when the light falls on it, and--then--we--fire--at--there, that's one! Look, don't you <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye?</b> Fire, Sir, fire!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She said it {{with that}} sort of {{repressed}} fieriness that means so much when a person's heart is in a thing. You could see the response in that nobleman's face; you could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> light up; there was sympathy there. He said, most earnestly: ...|$|R

60|$|Elizabeth, with {{a triumphant}} sensation, looked towards his friend.

60|$|She {{could only}} see the outline of his head silhouetted against the wind-tossed sky; she could not <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> nor his lips, but she felt his nearness, and the {{happiness}} of that almost caused her to swoon.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of his voice {{something}} seemed to come back to the face of the older man. He rose slowly to his feet. I could see his white fingers trembling, but I could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> suddenly fill with a new and stronger light.|$|E
