25|$|Competition {{with the}} modern {{trucking}} industry that used the Interstate highway system for short distance transportation of goods, also known as <b>short</b> <b>hauls,</b> compounded the company's problems, forcing it into bankruptcy in the 1970s. Its railroad operations were merged into Conrail in 1976, but the corporation lasted into 2000, disposing of valuable real estate holdings.|$|R

5|$|On 4 February 1972, Biman {{started its}} {{domestic}} services, initially linking Dhaka with Chittagong, Jessore and Sylhet, using a single Douglas DC-3 acquired from India. Following {{the crash of}} this DC-3 on 10 February 1972, near Dhaka, during a test flight, two Fokker F27s belonging to Indian Airlines and supplied by the Indian government entered the fleet as a replacement. Shortly afterwards, additional capacity was provided with the incorporation of a Douglas DC-6, loaned by the World Council of Churches, which was in turn replaced with another Douglas DC-6, a DC-6B model leased from Troll-Air, to operate the Dhaka-Calcutta route. On 4 March 1972, Biman started its international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian. The <b>short</b> <b>haul</b> fleet was supplemented by a Fokker F27 from India on 3 March 1972; the aircraft was employed on a daily scheduled flight between Calcutta and Dhaka on 28 April 1972. Three additional Fokker F27s were acquired during March and September of that year. In {{the first year of}} operation, Biman operated 1,079 flights carrying just over 380,000passengers.|$|E
5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the <b>short</b> <b>haul</b> routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
50|$|Patented in 1912, the lockrod {{was first}} used to secure {{railroad}} boxcar doors. Today, sometimes confused with locking bars or bar locks, lockrods have evolved to secure virtually every trailer or container that has a swing door (a door that swings open and closed rather than rolls up). Roll up doors are sometimes used in place of swing doors on some trailers that make <b>shorter</b> <b>haul</b> deliveries.|$|R

40|$|How far do the {{contractual}} {{implications of}} hold-up-based theories (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian (1978), Williamson (1979, 1985)) extend? I investigate {{this in the}} context of trucking. Quasi-rents in trucking are generally smaller than in the contexts studied in the previous empirical literature. They vary with hauls' distance and the thickness of local markets. I find that doubling the thickness of the market increases the likelihood that simple spot arrangements govern transactions by about 30 % for long hauls. I find weaker evidence of relationships between local market thickness and contractual form for <b>short</b> <b>hauls</b> [...] hauls for which quasi-rents are particularly small. Contracts' role as protectors of quasi-rents becomes less important as quasi-rents decrease, but exists over a surprisingly large range. ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{shakedown}} off southern California, Serpens loaded {{general cargo}} at Alameda and, on 24 June, sailed west to assume provision ship duties {{in support of}} operations in the Solomons. By mid-July, {{she was in the}} Tonga Islands. At the end of the month, she was en route from New Caledonia to New Zealand; and, by mid-August, she had emptied her holds at Wellington.

50|$|Trucks {{and cars}} {{have a common}} ancestor: the steam-powered fardier Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built in 1769. However, steam wagons were not common until the mid-1800s. The roads of the time, built for horse and carriages, limited these {{vehicles}} to very <b>short</b> <b>hauls,</b> usually from a factory to the nearest railway station. The first semi-trailer appeared in 1881, towed by a steam tractor manufactured by De Dion-Bouton. Steam-powered wagons were sold in France and the United States until the eve of World War I, and 1935 in the United Kingdom, when a change in road tax rules made them uneconomic against the new diesel lorries.|$|R
40|$|The {{outlook for}} the Clydesdale horse trade in Canada has brightened {{considerably}} {{in the course of}} the past year. Contractors and others have at length found that, for <b>short</b> <b>hauls</b> and town work, horse traction is the most economical. Clydesdale breeders have taken courage again, and steps have been adopted to increase the draught horse population (5). In 1931, only four Clydesdales were imported from Scotland, but in 1932, the number was 33. This, however, is far behind the business done in pre-war days. There has been considerable demand for mares and fillies thus indicating a revival in horse breeding (5). Numbers in brackets refer to bibliography...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how contractual incompleteness affects asset ownership in trucking by examining cross-sectional patterns in truck ownership and how truck ownership has {{changed with the}} diffusion of on-board computers (OBCs). We find that driver ownership of trucks is greater for long than <b>short</b> <b>hauls,</b> and when hauls require equipment for which demands are unidirectional rather than bidirectional. We then find that driver ownership decreases with OBC adoption, particularly for longer hauls. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that truck ownership reflects trade-offs between driving incentives and bargaining costs, and indicate that improvements in the contracting environment have led to less independent contracting and larger firms. © 2004 MIT Press...|$|R

Railroads had become the principal form of transportation for both people and goods, and the prices they charged and the practices they adopted greatly influenced individuals and businesses. In some cases, the railroads were perceived to have abused their power {{as a result of}} too little competition. Railroads also banded together to form pools and trusts that fixed rates at higher levels than they could otherwise command.
