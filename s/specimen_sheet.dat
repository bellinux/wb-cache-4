5|$|Miklós Kis, a Transylvanian Protestant {{priest and}} schoolteacher, became deeply {{interested}} in printing after {{being sent to}} Amsterdam to help print a Hungarian Protestant translation of the Bible. This {{was a period of}} considerable prosperity for the Netherlands and a time when its styles of printing were very influential across Europe, making it a centre for the creation of new typefaces. He developed a second career as a punchcutter, an engraver of the punches used as a master for making moulds for metal type, working on commission for printers and governments. Kis returned to Transylvania around 1689 and may have left matrices (the moulds used to cast type) in Leipzig on his way home. The Ehrhardt type foundry of Leipzig released a surviving <b>specimen</b> <b>sheet</b> of them around 1720.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{attempt to}} capture the spirit of Caslon by William Berkson, {{intended}} for use in body text. Although not aimed at being fully authentic in every respect, the typeface closely follows Caslon's original <b>specimen</b> <b>sheet</b> in many respects. The weight is heavier than many earlier revivals, to compensate for changes in printing processes, and the italic is less slanted (with variation in stroke angle) than on many other Caslon releases. Berkson described his design choices in an extensive article series.|$|E

2500|$|Caslon {{began his}} career in London as an {{apprentice}} engraver of ornamental designs on firearms and other metalwork. According to printer and historian John Nichols, the main source on Caslon's life, the accuracy of his work {{came to the attention}} of prominent London printers, who advanced him money to carve steel punches for printing, first for exotic languages and then as his reputation developed for the Latin alphabet. Punchcutting was a difficult technique and many of the techniques used were kept secret by punchcutters or passed on from father to son. Caslon would later follow this practice himself, according to Nichols teaching his son his methods privately while locked in a room where nobody could watch them. As British printers had little success or experience of making their own types, they were forced to use equipment bought from the Netherlands, or France, and Caslon's types are therefore clearly influenced by the popular Dutch typefaces of his period. James Mosley summarises his early work: [...] "Caslon's pica...was based very closely indeed on a pica roman and italic that appears on the <b>specimen</b> <b>sheet</b> of the widow of the Amsterdam printer Dirck Voskens, c.1695, and which Bowyer had used for some years. Caslon's pica replaces it in his printing from 1725…Caslon's Great Primer roman, first used in 1728, a type that was much admired in the twentieth century, is clearly related to the Text Romeyn of Voskens, a type of the early seventeenth century used by several London printers and now attributed to the punch-cutter Nicolas Briot of Gouda." [...] Mosley also describes several other Caslon faces as [...] "intelligent adaptations" [...] of the Voskens Pica.|$|E
2500|$|Most herbaria utilize a {{standard}} system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. [...] <b>Specimen</b> <b>sheets</b> are stacked in groups by the species {{to which they}} belong and placed into a large lightweight folder that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by genus. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic family according to the standard system selected {{for use by the}} herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the detection and removal of hazardous biocide residues from historic applications to herbarium collections. There are two main aims: • To develop a rapid, cost-effective and non-destructive screening method for identifying toxic residues on herbarium sheets; and • To establish the most suitable decontamination method for the removal of naphthalene from herbarium collections, maintaining the integrity of the specimen. The research outlines how the presence of fluorescent marks on <b>specimen</b> <b>sheets</b> throughout the herbarium, at Amgueddfa Cymru- National Museum Wales (AC-NMW), is indicative of mercury(II) chloride contamination. Compelling evidence is given to support the hypothesis that the observed fluorescence is due to the reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(I) during the oxidative degradation of cellulose, occurring as part of the natural ageing process. The rate of fluorescence development is shown to be increased by the presence of naphthalene, and is estimated to take at least 30 years to develop. From the results obtained, it is evident that a hand-held UV-A lamp can provide a rapid and effective method of identifying samples within a collection that are contaminated with mercury, thus providing a rapid and economical means to prioritise which collections require immediate re-mounting. Furthermore, this method will enforce the implementation of safe, standard procedures to protect personnel and visitors when handling the collections, plus enable the removal of a large amount of hazardous chemical from the herbarium environment. It is also demonstrated, through decontamination tests, that the air-drying of contaminated <b>specimen</b> <b>sheets</b> is a more efficient method of removing naphthalene, than either freeze-drying or oven-drying. It is also the most cost-effective, and the least damaging to the specimen. It is shown that the efficacy of the decontamination is dependent upon the paper type. Thin, unfinished, papers are more efficient at losing naphthalene than the heavier, finished and coated papers, as their porous structure allows the naphthalene to remain more mobile. These results provide important information about which <b>specimen</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are more likely to be}} successfully decontaminated by the air-drying procedure and can inform the selection and prioritisation process...|$|R

5000|$|Specimens of B. dryandroides {{were first}} {{collected}} in 1823 from {{the vicinity of}} King George Sound by William Baxter, a private plant collector who collected plant specimens and seed on behalf of British nurseries. Baxter sent to Clapton Nursery a package of Banksia seed labelled [...] "Dryandroides", and this was successfully germinated. The species became part of [...] "the collection of Mr Mackay, at Clapton", before being procured for [...] "the superb collection of the Comtesse de Vandes, at Bayswater", where it flowered in cultivation for the first time. There it was seen by Robert Sweet, who in 1826 listed it under the unpublished manuscript name [...] "Banksia dryandroides" [...] as having been in cultivation in British gardens since 1824. Two years later, Sweet published a formal description of the species in his Flora Australasica, accompanied by a hand-coloured engraving by Edwin Dalton Smith. Thus B. dryandroides became the first published of the 18 Banksia species discovered by Baxter; the remaining 17 would be published in Robert Browns 1830 Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae, based on Baxters <b>specimen</b> <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
40|$|Accuracy of biaxial test {{equipment}} {{to examine the}} nonlinear mechanical behavior of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>specimens</b> of elastomeric materials has been hampered by lack of precise determination of the force distribution {{along the sides of}} the specimen. It has been necessary to use an effective width established by approximate means to obtain the stress from the overall force applied along the edges. To avoid this experimental difficulty, individual miniature proof-ring load cells utilizing semiconductor strain gages have been developed and applied to the support hooks for the thin <b>sheet</b> <b>specimens.</b> Typical results are shown for time-dependent stress distributions for all degrees of biaxiality. An accurate evaluation of the effective specimen width is now possible...|$|R

40|$|Herbaria {{around the}} world house {{millions}} of plant specimens; botanists and other researchers value these resources as ingredients in biodiversity research. Even when the <b>specimen</b> <b>sheets</b> are digitized and made available online, the critical information about the specimen stored on the sheet {{are not in a}} usable (i. e., machine-processible) form. This paper describes a current research and development project that is designing and testing high-throughput workflows that combine machine- and human-processes to extract and parse the specimen label data. The primary focus of the paper is the metadata needs for the workflow and the creation of the structured metadata records describing the plant specimen. In the project, we are exploring the use of the new Dublin Core Metadata Initiative framework for application profiles. First articulated as the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles in 2007, the use of this framework is in its infancy.

40|$|Small-size smooth {{specimens}} {{of the high}} purity MgO and the similar fine-ceramics sheet materials are fractured under tension at room temperature. Here, the specimen's design and size and the way of loading tensile force, used for the previous investigation on the fracture of SIALON <b>sheet</b> <b>specimen,</b> are employed and the variation and scattering in fracture strength due to the materials i. e., the high purity MgO and the other five kinds of similar fine-ceramics materials, are studied and compared. A center-notched and a single edge-notched medium-size tensile <b>sheet</b> <b>specimens</b> having various tip-radius are fractured under tension at temperatures of 20 ℃ and 1000 ℃. Notched fracture strength {{is found to be}} controlled by not only the notch geometries but also the stress field around the notch tip-radius due to the thermal expansion. Fracture strength, of course, shows the strong dependence on the notch tip-radius (ρ) down to ρ≒ 15 μm and it shows very little dependence at ρ< 15 μm, and we estimate the fracture toughness value of the high purity MgO <b>sheet</b> <b>specimen</b> based on the fracture strength of the specimens having ρ≒ 15 μm. The crack propagation behaviour of the MgO <b>sheet</b> <b>specimen</b> during a cycle of heating up to 1000 ℃ and cooling down to 20 ℃ under free hanging in the furnace is examined. The crack proceeded straightly in the first stage and curved upside or/and downside and then it stopped. The detail mechanism of this phenomena is very complicated and is not known at present. The average crack propagation velocity of the single edge-notched specimen is measured at 300 ℃ and 20 ℃. The former gives about 53 m/s and the latter does about 1830 m/s and this says that the average crack velocity is faster the stronger the fracture strength. Analysis of the X-ray diffraction pattern (Cu target) is made for the MgO <b>sheet</b> <b>specimen</b> at various elastic strain under bending. The integrated intensity ratio and the relative half-width ratio of the (111) peak profile show the more correspondence than the other planes' profiles with respect to the elastic tensile strain and the former decreases with increasing the strain and the latter increases with increasing the strain...|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of HPEPC, the compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, and Poisson’s ratio were measured for various densities obtained by altering {{the amount of}} EPS beads. It was found that HPEPC with 40 % EPS bulk ratio was suitable for high strength lightweight concrete. HPEPC exhibits better mechanical and thermal resistance than typical structural lightweight concrete. The HPEPC had compressive strength and thermal conductivity 8 and 0.25 times, respectively, those of EPS mortar. The lightweight and thermal insulation characteristics is suitable for HPEPC to be applied as core material in sandwich panels. To qualify the structural behavior in composite sandwich panel, flatwise and edgewise compression tests, and four-point bending tests, were conducted on various composite sandwich panels. The HPEPC and EPS mortar were considered as core materials in composite sandwich panels, and <b>specimens</b> <b>sheeted</b> by three types of faces, UHPFRC plate, UHPC plate reinforced by GFRP textile mesh, and GFRP plate were tested for each core material. The structural test {{results indicated that the}} sandwich panel with an HPEPC core and UHPFRC face sheet can be used for high-strength lightweight elements, and the sandwich panel with EPS mortar and UHPFRC face sheet can be used as structural lightweight concrete.|$|R
