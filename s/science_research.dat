5|$|In 1980, Marburger left USC {{to become}} the third {{president}} of the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island, New York. At the time, state budget cuts were afflicting the university, and he returned it to growth with increases in the university's <b>science</b> <b>research</b> funding from the federal government. He also presided over the founding of Stony Brook University Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Harold Innis {{reached the}} height of his {{influence}} in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based Economic History Association and its Journal of Economic History. He later became the association's second president. Innis {{played a central role in}} founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social <b>Science</b> <b>Research</b> Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).|$|E

5|$|Two spacewalks {{were carried}} out during his time aboard. Their aim was to remove {{electrical}} power connectors from a 12-year-old solar power array on the base block and reconnect the cables to the more efficient new solar power arrays. In all, Blaha spent four months with the Mir-22 Cosmonaut crew conducting material science, fluid science, and life <b>science</b> <b>research,</b> before returning to Earth the next year aboard Atlantis on STS-81.|$|E
5|$|Although {{designed}} as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level natural <b>science</b> <b>research</b> component with the appointment of plant physiologist Kenneth V. Thimann as the first provost of Crown College. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus. Immediately upon its founding, UCSC was also granted administrative responsibility for the Lick Observatory, which established the campus as a major center for astronomy research. Founding members of the Social Science and Humanities faculty created the unique History of Consciousness graduate program in UCSC's first year of operation.|$|E

5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} larger role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium of Social Science Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support of social <b>science</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical {{work from the}} synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social <b>Science</b> <b>Research</b> Council (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with {{other aspects of the}} synthesis including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for critics of the synthesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Titterton {{stepped down}} as Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, and became an {{ordinary}} professor. Once again he spearheaded a proposal to upgrade the department's equipment, this time by using the tandem as an injector for a superconducting linear accelerator. Unable to secure funding in Australia, he managed to persuade the British <b>Science</b> <b>Research</b> Council to donate the required equipment to the ANU from facilities in England that were being closed down. It was installed and commissioned after his death. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1957, and was created a knight bachelor on 1 January 1970.|$|E
