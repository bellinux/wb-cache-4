5|$|Ramarayaningar {{was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire on 5 June 1926. In the Assembly {{elections}} which took place on 8 November 1926, no party {{was able to get}} a clean majority. The Swarajya Party won 41 of the 98 seats and emerged as the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> party while the Justice party won 21. The Raja resigned as the Chief Minister of the Presidency as the popular verdict appeared to be against the Justice Party. As no party had a clean majority and the Swarajya Party which was the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> party in the assembly was reluctant to form the government, the Governor appointed P. Subbarayan as the independent Chief Minister and nominated 34 members to the Council to support him.|$|E

5|$|The {{county has}} a {{developed}} tourism industry. The main attractions are the historic sites of Corydon, the county's golf courses, the Horseshoe Riverboat Casino and Hotel, and the area's two famous caves: Squire Boone Caverns near Mauckport and Wyandotte Caves in adjoining Crawford County. The casino is the county's <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> source of tax revenue and produced $23.5 million in tax revenue during 2007.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} was mirrored in Abkhazia, an autonomous republic in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, where the Abkhaz seceded from Georgia {{during the war}} in the early 1990s. The population of Abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of Georgians, the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> ethnic group in the region, a decrease from 525,000 before the war. The upper Kodori Gorge (in northeast Abkhazia) remained beyond the unrecognised Abkhaz separatist government's control.|$|E

5|$|Following {{continued}} turmoil {{between the}} centre-right parties, {{there was even}} an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right national unity government on a balanced budget program, an idea he did not reject. He was the headline speaker at the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in Tønsberg in 1928. In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship Stella Polaris, holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference {{announced}} {{the return of}} 11 episodes (two of which previously existing) from a television relay station {{in the city of}} Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1-6 of The Enemy of the World and episodes 1-6 of The Web of Fear. and returned 11 of these to the BBC. The return of the nine missing episodes was the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|On both fronts, {{the horse}} was also used as a pack animal. Because railway lines could not {{withstand}} artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1973 and {{extended}} in the mid-1980s, {{the station was}} initially operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. Since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times, and it is operated by the Drax Group. Completed in 1986, it is the newest coal-fired power station in England, flue gas desulphurisation equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995; high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012. Because of its large size, the station is the UK's <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> emitter of carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|The 1984 Rajneeshee {{bioterror}} {{attack was}} the food poisoning of 751individuals in The Dalles, Oregon, through the deliberate contamination of salad bars at ten local restaurants with Salmonella. A leading group of followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho) {{had hoped to}} incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 Wasco County elections. The incident {{was the first and}} <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> bioterrorist attack in United States history. The attack is one of only two confirmed terrorist uses of biological weapons to harm humans since 1945, the other being the 2001 anthrax attacks across the USA.|$|E
5|$|The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity was {{constructed}} in 1987 with financial support from the Saudi Fahd bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud Foundation. It is the main mosque in the city, and an iconic building in Somali society. With a capacity of up to 10,000 worshippers, it is the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> masjid in the Horn region. In 2015, the federal authorities completed formal refurbishments on the mosque's infrastructure. The upgrades {{are part of a}} larger governmental renovation campaign aimed at all of the masjids in Mogadishu. To this end, the municipal authority is refurbishing the historic Central Mosque, situated downtown.|$|E
5|$|The local {{elections}} of 2003 were a {{success for the}} party. In 36 municipalities, the party gained more votes than any other; it succeeded in electing the mayor in only 13 of these, but also secured 40 deputy mayor positions. The Progress Party had participated in {{local elections}} since 1975, but until 2003 had only secured a mayoral position four times, all on separate occasions. The Progress Party vote in Os—the only municipality that elected a Progress Party mayor in 1999—increased from 36.6% in 1999 to 45.7% in 2003. The party also became the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> in the counties of Vestfold and Rogaland.|$|E

3000|$|Mining {{patterns}} {{from a large}} data tree The type of mined {{data can}} be a collection of small trees [2, 5, 17, 26, 27] or a <b>single</b> <b>large</b> tree. Surprisingly, the problem of mining tree patterns from a <b>single</b> <b>large</b> tree has only very recently been touched even though a plethora of interesting datasets from different areas are {{in the form of}} a <b>single</b> <b>large</b> tree. Examples include encyclopedia databases like Wikipedia, bibliographic databases like PubMed, scientific and experimental result databases like UniprotKB, and biological datasets like phylogenetic trees. These datasets grow constantly with the addition of new data. Big data applications seek to extract information from large datasets. However, mining a <b>single</b> <b>large</b> data tree is more complex than mining a set of small data trees. In fact, the former setting is more general than the latter, since a collection of small trees can be modeled as a <b>single</b> <b>large</b> tree rooted at a virtual unlabeled node. Existing algorithms for mining embedded patterns from a collection of small trees [26] cannot scale well when the size of the data tree increases. Our experiments show that these algorithms cannot scale beyond some hundreds of nodes in a data tree with low-frequency thresholds.|$|R
5|$|The <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> {{producer}} of food {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes account for the largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year are thrown away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. Bread slices account for the second food type most disposed of (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year). Salad is disposed of in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the <b>single</b> <b>largest</b> {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E
