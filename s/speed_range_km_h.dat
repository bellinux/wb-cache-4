40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{with the}} Hinode Solar Optical Telescope display an active region prominence whose fine threads oscillate in the vertical direction {{as they move}} along a path parallel to the photosphere. A seismological analysis of this event is carried out {{by taking advantage of}} the small radius of these structures compared to the total length of magnetic field lines, i. e. by using the thin tube approximation. This analysis reveals that the oscillatory period is only slightly modified by the existence of the flow and that the difference between the period of a flowing thread and a static one is below the error bars of these observations. Moreover, although {{it is not possible to}} obtain values of the physical parameters, a lower bound for the Alfvén <b>speed</b> (<b>ranging</b> between 120 <b>km</b> s − 1 and 350 km s − 1) is obtained for each of the threads.

30|$|The grass populations sampled, for {{all species}} except Harding grass, were spread {{throughout}} a 150 m × 150 m area; the Harding grass population {{was less than}} 1 km away. Species were sampled {{in the same order}} on each date to maximize efficiency and maintain consistency. To evaluate the effect that time of collection had on fuel moisture values, we sampled from a subset of four species every two hours over an eight-hour period, on a single day on 10 October 2012. Two native species, California fescue and blue wildrye, and two non-native species, Harding grass and sweet vernal grass, were sampled. We sampled these species at two-hour intervals between 0900 hr and 1700 hr. Due to the small amount of Harding grass remaining at our study site, only two to three samples of this species were collected at each interval. The number of samples collected for the other species depended upon the abundance of easily accessible material; three samples were collected for blue wildrye, four for California fescue, and five for sweet vernal grass. Throughout the eight-hour sampling period, the air temperature ranged from 12.8 °C to 16.7 °C, relative humidity ranged from 62 % to 80 %, and wind <b>speeds</b> <b>ranged</b> from 3.2 <b>km</b> h− 1 to 9.7 km h− 1.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The energy {{consumed}} per covered distance (C) is increased in hemiparetic stroke adults during walking. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain if increased C in stroke patients {{is a result}} of increased mechanical work, of decreased efficiency of work production by muscles or of slow walking speed. METHODS: C and mechanical work were computed in 20 patients walking on a force measuring treadmill at <b>speeds</b> <b>ranging</b> from 1 <b>km</b> h(- 1) to their own maximum speed (WS(MAX)). Works done by healthy and pathological limbs were computed separately. RESULTS: For hemiparetic patients, C was around 1. 7 times greater than normal. When these patients had a slower WS(MAX), they had greater C and mechanical work (r=- 0. 44 and - 0. 57, respectively). The increased C was related to the external work performed to lift the center of body mass when the healthy limb was supporting the body weight (r= 0. 77). CONCLUSIONS: The increase of C in stroke patients is more pronounced when WS(MAX) is slow. Moreover, this increase is related to increased mechanical work done by muscles and is not related to slow walking speed or decreased efficiency. As in healthy subjects, C and external work presented optimum speeds, indicating a preserved pendular mechanism of walkin...|$|R

The experiment consists of three instruments with a common Data Processing Unit.

The observations made by SMS will make valuable contributions to the ISTP objectives by providing information regarding the composition and energy distribution of matter entering the magnetosphere. In addition SMS results {{will have an impact on}} many areas of solar and heliospheric physics, in particular providing important and unique information on: (i) conditions and processes in the region of the corona where the solar wind is accelerated; (ii) the location of the source regions of the solar wind in the corona; (iii) coronal heating processes; (iv) the extent and causes of variations in the composition of the solar atmosphere; (v) plasma processes in the solar wind; (vi) the acceleration of particles in the solar wind; and (vii) the physics of the pick-up process of interstellar He as well as lunar particles in the solar wind, and the isotopic composition of interstellar helium...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} limited information available on match running performance in Gaelic football. The {{objective of the}} current study was to report on the match running profile of elite male Gaelic football and assess positional running performance. In this observational study 50 elite male Gaelic football players wore 4 -Hz GPS units (VXsports, New Zealand) across 30 competitive games with a total of 212 full game data sets collected. Activity was classed according to total distance, high speed distance (≥ 17 <b>km.</b> <b>h),</b> sprint distance (≥ 22 <b>km.</b> <b>h),</b> mean velocity (<b>km.</b> <b>h),</b> peak velocity (<b>km.</b> <b>h)</b> and number of accelerations. The average match distance was 8160 ± 1482 m, reflective of a relative distance of 116 ± 21 m. min, with 1731 ± 659 m covered at high speed which is reflective of a relative high speed distance of 25 ± 9 m. min. The observed sprint distance was 445 ± 169 m distributed across 44 sprint actions. The peak velocity was 30. 3 ± 1. 8 <b>km.</b> <b>h</b> with a mean velocity of 6. 5 ± 1. 2 <b>km.</b> <b>h.</b> Players completed 184 ± 40 accelerations which represent 2. 6 ± 0. 5 a. min. There were significant differences between positional groups for both total running distance, high speed running distance and sprint distance, with midfielders covering more total and high speed running distance, compared to other positions (p< 0. 001). There was a reduction in high speed and sprint distance {{between the first and second}} half (p< 0. 001). Reductions in running performance were position dependant with the middle three positions experiencing the highest decrement in performance.
