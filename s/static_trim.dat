Stacking these misaligned gathers runs the risk of destroying important structures in the stacked migration image. To mitigate this problem, we propose a <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> inspired by the non-local means algorithm originally developed for image denoising. This method differs from the conventional one in two fundamental respects. First, the <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> are computed by comparing image patches instead of individual image traces. Second, no global pilot trace is needed because only two migration images at a time participate in <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> and are stacked into one image.

The level-set function is defined over the entire 3 D volume of a transport aircraft wing box. Therefore, the approach is not limited by any predefined structure and can explore novel configurations. The Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) level-set method is used to solve the constrained optimization problems. The proposed method is demonstrated using three problems with mass, linear buckling and flutter objective and/or constraints.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method proposed for modeling large deflection of aircraft in nonlinear aeroelastic analysis by developing reduced order model (ROM). The method is applied for solving the static aeroelastic and <b>static</b> aeroelastic <b>trim</b> problems of flexible aircraft containing geometric nonlinearities; meanwhile, the non-planar effects of aerodynamics and follower force effect have been considered. ROMs are computational inexpensive mathematical representations compared to traditional nonlinear {{finite element method}} (FEM) especially in aeroelastic solutions.

Moreover, the non-planar aerodynamic force is computed by the non-planar vortex lattice method (VLM). Structure and aerodynamics can be coupled with the surface spline method.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{handling qualities}} of light aircraft {{have traditionally been}} assessed {{in terms of the}} slope of the <b>static</b> stability <b>trim</b> curves. This method of assessment is simple in terms of analysis as well as being a relatively easy task for the pilot to perform. The theory is however based on a simple linearised model of. the aircraft'and omits, amongst other things, the effects of power. A comparison between the estimated and measured trim curves of a typical light aircraft shows that the linearised theory severely overestimates its static stability. A design based on the linear assumptions would be unlikely to comply with airworthiness requirements. In Part II the main omissions from the linearised model are considered individually and their effect on the trim curves found. In Part I the individual contributions from Part II are used to complete the full, non-linear, trim equations and these are solved in terms of elevator angle and incidence to trim, n and ä. The solution shows that the non-linear analysis provides a good simulation of the flight measured trim curve data thus verifying the methods of estimation developed in Part II. The trim curves are considered in terms of incidence and lift coefficient and show that assumption of a linear lift-incidence relationship may cause some misleading interpretations of the trim curves drawn in terms of lift coefficient...|$|R

40|$|Several {{conceptual}} hypersonic research airplanes, designed {{within the}} constraints of a B- 52 launch aircraft, have been studied experimentally and analytically at Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 6. 0. Vehicles built to these criteria for Mach 6 cruise were shown to be feasible, if careful {{attention was paid to}} the low speed lift, drag, and high angle of attack stability to assure successful landings and transonic pitch angle maneuvers. The integrated scramjet engine drag was high at subsonic speeds and appears to be constant with Reynolds number. The variable geometry airfoil used previously to improve directional stability was shown to be equally adaptable to the improvement of longitudinal stability. The vortex lattice theory gave good subsonic predictions of lift, drag due to lift, and pitching moments. Wind tunnel tests must be relied on for the drag at zero lift, <b>trim,</b> <b>static</b> margins and lateral-directional stability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if advanced supercritical wings incur higher trim drag values at cruise conditions than current wide body technology wings. Relative trim drag increments were measured in an experimental wind tunnel investigation conducted in the Langley 8 Foot Transonic Pressure Tunnel. The tests utilized a high aspect ratio supercritical wing and a wide body aircraft wing, in conjunction with five different horizontal tail configurations, mounted on a representative wide body fuselage. The three low tail and two T-tail configurations were designed to measure the effects of horizontal tail size, location, and camber on the trim drag increments for the two wings. Longitudinal force and moment data were taken at a Mach number of 0. 82 and design cruise lift coefficients for the wide body and supercritical wings of 0. 45 and 0. 55, respectively. The data indicate that the supercritical wing does not have significantly higher trim drag than the wide body wing. A reduction in tail size, combined with relaxed <b>static</b> stability, produced <b>trim</b> drag reductions for both wings.

40|$|Concession NC 151 {{is located}} in the northwestern part of the Murzuq Basin (Libya), which is covered by linear sand dunes that reach heights of 100 m above the gravel plain. The sand dunes cause large {{increases}} in the travel times of reflected events in seismic data. In recent years, the conventional method used to calculate field static corrections has been to interpolate the near-surface velocity structure between upholes. Results are often unsatisfactory on lines that cross the dunes because the reflection events contain false structures that correlate with sand dune topography. These structural artifacts are caused by residual static errors which are too large for automatic statics programs to correct during processing. An alternative method of calculating field statics is to pick the first breaks on the Vibroseis field records, calculate the delay times at each station, and use the delay times directly as the field statics after applying a linear adjustment to match them to the upholes. This simple version of the refraction method does not require surface velocity-depth models to be produced, and gives much better results than the conventional field static method. Since this method does not require any near-surface velocity-depth model because it works in time, it can be used in areas with variable LVL or HVL (e. g., sand dunes or permafrost). The maximum power autostatics method was chosen from several residual statics methods that are available in the ProMAX package. Two iterations of maximum power autostatics and velocity analysis followed by non-surface-consistent <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> improved the final stacked section...|$|R

No upper-limit porpoising was encountered by the planing-tail model. The maximum changes in rise during landings were lower for the planing-tail model than for the conventional model at most contact trims, an indication of improved landing stability for the planing-tail model. The hydrodynamic resistance of the planing-tail hull was lower than the conventional hull at all speeds, and the load-resistance ratio was higher for the planing-tail hull, being especially high at the hump.

The code takes as input mass property data {{in the form of}} an inertia tensor, aerodynamic loading data, and propulsion (i. e. thrust) loading data. Using fundamental non-linear equations of motion, MASCOT then calculates vehicle <b>trim</b> and <b>static</b> stability data for any desired flight condition. Common predefined flight conditions are included. The predefined flight conditions include six horizontal and six landing rotation conditions with varying options for engine out, crosswind and sideslip, plus three takeoff rotation conditions. Results are displayed through a unique graphical interface developed to provide stability and control information to the conceptual design engineers using a qualitative scale indicating whether the vehicle has acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable static stability characteristics. This software allows the user to prescribe the vehicle s CG location, mass, and inertia tensor so that any loading configuration between empty weight and maximum take-off weight can be analyzed. The required geometric and aerodynamic data as well as mass and inertia properties may be entered directly, passed through data files, or come from external programs such as Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP). The current version of MASCOT has been tested with VSP used to compute the required data, which is then passed directly into the program. In VSP, the vehicle geometry is created and manipulated. The aerodynamic coefficients, stability and control derivatives, are calculated using VorLax, which is now available directly within VSP. MASCOT has been written exclusively using the technical computing language MATLAB.
