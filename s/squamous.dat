5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in <b>squamous</b> differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of <b>squamous</b> epithelia.|$|E
5|$|In {{other great}} apes, the foramen spinosum is found {{not in the}} sphenoid bone but {{in parts of the}} {{temporal}} bone such as the <b>squamous</b> part, found at the sphenosquamosal suture, or absent.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} most {{commonly associated with}} endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a kinase; KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene is most commonly mutated in the <b>squamous</b> subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the <b>squamous</b> epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be <b>squamous</b> (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified <b>squamous</b> epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as {{basal cell}} carcinoma and <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators {{can be used to}} ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.|$|E
5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified <b>squamous</b> epithelium without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|Low soil {{concentration}} of molybdenum in a geographical band from northern China to Iran {{results in a}} general dietary molybdenum deficiency, and is associated with increased rates of esophageal cancer. Compared to the United States, which has a greater supply of molybdenum in the soil, people living in those areas have about 16 times greater risk for esophageal <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Terriers have {{a greater}} chance of {{developing}} some cancers than other purebreds. According to research by the Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more at risk for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple <b>squamous</b> epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|Type I are <b>squamous</b> {{epithelial}} cells {{that make up}} the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{the cancer}} cells grow in {{patterns}} reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by <b>squamous</b> differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified <b>squamous</b> epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14â€“44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with <b>squamous</b> cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified <b>squamous</b> tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birtâ€“Hoggâ€“DubÃ© phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|A {{malignant}} epithelial tumor that primarily {{originates in}} the epidermis, in <b>squamous</b> mucosa or {{in areas of}} <b>squamous</b> metaplasia {{is referred to as}} a squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|As liquid based {{preparations}} (LBPs) {{become a}} common medium for testing, atypical result rates have increased. The median rate for all preparations with low-grade <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial lesions using LBPs was 2.9% {{compared with a}} 2003 median rate of 2.1%. Rates for high-grade <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial lesions (median, 0.5%) and atypical <b>squamous</b> cells have changed little.|$|E
25|$|Most vulvar cancer (approximately 90%) is <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma, which {{originates}} from epidermal <b>squamous</b> cells, {{the most}} common type of skin cell. Carcinoma-in-situ is a precursor lesion of <b>squamous</b> cell cancer that does not invade through the basement membrane. While this type of lesion is more common with older age, young women with risk factors may also be affected. In the elderly, complications may occur due to the presence of other medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Primary ovarian <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas {{are rare}} {{and have a}} poor {{prognosis}} when advanced. More typically, ovarian <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that variants of MC1R, even in heterozygotes and independent of their effects on pigmentation, are risk factors for basal cell carcinoma and <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma A review has discussed the role of some MC1R variants in melanoma and basal and <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas independent of pigment production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Squamous</b> cell carcinoma* is a {{malignant}} tumor in dogs that most commonly {{occurs in the}} oral cavity, including the tongue, tonsils, and gingiva. <b>Squamous</b> cell carcinoma accounts for 5 percent of skin tumors in dogs, and {{are the most common}} tumor of the toe. Dogs with unpigmented skin on the nose may develop this cancer from long-term sun exposure.|$|E
25|$|CD10 differentiates CD10+ {{atypical}} fibroxanthoma from CD10âˆ’ {{spindle cell}} melanoma and sarcomatoid <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{tumor marker}} Cyfra 21-1 {{may be useful}} in {{diagnosing}} <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma of the head/neck.|$|E
25|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} is {{a cancer}} of the <b>squamous</b> cell â€“ a kind of epithelial cell found in both the skin and mucous membranes. It accounts for over 90% of all head and neck cancers, including more than 90% of throat cancer. <b>Squamous</b> cell carcinoma {{is most likely to}} appear in males over 40 years of age with a history of heavy alcohol use coupled with smoking.|$|E
25|$|Exenteration (complete removal) of the orbit, {{especially}} for <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma in {{the cat and}} cow.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of oral cancer that mainly affect the tongue. Mostly these are <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|Betel nut chewing is {{associated}} with an increased risk of <b>squamous</b> cell cancer of the head and neck.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{changes in}} CDKN2A status are highly {{variable}} {{depending on the}} type of cancer. In addition to skin cancer such as melanoma, changes of CDKN2A have been described in a wide spectrum of cancer types such as gastric lymphoma, Burkittâ€™s lymphoma, head & neck <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma, oral cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, esophageal <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, epithelial ovarian carcinoma and prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Corrosive {{injury to}} the {{esophagus}} by accidentally or intentionally swallowing caustic substances is {{a risk factor for}} <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|More than 3.5 {{million cases}} {{of skin cancer}} are {{diagnosed}} annually in the United States, which makes it {{the most common form}} of cancer in that country. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer at some point of their lives. The most common form of skin cancer is basal-cell carcinoma, followed by <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma. Unlike for other cancers, there exists no basal and <b>squamous</b> cell skin cancers registry in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Oral cancer* {{includes}} {{tumors of the}} tongue, tonsils, gingiva, and palate. The {{most common}} types are <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and fibrosarcomas.|$|E
25|$|Oropharyngeal <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas (OSCC) {{begins in}} the {{oropharynx}} (throat), the middle part of the throat that includes the soft palate, {{the base of the}} tongue, and the tonsils. <b>Squamous</b> cell cancers of the tonsils are more strongly associated with human papillomavirus infection than are cancers of other regions of the head and neck. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer generally has a better outcomes than HPV-negative disease with a 54% better survival, but this advantage for HPV associated cancer applies only to oropharyngeal cancers.|$|E
25|$|Laryngeal cancer, {{also known}} as {{cancer of the larynx}} or {{laryngeal}} carcinoma, are mostly <b>squamous</b> cell carcinomas, reflecting their origin from the skin of the larynx.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} risk, but {{the effect}} in esophageal adenocarcinoma is slight compared to that in <b>squamous</b> cell carcinoma, and alcohol has not been demonstrated to be a cause.|$|E
