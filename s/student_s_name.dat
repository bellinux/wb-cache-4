40|$|This is an {{informal}} description of E. F. Codd’s model [2] that was originally drafted as part my {{contribution to a}} special edition of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing devoted to the history of relational model. It turned out to be too long and its level of detail was not thought to be suited to my article, which was to serve as the introductory article to that edition. The terminology is that used in The Third Manifesto by Chris Date and myself. Our terminology is mostly the same as Codd’s but we made a few changes in an attempt to clear up some matters that had given rise to confusion over the years. The notation used in my examples is taken from Tutorial D [3, 4], a language Chris Date and I devised as an example for teaching purposes. My description is in three main sections. First, in Definitions, I describe the objects that constitute a relational database. Then, in Relational Algebra, I describe the operators that are defined in the model for operating on those objects. Finally, Database Integrity covers the mechanism the model prescribes for maintaining consistency in a database. Differences between the current definition and Codd’s original are mentioned in footnotes. Definitions What’s a relation? Consider the sentence, “Student <b>S</b> 1, <b>named</b> Anne, is enrolled on course C 1 ”. Because {{it is the kind of}} sentence of which we can say, “That’s true”, or “That’s false”, it denotes a proposition. A predicate is a generalized form of a proposition in which some designators (such as S 1, Anne, and C 1) are replaced by symbols denoting parameters, 1 as in “Student StudentId, named Name, is enrolled on course CourseId. ” That sentence no longer denotes a proposition, but nevertheless it has the same declarative form as a proposition and thus denotes a predicate. Assuming the table in Figure 1 is to be interpreted according to this predicate, the first row of that table tells us that <b>student</b> <b>S</b> 1 is <b>named</b> Anne and is enrolled on course C 1, and the remaining rows similarly describe other enrolments. 1 Also called free variables. We prefer “parameter ” to avoid confusion with the term “variable ” as used in computer languages (and in the relational model) ...|$|R
40|$|The two aims of {{this paper}} are (i) to {{identify}} the factors influencing the decision {{to drop out of}} high school and (ii) to estimate how the risk of dropping out varies during a <b>student</b> <b>s</b> high school years. The study is based on data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study 1988 - 94 and uses event history techniques to investigate the dropout decision. A flexible piecewise-linear baseline hazard is estimated, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity both parametrically and non-parametrically. Factors such as previous educational attainment, ethnicity and a range of family background variables are found to influence the dropout decision. The risk of dropping out is estimated to vary substantially during the <b>student</b> <b>s</b> time in secondary school. ...|$|R
