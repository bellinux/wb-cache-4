5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in {{what appears to be}} a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{reported}} that Dr. Ademola Aremu, the National Treasurer of the Union, {{said that the}} story of Prof. Adewole 'IFA' as we popularly called him is the story of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> destined to serve humanity. His achievements as a provost of the college of medicine made him to receive overwhelming support from the university community when he indicated interest to serve on the university governing council and later on as vice chancellor. As vice chancellor, he totally turned the university around in terms of staff and student welfare, academically, University of Ibadan unarguably became the best in Nigeria {{and one of the best}} in Africa.|$|E

25|$|Mumps is {{considered}} most contagious {{in the five}} days after the onset of symptoms, and isolation is recommended during this period. In <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> admitted to the hospital, standard and droplet precautions are needed. People who work in healthcare cannot work for five days.|$|E
25|$|An {{associated}} attribute {{is highly}} accessible. This might be {{because it is}} evaluated automatically in normal perception or {{because it has been}} primed. For example, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> thinking about their love life who is then asked about their happiness might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than answer the question as asked.|$|E
25|$|Amazon also {{employs the}} use of drop shippers or meta sellers. These are members or {{entities}} that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have {{become more and more}} commonplace in recent years.|$|E

25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools {{consider}} it as a proper means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E
25|$|The badges for inductees are of {{a similar}} design to the sovereign's badge, though without {{precious}} stones, and slight differences for each grade. For Commanders, the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the gold central disk; for Officers, it is gilt with a gold maple leaf; and for Members, both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver. The reverse bears only a serial number, and all are topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign.

These same miniatures also serves as a lapel pin for civilian wear.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{admission}} {{into the}} Order of Merit of the Police Forces, members are gifted various insignia of the organization, though these remain {{property of the}} Crown. The badges are similar in design {{to those of the}} Order of Military Merit, consisting of a dark blue enamelled cross pattée with four equal arms, at the centre of which is a disc bearing a maple leaf on a white enamel background, surrounded at its edge by a red enamel ring (annulus) bearing the words MERIT • MÉRITE • CANADA. Slight differences in appearance represent each grade: for Commanders, the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the gold central disk; for Officers, it is gilt with a gold maple leaf; and for Members, both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver. The reverse bears only a serial number, and all are topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign.

50|$|The {{cross is}} {{situated}} near Crosshall farmhouse and {{is said to}} date from the 12th century, after the Second Crusade.

5000|$|Scottish author Irvine Welsh {{gave this}} {{estimate}} of his literary merit: [...] "Iceberg Slim {{did for the}} pimp what Jean Genet did for the homosexual and thief and William Burroughs did for the junkie: he articulated the thoughts and feelings of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there. The big difference {{is that they were}} white." ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{well-known}} {{stories about}} Bocher were first recounted by Robert Parsons in 1599: for instance, Joan's friendship with Anne Askew and her involvement in smuggling Tyndale's New Testament into England, {{and into the}} royal court under her skirts. According to Parsons in A temperate ward-word, he had learned these things from <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> present at her trial.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{have decided}} to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because I have any illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because {{there are things that}} I must say to you.

And in my own mind, only <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so intimately a victim of this madness as I have can do justice to what I have to say." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{said she}} wasn't {{interested}} in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which {{is a bit of}} a stern statement from <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. I was disappointed because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E
500|$|The Drug in Me Is You {{has been}} {{described}} as post-hardcore and pop punk. The songs also included synths, pop-choruses, and other sounds. Radke commented on the inclusion of different genres in songs, comparing different parts of the same song to the sounds of Norma Jean, Underoath, and Katy Perry. Lyrically, according to Radke, some of the songs on the album had tones of being arrogant, comparing the attitude to that commonly found in rap music. This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences, so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track [...] "Sink or Swim". In an interview, Radke's experiences were compared to Eminem's, noting that, [...] " [...] is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> knocked down and knocked down, and he’s gotten back up again. Time and time again. And he’s triumphed." [...] While the album itself was written during Radke's time in prison, he does not consider it a [...] "Jailhouse record", though some songs that did not make the album do address a prison theme.|$|E
50|$|In Gardnerian Wicca, as {{laid down}} by Gerald Gardner, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{initiated}} in the 1st degree had to create (or, alternately purchase and then engrave) their own ritual tools.

500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|The primary {{continued}} to grow more heated in February 2010. On February 5, the two candidates held their first face-to-face debate, and used the 30-minute forum to strongly criticize each other, with Sestak continuing to associate Specter with failed Republican policies and Specter arguing his opponent was more focused on criticizing him than debating policy. Sestak {{continued to}} attack Specter for switching parties, asking, [...] "Is the best the Democrats can do <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the other side, with respect, for 50 years, and cast 2,000 votes with President Bush?" [...] Likewise, Specter once again criticized Sestak's missed votes in Congress, which he said {{would have been enough}} to earn Sestak a court-martial for going AWOL in his former Naval career. Sestak also criticized Specter for voting in favor of the Iraq War, and Specter in turn condemned Sestak for supporting Obama's proposed troop increase for the War in Afghanistan, which Specter opposed. The next day, the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee voted to endorse Specter over Sestak, with 77 percent of voters supporting the incumbent Senator, or 229 votes compared to Sestak's 72. Sestak criticized the committee for its decision, but also argued it solidified his own position as a political outsider independent from the mainstream Washington establishment. Media outlets said the vote indicated Specter had convinced most important figures in the state party that he was not simply a crossover politician.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of the boy who said he {{recalled}} the life of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot, the sister of the deceased told Stevenson that her brother had shot himself in the throat.

5000|$|Other clips {{that ran}} between songs or at station {{identification}} breaks took {{the approach of}} a man-on-the-street interview, asking the question, [...] "And {{how do you know}} that Jesus is real in your life?"

5000|$|Sting {{described}} [...] "Wrapped Around Your Finger" [...] as [...] "a spiteful {{song about}} turning {{the tables on}} <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in charge." [...] Like other Police songs from this period, it features mythological and literary references, including the Scylla and Charybdis monsters of Greek mythology, and the German legend of Faust. It has a relatively slow, almost foreboding feel in the beginning verses, modulating to evoke a lighter, triumphant feel during the chorus.|$|R
