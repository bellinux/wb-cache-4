The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences {{in the quality of}} care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts.

In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the logic}} of the {{proximate}} determinants framework for child survival analysis, the study shows how the main socioeconomic inequalities in neonatal, post-neonatal, and child mortality observed in 1981 - 86 Ondo State were produced. Unlike most previous studies of early childhood mortality factors in Nigeria, the study explicitly investigates the linking mechanisms between key socio-economic factors and child survival. Local area infrastructural development is shown to be the main <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factor</b> in neonatal mortality while household disposable income status along with local area infrastructural development showed the strongest impacts upon post-neonatal mortality. Household disposable income status emerged as the main <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factor</b> affecting mortality during ages 1 - 4, with maternal education showing no strong effects even in this age segment where its impact may be expected to be most strongly felt. The integrated analysis demonstrates that much of the observed infant mortality advantage of residence in more developed local areas is due to easier physical and real access to modern health services and that most of the child mortality benefits conveyed by high household income status derive primarily from better home sanitary conditions and secondarily from better quality of curative and home care for very ill children...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> associated with mother's breastfeeding infants from 0 - 6 months old in Savalugu Nanton district of Northern Ghana. Although many previous studies have focused on <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> such as occupation, education and breastfeeding, much has not been done to tackle other factors including distance to primary fuel source, room density and their relationship with breastfeeding. Most of the recommendations from previous studies do not reflect local interest. Accordingly, this study is designed to address some of these gaps and focus more on local needs. METHOD: The Study is based on a survey conducted in Savelugu-Nanton of Northern Ghana in 2001 by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the International Food Policy Institute (IFPRI) and the University for Development Studies (UDS). One thousand six hundred and eighty- four households in sixty- four communities participated in the survey. The sample for the survey was 1588 children. Standardised and structured questionnaires were used in the survey. The questionnaire provided information on demographic characteristics, food consumption, <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors,</b> nutritional status, social support, household feeding practices, health of index child and community infrastructure. The standard multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the contribution of each of independent variables to the variance in the dependent variable. RESULTS: The results {{of this study indicate that}} breastfeeding correlated with number of food groups consumed and also with compound cleanliness. However there was no correlation between breastfeeding and most of the socioeconomic variables. This implies that the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> in this study are not important in predicting breastfeeding in Savalugu Nanton district of Northern Ghana. CONCLUSION: The current study showed a relationship between breastfeeding and compound cleanliness and also with number of food groups consumed. Most of the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> did not correlate with breastfeeding. This does not mean that other <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> are not important to predict breastfeeding. Previous studies in western countries and inter-country studies in Africa have indicated a significant relationship between breastfeeding and <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> such as occupation and education. It is therefore important that future studies in Savalugu Nanton district of Northern Ghana determine <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> appropriate to predict breastfeeding and for that matter the health of the child. In a very poor area like Savalugu Nanton, <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> may not only influence breastfeeding. Future research should therefore consider infrastructure and social amenities and their relationship with breastfeeding...|$|R

The questionnaire included questions pertaining to socioeconomic characteristics, dichotomous choice method questions pertaining to ambulance calls in hypothetical nonemergency situations, and questions on the city's emergency medical system. The probit model was {{used to analyze the}} data. Results A total of 2, 029 out of 3, 363 targeted recipients completed the questionnaire (response rate, 60. 3 %). Probit regression analyses showed that several demographic and <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> influence the decision to call an ambulance. Male respondents were more apt than female respondents to state that they would call an ambulance in nonemergency situations (p Conclusion Results of the study suggest that several <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors,</b> i. e., age, gender, household income, and possession of a car, influence a person's decision to call an ambulance in nonemergency situations.

Although integrating <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> into systematic conservation planning is increasingly advocated, {{research is needed to}} progress from recognition of these factors to incorporating them effectively in spatial prioritization of protected areas. We evaluated 2 key aspects of incorporating <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> into spatial prioritization: treatment of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>factors</b> as costs or objectives and treatment of stakeholders as a single group or multiple groups. Using as a case study the design of a system of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) in Kubulau, Fiji, we assessed how these aspects affected the configuration of no-take MPAs in terms of trade-offs between biodiversity objectives, fisheries objectives, and equity in catch losses among fisher stakeholder groups. The achievement of fisheries objectives and equity tended to trade-off concavely with increasing biodiversity objectives, indicating {{that it is possible to}} achieve low to mid-range biodiversity objectives with relatively small losses to fisheries and equity. Importantly, the extent of trade-offs depended on the method used to incorporate socioeconomic data and was least severe when objectives were set for each fisher stakeholder group explicitly.
