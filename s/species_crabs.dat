Red rock crabs dominate the more saline, cooler lower estuary and green crabs, the less saline, warmer upper estuary. Because caged green crabs survive well in the lower estuary, I decided to test the hypothesis that red rock crabs prey on green crabs and thus contribute to their exclusion from the more physically benign lower estuary. A laboratory species interaction experiment was designed to determine whether red rock crabs prey on smaller green crabs at a higher rate than on smaller crabs of their own <b>species.</b> <b>Crabs</b> of both species were collected and sorted by weight into three size classes: small, medium and large.

Snails with the heaviest shells (Sinotaia quadrata: Viviparidae) could not be attacked successfully by any crabs, and those with somewhat lighter shells (Melanoides tuberculata: Thiaridae) were protected from small crabs. 2) Among those light-shelled snails which could be attacked successfully, prey value (M/handling time, Ht) determined rank order of preference. Biomphalaria straminea (Planorbidae) with the highest M/Ht, was the species most readily eaten. When presented with a single snail <b>species,</b> <b>crabs</b> selected among different-size B. straminea {{in a way which}} maximized M/Ht. This preference was most strongly exhibited by small crabs. A lack of size selection for Radix plicatulus (Lymnaeidae) prey was in agreement with an absence of a clear influence of size on Ht for this species. Manipulation of M/Ht by attaching plastic discs to B. straminea shells (thereby increasing Ht) resulting in patterns of prey selection in accordance with the hypothesis that foraging S. sinensis maximized M/Ht. Partial consumption of R. plicatulus, and to a lesser degree Physella acuta (Physidae), was common when groups of snails were presented to individual crabs, and occurred more frequently when large snails were offered. Implications of patterns of prey selection were discussed with reference to the influence of crab predation on snail distribution and abundance in Hong Kong fresh waters. -from Authorslink_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{structurally}} diverse rocky shores {{along the}} northern coast {{of the state of}} São Paulo, Brazil, support a varied fauna and provide refuges for many organisms. Some of these environments allow for extensive microhabitats, among them the sand reefs formed by the polychaete Phragmatopoma lapidosa, which occupy much of this area. The beauty of the landscape attracts large numbers of tourists, who contribute to the damage to the sand reef colonies, causing an imbalance in the patterns of population distribution and of this ecosystem. We describe the structure and population biology of the redfinger rubble crab Eriphia gonagra, and investigated the differential occupation of the habitat by each demographic category of this <b>species.</b> <b>Crabs</b> were sampled monthly for two consecutive years on the rocky coast of Grande Beach, Ubatuba, São Paulo, during spring low tides. Sampling was carried out over an area of approximately 1200 m 2, during two hours on the rock surface and another two hours on the sand reefs. A total of 1407 crabs were collected; 776 on the sand reef (SR) and 631 on the rocky shore (RO). The majority of juvenile crabs inhabited the SR, while adult crabs were equally distributed in both microhabitats. This study showed that the SR is a natural nursery ground for the establishment of the early juvenile stages of E. gonagra, which use the reefs as a refuge and food resource. Many other organisms (mollusks, echinoderms, polychaetes etc.) settle on the reefs, and these areas may be among the most important in maintaining benthic diversity in the region...|$|E
40|$|Tropical nearshore {{ecosystems}} represent global hotspots {{of marine}} biodiversity and endemism but are often poorly understood and impacted by human activities. The Seychelles Archipelago (Western Indian Ocean) sustains {{a wealth of}} marine life, much of which is threatened by rapid development associated with tourism and climate change. Six marine parks exist within the Archipelago, but their biodiversity value and ecological health are poorly known, especially with regards to non-fish and coral species. Here we investigate spatial patterns of littoral biodiversity on 6 islands, 5 of which were granitic and within marine parks, including the first surveys of Curieuse and Ile Cocos. Our surveys formed a nested sampling design, to facilitate an examination of variability in species richness, faunal abundance, taxonomic distinctness and assemblage composition at multiple spatial scales, from islands (> 100 s km) to quadrats (metres). We identified (mostly to species) and enumerated two target taxa, brachyuran decapod crustaceans and gastropod molluscs, and recorded over 8300 individuals belonging to over 150 <b>species.</b> <b>Crabs</b> and gastropods exhibited different patterns of spatial variability, as crab assemblages were generally more distinct between islands, while gastropod assemblages were markedly variable at the smallest spatial scales of ‘patch’ and ‘quadrat’. Intertidal biodiversity was greatest on Curieuse Island and least at Desroches, the latter was being the only coral atoll we surveyed and thereby differing in its geological and ecological context. We discuss likely drivers of these biodiversity patterns and highlight urgently-needed research directions. Our assessment {{of the status of}} poorly-known invertebrate assemblages across the Seychelles will complement more extensive surveys of coral and fish assemblages and, in doing so, provide a useful baseline for monitoring the effects of key stressors in the region, such as coastal development and climate change...|$|E

Q- 16 " and Long. 72 "- 75 " 46) are presented. Bottom trawling was conducted at 33 stations. A total catch of 1795 kg was realised, out of which the discards formed 31 1 kg. A variety of non-conventional finfishes (77 species) and shellfishes (shrimps 8 <b>species,</b> <b>crabs</b> 3 species, one species of lobsterette) have been recorded. Depth-wise 235 m zone indicated the maximum catch. The total catch during the entire cruise was dominated by Psenopsis ryanra. The various population parameters such as La, K, total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M), fishing mortality (F), exploitation ratio (E), recruitment pattern and length-weight relationship {{of some of the}} important species have been worked out. In most of the deep-sea fishes, the recruitment appeared to take place almost throughout the year and showed great similarity among the various species except Luciobrotula bartschi. Presently, all these resources remain unexploited, except the shrimps. The trawlers based at Cochin, Quilon and Munambam have been exploiting the deep-sea shrimp resources like the red-ring Arbreus alcocki from the Quilon Bank and other similar areas of< west coast for the last five years. Interestingly Psenopsis cyanea has been found to occur as bye-catch in these fishing operations. Therefore, these two species showed higher fishing mortality compared to practically nil value in other finfishes and shellfishes. The occurrence of the deep-sea glass sponge, Hyalonema sp. off Mangalore is also reported. Bio-silica, extracted from this sponge, has a vide range of applications in the medical field from novel biomaterials for bone replacements to the stabilization of tissue. Most of the resources being nonconventional there is need to evolve new processing methods, product diversification and develop export avenues to make deep-sea fishing venture a success.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} predatory {{behaviour}} of Cancer novaezelandiae (Decapoda : Brachyura : Cancridae), a subtidal crab from Lyttelton Harbour, Banks Peninsula. Cancer crabs were obtained at bimonthly intervals over a 22 month sampling period. Examination of stomach contents suggested that C. novaezelandiae was an opportunistic predator feeding {{on a wide}} variety of food items. Molluscs composed the major components of diet, with bivalves and gastropods comprising 35 % of all food items. Crustacea were the next most important group comprising 20 % of all food items. Amphipods, isopods and crabs were the most frequent crustaceans found. Other food types included fish, sponges, coelenterates and plant matter in relatively low abundances. No variation in dietary composition was evident with crab sex, size or season. The functional morphology of the chelae, mouthparts and gastric mill were examined for two size-classes of crab (60. 0 - 70. 0 and 120. 0 - 130. 0 mm carapace width). The mouthparts and gastric mill were generalised in structure and were typical of large, predatory brachyurans. Large crista dentata of the third maxilliped and sharp, rounded mandibles, together with large, heavily chitinised gastric mill ossicles suggested that C. novaezelandiae was well equipped to macerate course, particulate matter. No variation in either mouthparts and gastric mill structure was evident with crab size or sex. Left and right chela of C. novaezelandiae were morphologically similar in shape and dental pattern, and no difference was found between sexes. Relative growth of the chelae was described from measurements made on propodus height and length using carapace width as the reference dimension. Log-transformed regressions were used to test for allometric growth and lines were compared using t-tests. No significant difference was found in the growth of the propodus between left and right chelipeds, and for males and females. Relative growth of the propodus was positively allometric which remained constant throughout crab growth. No discontinuity in growth of the propodus was evident for male and female crabs (however for male crabs over 110 mm carapace width there was a slight indication of increased propodus growth). Both left and right chela of male and female crabs had a large diastema, and mean mechanical advantage of 0. 367 and 0. 375 respectively. The high mechanical advantage of the chela in C. novaezelandiae appeared to remain constant throughout crab growth, allowing a compressive force in excess of 496 kN. m⁻². The polyfunctional chela are therefore, capable of holding, manipulating and crushing a variety of prey shapes. Predator-prey experiments were undertaken in the laboratory using male crabs of three size classes (55. 0 - 65. 0, 80. 0 - 90. 0 and 105. 0 - 115. 0 mm carapace width). Prey used included blue mussel Mvtilus edulis aoteanus, cockle Chione stutchburyi, spotted whelk Cominella maculosa and catseye Turbo smaragdus. C. novaezelandiae adopted five distinct techniques to open bivalve and three techniques to open gastropod shells. The particular opening technique used was influenced by crab size, prey size and success of previous attempts. Small molluscs were usually opened by direct crushing by the chela and/or mouthparts. Splitting of the umbone valves and removal of the aperture lip were the most successful techniques used to open large bivalves and gastropods respectively. Handling times increased exponentially with prey size, with large crabs requiring less time to open prey than small crabs. Prey species influenced handling times with bivalves opened more quickly than gastropods. Critical maximum prey size increased with crab size, while minimum critical size was smaller for small crabs. Different sized crabs consumed similar numbers of prey, but energy intake increased with crab size. Profitability curves were derived and tested with regard to optimal prey size and species. When presented with a size range, crabs selected prey sizes that minimized time spent foraging. However when presented with different prey <b>species,</b> <b>crabs</b> maximized energy intake by selecting optimum prey species. Findings suggested C. novaezelandiae exhibited a flexible foraging behaviour, which allows crabs to maximize feeding efficiency. This was discussed in the context of the ecology of the crab and the Energy Maximization Premise (Elner and Hughes, 1978) ...|$|E
