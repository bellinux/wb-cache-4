5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 {{she left}} Drury Lane and {{subsequently}} appeared {{from time to}} time on the stage of the rival establishment, Covent Garden. It was there, on 29 June 1812, that she gave perhaps the most extraordinary farewell performance in theatre history. She was playing her most famous role, Lady Macbeth, and the audience refused to allow the play to continue {{after the end of the}} sleepwalking scene. Eventually, after tumultuous applause from the pit, the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own clothes and character — whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience lasting eight minutes.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) see Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> car {{eating a}} sandwich. She {{explains}} {{that she has}} begun eating lunch in her car to get some time away from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), whom she is starting to despise. [...] Pam advises Erin to tell Gabe her real feelings as soon as possible. This amuses Jim, given Pam's history with Roy Anderson, and he leaves {{in order to avoid}} the temptation to comment on the irony.|$|E

A charity called WishmakerUK has arranged for pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, {{much to the}} excitement of Jan, accompanied by his personal assistant Si and WishmakerUK representative Sally.

Later, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is upset about Frankie's death. Si says {{that no one can}} touch anything or call an ambulance until Frankie's manager arrives. Tamsin, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> wheelchair, holds the balloon; and Graham and Si realise that it may be valuable. Si takes the balloon from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally takes a call from her boss, but does not mention Frankie's death. She makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at the house. Graham and Si argue over the balloon, and Graham gives it to Sally, as he considers her [...] "a neutral". He looks online to work out how much the balloon and accompanying footage may be worth.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Ella Brown is {{the only child of}} a poor widower. Their home is {{in a small town in}} the Middle West, and Ella has never seen New York (City), although she has always wanted to go there. Her father, finding times hard, decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska, and when the play opens, is about to start there. He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt, a sour old person who runs a boarding house, who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl. As she has no other relatives, there is nothing for her to do except submit. <b>Sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> room one evening, tired after a day's hard work, she looks at her two treasured magazines, one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion. The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes, and falls asleep. In her dream she is transported to New York, where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires. Ella greatly enjoys her visit, and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up. But she finds that her dream will become reality before long, for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luckett {{was born}} on March 11, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She grew up singing in her local Brentwood Baptist Church. She also took vocal lessons to become an opera singer. Her father, {{who was also a}} singer, was very proud of his daughter's vocal talents and tried to get her in the music business. Luckett is the older of two children. Luckett was given the chance to sing her first solo at the age of five. [...] "The lady just gave me the mic one Sunday and I sang," [...] she recalled. Shortly thereafter, she joined the children's choir and began {{performing}} in plays at her elementary school. One day, she walked to her desk in class to find a girl <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> seat. Luckett asked her teacher to remove the girl (who turned out to be Beyoncé Knowles) from her assigned seat. They later became friends and she was invited to join Beyoncé's singing group Girls Tyme, which later became Destiny's Child.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1990s, King {{was subject}} to {{multiple}} break-ins and encountered Lyndon Fitzgerald Pace, a man who admitted killing women in the area. He broke in {{the house in the}} middle of the night and found her while she was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bed. After nearly eight years of staying in the home following the encounter, King moved to a condominium unit which had also been the home, albeit part-time, for singers Elton John and Janet Jackson. In 1999, the King family finally succeeded in getting a jury verdict saying her husband was the victim of a murder conspiracy after suing Loyd Jowers, who claimed six years prior to having paid someone other than James Earl Ray to kill her husband. On April 4, 2000, King visited her husband's grave with her sons, daughter Bernice and sister-in-law. Regarding plans to construct a monument for her husband in Washington, D.C., King said it would [...] "complete a group of memorials in the nation's capital honoring democracy's greatest leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and now Martin Luther King, Jr." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversy}} over the tactics used by the MCPD ensued, with reports of officers walking down I-270 between stopped cars with weapons drawn, telling people {{to get back in}} their vehicles, and demanding commuters pop their trunks without any explanation why. One woman was reportedly shouted at by police with weapons drawn after she'd opened her car door to throw up, having gotten motion sickness from <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> vehicle {{for an extended period of}} time. Chief Thomas Manger defended the MCPD's actions, stating that they were justified under exigent circumstances. Don Troop, a man who witnessed the incident, told the Washington Post that a group of officers made its way to his car and other cars around him. [...] "They were just walking along saying: 'Pop the trunk! Pop the trunk!'" [...] Troop said he overheard a man in a truck next to him call out to another motorist: [...] "The police are looking for bank robbers." [...] A short time later, about nine officers approached his car — including state troopers, county police officers, and at least one plainclothes officer. Among the commands given to motorists by officers were: [...] "stay in your car", [...] "pop the trunk", [...] "get your hands on the steering wheel", and [...] "get you hands up where we can see them", according to Troop. Corporal Aaron Smith, a pilot flying a Prince George's County police helicopter dispatched to assist stated that he [...] "saw that they were searching traffic and going vehicle to vehicle." [...] MCPD spokesman Captain Paul Starks described the incident as a [...] "systematic check of trunks and rear hitches" [...] of detained vehicles.|$|E
