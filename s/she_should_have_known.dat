60|$|She {{had been}} deeply stirred by her {{encounter}} with Stoller, but she entered with impartial intensity into {{the fact that}} the elevator at Pupp's had the characteristic of always coming up and never going down with passengers. It was locked into its closet with a solid door, and there was no bell to summon it, or any place to take it except on the ground-floor; but the stairs by which she could descend were abundant and stately; and on one landing there was the lithograph of {{one of the largest and}} ugliest hotels in New York; how ugly it was, <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not seen it there.|$|R

60|$|I {{turned and}} saw that she had {{deliberately}} slipped {{to the ground in}} the very path of the cruel demons who pursued us, thinking that by lightening the burden of my mount it might thus be enabled to bear me to the safety of the hills.

It has always been first with me, and always will. She has never {{accepted}} that, she is incapable of accepting it. I am sorry for her. But what would you? I was a fool to marry her. Chere mademoiselle, no troubles are anything beside the trouble which goes on day and night, meal after meal, year, after year, between two people who should never have married, because one loves too much and requires all, and the other loves not at all--no, not at all, now, it is long dead--and can give but little." ...|$|E

She has never given up hope, and has always insisted that you were alive, for she said that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> surely <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> if you <b>had</b> died. So she taught me her language, until I could speak like a native; and two years and a half ago, she came out here with me.|$|R
60|$|He found Olga {{very little}} altered, but she, on her part, protested that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him again. He had thought very often of {{her during the}} years which had passed, but {{although}} he had steadfastly clung to the determination he had expressed to his friend Hawtry, of some day marrying her if she would have him, he was now more alive than before {{to the difference between}} her position and his. The splendid apartments occupied by the count, his unlimited expenditure, the beauty of his carriages and horses, all showed Jack the difference between a great Russian seigneur and a lieutenant on half-pay. Feeling that he was becoming more and more in love with Olga, he determined to make some excuse to leave Paris, intending upon his return to apply at once to be sent on active service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk to ME, boy! Don't {{attempt to}} apologise for her. Such conduct is unpardonable. She OUGHT to have died. It was her clear duty.

60|$|Nature {{is always}} acting like that. Mrs. X. said (of course) that the {{caterpillar}} was not conscious and didn't suffer. <b>She</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better. No caterpillar can deceive Nature. If this one couldn't suffer, Nature {{would have known}} it and would have hunted up another caterpillar. Not {{that she would have}} let this one go, merely because it was defective. No. She would have waited and let him turn into a night-moth; and then fried him in the candle.|$|E
6000|$|And {{more than}} that, even {{had it been}} {{impossible}} for me to reach the steamer, I should have endeavored to reach Bertha's heart. I should have told her that I loved her. Whether she were lost or I were lost, or both of us, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> I loved her. She might {{not have been able to}} answer me, but she could have heard me. For that terrible mistake, that crime, there was no pardon. Now every chance was gone. What reason was there to suppose that these two derelicts ever again would drift together? ...|$|E
60|$|When we came back, {{it was in}} the evening. The {{first person}} who met me in the house was my kind mother, who fell into my arms with many tears, and who rebuked me tenderly for not having told her of my necessities. <b>She</b> never <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of them, <b>she</b> said; but she had not heard from me since I wrote announcing the birth of the child, and she felt uneasy about my silence; and meeting Mr. Smithers in the street, asked from him news {{concerning}} me: whereupon that gentleman, with some little show of alarm, told her that he thought her daughter-in-law was confined in an uncomfortable place; that Mrs. Hoggarty had left us; finally, that I was in prison. This news at once despatched my poor mother on her travels, and she had only just come from the prison, where she learned my address.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{although}} {{you may not}} have supposed it, Proserpina found it impossible to take leave of poor King Pluto without some regrets, and a good deal of compunction for not telling him about the pomegranate. She even shed a tear or two, thinking how lonely and cheerless the great palace would seem to him, with all its ugly glare of artificial light, after she herself,--his one little ray of natural sunshine, whom he had stolen, to be sure, but only because he valued her so much,--after <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> departed. I <b>know</b> not how many kind things she might have said to the disconsolate king of the mines, had not Quicksilver hurried her away.|$|R
60|$|He had {{abundance}} {{of time to}} ruminate on this discovery, for Tim Linkinwater was absent during {{the greater part of}} an hour, during the whole of which time Nicholas thought of nothing but the young lady, and her exceeding beauty, and what could possibly have brought her there, and why they made such a mystery of it. The more he thought of all this, the more it perplexed him, and the more anxious he became to know who and what <b>she</b> was. 'I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her among ten thousand,' thought Nicholas. And with that he walked up and down the room, and recalling her face and figure (of which he had a peculiarly vivid remembrance), discarded all other subjects of reflection and dwelt upon that alone.|$|R
60|$|Jane Humphreys {{was much}} puzzled {{as to what}} step she should take first. During all these years she had waited she had always {{expected}} that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> which was her own child {{as soon as she}} set eyes on the boys, and was surprised and disappointed to find that even after a week's stay at Cheltenham, and examining their faces as closely as she could, she had not the slightest idea which was which. She had imagined that she should not only know, but feel an affection for the boy who was her own, and she had fully intended to place him in the position of Captain Clinton's heir, trusting to receive the promise of a large sum from him when he should come into possession.|$|E
6000|$|Leonard was angry. When {{it began}} to dawn upon him what was the purpose of Stephen's speech, he had been shocked. Young men are so easily shocked by {{breaches}} of convention made by women they respect! And his pride was hurt. Why should he {{have been placed in}} such a ridiculous position! He did not love Stephen in that way; and <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it. He liked her and all that sort of thing; but what right had she to assume that he loved her? All the weakness of his moral nature came out in his petulance. It was boyish that his eyes filled with tears. He knew it, and that made him more angry than ever. Stephen might well have been at a loss to understand his anger, as, with manifest intention to wound, he answered her: ...|$|E
6000|$|His new spring overcoat, another prize {{from the}} Misfit Parlours, {{and his new}} pointed-toe shoes, and Derby hat, with the suit of clothes he had kept so {{carefully}} all through the winter, were not the complete disguise he had fancied they might be at Willoughby Pastures. The depot-master had known {{him as soon as}} he got out of the cars, and ignored his splendour in recognising him. He said, [...] "Hello, Lem," [...] and had not time to reconcile himself to the boy's changed appearance before Lemuel hurried away with the bag he had bought so long before for the visit. He met several people on his way home from the depot: two of them were women, and one of these said she knew as soon as she looked at him who it was, and the other said <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it was Lem Barker as far as she could see him.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the French Civil Code on the effective Serbian Law on Obligations from 1978 in respect of the cause of contract. This is an institution in respect of which the Law conspicuously departs from the Swiss Law on Obligations, which served as its prime legislative model, and follows the path designated in the French code. The author concludes that the Serbian law transcripts almost verbatim the rules of law in the French code pertaining to the cause of contract. However, its provisions are somewhat more detailed than those of the French counterpart, since it explicitly governs the impact of motives on the validity of a contract as well. Analyzing the Serbian case-law, the author concludes that motives gain legal relevance in Serbian contract law in two different ways. On the one hand, courts confirm the proposition adopted in the doctrine that in gratuitous contracts (permitted) motives pertain to the notion of cause. On the other hand, illicit, non-permitted motives make gratuitous contracts void regardless whether the other party acted in good faith or not, while they render onerous contracts void only if the other party acted in bad faith, that is, he or <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that the first party was guided by illicit motives to conclude the contract...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she got up}} {{and stood}} alone on the floor, {{thinking}} of it all. There she stood for ten minutes thinking of it. She would follow him and, not throwing herself on her knees--but standing boldly before him, tell him all. There was no disgrace in it,--to have loved that other man. Of her own conduct she was confident before all the world. There had been so little secrecy about it that she almost had a right to suppose that it <b>had</b> been <b>known</b> to all men. The more she tried to bring herself to follow him and tell him, the more she assured herself {{that there should be no}} necessity. How ought she to have told him, and when? At every point of his story <b>should</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> made <b>known</b> to him the same point in hers? [...] "It was exactly the same with me." [...] "I wouldn't have my young man because he was indifferent." [...] "With yours there was another lover ready. That has yet to come with me." [...] "You have come abroad for consolation. So have I." [...] It would have been impossible;--was impossible. [...] "I think it nicer as it is," [...] he had said, and she could not do it.|$|R
6000|$|Very good. A dumpy, motherly little body, in decent shawl and {{the cleanest}} of {{possible}} nightcaps, stood before this toilet, {{hard at work}} apparently doing me the kindness of [...] "tidying out" [...] the [...] "meuble." [...] Open stood {{the lid of the}} work-box, open the top drawer; duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in turn: not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded, not a paper but was glanced over, not a little box but was unlidded; and beautiful was the adroitness, exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished. Madame wrought at it like a true star, [...] "unhasting yet unresting." [...] I will not deny that it was with a secret glee I watched her. Had I been a gentleman I believe Madame would have found favour in my eyes, she was so handy, neat, thorough in all she did: some people's movements provoke the soul by their loose awkwardness, hers--satisfied by their trim compactness. I stood, in short, fascinated; but it was necessary to make an effort to break this spell a retreat must be beaten. The searcher might have turned and caught me; there would have been nothing for it then but a scene, and she and I would have had to come all at once, with a sudden clash, to a thorough knowledge of each other: down would have gone conventionalities, away swept disguises, and I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> looked into her eyes, and <b>she</b> into mine--we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that we could work together no more, and parted in this life for ever.|$|R
60|$|When {{at last he}} {{got away}} he walked home in a bad humor; he was even annoyed with Olive. Granting that {{what she had done}} was natural enough under the circumstances, and that she had not wished to stop when she saw him in company with a woman she did not like, he thought she might have {{considered}} him as well as herself. <b>She</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that it would give him great trouble for her to dash by in that way and neither stop nor come back to explain matters. She must have known that Maria Port was not going to stay always, and she might have waited somewhere until the woman had gone. If she had had the least idea of how much he wanted to see her she would have contrived some way to come back to him. But no, she went back to Broadstone to please herself, and left him to wander up and down the roads looking for her in the dark.|$|E
60|$|Penelope also wove a [Greek: charos] {{against the}} burial of old Laertes, but surely {{she ought to}} have woven for him; on Helbig's showing Hector had two, Patroclus had only one; Patroclus is in the old epic, Hector and Laertes are in the Ionian epics; therefore, Laertes should have had two [Greek: charea] but we only hear of one. Penelope had to finish the [Greek: charos] and show it; [Footnote: Odyssey, XXIV. 147.] now {{if she wanted to}} delay her marriage, she should have begun the second [Greek: charos] just as {{necessary}} as the first, if Hector, with a pair of [Greek: charea] represents Ionian usage. But Penelope never thought of what, had she read Helbig, she would have seen to be so obvious. She thought of no funeral garments for the old man but one shroud [Greek: speiron] (Odyssey, II. 102; XIX. 147); yet, being, by the theory, a character of late Ionian, not of genuine old AEolic epic, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better. It is manifest that if even the acuteness and vast erudition of Helbig can only find such invisible differences as these between the manners of the genuine old epic and the late Ionian innovations, there is really no difference, beyond such trifles as diversify custom in any age.|$|E
60|$|And so {{the longing}} grew upon her. Then, almost {{for the first}} time, did she begin to feel that it was {{necessary}} for the purposes of her life that the girl whom she loved so thoroughly, should be a creature in her hands, to be dealt with as she pleased. She would have had her daughter accede to the proposed marriage even before she had seen Lord Lovel, and was petulant when her daughter would not be as clay in the sculptor's hand. But still the girl's refusal had been but as the refusal of a girl. She should not have been as are other girls. <b>She</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better. She should have understood what the peculiarity of her position demanded. But it had not been so with her. She had not soared as she should have done, above the love-laden dreams of common maidens. And so the visit to Yoxham was permitted. Then came the great blow,--struck as it were by a third hand, and that the hand of an attorney. The Countess Lovel learned through Mr. Goffe,--who had heard the tale from other lawyers,--that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel had, with her own mouth, told her noble lover that she was betrothed to a tailor! She felt at the moment that she could have died,--cursing her child for this black ingratitude.|$|E
5000|$|Despite 20 {{years of}} {{psychological}} testing, which concluded that D.J. is severely mentally disabled, Stubblefield considered D.J. mentally capable, having {{the capacity to}} understand questions, communicate using facilitated communication, and give consent to sex. Prosecutors argued that FC has been scientifically discredited and that D.J. {{did not have the}} ability to give consent for or to refuse sexual relations. Stubblefield pleaded not guilty to the charges, but was put on administrative leave without pay and removed as chair of the philosophy department. D.J. was not allowed to testify using facilitated communication as it was ruled unreliable under New Jersey law. Experts evaluating D.J. testified {{he did not have the}} intellectual ability to consent to sexual activity. After a three-week trial, the jury found Stubblefield guilty of two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault. After conviction, the judge revoked bail saying that she was a flight risk. Sentencing, with possible penalties of between ten and twenty years in prison on each count, was scheduled for January 15, 2016. Stubblefield filed a motion to have the jury's verdict set aside on the grounds that there was [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] to prove that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that D.J. was not capable of giving consent. On January 15, 2016, she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. She will be required to register as a sex offender. In a press release, the Assistant Prosecutor, Eric Plant, said: [...] "Knowing how desperately families of disabled individuals are for some hope, she misled the victim's family into believing that she was making progress in helping their son to communicate while all the while she was simply satisfying her own tawdry desires".|$|R
