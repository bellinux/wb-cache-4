It is because of this quick turnover rate that the cell is extremely sensitive to mitogenic signaling levels, which not only stimulate cyclin D production, but also help to stabilize cyclin D within the cell. In this way, cyclin D acts as a mitogenic <b>signal</b> <b>sensor.</b> Cdk inhibitors (CKI), such as the Ink4 proteins and p21, help to prevent improper cyclin-cdk activity.|$|E

Together, these subunits form the phytochrome region, which regulates physiological changes in plants to changes in red and far red light conditions. In plants, red light changes phytochrome to its biologically active form, while far red light changes the protein to its biologically inactive form.|$|E
50|$|Neural {{networks}} are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition. Neural networks must be trained with example data before {{being able to}} generalise for experimental data, and tested against benchmark data. Neural {{networks are}} {{able to come up}} with approximate solutions to problems that are hard to solve algorithmically, provided there is sufficient training data. When applied to gene prediction, neural networks can be used alongside other ab initio methods to predict or identify biological features such as splice sites. One approach involves using a sliding window, which traverses the sequence data in an overlapping manner. The output at each position is a score based on whether the network thinks the window contains a donor splice site or an acceptor splice site. Larger windows offer more accuracy but also require more computational power. A neural network is an example of a <b>signal</b> <b>sensor</b> as its goal is to identify a functional site in the genome.|$|E

50|$|In metrology, {{such as when}} {{performed}} in support of science, engineering or manufacturing objectives, dynamic range refers to the range of values that can be measured by a sensor or metrology instrument. Often this dynamic range of measurement is limited {{at one end of}} the range by saturation of a sensing <b>signal</b> <b>sensor</b> or by physical limits that exist on the motion or other response capability of a mechanical indicator. The other end of the dynamic range of measurement is often limited by one or more sources of random noise or uncertainty in signal levels that may be described as the defining the sensitivity of the sensor or metrology device. When digital sensors or sensor signal converters are a component of the sensor or metrology device, the dynamic range of measurement will be also related to the number of binary digits (bits) used in a digital numeric representation in which the measured value is linearly related to the digital number. For example, a 12-bit digital sensor or converter can provide a dynamic range in which the ratio of the maximum measured value to the minimum measured value is up to 212 = 4096. With gamma correction, this limitation can be relaxed somewhat; for example, the 8-bit encoding used in sRGB image encoding represents a maximum to minimum ratio of about 3000.|$|E

IEEE 1451 and ISA- 100 standardization is working on common interfaces for industrial applications. The lack of standards in the field of sensor manufacturer require each sensor to be integrated individually to a wireless sensor node. This thesis presents the design of a sensor integration process for Tampere University of Technology Wireless Sensor Network (TUTWSN). The integration process eases the sensor integration, shortens the required time to integrate a sensor, and minimizes the frequency of errors and the presence of software bugs. The included documentation minimizes the loss of information in multi-partner projects. The integration process consists of five major phases: selecting a sensor, hardware integration testing, integration to a node, integration to a server infrastructure, and testing phases. The focus of this thesis is in the node and its embedded software. The integration process is tested with five sensors which are integrated to TUTWSN.

Most localization techniques apply RSSI-based ranging techniques to compute the location of the object in a wireless sensor network. However, a wireless sensor network is a fading-signal environment that has noise, which causes RSSI to become unstable and leads to abrupt distance estimates. In this paper, we propose the Verification-Based Localization Method (VBLM) to alleviate the effect of unstable signals to provide high-accuracy location estimates in wireless sensor environments. VBLM filters noisy signals in the localization process. The sensor node uses a neighboring beacon to help verify the quality of received signal under acceptable communication cost.
