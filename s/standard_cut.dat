5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a <b>standard</b> <b>cut</b> off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} idea of obtaining valid inequalities from a finite-domain {{formulation}} of a problem, rather than a 0 - 1 formulation. A finite-domain model represents discrete choices with variables that have several possible values, as is frequently done in constraint programming. We apply the idea to graph coloring and identify facet-defining cuts that, when converted to cuts in a 0 - 1 model of the problem, provide tighter bounds on the chromatic number than known 0 - 1 cuts. In particular, we show that finite-domain cuts for webs and odd holes are superior to <b>standard</b> <b>cuts,</b> and that two cuts for an odd cycle (a generalization of an odd hole) yield substantially tighter bounds, in much less time, than {{hundreds or thousands of}} <b>standard</b> <b>cuts.</b> We also identify a large family of facet-defining cuts for intersecting systems, for which there are apparently no previously known 0 - 1 cuts...|$|R

40|$|Associated to each {{ultrafilter}} U on ω {{and each}} map p:ω→ω is a Dedekind {{cut in the}} ultrapower ω^ω/p(U). Blass has characterized, under CH, the cuts obtainable when U is taken to be either a p-point ultrafilter, a weakly-Ramsey ultrafilter or a Ramsey ultrafilter. Dobrinen and Todorcevic have introduced the topological Ramsey space R_ 1. Associated to the space R_ 1 is a notion of Ramsey ultrafilter for R_ 1 generalizing the familiar notion of Ramsey ultrafilter on ω. We characterize, under CH, the cuts obtainable when U is taken to be a Ramsey for R_ 1 ultrafilter and p is taken to be any map. In particular, we show that the only cut obtainable is the <b>standard</b> <b>cut,</b> whose lower half consists of the collection of equivalence classes of constants maps. Forcing with R_ 1 using almost-reduction adjoins an ultrafilter which is Ramsey for R_ 1.

The corresponding array of unit cells has a simple modulated structure.
