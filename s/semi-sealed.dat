50|$|To {{maintain}} their inherent accuracy and ensure long life, great care {{is needed to}} avoid contamination with dirt and abrasive particles. This may be achieved by using rubber or leather bellows to completely or partially enclose the working surfaces.

50|$|The {{basic form}} of a {{wallpaper}} steamer is a <b>semi-sealed</b> container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water {{is added to the}} container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of pressure pipe. At the end of the pressure pipe is a flat plate about 30 cm square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the pressure pipe and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the design}} and {{construction}} of a pulse high repetition rate (HRR), transverse atmospheric pressure (TEA) CO 2 laser with ultra violet preionization is presented. In this laser, normal pure, industrial gases and also a combination of spark and corona preionization are used. In <b>semi-sealed</b> off condition, we obtained 220 watts at 300 Hz, % 7. 7 efficiency, 735 mJ/pulse. The best records that we reached separately were 1. 1 J/pulse, 320 Hz PRR, 11 MW peak power and 10. 6 % efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Although DC {{power is}} not exactly a high {{frequency}} technology, it is required for operation of all electronic equipment. In particular, batteries are important for communications systems, providing backup during power outages, as well as being the main power storage and delivery devices in remote sites powered by wind or solar energy. A new book [1] has an excellent chapter on battery systems for telecommunications facilities. For this column, we’ll summarize some of the basic information about batteries presented in that chapter. Battery Types Most storage battery systems use lead-acid batteries. These batteries are either “wet cell ” or vented leadacid (VLA) type, or the <b>semi-sealed</b> valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) type. VLA cells are available with capacities from 50 to 8000 Ah, while VRLA cells are typically offered in capacities from 50 to 2000 Ah. Lead-acid batteries store energy through an electrochemical conversion process involving the lead negative plate, the lead dioxide positive plate and the sulfuric acid electrolyte. The reaction is described by the following diagram...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} {{results in}} constant enlarging of the artificial area closed to water infiltration. In 2006 – 2008, the Soil Sealing Enhancement (SSE) database was {{the part of}} the GMES Fast Track Service on Land Monitoring. The accuracy of the final product set by the authors should reach at least 85 %. Orthorectified high resolution aerial photos of Poland were used to develop reference data constituting 20, 000 random samples around the country. In each sample, the points were classified into three possible surface classes: natural, artificial and <b>semi-sealed.</b> Comparison of reference data to original project statistics revealed the values of accuracy, commission and omission errors in the SSE dataset. Although, SSE accuracy in Poland fulfils the criteria set by SSE authors with overall accuracy of 99. 5 %, the individual analysis for each category reveals many weaknesses. Preliminary interpretation of mistakes leads {{to the conclusion that the}} spatial resolution of pictures used in the SSE project is insufficient. In several cases, validation proved that omission errors were made in relation to construction sites or recently constructed buildings. It should be stated that the accuracy of SSE product for Poland should be treated as the maximum value of impervious surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Air {{revitalization}} technologies {{maintain a}} safe atmosphere inside spacecraft by {{the removal of}} C 02, ammonia (NH 3), and trace contaminants. NH 3 onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is produced by crew metabolism, payloads, or during an accidental release of thermal control refrigerant. Currently, the ISS relies on removing NH 3 via humidity condensate and the crew wears hooded respirators during emergencies. A different approach to cabin NH 3 removal is to use selective catalytic oxidation (SCO), which builds on thermal catalytic oxidation concepts that could {{be incorporated into the}} existing TCCS process equipment architecture on ISS. A low temperature platinum-based catalyst (LTP-Catalyst) developed at KSC was used for converting NH 3 to H 20 and N 2 gas by SCO. The challenge of implementing SCO is to reduce formation of undesirable byproducts like NOx (N 20 and NO). Gas mixture analysis was conducted using FTIR spectrometry in the Regenerable VOC Control System (RVCS) Testbed. The RVCS was modified by adding a 66 L <b>semi-sealed</b> chamber, and a custom NH 3 generator. The effect of temperature on NH 3 removal using the LTP-Catalyst was examined. A suitable temperature was found where NH 3 removal did not produce toxic NO, (NO, N 02) and N 20 formation was reduced...|$|E
