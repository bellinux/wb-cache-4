5000|$|Device-dependent USB class drivers {{available}} for USB mass <b>storage</b> and HID <b>keyboard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Technical - Data that {{describes}} the CI's capabilities which include software version and model numbers, hardware and manufacturer specifications and other technical details like networking speeds and data <b>storage</b> size. <b>Keyboards,</b> mice and cables are considered consumables.|$|R
50|$|USB On-The-Go with {{built-in}} support for mass <b>storage</b> devices, HID <b>keyboard,</b> mice, and USB headphones.|$|R
50|$|An {{optional}} keyboard accessory {{is available}} for the Pixel C. The tablet can attach to the keyboard magnetically via a hinge (to use as a laplet), or the keyboard can {{be attached to the}} front or back of the tablet for <b>storage.</b> The <b>keyboard</b> connects via Bluetooth and is battery powered; when keyboard is snapped {{to the front of the}} tablet, it can be charged inductively by the tablet itself.|$|R
5000|$|DJ-70mkII: Successor to the DJ-70, {{with more}} {{powerful}} features, including a DJ sampling music workstation, which featured a scratch wheel pad. It {{is essentially an}} S-760 sampler with a <b>keyboard.</b> <b>Storages</b> on 3.5" [...] DS/DD floppy disk drive ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the Pravetz series 8 {{personal}} computers, {{manufactured in}} Bulgaria, which were equipped with decent dedicated displays, floppy discs and good quality keyboards, the entire series used a TV {{set for a}} monitor (by standard TV-UHF via coaxial cable, composite video, or RGB) and a standard tape recorder as data <b>storage.</b> The <b>keyboards</b> were of low quality. The KC 85/1 used an integrated calculator-style keyboard with small [...] "keys" [...] of hard plastics, while KC 85/2-4 used a separate keyboard driven by a remote control IC.|$|R
50|$|Construction was {{completed}} in 2009 for the Student Union expansion that {{has more than doubled}} the amount of space available for students. An $8-million science building opened in 2011. The 26000 sq ft science building is located west of the current Jonas Science wing. Clare and Josef Meier Hall, a state-of-the-art a music and classroom building, was added in the center of campus in 2003. This 44919 sq ft building includes a 280-seat recital hall, choir and band rooms, faculty studios, classrooms, soundproof practice rooms, conference rooms, instrument <b>storage</b> areas, <b>keyboard,</b> listening and piano labs and faculty offices.|$|R
50|$|The Edge 91z was {{described}} as being simple with a seamless front and two removable feet that could be detached from the AIO. The space between the two feet was open and meant to store a keyboard. This {{was described}} as being different from the IdeaCentre B520 desktop, in which the <b>keyboard</b> <b>storage</b> was blocked by the speaker bar.|$|R
25|$|The most {{identifiable}} Wang minicomputer performing recognizable {{data processing}} was the Wang 2200 {{which appeared in}} May 1973. Unlike some other desktop computers such as the HP 9830, it had a CRT in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled cassette tape <b>storage</b> unit and <b>keyboard.</b> Microcoded to run interpretive BASIC, about 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide.|$|R
50|$|During 1958 Montauk AFS {{joined the}} Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-01 at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. After joining, the {{squadron}} was redesignated as the 773d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1958. It {{was also a}} major part of the NORAD defense system, so security was very tight. Montauk AFS was state of the art and many new systems were developed or tested there including magnetic memory for <b>storage,</b> light pens, <b>keyboards,</b> WANs (Wide area networks) and modular circuit packaging.|$|R
50|$|The Wang 2200 {{appeared}} in May 1973, and was Wang Laboratories' first minicomputer that could perform data processing {{in a common}} computer language. Unlike some other desktop computers, such as the HP 9830, it had a cathode ray tube (CRT) in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer-controlled cassette tape <b>storage</b> unit and <b>keyboard.</b> Microcoded to run interpretive BASIC, about 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide. The 2200 evolved into a desktop computer and larger system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that {{appeared in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s. The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single cluster.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of laptops is that, {{due to the}} size and configuration of components, usually relatively little {{can be done to}} upgrade the overall computer from its original design or add components. Internal upgrades are either not manufacturer-recommended, can damage the laptop if done with poor care or knowledge, or in some cases impossible, making the desktop PC more modular and upgradable. Desktop PCs typically have a case that has extra empty space inside, where users can install new components. Some internal upgrades to laptops, such as memory and hard disk drive upgrades are often easily performed, while a display or keyboard upgrade is usually difficult or impossible. Just like desktops, laptops also have the same input and output ports for connecting {{to a wide variety of}} devices, including external displays, mice, cameras, <b>storage</b> devices and <b>keyboards,</b> which may be attached externally through USB ports and other less common ports such as external video. Laptops are also a little more expensive compared to desktops, as the miniaturized components for laptops themselves are expensive.|$|R
