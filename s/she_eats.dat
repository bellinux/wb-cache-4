5|$|The film often {{features}} shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows {{are present}} {{from the very}} first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as <b>she</b> <b>eats,</b> and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the very end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.|$|E
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
25|$|Jadis {{makes her}} way to the garden on a {{mountain}} west of Narnia, where <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: her skin is bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.|$|E

25|$|Ofelia {{completes the}} first task—retrieving a key from {{the belly of}} a giant toad—but becomes worried about her mother, whose {{condition}} is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, which eases Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task—retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Although she was warned not to consume anything there, <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, a queen {{or another}} female will eat eggs laid {{in her own}} colony. The {{majority}} of the time <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> the eggs of her subordinates, however, a female may occasionally eat her own eggs. Queens also undertake egg inspections {{to see if the}} eggs in the nest are their own or if they were laid by a subordinate. The majority of oophagies are committed by the queen (87.5%). Oviposition is the laying of eggs. Queens lay 83.3% of the eggs in pre-emergence colonies, which is a significantly higher rate of oviposition than that of subordinates. Workers were never observed eating or laying eggs.|$|E
25|$|The workers {{carry out}} {{nearly all the}} basic work, like {{creating}} and fixing damage to the nest, getting food, and feeding the larvae. The queen's primary job is to lay eggs. When there is an active queen, workers often have undeveloped ovaries. However, when the queen is removed, 11% of workers develop mature ovaries. This is reproductive suppression under {{the power of the}} queen. If there are any eggs found that are not laid by the queen, <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> them (oophagy). Most of these eggs were likely laid by subordinates. Queens often get to rest in the central areas of the nest close to the growing larvae while subordinates and workers often position themselves in the outer areas of the nest.|$|E

Had <b>she</b> <b>eaten</b> the entire pomegranate (and thus all the seeds), {{she would have}} been condemned to the underworld permanently. Because <b>she</b> only <b>ate</b> half, <b>she</b> was forced to stay in Hades for six months of every year. During the other six months, she was reunited with her mother, Demeter, on the surface world.|$|R

500|$|Westenra {{has been}} known as a vegetarian/pescetarian. In 2007, she was {{nominated}} for PETA's 'Sexiest Vegetarian'. However, when touring she sometimes has worried about getting the appropriate amounts of nutrients. She was sometimes unable to obtain the more nutritious vegetables and other foods she preferred, and now on occasions <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> meat. In 2007, Westenra told The New Zealand Herald, [...] "I'm completely bursting the bubble now, aren't I? That's that ruined." ...|$|E
500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{point out}} in The Classic Fairy Tales (1999) that the tale has a [...] "partial analogue" [...] in [...] "Snow White": the lost princess enters the dwarfs' house, tastes their food, and falls asleep {{in one of their}} beds. In a manner similar to the three bears, the dwarfs cry, [...] "Someone's been sitting in my chair!", [...] "Someone's been eating off my plate!", and [...] "Someone's been {{sleeping}} in my bed!" [...] The Opies also point to similarities in a Norwegian tale about a princess who takes refuge in a cave inhabited by three Russian princes dressed in bearskins. <b>She</b> <b>eats</b> their food and hides under a bed.|$|E
500|$|Marceline the Vampire Queen is a {{character}} in the American animated television series Adventure Time created by Pendleton Ward. She is voiced by Olivia Olson in most appearances, by Ava Acres {{as a child and}} by Cloris Leachman as an old woman. Marceline is a fun-loving 1,000-year-old vampire queen. The name [...] "Marceline" [...] is based on the middle name of a childhood friend of Ward's, Marie. The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead-character designer and prop designer for Adventure Time. Unlike a traditional vampire, Marceline does not need to drink blood to survive; rather, <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> the color red. Marceline is a musician who plays an electric bass that she made from her family's heirloom battle-axe.|$|E

500|$|The 2012 {{campaign}} from Clemenger BBDO for the TenderGrill for the Australian Burger King franchise, Hungry Jack's, {{featured a}} goth girl, complete with facial piercings and tattoos that loses her piercings and tattoos as <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> the sandwich. By {{the time she}} has finished her meal, her clothing and style had completely changed– much to her and her friends horror. At {{the end of the}} commercial, the announcer states the tag line [...] "There is nothing naughty about the new Hungry Jack's TenderGrill... Hungry Jack's makes it better." [...] The Australian Advertising Standards Bureau received several complaints from the public claiming the commercial demeaned alternative lifestyles, was discriminatory and insulting to non-conformists. The Advertising Standards Board determined that the advertisement did not breach any pertinent anti-discrimination codes, and dismissed the complaint.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of popular}} demand and {{favorable}} reception of Deadly Alliance, {{the number of}} finishing moves, known as Fatalities, increased to two per character. The Fatalities were developed {{by a group of}} animators led by Carlos Pesina; they comically described Mileena's Fatality in which <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> the opponents' neck as the most disturbing due to how her [...] "sexy moves" [...] are modeled from Pesina. The Hara-Kiri moves were added to allow the losers to perform a finishing move as well, creating a race between both players. The Death Traps, meant to be introduced in the previous game, were added to give the combat more strategy as well as to give more chances to players to win a fight if they are at a disadvantage. The game was originally meant to have other new finishing moves, such as tortures and falling cliffs similar to Fatalities.|$|E
500|$|While {{singing at}} Elyria's Harvest Festival, Elena {{is struck by}} a curse that forces her to flee the Elyrian army with Aeron. They are led by Mavda to the Thirteen Towers, with Elena having been {{partially}} transformed into a monster by this point. Mavda reveals {{that the only way}} to lift the curse from Elena and prevent her transformation is to feed her the flesh of [...] "Masters", powerful beings living inside the Towers. Given the Oraclos Chain, Aeron explores the Towers and kills each of its Masters, returning to give their flesh to Elena. Each time <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> Master Flesh, she receives visions detailing the events behind the Towers' creations. Five hundred years before, in an attempt to end the War of Unification, the people of Elyria and the Vestra decided to embody the twelve deities of Impedia in physical formsthe Towers' Masterswith a thirteenth vessel providing balance between them in a project dubbed Experiment Zero.|$|E

500|$|Traces {{of beliefs}} in that demon are {{preserved}} among South Slavs in expressions {{for the bad}} weather common in early spring (baba Marta, babini jarci, babine huke, etc.). Brought to the Balkans from the ancient homeland, these beliefs combined {{with those of the}} native populations, eventually developing into the personage of the ala. The pre-Slavic Balkan source of the ala is related to the vlva, female demons of bad weather of the Vlachs of Serbia, who, like ale, led hail clouds over crops to ruin them, and uprooted trees. A Greek female demon Lamia might also have [...] contributed {{in the development of the}} ala. Just like ale, <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> children, and is called gluttonous. In southern Serbia and Macedonia, lamnja, a word derived from lamia, is also a synonym for ala. The Bulgarian lamya has remained a creature distinct from the ala, but shares many similarities with her. The numerous variations in form of ale, ranging from the animal and half-animal to the humanlike concepts, tell us that beliefs in these demons were not uniform.|$|E
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E

These acorns she chewed into pats, and dried in the sun, to eat at other times, like a savage.|$|R

2500|$|A {{photograph}} of Smith {{was used by}} New York magazine {{on the cover of}} its August 22, 1994, issue titled White Trash Nation. In the photo, she appears squatting in a short skirt with cowboy boots as <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> chips. In October 1994, her lawyer T. Patrick Freydl initiated a $5 million lawsuit against the magazine, claiming that Smith did not authorize the use of her photo; the suit also alleged that the article damaged her reputation. Her lawyer stated Smith {{was under the impression that}} she was being photographed to embody the [...] "all-American look." [...] Editor Kurt Anderson said that the photo was one of dozens taken for the cover, further stating [...] "I guess they just found the picture we chose unflattering." [...] The lawsuit was reported to be settled.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter One – Down the Rabbit Hole: [...] Alice {{is feeling}} bored and drowsy while {{sitting on the}} {{riverbank}} with her older sister, who is reading a book with no pictures or conversations. She then notices a White Rabbit wearing a waistcoat and pocket watch, talking to itself as it runs past. She follows it down a rabbit hole, but suddenly falls {{a long way to}} a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled [...] "DRINK ME", the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key, which she has left on the table. <b>She</b> <b>eats</b> a cake with [...] "EAT ME" [...] written on it in currants as the chapter closes.|$|E
2500|$|Fellow Australian celebrities have praised Arena's vocal prowess with Delta Goodrem saying, [...] "Her {{voice has}} {{strength}} whilst keeping its feminine warmth to draw you in." [...] Melbourne singer/songwriter, Michael Paynter hailed Arena as [...] "simultaneously {{the most natural}} and supernatural female Australian voice ever. She is technically and emotionally perfect, but somehow always has enough of a sniff of imperfection and rawness to make you not only believe every word, but be hanging off them too." [...] Ricki-Lee Coulter also says that [...] "She has so much control and power". Missy Higgins also commented that, [...] "Tina Arena {{is one of our}} best singers ever. She could sing the balls off anyone, and she's miniature." [...] Brian Mannix says, [...] "Tina Arena has a tasteful voice. She sells the lyrics with her big voice but never over-sings." [...] Birds of Tokyo frontman says, [...] "Tina Arena can sing the shit out of anything, and do it in four different languages!" [...] Anthony Callea added, [...] "Technically, she is faultless and her tone is unique and warm. I love that she goes against all the 'singers' rules' – I've seen what <b>she</b> <b>eats</b> and drinks before a gig!" [...] Darren Hayes also made an effort in letting the public know that Arena's voice is one of his favourite voices in Australia through Twitter.|$|E
