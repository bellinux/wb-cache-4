The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: Trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. irritability). Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender. Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.|$|E

T7 temper is achieved by overaging (meaning aging past the peak hardness) the material. This is often accomplished by aging at 100-120 °C for several hours and then at 160-180 °C for 24 hours or more. The T7 temper produces a micro-structure of mostly eta precipitates. In contrast to the T6 temper, these eta particles are much larger and prefer growth along the grain boundaries. This reduces the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> corrosion cracking.

5000|$|The HPA Axis {{was present}} in the {{earliest}} vertebrate species, and has remained highly conserved by strong positive selection due to its critical adaptive roles. [...] The programming of the HPA axis is strongly influenced by the perinatal and early juvenile environment, or “early-life environment.” [...] Maternal stress and differential degrees of caregiving may constitute early life adversity, which {{has been shown to}} profoundly influence, if not permanently alter, the offspring's stress and emotional regulating systems. Widely studied in animal models (e.g. licking and grooming/LG in rat pups), the consistency of maternal care has been shown to have a powerful influence on the offspring's neurobiology, physiology, and behavior. Whereas maternal care improves cardiac response, sleep/wake rhythm, and growth hormone secretion in the neonate, it also suppresses HPA axis activity. In this manner, maternal care negatively regulates stress response in the neonate, thereby shaping his/her <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> in later life. These programming effects are not deterministic, as the environment in which the individual develops can either match or mismatch with the former's “programmed” and genetically predisposed HPA axis reactivity. Although the primary mediators of the HPA axis are known, the exact mechanism by which its programming can be modulated during early life remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, evolutionary biologists contest the exact adaptive value of such programming, i.e. whether heightened HPA axis reactivity may confer greater evolutionary fitness.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate whether the bioincompatibility phenomena occurring during hemodialysis (HD) (where neutrophil activation with increased free radical production is well documented) may have detrimental effects on RBC. We evaluated RBC <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> before and after HD in 15 patients using Cuprophan, cellulose triacetate, and polysulfone membrane. RBC were incubated with t-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidizing agent both in the presence and in the absence of the catalase inhibitor sodium azide. The level of malonaldehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, was measured at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min of incubation. When Cuprophan membrane was used, the MDA production was significantly higher after HD, indicating an increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> in comparison <b>to</b> pre-I-ID. The addition of sodium azide enhanced this phenomenon. Both cellulose triacetate and polysulfone membranes did not significantly influence RBC <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress.</b> Neither the level of RBC reduced glutathione nor the RBC glutathione redox ratio changed significantly during HD with any of the membranes used. The RBC <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> was influenced in different ways according to the dialysis membrane used, being increased only when using the more bioincompatible membrane Cuprophan, where neutrophil activation with increased free radical production is well documented.

[...] Dutch Landraces are responsive 22% of the time (vs. 3% for Dutch Yorkshires), and those responsive to the test are almost ten times likelier to die during the fattening period than responsive Dutch Yorkshires. [...] Two 1980 follow-up studies by the same team of researchers found that the Dutch Landrace's susceptibility is inherited as [...] "a single recessive autosomal trait", and [...] "the gene for this trait affects production traits", including carcass and meat quality. [...] Three genotypes (genetic strains) have been identified in the breed: Heterozygous for (carrying but not expressing) the gene, and homozygous either for (expressing) the gene, or not possessing it at all. The heterozygous has an intermediate carcass and meat quality and a selection advantage. The homozygous for reactivity to halothane had lowest meat quality, though highest meat production of the three genotypes, and as noted in the first study, its high reactivity level can be used for screening. [...] It also has the lowest percentage loss at slaughter. Halothene-reactive castrated males, as opposed to un-modified boars, differed from non-reactive in [...] "all carcass and meat quality traits", and had [...] "significantly lower feed conversion ratios". Halothene reactivity seems to be more heritable from the sire than the dam; in a population with an average 24.9% of individuals being reactive, 40.7% of those with reacting sires were themselves reactive, vs. 21.3% without.|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{promising}} future for use of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) {{in the prevention of}} cancer and cardiovascular diseases, it is necessary to ensure that their consumption does not result in detrimental oxidative effects. The aim of the present work was to test a hypothesis that low doses of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) do not induce harmful modifications of oxidative cell metabolism, as modifications of membrane fatty acid composition occur. Wistar rats received by gavage oleic acid, EPA, or DHA (360 mg/kg body weight/day) for a period of 1 or 4 wk. Fatty acid composition and alpha-tocopherol content were determined for plasma, red blood cell (RBC) membranes, and liver, kidney, lung, and heart microsomal membranes. <b>Susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide was measured in RBC. EPA treatment increased EPA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) content in plasma and in all the membranes studied. DHA treatment mainly increased DHA content. Both treatments decreased arachidonic acid content and n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio in the membranes, without modifying the Unsaturation Index. No changes in tissue alpha-tocopherol content and in RBC <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> were induced by either EPA or DHA treatment. The data suggest that EPA and DHA treatments can substantially modify membrane fatty acids, without increasing <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> oxidative <b>stress,</b> when administered at low doses.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of the natural gas industry, gas transmission pipelines have been developed rapidly in terms of safety, economy and efficiency. Our recent studies have shown that an important factor of main pipelines serviceability loss under their long-term service is the in-bulk metal degradation of the pipe wall. This leads to the loss of the initial mechanical properties, primarily, resistance to brittle fracture, which were set in engineering calculations at the pipeline design stage. At the same time stress corrosion cracking has been identified as one of the predominant failures in pipeline steels in humid environments, which causes rupture of high-pressure gas transmission pipes as well as serious economic losses and disasters. In the present work the low-carbon pipeline steels with different strength levels {{from the point of view}} of their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> corrosion cracking in the as-received state and after in-laboratory accelerated degradation under environmental conditions similar to those of an acidic soil were investigated. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether {{the development}} of higher strength materials led to greater <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> corrosion cracking and whether degraded pipeline steels became more susceptible to stress corrosion cracking than in the as-received state. The procedure of accelerated degradation of pipeline steels was developed and introduced in laboratory under the combined action of axial loading and hydrogen charging.
