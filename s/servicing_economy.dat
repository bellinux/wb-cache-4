Since the adoption of reform and opening policies, China's <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> has entered a new era of rapid development, especially in recent years. Notwithstanding, there are several domestic scholars considering that China’s <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> not only lag behind the developed countries but also many developing countries. Through the comparison of several developed countries and developing countries, this paper analyses the real level of the development of China’s <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> This paper finds out that China’s <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> is not simply backward and slow, which means that the promotion of <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> should not simply focus on the development of the quantity but the acceleration of the optimization and upgrading of the structure, which is called the improvement of the quality. We should pay more attention to the structural adjustment of the <b>service</b> <b>economy,</b> especially in the context of the global financial crisis which blocks the development of China’s <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> Place undu...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the varieties and dynamics of <b>service</b> <b>economies</b> in Europe, analysing {{the role of}} knowledge base and innovative efforts and their evolution across time and countries. Results based on aggregated macroeconomic data indicate {{that there is no}} convergence trend towards a single <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> model. Moreover, different <b>service</b> <b>economies</b> models can be associated with institutional and welfare state diversity. When analysing a comprehensive set of indicators at a disaggregated level a more detailed pattern of <b>service</b> <b>economies</b> emerges. The structural composition of countries plays a prominent role, while heterogeneity is driven by uneven knowledge bases and innovative efforts...|$|R

Model 1 a implies that these countries will become <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> at some time in future. Afterward, everything can happen according to Model 1 a, i.e., the economies may become agricultural or manufacturing economies again or remain <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> forever. In general, Model 1 a may be regarded as an ‘optimistic’ model, since it states that all economies (belonging to the group C) will become <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> at some point in time.|$|R
40|$|The modern <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> relies {{not just}} on the {{manufacture}} of products but on their correct functioning. This measuring of how systems work means that qualitative and non-monetarized considerations are becoming more important. The notion of risk and the management of vulnerability and uncertainty become key issues in the <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> Consideration has now to be given to both risks which those involved can influence and also those over which there is no control. It is essential to adapt to the new <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> and see the opportunities for real economic and social growt...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} often linked to <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> Sustainable {{economic}} growth is based upon economic, environmental and social sustainability. Some argue that economic and environmental sustainability has its foundation on social sustainability. By analysing the effects of <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> on society, one can identify potential threats to social sustainability. Theoretical analysis is supported by historical events {{from around the world}} focusing on highlighting threats that <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> countries are exposed to. Findings were that while on short term post-industrial economies boost development and sustainability, on long term countries are facing challenges in terms of ageing population, sustainable communities and access to social equity. Furthermore, depending on local policies, in some cases a trade-off is needed among factors in order to reach the highest level of social sustainability...|$|R

40|$|An era of {{industrialisation}} {{is making}} way {{for what has}} become termed the global <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> that is essentially characterised by uncertainty, discontinuous change, extensive competition, and complex contextual conditions. In this paper strategy and culture, as two interdependent domains of management are analysed, from a traditional scientific management and a complexity theory perspective, {{as a means of}} gaining a competitive advantage within the <b>services</b> <b>economy.</b> An important conclusion derived from the analysis is that organisational culture cannot be intentionally managed to support a specific strategy that is to be implemented, as it essentially is emergent in nature. At best unfavourable emergent cultural patterns may be disrupted and favourable patterns encouraged. This has significant implications for strategic management within the <b>services</b> <b>economy.</b> It is also suggested that the rational analytical models of strategy formulation and implantation, that assumes linear causality, are no longer deemed to be an effective response to the complex nature of the <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> and that an emergent strategic process is far better suited for dealing therewith. A central tenet underpinning such an approach is the emergence of a culture that facilitates participation and open-ended discussions, enabling participants to make-sense of contextual conditions that are arising at the peripheral edge. It is a process that entails looking at the emergent context from widely different perspectives and experimenting to find a possible innovative strategic response for gaining a competitive advantage in the global <b>services</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Services {{constitute}} over 50% of GDP in {{low income}} countries and as their economies continue to develop, {{the importance of}} <b>services</b> in the <b>economy</b> continues to grow. The <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> is also key to growth, for instance it accounted for 47% of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa over the period 2000-2005 (industry contributed 37% and agriculture 16% in the same period). This means that recent economic growth in Africa relies as much on services as on natural resources or textiles, despite many of those countries benefiting from trade preferences in primary and secondary goods. As a result, employment is also adjusting to the changes and people are leaving the agricultural sector to find work in the <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> This job creation is particularly useful as often it provides employment for low skilled labour in the tourism and retail sectors, thus benefiting the poor in particular and representing an overall net increase in employment.

In his search for ways to effectively fight poverty, he formulated the basis for a new view of economy based on the Industrial Revolution. Two centuries later, the perspective he developed remains intact and is largely outdated. It does not reflect the radical shift from an industrial to a <b>service</b> <b>economy,</b> which occurred during the later half of the 20 th century and prevails today. Insurance, a very important component of the modern <b>service</b> <b>economy,</b> was and has been ignored or dismissed by past and contemporary economists.

[...]) the {{dynamics}} of these economies {{will be the same}} as the future dynamics of today’s developed countries (see below for a discussion of Model 1 b’s predictions of the future dynamics of developed economies). In general, Model 1 b is even more ‘optimistic’ than Model 1 a is: It does not only state that all economies (belonging to the group C) will become <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> {{at some point in time}} but also that they will be able to sustain this development (i.e., stay <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> forever).|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The paper aims {{to answer}} to the {{following}} questions: which are the critical dynamic capabilities {{to survive in the}} rubber landscape of <b>service</b> <b>economy?</b> Does it exist in <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> a dynamic capabilities provider? Methodology. The paper combines the literature review on dynamic capability perspective and that on vicariance to the Project Management professional services. Findings. Firstly, the paper identifies vicariance as an intriguing dynamic capability, crucial to survive in the rubber landscape of <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> Secondly, the paper sheds light on Project Management (PM) as a vicarious that provides vicariance. Practical implications. For each critical organizational dimension, the paper identifies the links among the <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> challenges and the vicariance typology required to the project manager to face those challenge. Originality/value. The approach to conceive the PM as a vicarious that provides vicariance is original and leads to new insights on the professional services management. In fact, on one hand, dynamic capabilities cannot easily be bought through a market transaction; on the other hand, they must be built. This building can be achieved internally, by the organization itself (i. e. hierarchy), or through a partnership (i. e. hybrid form among hierarchy and market). PM professional services enrich organizations with additional information variety according to a hybrid (i. e. non- market) coordination model...|$|R

40|$|Many CEO's {{and economists}} are in {{agreement}} that our future economy, if not our present one, will be dominated by global business and a <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> The existing literature, however, fails to explain the influence and application {{of the principles of}} strategic management in a global <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> Competitive Strategies for Service Organizations fills that gap, providing an understanding of the major changes that will affect players in this economy. The picture this book paints is a complex one: the economic model based on the availability of capital is being replaced by one relying on innovation and intellectual capital-the cornerstone of the <b>service</b> <b>economy.</b> Current management strategy theory and its practical application are to some degree out of sync with this emerging model. Drawing on international examples for their case-study material, the authors, Botten and McManus balance their exposition of theory with real-world examples organized around the emerging service model...|$|R
