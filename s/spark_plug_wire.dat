5000|$|The wire {{from each}} spark plug is {{just long enough}} to reach the distributor, without excess. Each end of a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> has a metal {{terminal}} that clips onto the spark plug and distributor, coil, or magneto. There are dedicated <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from a spark plug without damaging it.|$|E
50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|E
50|$|Mario Andretti quickly charged {{from last}} {{starting}} position {{to run as}} high as 13th in the early going. However, he was forced to pit to change a bad <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b> He lost 8 laps, and was effectively out of contention {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|E
50|$|Placing <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> {{back into}} their {{separators}} or holders during replacement helps {{to keep them in}} place despite engine vibration, extending their life. A common problem with <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> is corrosion of the metal end terminals. Better-quality <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> usually have brass terminals, which are more resistant to corrosion than other metals used.|$|R

50|$|Automotive <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> are {{insulated}} {{by multiple}} layers of silicone to prevent sparks from jumping to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines with forced induction).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> have {{an outer}} {{insulation}} several times thicker than the conductor, {{made of a}} very flexible and heat-resistant material such as silicone or EPDM rubber. The thick insulation prevents arcing from the cable to an earthed engine component. A rubber [...] "boot" [...] covers each terminal. Dielectric grease {{can be used to}} improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help seal out moisture. Printing on <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> may include a brand name, insulation thickness (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).|$|R
50|$|Older engines {{also have}} a wire {{connecting}} the ignition coil to the distributor, known as a coil wire. A coil wire is of the same construction as a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire,</b> but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an ignition coil built inside them, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate coil wire, e.g. GM High energy ignition system and some Toyotas and Hondas.|$|E
50|$|It uses Sequential Electronic Fuel Injection, has an {{aluminum}} head and 4 valves per cylinder with some versions using VVT-i, {{along with a}} cast-iron cylinder block. The VVT-i version also featured DIS {{in favor of the}} traditional distributor set-up previously seen on the 2JZ-GE. Despite common misconception it was not a true COP (Coil-On-Plug, also known as Plug-top coil) ignition system instead relying on one coil to fire two cylinders, one of which was by <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{timing light}} {{may be a}} {{self-contained}} instrument, but is sometimes combined with a voltmeter, RPM meter, and a dwell angle meter, or may be incorporated into a more comprehensive instrument such as an engine analyser. Self-contained units used to time automotive engines have an inductive pickup that clamps around the proper <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> and serves as the trigger for the strobe. Power for the strobe comes directly from the vehicle's battery. Some older timing lights require {{the removal of the}} spark plug boot in order to attach a direct pickup between the wire's terminal and the centre conductor of the spark plug.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{car engines}} have {{multiple}} ignition coils (one for {{each pair of}} cylinders) built into a coil pack, {{eliminating the need for}} a distributor and coil wire. Some car engines use a small ignition coil mounted on top of each <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> eliminating the need for <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> entirely.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Champion was {{purchased}} by Cooper Industries {{and is now a}} wholly owned brand of Federal-Mogul Corporation. Its main products are a line of <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{for a wide range of}} cars, trucks, SUVs, racing and marine applications. Also included in the brand are <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> and other ignition system specific wiring.|$|R
50|$|They have no {{high voltage}} {{electrical}} ignition system, resulting in high reliability and easy adaptation to damp environments. The absence of coils, <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires,</b> etc., also eliminates {{a source of}} radio frequency emissions which can interfere with navigation and communication equipment, which is especially important in marine and aircraft applications, and for preventing interference with radio telescopes.|$|R
50|$|Another sort of {{ignition}} system commonly used on small off-road motorcycles in the 1960s and 1970s was called Energy Transfer. A coil under the flywheel generated a strong DC current pulse as the flywheel magnet moved over it. This DC current flowed through a wire to an ignition coil mounted {{outside of the}} engine. The points sometimes were under the flywheel for two-stroke engines, and commonly on the camshaft for four-stroke engines. This system worked like all Kettering (points/coil) {{ignition system}}s... the opening points trigger {{the collapse of the}} magnetic field in the ignition coil, producing a high voltage pulse which flows through the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> to the spark plug.|$|E
50|$|Berry {{was born}} in Newton, North Carolina and owned LGM Ltd., a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> {{manufacturing}} business in Catawba County, North Carolina. A businesswoman, Berry served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1993 to 2000, where she chaired the welfare reform committee and co-chaired the commerce committee. In November 2000, she was elected state labor commissioner, {{the first woman to}} hold the post. A Republican, (the only Republican on the Council of State between 2001 and 2005), she bested Democrat Wayne Goodwin to win a second term in the 2004 statewide elections. Berry narrowly defeated Mary Fant Donnan to keep her seat in the 2008 election. Berry won a fourth four-year term in November 2012, defeating former Labor Commissioner John C. Brooks by more than 280,000 votes. Berry won a fifth four-year term in November 2016 , defeating former Raleigh mayor Charles Meeker by more than 476,000 votes, her largest percentage margin of victory.|$|E
5000|$|... 1978: Mario {{squeezed}} in another attempt at Indy during his full-time Formula One effort. Mario plans to qualify at Indy {{during the first}} weekend of time trials (which was an off-week for F1). He is quickly up to speed during practice, running an [...] "unofficial" [...] track record of 203.482 mph. He went into the weekend as a favorite for the pole, but {{the first two days}} of time trials were rained out. He was forced to leave and go back to Europe for the Belgian Grand Prix. During the second weekend of time trials, Mike Hiss was drafted as a substitute, and qualified the car for Mario (he qualified 8th fastest). Mario himself won at Belgium. On race day, Mario got back in the cockpit and the car was moved {{to the back of the}} field due to the driver change. Early in the race, Andretti lost 8 laps when he had to make a long pit stop to change a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b> He was effectively out of contention very early on, and wound up 15 laps down at the finish.|$|E
50|$|The {{top of the}} <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> {{contains}} a terminal to connect to the ignition system. The exact terminal construction varies depending {{on the use of}} the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> Most passenger car <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> snap onto the terminal of the <b>plug,</b> but some <b>wires</b> have eyelet connectors which are fastened onto the plug under a nut. Plugs which are used for these applications often have the end of the terminal serve a double purpose as the nut on a thin threaded shaft so that they can be used for either type of connection.|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, Trionic {{systems are}} {{shortened}} to indicate which version they are, e.g. T5, T7, T8, etc. The engines with T5 had red direct ignition modules which differentiate them visually from the T7 models {{which had a}} black ignition module. The ignition module on both T5 and T7 are an integral ignition coil and electronics that plugs directly onto the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{without the use of}} <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> that are typically used on most engines.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, when Oswalt {{was with}} the Class A Michigan Battle Cats in the Midwest League, he {{suffered}} an apparently serious shoulder injury. After a month of pain in his upper shoulder, Oswalt was convinced that his shoulder was torn. Shortly thereafter, he was checking the spark plug wires on his pickup truck. He touched one of the spark plug wires, causing the truck's engine to start. The truck's electric current flowed through Oswalt's body, and consequently {{the muscles in his}} hand tightened on the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire.</b> Unable to let go of it, Oswalt grasped the wire for almost one minute. Oswalt then claimed his foot slipped off the truck's bumper and he was finally [...] "thrown off." [...] After the electric shock, Oswalt told his wife that his shoulder's condition improved and that he no longer felt any pain. According to Sports Illustrated, he reported it thus to his wife: [...] "My truck done shocked the fire out of me, and my arm don't hurt no more." [...] Apparently, the electric charge loosened accumulated scar tissue in the shoulder. Oswalt claims he has not felt any pain in his shoulder since the incident. He finished 1999 with 143 strikeouts and a club-high 13 wins.|$|E
50|$|By late 1977, he {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Frank Williams, who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team. Williams Grand Prix had struggled for success in its first years and Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a Lola 333CS in the Can-Am series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the Laguna Seca race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in Brian Redman finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to Elliot Forbes-Robinson at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wire,</b> retired through accident at St Jovite and lost a radiator at Watkins Glen. He finished third at Trois-Rivières after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and Keke Rosberg finished 1-2, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at Watkins Glen. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the Williams FW07, after winning four races in the span of five events {{near the end of the}} season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign. Jones's best years in Formula One had just begun, in the middle of the ground-effect era.|$|E
50|$|Both {{direct and}} remote distributorless systems also allow finer levels of {{ignition}} control by the engine computer, which helps to increase power output, decrease fuel consumption and emissions, and implement {{features such as}} cylinder deactivation. <b>Spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires,</b> which need routine replacement due to wear, are also eliminated when the individual coils are mounted directly {{on top of each}} plug, since the power is transported a very short distance from the coil to the plug.|$|R
50|$|In a {{gasoline}} engine, the correct firing order is {{obtained by the}} correct placement of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> on the distributor. In a modern engine with a direct ignition and the Engine Control Unit(ECU) or Engine Management system {{takes care of the}} correct firing sequence. Especially on cars with distributors, the firing order is usually cast on the engine somewhere, most often on the cylinder head, the intake manifold or the valve cover(s).|$|R
50|$|On 3 June 1929 {{the first}} two-way, radiophone {{communication}} {{took place over}} the skies of the Packard Proving Grounds in Utica, (now Shelby Township, Michigan). Heretofore, gasoline powered aircraft caused too much electro-magnetic interference for the weak voice signal {{to be heard over}} the static. Only a strong Morse code signal could be heard. As diesel engines neither have <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> nor <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wiring</b> the EM static was greatly reduced and allowed voice communication to be used. The two-way ground to plane voice communication was witnessed by the U.S. Department of Commerce.|$|R
50|$|The Duck, {{having been}} warned by Widow Woman, enters {{and tries to}} smooth things over. But Lyle is determined, {{insulting}} Mike who is desperate {{to get home to}} his pregnant wife. Mike punches Wallace, leading to a brawl in the diner when some deputies arrive to assist Wallace. The assorted truckers prevail, and the Duck handcuffs Wallace to a bar stool. After pulling the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> and distributor caps out of the police cars, they all decide to head for the state line to avoid prosecution.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, for {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Camry, the 5S-FE was updated for the last time. This engine received a direct ignition system with external camshaft and crankshaft sensors. This system used a waste-spark design, and the coils had integrated igniters. The engine did not use a typical coil-on-plug design, but rather two coil+igniter assemblies mounted near cylinder four, and provided spark via normal high-tension cords (<b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires).</b> This change means that the 1997-01 Camry 5S-FE has a blocked off distributor mounting hole and could be used with older 5S-FEs without swapping cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|The {{ignition}} system was also all-new for the Magnum. Controlled {{by a new}} micro-processor-equipped Single-Board Engine Controller (SBEC, {{also known as the}} ECM, or Engine Control Module), the {{ignition system}} included a distributor mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine. A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the distributor cap, where a spinning rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders' <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires.</b> Ignition dwell, advance and retardation were electronically controlled by the SBEC.|$|R
5000|$|High tension leads or {{high tension}} cables or <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> or <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> cables are the wires that connect a distributor, {{ignition}} coil, or magneto {{to each of}} the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> in some types of internal combustion engine. [...] "High tension lead" [...] or [...] "cable" [...] is also used for any electrical cable carrying a high voltage in any context. Tension in this instance is a synonym for voltage. High tension leads, like many engine components, wear out over time. Each lead contains only one wire, as the current does not return through the same lead, but through the earthed/grounded engine which is connected to the opposite battery terminal (negative terminal on modern engines) high tension may also be referred to as HT.|$|R

2500|$|Most {{four-stroke}} engines {{have used}} a mechanically timed electrical ignition system. The heart {{of the system is}} the distributor. The distributor contains a rotating cam driven by the engine's drive, a set of breaker points, a condenser, a rotor and a distributor cap. External to the distributor is the ignition coil, the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> and <b>wires</b> linking the distributor to the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> and ignition coil. (see diagram Below) ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{ignition}} coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the {{ignition coil}} to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> are called <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> or high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R
