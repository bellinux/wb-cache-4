5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> Doctor has them <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E

Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and {{there was no evidence of}} progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.|$|E

5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways {{as though it were}} Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E
5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E

5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E

An update released on July 31, 2015, added an online tournament mode {{and the ability to}} upload replays to YouTube. A Smash Controller app was released on the Nintendo eShop on June 14, 2015, allowing players to use the Nintendo 3DS as a controller for the Wii U version without needing a copy of the 3DS version.

5|$|Pete Draper, {{who worked}} with Kamalakanna in Ghajini (2008), was {{selected}} as the pipeline technical director of the film. At that time, Kamalakannan was in Iran finalising the CG stadium and City with Adili. The majority of the film was shot in anamorphic format, but a Super 35 camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post-production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own render farm in Chennai. The post process was done in several stages after the <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> live stadium had only 7 steps, in which live people were positioned in 6 steps while the remaining 12 steps were CG extension. Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions in a library of 3000 frames.|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{to obtain}} an accurate representation of the far-field emissions starting from a finite planar <b>scan</b> of <b>the</b> magnetic near-field is proposed. The algorithm introduces so-called auxiliary sources that compensate for the finite size of <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> area. While previous works typically introduce equivalent sources to represent the fields inside <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area, <b>the</b> auxiliary sources introduced in this paper approximate the fields outside of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area. <b>The</b> auxiliary sources are located within the pcb under <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area at <b>the</b> locations where <b>the</b> <b>scanned</b> field strengths are above a pre-chosen threshold. Their complex values are chosen such that they accurately represent the fields {{at the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area. Several numerical examples show that the application of these auxiliary sources considerably improves the accuracy of the obtained far-field. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion. They observe the Countess Scarlioni using an alien device to <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> {{security}} systems housing Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects the Countess {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of the Mona Lisa. The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing the Mona Lisa, and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E
