40|$|In this paper, {{the concept}} of the image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> made clearer, and the {{research}} on the poetic-image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> executed. The research technique and the procedure were also established through investigating. In addition, the validity of the idea concerning the characteristic of poetic-image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> verified. As a result, eight types of the poetic image <b>structure</b> <b>were</b> found. The type of the poetic image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> named 'poetry pattern of the image'. The hypothesis concerning a poetic image <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> verified though not quite satisfactorily...|$|R
50|$|If a {{structure}} has a discrete moduli (if {{it has no}} deformations, or if a deformation of a <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> isomorphic to the original <b>structure),</b> the <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> said to be rigid, and its study (if it is a geometric or topological <b>structure)</b> <b>is</b> topology.

5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E

30|$|Chromatin <b>is</b> the {{fundamental}} <b>structure</b> of the genome, which is constituted by nucleosome particles. The chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> important to gene transcription. In active transcription sites, the chromatin will be loosened, {{so that the}} DNA can be exposed to transcriptional factors for transcription initiation. This open chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> termed “euchromatin”. In contrary, some of the chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> heavily condensed and the transcriptions of those genes within those regions are inhibited. The condensed chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> termed “heterochromatin”. Thus, chromatin <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> of critical importance in regulating gene expression in a temporal and spatial dependent manner (Wang et al., 2007 a).|$|R
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E

5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.|$|E

5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> tunable by the concentration: for example, in {{lamellar}} phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume.

5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{original}} structure {{stress state}} of No. zero frame of TB 200 aircraft is analyzed by finite element method. The stress {{and the reasons}} of the crack on the frame are determined. The numerical analysis results fit well with the actual damage of the frame, and the finite element analysis model is verified to be reliable. The stress state of the damaged frame <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> analyzed, which shows that the undamaged frame <b>structure</b> must <b>be</b> reinforced. The reinforce plan for the undamaged frame <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> given. The reinforced frame <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> analyzed by finite element method. The stress state and the residual strength of the reinforced frame <b>structure</b> <b>are</b> given. It is showed that the reinforce plan causes an obvious descent of the frame stress. The load is mainly distributed on the reinforcement of the No. zero frame. The residual static strength of the reinforced <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> higher than the original structure.
