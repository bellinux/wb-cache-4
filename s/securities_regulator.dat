[...] The bill was passed on a party line vote, with Knight's fellow Progressive Conservatives voting unanimously in favour and the opposition Liberals and New Democrats voting unanimously against. [...] Knight also sponsored the Securities Amendment Acts, separate bills with the same name from different years, 2005 and 2006. [...] The first of these was designed to harmonize the securities regulation with that of other provinces. [...] It was supported by Liberals Rick Miller and Bill Bonko, who considered it {{a step in the}} right direction.
