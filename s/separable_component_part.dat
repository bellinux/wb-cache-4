40|$|The nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo marmorata carries two nonequivalent agonist binding sites at the R# and R# subunit interfaces. These sites have been characterized by time-resolved fluorescence with the partial nicotinic agonist dansyl-C 6 -choline (Dnscho). When bound to the detergent-solubilized receptor, the fluorescence lifetime distribution of Dnscho displays a characteristic signature, with four <b>separable</b> <b>components</b> at 0. 2, 1. 8, 7. 2, and 18. 3 ns, respectively.

40|$|Four {{neurotoxins}} that {{activate the}} action potential Na+ ionophore of electrically excitable neuroblastoma cells interact with two distinct classes of sites, one specific for the alkaloids veratridine, batrachotoxin, and aconitine, {{and the second}} specific for scorpion toxin. Positive heterotropic cooperativity is observed between toxins bound at these two classes of sites. Tetrodotoxin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of activation by each of these toxins (KI = 4 - 8 nM). These results suggest the existence of three functionally <b>separable</b> <b>components</b> of the action potential Na+ ionophore: two regulatroy components, which bind activating neurotoxins and interact allosterically in controlling the activity of a third ion-transport component, which binds tetrodotoxin...|$|R
50|$|Composition {{is a kind}} of {{association}} where the composite object has sole responsibility for the disposition of the <b>component</b> <b>parts.</b> The relationship between the composite and the component is a strong “has a” relationship, as the composite object takes ownership of the component. This means the composite is responsible for the creation and destruction of the <b>component</b> <b>parts.</b> An object may only be part of one composite. If the composite object is destroyed, all the <b>component</b> <b>parts</b> must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object.

40|$|Background: Cognitive control {{refers to}} the ability to {{selectively}} attend and respond to task-relevant events while resisting interference from distracting stimuli or prepotent automatic responses. The current study aimed to determine whether interference suppression and response inhibition are <b>separable</b> <b>component</b> processes of cognitive control. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fourteen young adults completed a hybrid Go/Nogo flanker task and continuous EEG data were recorded concurrently. The incongruous flanker condition (that required interference suppression) elicited a more centrally distributed topography with a later N 2 peak than the Nogo condition (that required response inhibition). Conclusions/Significance: These results provide evidence for the dissociability of interference suppression and response inhibition, indicating that taxonomy of inhibition is warranted with the integration of research evidence from neuroscience...|$|R
40|$|Five {{methods were}} {{employed}} to determine the heterogeneity or homogeneity of lipopolysaccharides from four acholeplasmal species, Acholeplasma axanthum, A. granularum, A. laidlawii, and A. modicum. A axanthum lipopolysaccharide behaved as a single component in all tests. A. granularum exhibited two components of identical composition and antigenic specificity. A. modicum lipopolysaccharide behaved as three components in two tests, but all three were similar in composition and identical serologically. The <b>separable</b> <b>components</b> of lipopolysaccharides from A. granularum and A. modicum probably represent size differences only. A. laidlwii lipopolysaccharide contained two distinct components by all methods.
