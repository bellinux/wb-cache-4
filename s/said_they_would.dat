5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate.

At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|At this conference, {{which was}} {{organised}} by Britain with American support, Van der Byl {{rejected the idea}} of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified {{as one of the few}} ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement.

The nationalist leaders <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion. Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start.

During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E

5|$|Customers' {{reactions}} to the merger varied. Most of the public understood {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some customers were upset because the last long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; they <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E

Mido flew to Cairo in February 2005 and made a public apology and the following month he was recalled by the national team.
