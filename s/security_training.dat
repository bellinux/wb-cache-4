5|$|In November 1943, Kinkaid became Commander Allied Naval Forces South West Pacific Area, and Commander of the Seventh Fleet, {{directing}} U.S. and Royal Australian Navy forces {{supporting the}} New Guinea campaign. During the Battle of the Surigao Strait he commanded the Allied {{ships in the}} last naval battle between battleships in history. Following the demise of Japanese naval power in the region, the Allied navies supported the campaigns in the Philippines and Borneo. Kinkaid was promoted to admiral on 3 April 1945.

25|$|Another {{major concern}} {{is the lack of}} {{implementation}} of the Leahy Law in U.S. and the consequences of that in worsening the human rights situation in Mexico. Under this U.S. law, no member or unit of a foreign security force that is credibly alleged to have committed a human rights violation may receive U.S. <b>security</b> <b>training.</b> It is alleged that the U.S., by training the military and police force in Mexico, is in violation of the Leahy Law. In this case, the U.S. embassy officials in Mexico in charge of human rights and drug control programs are blamed with aiding and abetting these violations. In December 1997, a group of heavily armed Mexican special forces soldiers kidnapped twenty young men in Ocotlan, Jalisco, brutally torturing them and killing one. Six of the implicated officers had received U.S. training as part of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE) training program.|$|E

2500|$|From Aylesbury {{she went}} on to Beaulieu, where the <b>security</b> <b>training</b> was capped with a {{practice}} mission – in the case of wireless operators, to find a place in a strange city from which they could transmit back to their instructors without being detected by an agent unknown to them who would be shadowing them. The ultimate exercise was the mock Gestapo interrogation, intended to give agents a taste of what might be in store for them if they were captured and some practice in maintaining their cover story. Noor’s escaping officer found her interrogation [...] "almost unbearable" [...] and reported that [...] "she seemed terrified… so overwhelmed she nearly lost her voice", and that afterwards [...] "she was trembling and quite blanched." [...] Her finishing report, which the official historian of F Section found in her personal file long after the war, read: [...] "Not overburdened with brains but has worked hard and shown keenness, apart from some dislike of the security side of the course.

2500|$|In September 2004, Petraeus {{wrote an}} article for The Washington Post in which he {{described}} the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces {{from the ground up}} while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. [...] "Although there have been reverses – not to mention horrific terrorist attacks," [...] Petraeus wrote, [...] "there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do." [...] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task {{in the midst of a}} tough insurgency—or, as Petraeus wrote, [...] "making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight – and while being shot at". Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, [...] "under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army." [...] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures—particularly from 2004 to 2005, when <b>security</b> <b>training</b> was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra. Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents. Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost. The Independent has stated that the military believed [...] "the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter." [...] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.|$|E
