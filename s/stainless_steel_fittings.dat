The rheological properties of these solutions were determined and the power-law model provided the best fit for experimental data. Friction losses were measured in fully and partially open butterfly and plug valves, bends and unions. Values of loss coefficients (kf) were calculated and correlated {{as a function}} of the generalized Reynolds number by the two-k method. The model adjustment was satisfactory and was better in the laminar flow range (0. 976 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 999) than in the turbulent flow range (0. 774 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 989). In order to test the adequacy of the results for predicting loss coefficients during flow of real fluids, experiments were conducted with coffee extract. Comparison between experimental and predicted loss coefficients showed very good agreement...|$|R

Art Deco in India (and especially in Mumbai) evolved into a unique style that came to be called Deco-Saracenic. Essentially, {{it was a combination of}} the Islamic and the Hindu architectural styles. The main features of the Indo Saracenic Style were the construction of domes, arches, spires, stained glasses and minarets. The interiors have Victorian influences while the exterior was Indian.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{can play}} a key role in the SCC performance of susceptible materials in PWR primary water applications. Residual stresses are stresses stored within the metal that develop during deformation and persist in the absence of external forces or temperature gradients. Sources of residual stresses in pipe fittings include fabrication processes, installation and welding. There are a number of methods to characterize the magnitude and orientation of residual stresses. These include numerical analysis, chemical cracking tests, and measurement (e. g., X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, strain gage/hole drilling, strain gage/trepanning, strain gage/section and layer removal, and acoustics). This paper presents 400 C steam SCC test results demonstrating that residual stresses in as-fabricated Alloy 600 pipe fittings are sufficient to induce SCC.

In 2013 JSC “NIIEFA” delivered 95 high voltage insulation breaks to the IO ITER, i. e. 65 breaks with spiral channels and 30 breaks with uniflow channels. These high voltage insulation breaks were designed, manufactured and tested {{in accordance with the}} ITER Technical Specifications: «Axial Insulating Breaks for the Qualification Phase of ITER Coils and Feeders». The high voltage insulation breaks consist of the glass-reinforced plastic cylinder equipped with channels for cryoagent and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> end <b>fittings.</b> The operating voltage is 30 kV for the breaks with spiral channels (30 kV HV IBs) and 4 kV for the breaks with uniflow channels (4  kV HV IBs). The main design feature of the 30  kV HV IBs is the spiral channels instead of a linear one. This approach has enabled us to increase the breakdown voltage and decrease the overall dimensions of the high voltage insulation breaks. In 2013 the manufacturing technique was developed to produce the high voltage insulation breaks with the spiral and uniflow channels that made it possible to proceed to serial production. To provide the acceptance tests of the breaks a special test facility was prepared.

40|$|Futuro Estate is a {{permanent}} public artwork sited on the Al Majaz Waterfront, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. It was commissioned by Alexandra MacGilp for the exhibition Imitation Game 2015 - 16 and funded by the Maraya Art Foundation. The materials and dimensions are as follows: fibreglass, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> <b>fittings.</b> H: 6 m W: 1. 8 m. D: 1. 8 m. The commission extends the artist’s research into political histories of the built environment, focusing on bird life on the seafront area of Sharjah. This {{is an area that}} in the last 50 years has undergone rapid transformation from fishing port and wetlands to an oil fuelled metropolis. The work, a birdhouse with nesting boxes for 42 pairs of birds, is imagined in the first instance as a kind of probe that, by being inserted directly into the environment, will serve a measure of birdlife in the city – an instrument through which to glimpse an emerging and shifting ecology. Unlike the dovecotes that grace rural residencies through much of the Middle East, and which provide a home for birds that serve as both companion and food, Estate is proposed as a resource for feral birds. Which species though (if any) will make use of it? If it is occupied, will it serve simply as a platform on which to gather, see and be seen or will it be colonised for nesting? How might its existence modify our understanding of the “right to the city”, so that right may be taken as a privilege of Sharjah’s birds as much as one belonging to humans? And if so, will some birds be thought of as more rightful residents than others, say, indigenous species as opposed to those more recent, if naturalised, arrivals? Which species, once indigenous to this coastline will be conspicuous by their absence? In focusing on bird life the artist has revisited earlier works that direct attention to the reception of birds in the city and the commission arises from the curator having seen one of these works exhibited Space Station 65, London 2006. For this commission the work has been fabricated by a third party, making use of processes and materials used in the construction industry.

40|$|A {{manufacturing}} defect in pipe fittings supplied {{to the oil}} and gas industry has resulted in installed components with unknown impact capacity. If the altered capacity is not sufficient, production stops and expensive replacements of parts are necessary. Erroneous heat treatment led to precipitation of a brittle sigma phase in duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>fittings.</b> The overall goal for this thesis is to increase the knowledge of how the impact capacity of fittings with this production error is affected. The main objective in the performed study has been to create a finite element model and simulate impact loading on pipe bends both with and without precipitated sigma phase. Special attention has been given to the initiation and propagation of fracture and how this can be modeled. The model can in further studies be used to find the impact capacity of bends with various levels of sigma content. The objective was reached by material testing, full scale component tests and non-linear finite element analyses of both the material tests and the component tests. All analyses were carried out using the finite element code LS-DYNA. Material tests are performed previous to, and during this study, on both specimens affected and unaffected by sigma phase. The material, with three different amounts of precipitated sigma phase, was modeled by use of the modified Johnson-Cook constitutive relation and the Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion. Full scale component tests on pipe bends were carried out under both dynamic and quasi-static load conditions. The results were compared, and the effect of sigma phase in the component was addressed. During simulations of the full scale tests, attention was given to recreate the global response of the component at various impact velocities and to predict the initiation of fracture. The effect of high levels of precipitated sigma phase was found to reduce the impact capacity of the tested components. No visual fracture was found on any of the components containing low amounts of sigma, i. e. 0 - 5 %, while the components with higher content fractured. The same tendency was found in the quasi-static tests. Components containing 15 % sigma phase were found to have a reduced impact capacity of more than 80 % compared to components unaltered by sigma phase. The finite element model was able to predict the global response of the components sufficiently accurate. The Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion, when calibrated according to the tensile tests, was not able to predict the initiation of fracture in the finite element analyses of the component tests. However, by reducing the critical Cockcroft-Latham parameter by a constant factor, the initiation of fracture was accurately predicted both for quasi-static simulations and dynamic simulations with various impact velocities. The simulations were not able to recreate the rapid fracture propagation seen in the full scale tests. </p...|$|E
