50|$|These were {{developed}} {{from a series}} of five locomotives (2631-2635), introduced in 1902 by Samuel W. Johnson, which had had a 3-cylinder compound arrangement on the Smith system. This had a layout of one high-pressure cylinder inside the frames, and two low-pressure cylinders outside, and utilised Smith's <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement.</b> On the first two locomotives, independent control of high-pressure and low-pressure valve gears was available. From 1905 onwards, Johnson's successor Richard Deeley built an enlarged and simplified version, eliminating all the Smith refinements whilst fitting his own <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement,</b> making the engines simpler to drive. These locomotives were originally numbered 1000-1029, but in the 1907 renumbering scheme the five Smith/Johnson locomotives became 1000-1004 and the Deeley compounds 1005-1034, ten more of these being added in 1908-1909. The original Johnson locomotives were all subsequently renewed as Deeley compounds, including the now-preserved 1000 which was rebuilt and outshopped with a superheater in 1914.|$|E

5000|$|The Battle of Surigao Strait {{was fought}} {{on the night}} of 24-25 October, a few hours before the Battle off Samar. The Japanese had a small {{battleship}} group composed of Fusō and Yamashiro, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers. They were followed at a considerable distance by another small force of two heavy cruisers, a small light cruiser, and four destroyers. Their goal was to head north through Surigao Strait and attack the invasion fleet off Leyte. The Allied force, known as the 7th Fleet Support Force, guarding the strait was overwhelming. It included six battleships (all but one previously damaged in 1941 at Pearl Harbor), four heavy cruisers (one Australian), four light cruisers, and 28 destroyers, plus a force of 39 PT boats. The only advantage to the Japanese was that most of the battleships and cruisers were loaded mainly with high explosive shells, although a significant number of armor-piercing shells were also loaded. The lead Japanese force evaded the PT boats' torpedoes, but were hit hard by the destroyers' torpedoes, losing a battleship. Then they encountered the battleship and cruiser guns. Only one destroyer survived. The engagement is notable for being one of only two occasions in which battleships fired on battleships in the Pacific Theater, the other being the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Due to the <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the opposing forces, the Allied force was in a [...] "crossing the T" [...] position, so this was the last battle in which this occurred, {{but it was not a}} planned maneuver. The following Japanese cruiser force had several problems, including a light cruiser damaged by a PT boat and two heavy cruisers colliding, one of which fell behind and was sunk by air attack the next day. An American veteran of Surigao Strait, , was transferred to Argentina in 1951 as the General Belgrano, becoming most famous for being sunk by [...] in the Falklands War on 2 May 1982. She was the first ship sunk by a nuclear submarine outside of accidents, and only the second ship sunk by a submarine since World War II.|$|E

The existing rolling mill in India are using the 3 phase induction motor and flywheel to drive the rolling mill. The electric motor transmits the power to flywheel {{with the help of}} V-belt. An attempt has made after analysis of existing mill that by using some soft <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement,</b> which can be use as a clutch in between the motor and flywheel reduces the horse power of main drive which save the energy consumption of rolling mill. The optimum selection of drive can help in reducing the horse power of main electric motor {{and at the same time}} capable of energies the flywheel. An experimental analysis is done by using flat belt drive and motor sliding arrangement in order to reduce the H. P. of main electric motor. In this paper an attempt has made after analyzing the existing rolling that a mechanical soft <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement</b> is designed and tested on prototype rolling mill. The soft <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement</b> used in this protype rolling mill analysed and concluded that in the actual rolling mill the motor used are oversized which consumes the more energy. By designing the soft <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the motor horse power can be reduced which ultimately saves the energy consumed and hence the billing cost can be reduced. 1...|$|E

40|$|Nanotube-vesicle {{networks}} (NVNs) are simplified {{models of}} cell membrane tubular systems which are dynamic transportation routs for molecular cargoes in biological cells. The presented work describes dynamic properties of NVNs such as self-organization, shape and topology transformations; moreover, specific geometric {{properties of the}} networks are used for controlling enzymatic reactions. A nanotube-vesicle network is a network of surface-adhered lipid vesicles (5 - 25 m in radius) connected by suspended lipid nanotubes (100 - 200 nm in radius). Vesicle size, nanotube length, and connectivity of a network can be controlled with high precision. Initially, the network is trapped in a high free energy state. By proper means, {{it is possible to}} trigger network self-organization towards a lower free energy state. Network evolution begins with merging of two adjacent nanotubes, and formation of a single nanotube three-way junction. Based on experimental observations of fluorescently labeled nanotubes and a theoretical model, the nanotube three-way junction is shown to propagate with a zipper-like mechanism, described in Paper I of this thesis. Lipids from two merging branches flow through the junction and form an extension on the third nanotube branch. Depending on the <b>starting</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the nanotubes, a NVN can evolve towards entangled and knotted geometries; or it can form a system of branching nanotubes. Paper II describes the formation of knotted nanotubes. The estimated size of the knot is comparable with the radius of a lipid nanotube. It is also demonstrated that such a knot {{can be used as a}} mechanical tweezer to capture and transport submicrometer-sized objects. In the experiments described in Paper III, NVNs are shown to form tree-like structures. The nanotubes arrange into symmetric three-way junctions with angles of 120 o between the nanotubes. Moreover, the process of self-organization in the networks reveals a strong similarity with some optimization problems, such as the Euclidian Steiner Tree Problem. Paper IV suggests a method to form circular lipid nanotubes. The presented method gives new opportunities for preparing, manipulating and studying shape transitions of vesicles with non-spherical topology. Finally in Paper V, the geometry of a NVN is used to control the dynamics of an enzymatic reaction. Here, the vesicles are used as containers for reacting molecules, and the nanotubes serve as transportation routes. The narrow nanotube entrances act as transport barriers for the enzyme molecules. In such a reaction-diffusion system, the reaction occurs as a cascade through the containers and displays wave-like behavior...|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a 3 phase winding, is provided with a 3 phase supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The 3 phase stator winding carrying 3 phase currents produces 3 phase rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator winding is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by the <b>starting</b> <b>arrangements.</b>|$|R
