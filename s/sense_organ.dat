5|$|There is thus {{a causal}} chain which transmits {{information}} from a <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ. In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in sensory-motor coupling.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
40|$|Adults of Romanomermis culicivorax {{obtained}} from mass cultures were examined by scanning and {{transmission electron microscopy}} to determine the organization of their anterior <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> The normal pattern apparently consists of two lateral amphids plus six cephalic papillae. Lateral cephalic papillae contain two <b>sense</b> <b>organs,</b> each with a cuticular pore, while subdorsal and subventral papillae have three <b>sense</b> <b>organs,</b> each with a cuticular pore. About 30 % of females and 80 % of males examined showed aberrant developments in these <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Both cuticle and underlying cells (hypodermis and neurons) are affected; some <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> are absent while others are incompletely formed. Few aberrant worms were found in a smaller collection of worms reared in lower population densities. Perhaps aberrant forms are examples of teratological development resulting from, or promoted by, conditions used for mass rearing of biological control agents...|$|R

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} <b>sense</b> <b>organ.</b> Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the structure and}} function of pox neuro (poxn), a gene previously isolated by virtue of a conserved domain, the paired box, which it shares with the segmentation genes paired and gooseberry. Its expression pattern has been analyzed, particularly during development of the PNS. We propose that poxn is a "neuroblast identity" gene acting in both the PNS and the CNS {{on the basis of}} the following evidence. Its expression is restricted to four neuronal precursors in each hemisegment: two neuronal stem cells (neuro-blasts) in the CNS, and two sensory mother cells (SMCs) in the PNS. The SMCs that express poxn produce the poly-innervated external <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> of the larva. In poxn- embryos, poly-innervated <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> are transformed into mono-innervated. Conversely, ectopic expression of poxn in embryos transformed with a heat-inducible poxn gene can switch mono-innervated to poly-innervated <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Expression of poxn in the wing disc is restricted to the SMCs of the poly-innervated <b>sense</b> <b>organs,</b> suggesting that poxn also determines the lineage of poly-innervated adult <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> © 1992 by Cell Press.

40|$|The {{homeotic}} genes are instrumental in establishing segment-specific characteristics. In Drosophila embryos {{there is ample}} evidence that the {{homeotic genes}} are involved in establishing the differences in the pattern of <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> between segments. The chordotonal <b>organs</b> are compound <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> made up of several stretch receptive sensilla. A set of serially homologous chordotonal organs, Ich 3 in the 1 (st) thoracic segment, dch 3 in the 2 (nd) and 3 (rd) thoracic segments and Ich 5 in abdominal segments 1 to 7, is composed of different numbers of sensilla with different positions and orientations. Here we examine this set of <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> and a companion set, vchA/B and vch 1, in the wild type and mutants for Sex combs reduced, Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and abdominal-A, using immunostaining. Mutant phenotypes indicate that Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A in particular influence the formation of these <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Differential expression of abdominal-A and Ultrabithorax within compartments of individual parasegments can precisely modulate the types of <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> that will arise from a segment...|$|R
5|$|The nasal {{openings}} {{were large}} and faced frontwards. The nasal bone was thick, heavily sculpted, {{and had a}} convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the frontal bone. The lower front of the premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small foramen (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into the nasal cavity, and possibly connected to the Jacobson's organ (an olfactory <b>sense</b> <b>organ).</b> The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a sinus. The maxilla {{had a series of}} foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a predentary bone is indicated by facets {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.|$|E

25|$|For brine shrimp, many functions, {{including}} swimming, digestion {{and reproduction}} are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system ganglia may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions. Autotomy, the voluntary shedding or dropping {{of parts of}} the body for defence, is also controlled locally along the nervous system. Artemia have two types of eyes. They have two widely separated compound eyes mounted on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> in adult brine shrimps.
