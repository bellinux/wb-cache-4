5|$|A <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> the line {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich der Grosse was {{the first}} <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> the fleet to be scuttled, sinking at 12:16. She was raised on 29 April 1937 and towed to Rosyth for scrapping. The ship's bell was {{returned}} to Germany in 1965, and is currently in the Fleet Headquarters in Glücksburg. König Albert followed at 12:54, the second <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> the fleet to sink. The ship was later raised on 31 July 1935 and broken up in Rosyth over the following year. Kaiser sank at 13:25, and was raised for scrapping on 20 March 1929; breaking work was conducted in Rosyth by 1930. Prinzregent Luitpold sank five minutes later, at 13:30. She too was raised, on 9 July 1931, and broken up in Rosyth. Kaiserin, the last <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> the class to be sunk, slipped beneath the surface at 14:00. She was raised on 14 May 1936, and broken up that year in Rosyth.|$|E

2500|$|The French Navy {{was largely}} {{confined}} to port, blockaded by various fleets and commands of the Royal Navy, while the main invasion force of 93,000 men in four Army corps waited in Boulogne. A combined French and Dutch squadron <b>of</b> nine <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line were quartered in the Netherlands, covered by Admiral Lord Keith's Downs squadron <b>of</b> 11 <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line. Neither squadron {{took part in}} the campaign. The main Channel Fleet, patrolling between Ushant and the Irish coast under Admiral William Cornwallis and his deputy Vice-Admiral Charles Cotton, consisted <b>of</b> 15 <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line, with detached squadrons <b>of</b> five <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line under Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves blockading Rochefort, and eight <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line under Vice-Admiral Robert Calder blockading Ferrol. They were maintaining a tight blockade over the French Atlantic forces, consisting <b>of</b> 21 <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line at Brest under Vice-Admiral Ganteaume, three or four <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line at Rochefort, and four French <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line under Rear-Admiral Gourdon and eight Spanish <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line under Admiral Grandallana at Ferrol. [...] Six Spanish <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line and one French one were in port at Cádiz, under the watchful eyes of Rear-Admiral John Orde and his five <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line, with another six Spanish <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> line located at Cartagena under Admiral Salcedo. The French naval base at Toulon was home to 11 French <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line under Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, who was being kept bottled up by the 12 <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line of the Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson. Each commander had a number of frigates, sloops and brigs at their disposal. Further afield, Missiessy, pursued by Cochrane, sailed around the West Indies, but without making contact with each other. Napoleon recalled Missiessy once it became clear the Villeneuve had remained trapped in Toulon, and Missiessey began to voyage back to France on 28 March. March 1805 brought a significant development for Napoleon, an assurance from the Austrians that they did not plan to make war on France. Napoleon resolved to return to his scheme for the invasion of Britain, and drew up a new plan.|$|R

50|$|U-Boat Command (BdU), in {{the person}} of Rear Admiral Karl Dönitz, was delighted with the attack, believing his U-boats had sunk {{eighteen}} <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> over 120,000 GRT.

5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on the <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> {{the line}} and by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in {{the stern of the}} ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E
