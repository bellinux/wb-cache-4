40|$|As {{buildings}} {{with a high}} ceiling clearance are becoming increasingly common, making proper assessments {{of whether or not}} the ceiling sprinklers would actuate becomes very critical for such buildings. One of the commonly adopted processes for the assessments are: (1) to evaluate the potential fire load inside a facility and convert that to the maximum anticipated heat release rate, and (2) to run a pan fire test that would generate the heat release rate equivalent to the value estimated from the previous step and see if any ceiling sprinklers to actuate. If such an assessment indicates no ceiling sprinkler actuation, then a waiver of the requirement of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>installation</b> often follows [...] -leaving the building with no active fire protection system.

40|$|For a {{specific}} range of building and occupancy types, this report examines {{the effectiveness of}} automatic sprinkler systems installed in New Zealand and Australia. The {{aim of the research}} is to quantify the likelihood of a fully developed fire occurring in sprinklered buildings. By deriving an annual probability of occurrence this can be compared with the accepted exceedance probabilities that exist for other limit state design actions for the design of steel structures. Comprehensive data collated for the entire history of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>installations</b> in New Zealand and Australia is analysed to obtain conditional probabilities that confirm the effectiveness of sprinklers to control fires. These probabilities correspond to the likelihood of fully developed fire occurring being classified as an extremely unlikely event. Passive fire protection is normally provided to protect a structure against a fully developed fire. It is therefore suggested that certain types of structural steel frames in sprinklered buildings do not require passive fire protection to meet performance requirements of the Building Code. The performance of steel frames without fire protection when exposed to fire following earthquake is assessed in a probabilistic framework. The likelihood of damage to the steel frame is not very different for the scenario of fire without earthquake. This report also examines other aspects that affect sprinkler reliability, such as town main water supply, system isolation due to internal alterations and booster pump reliability. Most of these items do not have a major effect on sprinkler reliability. Current literature describing the performance of steel framed multi-level buildings when subjected to fully developed fires is reviewed. The favourable behaviour of these real frames in natural fires confirms that the consequences are not usually serious if steel members without passive fire protection are exposed to severe fires...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} analysis of diurnal and potentially possible efficiency of water freezing aimed at construction of artificial infiltration (firn-ice) masses on the Russia’s territory. A method of jet ice-formation (winter sprinkling) developed in Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences {{is used for}} freezing of the artificial firn-ice masses. The method applies far-reaching (long-distance) <b>sprinkler</b> <b>installations</b> for spraying of water and formation of thick (more than 7 m for a day) masses of artificial firn. In winter the sprinkler allows freezing of both the monolithic ice and artificial firn. A practical implementation of this method is licensed and realized for construction of ice passages, bridges, and winter automobile roads. Testing of the method demonstrated that the artificial firn {{can be used for}} desalination and purification of polluted salt waters with high efficiency. That is stipulated by both, the high productivity of the method (about 1500 tons of artificial firn for a day at the air temperature of − 20 ° С, and low mineralization of the firn relative to initial salt water.   Winter sprinkling is carried out when mean daily air temperature drops below – 5 ∞ С. Estimating of productivity of the artificial firn and monolithic ice under present-day climatic conditions was made over the Russia’s territory. Analysis of the climate conditions for periods 2001 – 2010 and 1961 – 2000 have shown that reduction of the firn productivity changed from 5 - 10 % in Siberia up to 20 – 40 % in central and southern regions of the European Russia. At the present time, a potentially possible volume of the artificial firn freezing being produced in cold seasons changes from 500 thousand tons in northern areas of Yakutia down to 10 thousand in center of European Russia. Productivity of the monolithic ice freezing by a method of thin-layer water pouring is twice lower in central areas of Yakutia than on the Arctic seashores that is explained by differences in wind speeds. Potentially possible monolithic ice productivity made by means of thin-layer water pouring changes from 56 m of ice thickness in Northern Siberia down to 10 m in center of European Russia. The Northern Yakutia and the River Ob’ mouth are two areas of maximal productivity of this method. </p...|$|R
40|$|In March 1999 {{results from}} an {{exploratory}} case-control {{study indicated that}} the most probable origin of a large epidemic of legionnaire's disease had to be directly located at or in the surroundings of the Westfriese Flora (WF) in Bovenkarspel (Province of Noord-Holland, Netherlands). The WF is a yearly exhibition of flowers, and agricultural and consumer products, which was held in 1999 from 19 to 28 February. After inspecting the premises and making an inventory of all exhibits, a list of potential sources was drawn up. The water supply system and all the still available equipment using water were sampled. A risk assessment was done for each potential source by interviewing exhibitors. In total, sixteen products were found potentially hazardous: two whirlpools, two bubblemats (perforated rubber mats meant for {{the bottom of a}} water-filled bathtub through which air can be blown at high speed), eleven fountains and a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>installation.</b> Legionella pneumophila was isolated from two whirlpools and a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>installation.</b> With the use of molecular-biological techniques (PFGE, ERIC/REP-PCR and AFLP), three different genotypes were identified. These were B- 1, B- 2 and B- 3 (B for Bovenkarspel). To enable comparison of these isolates with patient isolates, all microbiology laboratories in the Netherlands collaborated in collecting patient isolates related to the epidemic. In total 29 isolates were collected, 28 of which were genetically identical to B- 1; the other one was genetically identical to B- 2. Through the risk assessment based on the reported use and estimating the degree of contamination from the microbiological investigation of the three culture-positive products, the most probable source contributing the most to the spread of L. pneumophila was found to be the whirlpool located in hall 3 of the WF premises. It is not possible to rule out the contribution made to spreading by the whirlpool in hall 4, whereas the sprinkler's contribution to spreading is not probable. The contribution to spreading by the fountains and bubblemats is also unlikely. Although Legionella spp was not isolated from the water supply system, the organism was likely introduced into the three products from this system. These results were confirmed by the outcome of a case-control study and a cohort study, both designed to pinpoint the exact location of exposure to Legionella spp on the WF premises. They showed the whirlpool in hall 3 to be the most probable source of infection (reported separately) ...|$|E
40|$|The Robert E. Kennedy Library {{is located}} on Cal Poly Campus. The Library is a five-story {{building}} with different occupancies which consists of library areas, offices, mechanical equipment and storage areas. The building has a total area of 178 702 ft². The original code of construction for the Library was the 1976 Uniform Building code (UBC). However, the fire and life safety analysis of the building in this report is performed using: Egress: NFPA 101 LSC 2015, Water based suppression: NFPA 13, Structural fire protection: 2015 IBC, Fire detection, alarm and communication systems: NFPA 72, Performance based design: NFPA 101 LSC 2015 and the SFPE handbook 5 th edition. The prescriptive-based analysis in this report focuses on the egress features, fire alarm and detection systems, fire suppression systems and structural fire protection of the Robert E. Kennedy Library. The egress features built into the Library were found to mostly comply with the prescriptive requirements of the LSC. There is an automatic fire alarm and detection system {{as well as an}} emergency notification system installed in the Library, mostly in accordance with the LSC and NFPA 72. However, the notification devices do not cover all common use areas in the Library, which is not up to code. The Library does not have a water based suppression system, but it is designed in this report. The proposed suppression system is in accordance with IBC requirements, and was designed following the requirements of NFPA 13. The analysis demonstrates that the Library is in accordance with all of the requirements of the IBC for Type I- B construction. The performance-based analysis in this report investigated the ability of the fire protection systems in the Library to perform satisfactorily in different fire scenarios. This analysis was completed using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) program, in conjunction with the Pyrosim graphical user interface and the Pathfinder evacuation simulator. The chosen design fire scenario was a fire with 8 bookshelves in the south west corner of the second floor. Two simulations were done, with and without functional sprinkler system. The data needed for the fire and combustion properties was taken from the SFPE handbook. The tenability criteria’s was evaluated east of the fire, where the occupants first will be affected by the fire. The simulations without functional sprinkler system indicated that RSET 3 ̆eASET. The visibility was violated in less than half the required safety egress time (RSET). The simulations with a functional sprinkler system indicated that ASET 3 ̆eRSET. The tenability criteria’s was not violated and it was determined that the building is safe in respect to life safety with sprinklers. It has been shown in the performance-based analysis portion of this report how a sprinklers system can reduce the effects of combustion byproducts in an area with a high fuel load and increase the life safety potential within a building. <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>installation</b> for the control of fires is the most common method of providing fire suppression. I would therefore recommend installing a sprinkler system in the Library for life safety. I would also recommend providing notification devices in all common use areas throughout the Library as required by IBC 2015 edition...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{there are}} a lot of vacant {{buildings}} available. To reuse these buildings, which may or may not have monumental status, the project has to be financially feasible. If a building has good potentials to be reused, the capacity of the structure and the possibilities of adapting the structures needs to be examined to make a project possible This study focuses on how the structural design influence the redesigning for reuse of a monument. As a design case the Flour factory in Leiden has been selected. The old flour factory ‘de Sleutels’, located at the corner of the Oosterkerkstraat and the canal the Zijlsingel in Leiden is a complex of nine different buildings with each different characteristics. The architect Peter Zumthor designed a plan on how to reuse the existing buildings and which interventions should be done to realize this. The problem definition is the following: How can the interventions, as proposed by Peter Zumthor and partner, be integrated in the current structures of the former flour factory ‘meelfabriek de Sleutels’ in Leiden, so that sound safe structures, set out in the Dutch Building Regulations and in the Eurocode-regulations, are created and which adjustments and additions should be made to realize this goal? The methodology generated is applied on this project. First as much as possible data was searched for. This data was, when possible, compared to inspections on the buildings on site to get a realistic overview of the characteristics of the building. Where data was missing assumptions were made (in reality it is recommended to find the missing data by inspections on site) or conclusions were drawn from visible inspections. With this overview it was possible to detect the failures and possibilities of the structures of the buildings. The failures and possibilities resulted in different solutions to realize the proposed architectural interventions in the existing structures. A selection of the best solution was done by testing them on the set preconditions (as set in the architectural analysis, in reality this is done by client, architect, state or municipality and other stakeholders involved). The solution that fits best is selected to develop the final structural design. To adapt the Boiler House to an workshop building the foundation capacity has to be examined further and the possibility to couple the building in South direction to the cleaning building to provide stability. If it is possible the steel should be examined on its yielding strength and a check has to be done if the masonry is still intact and if the bond between steel skeleton and concrete floors still is present, otherwise anchors could be used to solve this problem. To adapt the silos built in 1904 to a hotel the foundation should be reinforced, because it has now only a rest-life of 25 years. The cracks in the roof should be repaired to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the Mill to an atelier building, sloping columns are added to transfer the overloading forces to the outer dies, with extra capacity, to make the foundation safe. Braces are added in the outer portals and two inner portals to take care of the displacement. The structure should be cleaned from corrosion and protected; a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>installation</b> should diminish the temperature of the structure to provide fire safety. To adapt the Flour Warehouse to a fitness building a steel top is realised with steel-plate concrete floors to make a light structure, to create a safe foundation. Outriggers are placed in the top to take care of the displacement. Where reinforcement is visible the concrete should be repaired to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the silos built in ’ 37, ’ 38 and ’ 55 to a hotel the concrete has to be repaired where reinforcement is visible to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the cleaning building to a design office the foundation capacity has to be examined further and the concrete has to be repaired where reinforcement is visible to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the extension of the Mill to apartments the structure should be cleaned from corrosion and protected. The displacement should be diminished by adding braces or a core. To adapt the Tower of Silos into design and fashion shops the concrete has to be repaired where reinforcement is visible to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. The final conclusion: The interventions and additions of the structures of The Mill and the Flour Warehouse are sound safe structures verified according to the Dutch Building Regulations and the Eurocode-regulations. The capacity of the existing structures is used at full extend and simple solutions make additions or adaptions possible. The monumental values are kept intact and the preconditions as set according to the vision of the architect and the client wishes are nearly achieved. Recommendations When an existing structure is adapted to the needs of a renovation project the following recommendations can be done: 9 ̆ 5 Use the methodology as generated in this thesis, based on the ABCD method. When data is thoroughly searched and compared with measurements from inspections on the structures it is possible to find failures and possibilities, which give a good base for the redesign. 9 ̆ 5 When there is a need for adapting the structure search for the extra capacity of a structure and make a solution with this capacity. 9 ̆ 5 From this thesis it appears that buildings build until at least 1947 were not designed on stability and or horizontal displacement, consider this when making a redesign for a structure of the same period.

40|$|Fire Flow Water Consumption in Sprinklered and Unsprinklered Buildings {{offers a}} {{detailed}} analysis for calculating the fire water demand required in buildings with existing and non-existant <b>sprinkler</b> systems. The <b>installation</b> of automatic <b>sprinkler</b> systems can significantly {{reduce the amount of}} water needed during a fire, but it requires water for commissioning, inspection, testing, and maintenance (CITM). This book provides an estimate of fire water used under both fire conditions, including CITM, to allow communities to develop fire water fees for both sprinklered and unsprinklered buildings that are proportional to the anticipated fire water usage. The types of buildings analyzed include residential (family dwellings as well as those up to four stories in height), business, assembly, institutional, mercantile, and storage facilities. Water volume was studied using guidelines from the International Code Council, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Insurance Services Office.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Policy analysts {{designing}} {{programs to}} improve the efficiency and expand the use {{of water in the}} irrigation of farm lands often enlist benefit-cost analysis as a means of assessing impacts and feasibility. While on-site comparisons of costs and benefits are important factors in project assessment, other dimensions such as risk, income distribution and offsite impacts may be overlooked. In this research a more complete approach to project analysis was sought. A simulation model of a river basin was developed. Paris Creek, Idaho, an area studied recently by the U. S. Soil Conservation Service, was the representative project location analyzed. An important design goal was to provide an analytical data processing template applicable to future studies. Paris Creek farmers are directly dependent on water available from Paris Creek. However, most years the flow is insufficient to provide adequate irrigation with present methods. High pumping costs, high seepage losses in delivery systems and low on-farm irrigation efficiencies compound the problem. A proposed improvement plan is analyzed, involving piped gravity-fed delivery systems and conversion from surface to <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation. <b>Installation</b> and government consulting costs are to be shared by the farmers and S. C. S. The computer model simulated monthly stream flows, irrigated crops, measured impacts, computed production benefits, and compiled costs and benefits affecting farmers and society. A 50 -year project life was assumed, and statistics were collected for 25 separate iterations. It was determined that north group farmers are almost always better off with the project when annual comparisons were made between conditions. Only in years of very low stream flow would farmers lose more money with the project. However, substantially higher variability in annual income could be expected, a condition of greater risk to farmers. Society as a whole was also found to experience an increase in net benefits, but not as great as for farmers and with greater annual variability. The model was effective in providing information about risk and income distribution. However, difficulty remains in assessing offsite impacts because there lacks an effective approach and appropriate data...|$|R
