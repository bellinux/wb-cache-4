50|$|Upon its {{scientific}} discovery, the Philippine eagle {{was first}} called the monkey-eating eagle because of reports from natives of Bonga, Samar, where the species was first discovered, that it preyed exclusively on monkeys; from these reports it gained its generic name, from the Greek pithecus (πίθηκος) ("ape or monkey") and phagus (-φάγος) ("eater of"). The species name commemorates Jeffery Whitehead, {{the father of}} John Whitehead. Later studies revealed, however, that the alleged monkey-eating eagle also ate other animals, such as colugos, civets, large snakes, monitor lizards, and even large birds, such as hornbills. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} the same name applied to the African crowned eagle and the Central and <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle,</b> resulted in a presidential proclamation to change its name to Philippine eagle in 1978, and in 1995 was declared a national emblem. This species has no recognized subspecies.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} <b>American</b> <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> to distinguish it from the Papuan eagle, which {{is sometimes}} known as the New Guinea <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> or Papuan <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle.</b> It is {{the largest and most}} powerful raptor found in the Americas, and among the largest extant species of eagles in the world. It usually inhabits tropical lowland rainforests in the upper (emergent) canopy layer. Destruction of its natural habitat has caused it to vanish from many parts of its former range, and it is nearly extirpated in Central America. In Brazil, the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is also known as royal-hawk (in gavião-real).|$|R

50|$|In Belize, the Belize <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagle</b> Restoration Project {{began in}} 2003 with the {{collaboration}} of Sharon Matola, {{founder and director}} of the Belize Zoo and the Peregrine Fund. The goal of this project was the re-establishment of the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> within Belize. The population of the eagle declined as a result of forest fragmentation, shooting, and nest destruction, resulting in near extirpation of the species. Captive-bred <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> were released in the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in Belize, chosen for its quality forest habitat and linkages with Guatemala and Mexico. Habitat linkage with Guatemala and Mexico were important for conservation of quality habitat and the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> on a regional level. As of November 2009, 14 <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> have been released and are monitored by the Peregrine Fund, through satellite telemetry.|$|R

50|$|The <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Vultur harpyja, after the mythological beast harpy. The {{only member of}} the genus Harpia, the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is most closely related to the crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) and the New Guinea <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> (Harpyopsis novaeguineae), the three composing the subfamily Harpiinae within the large family Accipitridae. Previously thought to be related, the Philippine eagle has been shown by DNA analysis to belong elsewhere in the raptor family, as it is related to the Circaetinae.|$|R

5000|$|Globally, the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{considered}} Near Threatened by IUCN and threatened with extinction by CITES (appendix I). The Peregrine Fund until recently {{considered it a}} [...] "conservation-dependent species", meaning it depends on a dedicated effort for captive breeding and release to the wild, as well as habitat protection, {{to prevent it from}} reaching endangered status, but now has accepted the Near Threatened status. The <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> {{is considered}} critically endangered in Mexico and Central America, where it has been extirpated in most of its former range; in Mexico, it used to be found as far north as Veracruz, but today probably occurs only in Chiapas in the Selva Zoque. It is considered as Near Threatened or Vulnerable in most of the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> portion of its range; at the southern extreme of its range, in Argentina, it is found only in the Parana Valley forests at the province of Misiones.

Fourteen blood samples from nine <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> were collected from animals of both sexes, of different ages and with no clinical signs of disease. Significant variations were found in haematological values of hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), leukocyte, a relative number of heterophils, absolute and relative number of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and plasma protein between groups of young (less than six months old) and adult birds. Comparing males and females there was variation in the values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) on heterophils, absolute and relative number of lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils. There was also variation in the values of red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), leukocyte count, absolute number of lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils among birds that study compared to another reference birds. Due to the limited information available on <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> hematology, this study will be useful to the clinical assessment of birds maintained in captivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the Tapajos-Xingu interfluve, one of {{the largest}} birds of prey, the <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagle,</b> is under intense {{anthropogenic}} pressure due to historical and recent reductions in forest cover. We studied prey availability and use by <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagle</b> on six breeding territories on the low- and mid-Xingu River, between 2013 and 2015. We evaluated food resource availability using the environmental-surveys database from two methods: terrestrial surveys (RAPELD method) and fauna rescue/flushing before vegetation suppression for the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex construction. <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagle</b> diet was identified by prey remains sampled around six nest trees. Eighteen species of mammals, birds and reptiles comprised the prey items. Most prey species were sloths, primates and porcupines, which have arboreal habits and are found in forested areas, but two species, hoatzin and iguana, are usually associated with riverine habitats. The proportion of prey from each species predated on the nest best studied was different from estimated availability (χ 2 = 54. 23; df = 16; p < 0. 001), however there was a positive correlation (rs = 0. 7; p < 0. 01) between prey species consumed and abundance available, where the predation was more on species more abundant. Continuous monitoring of the <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagle</b> diet at these nests could evidence changes in the assemblage of prey species available for <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagles,</b> due to changes in the seasonal flood pulse of the Xingu River to be caused by the operation of the hydroelectric dam, and changes in habitat features by forest reduction around breeding territories. We believe {{that it is important to}} consider the protection of remnants of forested areas in the landscape matrix surrounding the breeding territories to maintain the food resource availability and allow all pairs to successfully reproduce...|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{cited as the}} largest eagle alongside the Philippine eagle, that is somewhat longer on average and the Steller's sea eagle, that is slightly heavier on average. The wingspan of the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is relatively small, an adaptation that increases maneuverability in forested habitats and is shared by other raptors in similar habitats. The wingspan of the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is surpassed by several large eagles who live in more open habitats, {{such as those in}} the Haliaeetus and Aquila genera.
