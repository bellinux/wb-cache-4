The findings from the study were then used to understand how notches (cracks) located at the toe of slopes made of brittle materials influence their failure. For {{the first part of the}} study, a theoretical analysis that uses closed form solutions, linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and a numerical analysis that uses a finite element software (ABAQUS) were conducted to understand how the degree of curvature of circular and elliptical openings develops critical stresses that were the locations of the failure of the openings. The theoretical and numerical analysis established that the degree of curvature of the openings had a tremendous influence on where the secondary cracks developed. For the case of the elliptical samples, the attitude of the ellipse also had an influence on how the secondary cracks extend. For the case of the rock slopes with a notch (crack) at their toe, an extended finite element method (XFEM) based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory was utilized to model the <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> propagation that takes place from the tip of the notch subjected to gravity induced compression and gravity induced lateral pressure. The analysis that used XFEM established that the ratio between the shear stress acting parallel to the axis of the toe crack, and the vertical overburden compression normal to the axis of the notch had a marked influence on how the secondary cracks developed from the notch.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} recent progress in applying large-scale atomistic studies of crack dynamics along interfaces of dissimilar materials. We consider two linear-elastic material strips in which atoms interact with harmonic potentials, {{with a different}} spring constant in each layer leading to a soft and a stiff strip. The two strips are bound together with a weak potential whose bonds snap early upon a critical atomic separation. An initial crack serves as initiation point for the failure. We {{will focus on the}} maximum speed of mode I loaded cracks along such a biomaterial interface. Upon nucleation of the crack, it quickly approaches a velocity a few percent larger than the Rayleigh-wave speed of the soft material. After a critical time, we observe that a <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> is nucleated a few atomic spacings ahead of the crack. This <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> propagates at the Rayleigh-wave speed of the stiff material. If the elastic mismatch is sufficiently large, the <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> can be faster than the longitudinal wave speed of the soft material, thus propagating supersonically. Supersonic crack motion is clearly identified by two Mach cones in the soft material. This suggests that mother-daughter mechanisms, formerly only reported in mode II cracks in homogeneous materials, {{play an important role in}} interfacial mode I crack dynamics.

40|$|A unified phenomenological {{framework}} is proposed for fracturing phenomena in pre-cracked brittle materials. The {{framework is}} developed based on experimental observations from gypsum specimens loaded in uniaxial compression, with either open or closed (frictional) pre-existing discontinuities (flaws). The existing database that included observations from open flaws {{has been completed}} with an extensive series of laboratory experiments on gypsum specimens with three closed flaws. ^ Similar types of cracks and coalescence patterns are observed in specimens with open or closed cracks. Three types of cracks can occur: wing cracks, coplanar, and oblique <b>secondary</b> <b>cracks.</b> Wing cracks are tensile cracks that initiate {{at or near the}} tips of the flaws, are stable, and propagate in the direction of maximum compression. <b>Secondary</b> <b>cracks</b> are shear cracks. They are initially stable but may become unstable near coalescence. Coalescence is produced by the linkage of two flaws through wing <b>cracks,</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>cracks,</b> or a combination of wing and <b>secondary</b> <b>cracks.</b> When coalescence occurs through wing cracks only or through a combination of wing and <b>secondary</b> <b>cracks,</b> the process is stable. When coalescence occurs through <b>secondary</b> <b>cracks</b> only, the phenomenon is unstable. Seven types of coalescence have been identified based on the types of cracks that produce linkage of the flaws. The types of coalescence are related to the distribution of the flaws. In left stepping geometries coalescence generally involves wing cracks and/or coplanar shear cracks, while right stepping geometries tend to favor coalescence through wing cracks and/or oblique shear cracks. The laboratory experiments show that coalescence through wing cracks takes precedence. When this type of coalescence is not possible, the mechanism that takes priority is a combination of shear and tensile cracks. The last priority is for coalescence through shear cracks only. Thus coalescence stresses are the smallest when the linkage is through wing cracks and they are the largest when the linkage is through shear cracks only. The principal difference between experimental results from open and closed flaws is that initiation and coalescence stresses are higher for closed flaws than for open flaws. This is due to the friction along the closed flaws, which must be overcome before a crack can initiate and by the capability of closed flaws of transmitting normal stresses. ^ A new crack initiation criterion has been proposed based on the critical energy release rate. The criterion states that a tensile crack will initiate when the mode I energy release rate reaches the critical energy release rate GIC, which is material dependent, and along the direction where the energy release rate is maximum. An analogous criterion applies for shear cracks, where initiation occurs when the mode II energy release rate reaches the critical value GIIC, also a material property. The criterion has been implemented into the code FROCK. Comparisons between predictions from the code and experiments show that the criterion is able to predict initiation of the wing cracks and of the two types of <b>secondary</b> <b>cracks,</b> as well as the types of coalescence. Initiation stresses and angles are simulated within experimental results. The types of coalescence are predicted well for open flaws with left stepping geometries, while larger differences are observed for closed flaws and in particular for right stepping geometries. ...|$|R

If the elastic stored energy in the lens is high enough, the lens will fracture into many pieces (implosion). Three parameters control the degree of fracture in the vacuum barrier window: elastic stored energy (tensile stress), ratio of window thickness to flaw depth, and <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> propagation. Fracture experiments were conducted on 15 -cm dia fused silica windows that contain surface flaws caused by laser damage. Results, combined with window failure data on Beamlet and Nova, were used to develop design criteria for a ``fail-safe`` lens (that may catastrophically fracture but not implode). Specifically, the window must be made thick enough so that the peak tensile stress is less than 500 psi (3. 4 MPa) and the thickness/critical flaw size is less than 6. The air leak through the window fracture and into the vacuum must be rapid enough to reduce the load on the window before <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> growth occurs. Finite element stress calculations of a window before and immediately following fracture into two pieces show that the elastic stored energy is redistributed if the fragments ``lock`` in place and thereby bridge the opening. In such cases, the peak stresses at the flaw site can increase, leading to further (i. e. <b>secondary)</b> <b>crack</b> growth...|$|E
3000|$|Note {{that the}} {{original}} crack arrested at the interface of different materials as shown in Fig.  4 a and b, but a <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> emerged. Previous studies have implied that there were several scenarios for crack behavior as it approaches the interface between soft regions and rigid regions (Wu et al. 2004). Fracture pattern depends on the energy release rate, G_ 1 [...] = [...] K_lC^ 2 /E^', where, E^' [...] = [...] E and E^' [...] = [...] E ([...] 1 [...] - [...] U^ 2) for plane stress and plane strain problems, respectively. Unstable crack propagation was onset as K [...] l  = K [...] lC [...]. The stress intensity was K_l [...] = [...] σ√(π a), where σ was the normal stress along the crack faces, and a was {{the length of the}} crack. Once the cracks exited the weaker gravel the energy release rate (G [...] l [...]) tended to be zero (Nuller et al. 2001). This meant that the crack would arrest according to the Griffith criterion (Griffith 1921). However, σ became discontinuous across the interface and jumped to a value larger than the tensile strength of the rigid matrix. Thus, the high value of σ fostered the generation of a <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> that was oriented parallel to the original crack.|$|E
40|$|A remarkably {{high degree}} of {{plasticity}} in brittle epoxies during debonding failures is reported. The plasticity is exhibited {{by the presence of}} ridges on the debonded surfaces having a width and height above the general level of these surfaces of the order of 100 nm. The surfaces of the more rigid substrates from which the debonding has occurred, by contrast, are smooth after debonding. The ridges have been found in several forms: in more or less straight rows parallel to the debonding fracture direction; as irregularly-shapes rings or craters, probably formed from <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> growth; as paraboloids, which also seem to be related to <b>secondary</b> <b>crack</b> growth; and as serpentine rows more or less perpendicular to the debonding fracture direction. This behaviour has been exhibited by various epoxy formulations. The 100 nm widths and heights for the ridges suggest that during debonding, plastic deformation has occurred rather uniformly in the epoxy to a depth below the interface of this order. This behaviour is in contrast to the simple notion of brittle fracture, in which atoms or molecules separate across planes in an elastically strained body. It differs also from the bulk fracturing process with these resins, in which a smaller amplitude, more random ridge and groove texture, referred to as the “basic longitudinal” or “fingering” texture, is seen...|$|E

Whereas open-system heating gives raise to continuous primary product generation, closed-system experiments are marked by the overlap of primary generation and <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking</b> reactions; the apparent degree of overlap, however, {{turns out to be}} different for different compound classes. Primary generated C 15 + (total C 15 + fraction) compounds, in particular, are subjected to severe <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking</b> from the beginning. However, at temperatures lower than 460 degrees C for both samples, <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking</b> essentially transforms C 15 + compounds into C 6 - 14 (total C 6 - 14 fraction) compounds.

At temperatures higher than 460 degrees C <b>secondary</b> oil-to-gas <b>cracking</b> becomes obvious from the decrease of C 6 + concentrations. Because the open-system generation of C 6 + compounds has come to an end at this temperature, the overlap of primary and secondary reactions only affects the overall composition of the C 6 + fraction in the closed-system bur not the timing of secondary gas formation.

Poly(butylene terephthalate) was found to toughen the epoxy about twice as well as did the rubber. The toughness of poly(butylene terephthalate) -epoxy blends was independent of par-ticle size for sizes in the range of tens of micrometres, but the toughness of the nylon 6 -epoxy blends decreased with increasing particle size for sizes smaller than about 40 #m. There was no loss of either Young's modulus or yield strength of the epoxy with the inclusion of either nylon 6 or poly(butylene terephthalate) and less loss of these with the inclusion of poly(vinylidene fluoride) than with the inclusion of rubber.

The bridge angles {{between the two}} pre-existing cracks vary from 0 ° to 135 °. The digital speckle correlation method (DSCM) is {{used to analyze the}} captured images producing strain fields during the cracking process, and thus reveals the mode of cracking (either tensile, shear or their combination). Petal crack that initiates from internal crack fronts of the pre-existing surface cracks {{plays an important role in}} crack initiation, propagation and coalescence. Microcracks underneath the specimen surface appear as white patches on the surface, which always appear preceding the appearance of surface macrocracks (either wing or anti-wing cracks). Cracks, which grow in a direction opposite to that of wing cracks, were consistently observed before the appearance of wing cracks; and these cracks are therefore called "anti-wing cracks". In addition, DSCM results suggest that wing crack and anti-wing crack are tensile during initiation but may subsequently turn into mixed mode. The coalescence between the two 3 -D pre-existing surface cracks takes place both on the specimen surface (through wing, anti-wing cracks or secondary cracks) and inside the specimen (through internal petal cracks).

The three bolts present very similar failure processes, with a circumferential external crack that led to the final failure. The morphology of the crack propagation is typical of Hydrogen-Induced Stress Corrosion Cracking (HISCC), with mixed intergranular-transgranular micromechanisms, tearing processes and <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking.</b> The cracks then grew subcritically until they reached their critical size. Quench cracking or fatigue processes have been ruled out...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of light paraffins to olefins and the secondary {{reactions of the}} unsaturated compounds were investigated on H-ZSM 5 and H-Y zeolites between 733 and 823 K. Steady state- and transient response-isotope tracing studies revealed that two mechanisms of dehydrogenation are operative. The main pathway is represented by monomolecular, protolytic dehydrogenation. This reaction contributes most to steady state olefin production. Additionally, at {{the initial stages of}} the reaction, extra framework aluminum moieties are speculated to participate in high dehydrogenation activity. This pathway is blocked at later stages of the reaction by product (hydrogen) inhibition. The intrinsic rates of protolytic dehydrogenation and olefin desorption range in the same order of magnitude. At high protolytic dehydrogenation rates, olefin desorption represents the rate determining step. Depending on the process conditions, olefins undergo <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking,</b> oligomerization, or isomerization. The latter proceeds via intramolecular rearrangement, possibly via a cyclopropylcarbenium ion at high temperatures and low conversions. At reaction conditions where bimolecular cracking prevails, isomerization is concluded to occur via <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking</b> of di- or oligomers...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{failure modes}} {{observed}} in fiber reinforced intermetallic matrix composites are analyzed {{by using a}} micromechanical analytical model based on the con-sistent shear lag theory. Stress distribution is examined {{for a number of}} damage configura-tions such as interface split, fiber bridging and <b>secondary</b> <b>cracking.</b> Based on the point stress failure criterion, prediction of failure mode is made for a fiber reinforced unidirec-tional composite with central transverse crack and subjected to a remote uniform stress...|$|R
