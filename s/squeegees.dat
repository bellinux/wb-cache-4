5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used <b>squeegees</b> to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E

6000|$|We were Argonauts--even the Red Cross ladies {{on their}} way to {{establish}} rest camps behind the lines and brave the mud and rains of a winter in eastern France. None, indeed, were more imbued with the forthfaring spirit than these women, who were leaving, without regret, sheltered, comfortable lives to face hardships and brave dangers without a question. And no sharper proof of the failure of the old social order to provide for human instincts and needs could be found than the conviction they gave of new and vitalizing forces released in them. The timidities with which their sex is supposedly encumbered had disappeared, and even the possibility of a disaster at sea held no terrors for them. When the sun fell down into the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the cabins below were sealed--and thus become insupportable--they settled themselves for the night in their steamer-chairs and smiled at the remark of M. le Commissaire {{that it was a good}} [...] "season" [...] for submarines. The moonlight filtered through the chinks in the burlap shrouding the deck. About 3 a.m. the khaki-clad lawyer from Milwaukee became communicative, the Red Cross ladies produced chocolate. It was the genial hour before the final nap, from which one awoke abruptly at the sound of <b>squeegees</b> and brooms to find the deck a river of sea water, on whose banks a wild scramble for slippers and biscuit-boxes invariably ensued. No experience could have been more socializing.|$|E

They produce very consistent solder volumes and are resistant to scooping the solder paste out of the apertures when printing. In addition, they have better wear characteristics, leading to longer life.|$|E

50|$|In {{his book}} Leadership, Giuliani {{explained}} that his method of removing the <b>squeegee</b> {{men from the}} street involved arresting them. Patrolmen who first made the arrests saw that the <b>squeegee</b> men were released immediately, because according to the New York penal code at the time, cleaning someone's windshield was not illegal. Giuliani told the officers that if they saw any more <b>squeegee</b> men they should simply arrest them for jaywalking.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{development}} of the skyscraper in the 20th century, a more efficient tool for the cleaning of window exteriors was needed. Professional window washers began using the Chicago <b>squeegee,</b> a bulky tool with two heavy pink rubber blades. Changing the blades required the loosening of twelve separate screws. The modern single-blade window cleaning <b>squeegee</b> was patented by Ettore Steccone in 1936; who dubbed it the [...] "New Deal". It was made of lightweight brass with a very flexible and sharp rubber blade. Steccone began a manufacturing process and sold the product in his garage. The Ettore Products Co. is still the leader in the <b>squeegee</b> market today. <b>Squeegee</b> kits can include a telescoping pole to extend the washer's reach.|$|R

50|$|Ziba's {{designers}} {{determined that}} the traditional T-shape of a <b>squeegee</b> was not the most efficient for a wiping motion in a confined area such as a shower stall. After researching the way window washers and filling-station attendants would put their hands close to the blade and rarely use the handle, Ziba designed a plastic <b>squeegee</b> without a traditional handle; instead, it had a tubular rubber grip running parallel to curved twin blades, which moves across glass or mirrors with a wiping motion to reduce strain to the hand and wrist. The dual blades leave a surface cleaner than a single blade <b>squeegee.</b>|$|R
