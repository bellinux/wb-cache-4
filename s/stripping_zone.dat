40|$|Ethylene Oxide was ﬁrst {{reported}} in 1859 as being prepared from {{the reaction of}} potassium hydroxide on ethylene chlorohydrins. But nowadays it is mainly prepared by direct oxidation of ethylene with oxygen on silver based catalyst. In its ﬁnal product stream along with ethylene oxide many other impurities like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, unconverted ethylene, water and other inert gases are also present. So its puriﬁcation consist of many stages which includes <b>stripping</b> <b>zone,</b> scrubbing zone, phase separator, an ethylene oxide puriﬁcation zone and their interconnections. In its scrubbing step ethylene oxide is scrubbed from other impurities with help of excess of water which needs to be removed {{so it can be}} reused for scrubbing purpose as well as to get pure ethylene oxide. For commercial purpose like its use in epoxy paints, as surfactants demands highly pure ethylene oxide having purity of more than 99. 5 %. Present study aims to separate Ethylene oxide from water at minimum cost and high purity using distillation process as a means of purifying technique and then designing its heat exchangers as well as storage tanks to store crude Ethylene oxide as well puriﬁed ethylene oxide and ﬁnally preparing its process ﬂow diagram to show how exactly the whole purifying stages are connected. Distillation operation is a widely used separation technology because of its ability to providehighly pure components although at high energy cost. In present study Distillation is evaluated has separationtechnology for separation of Ethylene oxide from water. Simulation of Distillation column were carried out using chemical simulators and then results obtained from simulation were veriﬁed for column eﬃciency by manual calculation as well as program was prepared using Excel to check eﬃciency.

This paper aimed to elaborate land-cover maps using digital satellite images obtained in 1997 from seven watersheds (Piracicaba, Moji-Guaçu, Alto Paranapanema, Turvo Aguapeí, Peixe, and São José dos Dourados) located in the State of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Additionaly, this study evaluated the relationship between land-cover and slopes of the terrain of the seven watersheds. A third objective was to estimate the percentage of riparian vegetation currently remaining along the streams in a 30 -meter width buffer zone. Three research questions were posed: i) What is the dominant land-cover of these watersheds? ii) Is the riparian vegetation well preserved in the 30 m width buffer zone? If not, iii) what is the dominant land-cover in these areas {{and what would be}} the cost of recovering such areas? Pasture was the predominant land-cover, occurring in approximately 50 % of the entire study area, while sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) (14 %) constituted the second most frequent land-cover. Approximately 50 % of the area of the seven basins is considered flat (40 %) or smoothly rolling (10 %). The terrain only becomes hillier in the Piracicaba and Alto Paranapanema basins, where a little less than 50 % have slopes higher than 8 %.

40|$|The Single Roll Continuous Strip Casting Process {{has been}} quantitatively {{analysed}} using {{a mathematical model}} based on fluid flow and heat transfer considerations. The process is divided into four distinct zones: (1) liquid metal reservoir, (2) liquid metal pool, (3) solid <b>strip</b> <b>zone,</b> and (4) caster drum. Model equations are formulated using a control volume approach and setting up equations representing balances of mass, momentum and energy for these various zones. These equations, which are coupled by the thermophysical properties and various interfaces, are solved using an iterative finite difference technique. It has been possible to simulate the process and predict the effect of various process parameters on the process performance using the model. The parameters examined include: (1) liquid steel head in the tundish, (2) speed of rotation of the caster drum, (3) superheat of melt in the tundish, (4) gap between the caster drum and the tundish, (5) cooling conditions prevailing at the inner surface of the drum, (6) drum geometry, and (7) drum material.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the veer-off risk of an Italian airport that is characterized for having near 12, 000 annual movements. The name of this airport is not disclosed for security purposes. The methodology used followed the principles of probabilistic risk analysis in order to characterize the events and assess the corresponding damages. The study used statistical data about accident reports and local conditions that were collected following the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The methodology used in this work complies with the guidelines for the adjustment of lateral runway strips, edited by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC). Besides, data available in worldwide databases of airplane accidents were also gathered and included as part of the analysis. The method used to assess the veer-off risk of the airport is consistent with probability and damage quantification methods published in the literature. The main variables considered in the analysis were traffic information, wind conditions, the existence of landsidebuildings adjacent to the runway, and the geotechnical conditions of the subgrade underneath the <b>strip</b> <b>zones.</b> For the assessment of the veer-off risk, the authors used primary data provided by the airport management body within the period 2013 - 2015 and secondary data available in the literature. The risk of veer-off was calculated in more than 1, 500 points around the runway. Besides, the authors proposed maximum allowable risks in different locations, and these values were compared to the actual risk levels previously computed. The results of this comparison suggested that improvements in the soil capacity and/or in the airport management activities might contribute to achieve the proposed allowable risk. The results from this assessment showed that the two critical variables determining the risk of veer-off accidents in the airport under evaluation were wind conditions and the bearing capacity of the soil underneath the strip areas. Also, it was found that the highest veer-off risk level obtained within the Cleared and Graded Area (CGA, part of the runway strip cleared of all obstacles and graded) was 2 10 - 7, while the lowest level was 3 10 - 8, which are considered typical risk ranges in airport operations. In general, the results demonstrate that the adopted methodology is a useful tool to evaluate the veer-off risk of a specific airport. Besides, the method allows comparing the actual levels of risk with proposed target levels of safety. Consequently, the quantification of the veer-off risk levels offers the airport management body the possibility of implementing appropriate measurements in those cases where minimum safety requirements are not achieved...|$|R

We explore a wide range of time scales by considering two light curves from each simulation; one uses a relativistic turbulence code with bulk velocities taken from our simulations as input, while the other uses the bulk velocity data to compute fluctuations caused by variations in the Doppler boosting due to changes in the direction and the speed of the flow through all <b>zones</b> in the <b>strip.</b> We then calculate power spectral densities (PSDs) from the light curves for both turbulent and bulk velocity origins for variability.

When superimposed, these power spectra span a very large range in frequency (about five decades), with the turbulent fluctuations yielding most of the shorter timescale variations and the bulk flow changes dominating the longer periods.

The fracture process is modeled using a cohesive zone model (CZM) where the fracture process is treated as a microscale <b>strip</b> (cohesive <b>zone)</b> and is represented by a continuum traction-separation law. Attention is focused on two issues. Firstly, the parameters affecting fracture resistance are studied systematically, emphasizing the roles of microstructural parameters and continuum properties of solids. Secondly, the effect of the interleaf thickness on failure (crack initiation and subsequent crack growth) is investigated. The results show that the interleaf thickness almost does not affect crack initiation. For all specimens considered, crack initiation takes place at the crack tip. However, after crack initiation, the interleaf thickness 'significantly' affects fracture resistance. Reducing the interleaf thickness significantly increases the load-carrying capacity. More importantly, it is observed that ductile fracture in a thin interleaf is associated with an instability. (orig.) First published in: Schwalbe, K. H.; Kocak, M. (eds.) : 2.

40|$|Cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project Holes 501, 504 B and 505 B have {{an unusual}} near-vein zonation in basalts. Megascopically, zonation occurs as {{differently}} colored <b>strips</b> and <b>zones</b> whose typical thickness does not exceed 6 to 7 cm. Microscopically, {{the color of}} zones depends on variably colored clay minerals which are the products of low-temperature hydrothermal alteration in basalt. These differently colored zones form the so called "oxidative" type of alteration of basalts. Another "background," or, less precisely termed, "non-oxidative," type of alteration in basalts is characterized by large-scale, homogeneous replacement of olivine, and filling of vesicles and cracks by an olive-brown or olive-green clay mineral. The compositions of clay minerals of the "background" type of alteration, {{as well as the}} composition of co-existing titanomagnetites, were determined with an electron microprobe. There are sharp maxima in potassium and iron content, and minima in alumina, silica, and magnesia in clay minerals in the colored zones near veins. Coloring of clay and rock-forming minerals by iron hydroxides and a decrease of the amount of titanomagnetite, which apparently was the source of redeposited iron, occur frequently in colored zones. We assume that the large-scale "background" alteration in the basalts occurred under the effect of pore waters slowly penetrating through bottom sediments. Faulting can facilitate access of fresh sea water to basalts; thus above the general homogeneous background arise zones of "oxidative" alteration along fractures in basalts. The main factors controlling these processes are time (age of basalt), grain size, temperature, thickness of sedimentary cover, and heat flow...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2002 Dr. David Martin NashNutrient exports, in particular phosphorus, are {{a major problem for}} Gippsland and many other regions of the world. This thesis investigates the export of phosphorus in overland flow from pasture-based grazing systems in south-eastern Australia. Initially, field-scale monitoring is used to investigate the forms of phosphorus in overland flow with a view to identifying the primary mobilisation process. It is shown that from a well-managed pasture, phosphorus was primarily mobilised as a result of dissolution rather than physical detachment (erosion) processes. Phosphorus in the overland flow is shown to be predominantly in the dissolved reactive form (DRP). It follows that remedial strategies that rely on physically trapping phosphorus entrained in overland flow (i. e. buffer <b>strips</b> and riparian <b>zones)</b> are unlikely to be effective. The field-scale monitoring data are then used to investigate the structure of phosphorus exports. It is shown that the data conforms to a base-plus-increments model. It is proposed that phosphorus exports can be divided into a base or systematic component that results from a particular land use management system, and an incremental or incidental (preventable) component that is the result of particular management decisions, activities or incidents.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} paper a crack arrest model is {{proposed}} for an infinitely long narrow poled piezoelectric strip embedded with a centrally situated finite hairline straight crack. Design/methodology/approach: The ceramic of the strip {{is assumed to be}} mechanically brittle and electrically ductile. Combined mechanical and electrical loads applied {{at the edge of the}} strip open the rims of the crack in mode-I deformations. Consequently a yield zone protrudes ahead of each tip of the crack. Under small scale yielding the yield zone are assumed to lie on the line segment along the axis of the crack. To arrest the crack from further opening the rims of the yield zones are subjected to normal, cohesive quadratically varying yield point stress. Two cases are considered: Case-I the edges of the strip are subjected to in-plane normal and in-plane electrical displacement and in Case-II the in-plane stresses and in-plane electrical field are applied on the edges of the strip. In each case problem is solved using Fourier transform method which finally reduces to the solution of integral equation. Findings: Analytic expressions are derived for stress intensity factor, yield zone, crack opening displacement, crack growth rate, variation of these quantities with respect to affecting parameters viz. width of the <b>strip,</b> yield <b>zone</b> length, crack length, material constants for different ceramics have been plotted. Research limitations/implications: The material of the strip is assumed mechanically brittle and electrically ductile consequently mechanically singularity is encountered first. The investigations in this paper are carried at this level. Also the crack yielding under the loads is considered small scale hence the yield zone is assumed to be lying on the line segment ahead of the crack. Practical implications: Piezoelectric ceramics are widely used as sensors and actuators, this necessity prompts the fracture study on such ceramics under different loading conditions. Originality/value: The paper gives an assessment of the quadratically varying load required to be prescribed on yield zones so as to arrest the opening of the crack. The investigations are useful to smart material design technology where sensors and actuators are manufactured...|$|R

Several European initiatives are promising models, including the strategies of the Danish Land Development Service (Hedeselskabet) and the Icelandic Soil Conservation Service (Landsgraedsla Rikisins). The Erosienormeringsprojekt of South Limburg (The Netherlands) is a coordinated and integrated soil conservation project and seems a particularly useful model for future soil conservation in northern Europe. Several best management practices for soil conservation are identified. These include the promotion of soil conservation by a properly funded and relatively well known soil conservation service and full mapping, monitoring and costing of erosion risk by national soil survey organizations. A participatory approach to soil conservation should be adopted, involving farmers and interested members of the public, {{and there should be}} a 'cost share' partnership between government and farmers in funding conservation work on farms. Rational land-use policies need to be developed, such as the promotion of 'set-aside' on erodible soils, grass strips on arable slopes and buffer <b>strips</b> in riparian <b>zones.</b> Education programmes are necessary to actively inform the public on the importance of soil as a resource. These schemes should particularly encourage 'land literacy' among participants. It is imperative that the broader societal benefits of effective soil conservation are recognized, such as its potential contribution to habitat creation, biodiversity and carbon sequestration...|$|R

40|$|We report optical {{observations}} of the Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) HR Carinae which show that the star has reached a visual minimum phase in 2009. More importantly, we detected absorptions due to Si IV 4088 - 4116 Angstroms. To match their observed line profiles from 2009 May, a high rotational velocity of vrot= 150 +- 20 km/s is needed (assuming an inclination angle of 30 degrees), implying that HR Car rotates at ~ 0. 88 +- 0. 2 of its critical velocity for break-up (vcrit). Our results suggest that fast rotation is typical in all strong-variable, bona-fide galactic LBVs, which present S Dor-type variability. Strong-variable LBVs are located in a well-defined region of the HR diagram during visual minimum (the "LBV minimum instability strip"). We suggest this region corresponds to where vcrit is reached. To the left of this <b>strip,</b> a forbidden <b>zone</b> with vrot/vcrit> 1 is present, explaining why no LBVs are detected in this zone. Since dormant/ex LBVs like P Cygni and HD 168625 have low vrot, we propose that LBVs can be separated in two groups: fast-rotating, strong-variable stars showing S-Dor cycles (such as AG Car and HR Car) and slow-rotating stars with much less variability (such as P Cygni and HD 168625). We speculate that SN progenitors which had S-Dor cycles before exploding (such as in SN 2001 ig, SN 2003 bg, and SN 2005 gj) could have been fast rotators. We suggest that the potential difficulty of fast-rotating Galactic LBVs to lose angular momentum is an additional evidence that such stars could explode during the LBV phase.

40|$|Nabq {{protectorate}} is one {{of wonderful}} natural places in Egypt. It is characterized by diversity of bio-lives such as man grove forests, coral colonies, wild life plants and migratory birds. Ongoing growth of tourism industries at Sharm El Sheikh northward into the Nabq protectorate causes severe hazards on its natural resources. The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess the present geo-environmental hazards in the Nabq protectorate. Assessment includes the analysis of satellite images, topographical, geological and other ancillary geological data using GIS technology. GIS data analyses indicate that the area is under threat from some of geo-hazards. Rough topography and mass wasting with high prob ability of flash flooding threaten different constructions in this area. The mobilization of coastal sand dunes, wave ac tion and tidal currents are natural impacts on Nabq ecosystems, where moved dunes leave clay soils that are removed in some places by tropical storms increasing sea water turbidity that threaten the corals and other living organisms in the tidal flat region. The seismic activity hazard in the study area is usually active on lineaments extending parallel to the trend of the Gulf of Aqaba-Dead Sea transform fault where the Nabq protectorate occupies its southern segment. Un wise planning activities destroy the natural environmental resources in Nabq area by construction of new resorts on mangrove forests, coral colonies and raised beaches. Hazard assessment identifies land suitability and land use maps that are clearly exhibit models of traditional dams and buffer <b>strips</b> on coastal <b>zone</b> and highways as well as around the Bedouin communities which are worked on tourism and fishing. These maps are urgent in need of an assessment and rehabilitation program to mitigate geo-hazard. </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{precision}} agriculture {{to provide}} {{both economic and}} environmental benefits over conventional farm practice, management strategies must be developed to accommodate the spatial variability in crop performance that occurs within fields. Experiments were established in crops of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) over three seasons. The aim of which was to evaluate a set of variable rate nitrogen strategies and examining the spatial variation in crop response to applied N. The optimum N application rate varied from 90 to in excess of 160 kg [N] ha− 1 {{in different parts of}} the field, which supports the case for applying spatially variable rates of N. This, however, is highly dependent on seasonal variations, e. g. the quantity and distribution of rainfall and the effect that this has on soil moisture deficits and crop growth. Estimates of yield potential, produced from either historic yield data or shoot density maps derived from airborne digital photographic images, were used to divide experimental <b>strips</b> into management <b>zones.</b> These zones were then managed according to two N application strategies. The results from the historic yield approach, based on 3 yr of yield data, were inconsistent, and it was concluded that that this approach, which is currently the most practical commercial system, does not provide a suitable basis for varying N rates. The shoot density approach, however, offered considerably greater potential as it takes account of variation in the current crop. Using this approach, it was found that applying additional N to areas with a low shoot population and reducing N to areas with a high shoot population resulted in an average strategy benefit of up to 0 · 36 t ha− 1 compared with standard farm practice...|$|R
