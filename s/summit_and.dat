5|$|In August 1969, Canadian Forces Maritime Command divers {{made more}} dives during {{scientific}} {{studies by the}} Fisheries Research Board of Canada.

5|$|On August 26, 1823, Joseph F.

5|$|The Llanberis Path is {{the longest}} route to the <b>summit,</b> <b>and</b> has the shallowest gradient. It largely follows {{the line of the}} Snowdon Mountain Railway, and is {{considered}} the easiest and least interesting route to the summit of Snowdon. It is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} hill running on Ben Nevis {{dates back to}} 1895. William Swan, a barber from Fort William, made the first {{recorded}} timed ascent up the mountain on or around 27 September of that year, when he ran from the old post office in Fort William to the <b>summit</b> <b>and</b> back in 2 hours 41 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} the summit leads {{through one of the}} ramps to the saddle between the main <b>summit</b> <b>and</b> its western trabant. The passage on the top cone is secured by ropes for {{unprepared}} tourists. One of the variants of the Polar Route follows the coast of Amerloq Fjord {{at the base of the}} southern wall of Nasaasaaq. The main summit is visited for its long-range view of the coast, although more limited to the north than that of Palasip Qaqqaa to the north of the town airport. An alternative {{route to the}} top of interest to mountaineers leads through the hard to find low pass to the east of the main <b>summit,</b> <b>and</b> from there directly on the summit cone ridge.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} climbers are {{attempting}} Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth. We compiled interview data and computed the probabilities of <b>summiting</b> <b>and</b> of dying {{as a function}} of climber age and gender (2211 climbers, spring season) for the period of 1990 – 2005. Men and women had similar odds of <b>summiting</b> <b>and</b> of dying. However, climbers older than 40 years have reduced odds of <b>summiting,</b> <b>and</b> those older than 60 years have increased odds of dying, especially when descending from the summit.

5|$|The northwestern {{slope of}} Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, {{the result of}} the rain shadow effect, as the {{dominant}} trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage {{they have been able to}} capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the <b>summit</b> <b>and</b> left with Wai'ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from the north side of the <b>summit,</b> <b>and</b> as a result is a deep, long, narrow bottomed valley with little habitable floodplain.|$|E
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the <b>summit,</b> <b>and</b> {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits.

The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous <b>summit,</b> <b>and</b> off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E

Because of his interim appointment, Gibbs faced an election in November 2008 to retain his new Senate seat. Christine Scanlan was appointed to fill Gibbs' vacant house seat on December 19, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcanoes with which this eruptive type is hallmark. Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types {{of volcanic}} events, characterized by the effusive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lavas with low gaseous content. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions {{is less than half}} of that found in other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a shield volcano. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the <b>summit</b> <b>and</b> from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E
5|$|In pre-contact times, natives {{traveling}} up Mauna Kea {{were probably}} guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as {{no evidence of}} the latter has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its <b>summit,</b> <b>and</b> traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the <b>summit</b> <b>and</b> flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Monte Testaccio {{also had}} a {{religious}} significance; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem, when the Pope would lead a procession to the <b>summit</b> <b>and</b> placed crosses to represent those of Jesus and the two thieves crucified alongside him. Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event. It was not until after World War II that {{the area around the}} hill was redeveloped as a working class neighbourhood.|$|E
