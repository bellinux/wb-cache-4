500|$|Alexandra {{undertook}} {{many public}} duties; {{in the words}} of Queen Victoria, [...] "to <b>spare</b> <b>me</b> the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty." [...] She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called [...] "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met. Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously, but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, which the British press still portrayed in a positive light, describing the crowds as [...] "enthusiastic". As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College, Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they <b>spare</b> <b>me</b> {{a few days in}} Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is [...] "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his magnum opus sacrum, the opera, Dialogues des Carmélites." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{extended}} {{version of this}} very short duet appears in the piano-vocal score. Only the initial phrases of this passage {{are found in the}} original full score, and the section which begins with the Queen's phrase Hélas! Dieu m'épargne la honte [...] "Alas! may God <b>spare</b> <b>me</b> the shame" [...] is marked as a possible cut. The scoring of the remainder of the duet was thought lost. The original manuscript with the full score of the duet was recently found at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. The uncut duet is performed in the video recording with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet. It is included as an appendix in the recording with Thomas Hampson as Hamlet (see Recordings).|$|E

2500|$|According to stenographic {{transcripts}} {{translated by}} Hugh Trevor-Roper of conversations between Hitler and {{his inner circle}} which took place between July 1941 and November 1944, Hitler regarded himself as a vegetarian. These conversations were gathered together under the title Hitler's Table Talk. Written notes taken {{at the time were}} transcribed and then were edited by Martin Bormann. According to these transcripts dated 11 November 1941, Hitler said, [...] "One may regret living at a period when it's impossible to form an idea of the shape the world of the future will assume. But there's one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian." [...] On 12 January 1942, he said, [...] "The only thing of which I shall be incapable is to share the sheiks' mutton with them. I'm a vegetarian, and they must <b>spare</b> <b>me</b> from their meat." [...] In a diary entry dated 26 April 1942, Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a committed vegetarian, writing, ...|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, <b>spare</b> <b>me</b> your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E

6000|$|And {{behold the}} superstition {{affected}} even the licentious good-for- nothing Abbe.
