After logging and transport to the landing by a forwarder, the wood is loaded on trucks for further transport, often by using separate loaders. During this handling process considerable amounts of stone material is sometimes mixed into the pulpwood and this causes problems for the industry. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify which part of the chain from forest to pulpmill, that contributes the most to this contamination. Sizes and total volumes of the contaminating stones were also investigated. Landings with stacks of wood were picked through by a forwarder to locate the individual stones. The same stacks were then run through the industry process and stones from the stone traps were registered. The result show that three quarters of the stone material could be related to the use of a separate loader at the landing while the forwarder contributed with the remaining one quarter.

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} fast growth in {{greenhouse}} gas emissions have encouraged several countries to increase their use of renewable energy. According to the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), 20 % of all the energy production in the EU should come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Woody biomass can be one choice within bioenergy for mitigating climate change if replacing fossil fuels. However, the demand for wood fuels has increased recently, and in Europe, the demand is predicted to exceed European supply, so we therefore need to consider more wood energy sources. Here, wood fuels from mountain forests can be an interesting alternative. Globally, mountain forests cover 28 % of the total forested areas, while in Europe {{one quarter of the}} forest is located in mountain areas. Thus, there is a large potential for harvesting woody biomass for bioenergy use. The aim of this PhD study is to assess the GHG emissions associated with two wood fuel supply chains from mountain forests. Two case studies, one in Norway (Hedmark-Oppland counties) and one in Italy (Valle di Fiemme -Trentino-Alto Adige region) are analyzed and compared. The methodology used is the Life Cycle Assessment, which is an established tool for assessing the mentioned environmental impact for the supply system through its life cycle – from the forest stand to the user (bioenergy plant), through forest management, logging operations, transportation and combustion at the plant. The chosen functional unit is one <b>solid</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> over bark (1 m 3 s. o. b.). The environmental impact category under assessment was climate change, expressed as global warming potential (GWP) with a time horizon of 100 years in terms of the amount of GHG emissions. In the study, a cost analysis (NOK or euro/m 3 s. o. b.) is performed, and an analysis of the employment impacts (hours/m 3 s. o. b.) is conducted in the Italian case related to the examined supply chains. Comparison with lowland forest or other types of renewable energy is outside the scope of this study. The PhD thesis consists of four papers. Papers 1 and 2 deal with the Norwegian case study, while Paper 3 describes the Italian case study. Paper 4 compares the main findings of each case study, analysing the differences and similarities between the Norwegian and Italian supply chains. Paper 1 provides {{the first part of the}} Norwegian case study, comprising the production stages from the mountain forest stands to the terminal. Mountain forests were highlands located in flat terrain. Forest management, logging operations and transportation to the terminal were the processes assessed. Forest residues, generally left at the forest stand, were harvested and bundled. Fuel consumption, raw material and primary energy use were calculated as input parameters. Results showed that the operation with the highest emissions and costs was transportation of woody biomass to the terminal, due to high fuel consumption and long transportation distance. Forest management had the lowest emissions, but highest costs. Bundling had high emissions and costs, even if long transport distance might make this operation advantageous in mountain areas. The present forest management and transport logistics are elements, which can be improved, seen from a GHG perspective. In Paper 2, the second part of the Norwegian supply chain is assessed; i. e. from the terminal to the biomass combustion plant. The benefits of replacing fossil fuel (natural gas, coal and oil) with wood fuel from the mountain sites, as described in paper 1, were calculated based on the assumption of carbon neutrality. Two alternatives were analyzed: i) a local supply chain, where raw materials from lowland forests were chipped at the terminal and transported by truck to a local district heating plant, and ii) an international supply chain, where raw materials from both lowland and highland forests were chipped at the terminal and exported by train to a combined heat and power plant in Sweden. The local supply chain had larger emissions than the export alternative. Both railway transportation and energy cogeneration made the international supply chain more efficient than the local alternative. The wood chips from mountain forests in Norway can be an option for covering the increasing demand for wood fuels in Sweden. Furthermore, the results indicate that the export of wood chips from Norway to Sweden is currently economically viable. Paper 3 presents the Italian case study carried out in Valle di Fiemme-Trentino region. In this paper, the social aspect (i. e. the direct employment potential) was assessed in addition to the environmental and economic aspects. The LCA concerned a local supply chain from mountain forest stands located in steep terrains to combustion at a district heating plant, where wood fuels were assumed to replace a fossil fuel plant (natural gas or oil plant). Logging residues, generally left at the forest stand, were harvested and chipped at the landing site. Chipping was the operation with the largest emissions followed by transportation by truck. Extraction by cable yarder was the operation with the highest costs along the supply chain. Regarding the analysis of employment, transportation and yarding operation created working opportunities. The use of woody biomass for energy can generate new jobs, although the topic of job creation is under discussion in the forestry sector. Furthermore, comparisons between an innovative (more mechanized) and a traditional logging system (more manual work) were presented, indicating that the substitution of a motor manual with a mechanized logging system reduced both emissions and costs. Paper 4 compares results from the Norwegian case study (paper 1 and 2) and the Italian case study (paper 3). Distinctive features of each case study, both similarities and differences, are discussed. The main results from the Norwegian case study were: a high rate of mechanization in harvesting highland forests located in flat terrain, chipping at the terminal, and a preference for an international supply chain (i. e. export to Sweden). The main features of the Italian supply chain were: a predominance of motor manual operations, felling trees in steep terrain, chipping at the landing of logging residues, absence of a terminal, and a local supply chain. The overall comparison between the case studies showed larger emissions for the Norwegian supply chain than the Italian one, due to higher mechanization and more steps involved in the supply chain. That also explained the higher costs for the Norwegian case. However, the greenhouse gas balance for the studied supply chains was still positive when wood fuels substituted fossil fuels. The analysis of employment was a critical aspect, and needs further investigation. The papers show large differences in how wood fuel supply chains are handled in the studied mountainous areas, making it difficult to formulate general conclusions. However, our case studies clearly show the potential for using woody biomass for bioenergy from mountain forests and the feasibility of harvesting wood fuels there with positive GHG impacts and without increasing the operative costs dramatically. The improvement of critical aspects of the supply chain operations may reduce emissions and costs. The evaluation of other impacts, in particular biodiversity aspects and deeper analyses should be made to ensure the fulfilment of sustainability criteria...|$|E
