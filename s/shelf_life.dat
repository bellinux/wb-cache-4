5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E

40|$|Cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum Schum.) is {{an exotic}} fruit with a {{promising}} economic potential, particularly {{due to its}} strong aroma and creamy texture. This study aimed to produce sweetened cupuaçu puree and evaluate the effects of packaging corrosion on its sensory properties and <b>shelf</b> - <b>life</b> in tinplated cans. After 240 days of storage, the commercially sterile product had average sensory analysis scores of 5. 89 ± 0. 21, 5. 39 ± 0. 30, 5. 45 ± 0. 21 and 5. 49 ± 0. 25, for appearance, aroma, flavor and overall appreciation, respectively. Sensory acceptance scores did not change during storage (p> 0. 05). Corrosion potential and low tin and iron levels in the product, which are parameters used to evaluate food - packaging interaction, demonstrated the product remained food - safe throughout its <b>shelf</b> - <b>life.</b> Tinplate is a promising packaging material for sweetened cupuaçu puree due to its mechanical and protective properties.

5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was about {{packaging}} methodologies and processing techniques to extend <b>shelf</b> [...] <b>life</b> of longan fruits (Dimocarpus longan). There were five types of processing techniques that had been used were crunchy longan pickle, longan pickle, longan dried salted pickle, longan syrup and dried longan. The types of packaging methodologies used in this study were air tight containers, sealed plastic bag, glass jar and vacuum packaging. The duration period of the experiment was about two months. All of the data collected was analyzed using SPSS Software with Two Way ANOVA methods. From the observation, it was found that the most suitable processing techniques to extend <b>shelf</b> [...] <b>life</b> of longan were crunchy longan pickle, longan dried salted pickle and dried longan since these three types of methods can extend the shelf —life of longan for about two months. For the packaging methodologies, all types of packaging were suitable to use for crunchy longan pickle, longan dried salted pickle and dried pickle since there were no significance difference occur between the usage of all four types of packaging besides for longan pickle and longan syrup. These were because the two types of longan processing techniques become rotten after one week of storage.
