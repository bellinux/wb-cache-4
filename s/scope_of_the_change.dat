The Agency was faced {{with the need for}} urgent and major transformational change, effectively tripling its size. The change was due to take effect within a limited, predetermined and non-negotiable timeframe. The change meant rapid transformation of the Agency’s internal operating environment. It required a new organisational infrastructure to be built as a matter of urgency in order to match stakeholder expectations. Structural analysis and development, industrial relations and legislation were included in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> In ensuring a smooth transition, consideration and sensitivity to the operational arm of the organisation, comprising approximately 70, 000 volunteers, was of utmost importance.

A project office was established to support, underpin and co-ordinate the entire process mostly utilising existing staff.

Manufacturing process changes are frequently needed for a variety of reasons including response to regulatory requirements, up scaling production, change in facility, change in raw materials, improving control of quality (consistency) or optimising production efficiency. The <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> is usually a key indicator of the scale of analysis required to evaluate the quality.

40|$|International audienceThis book {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} global legal history in Modern times, questioning the effect of political revolutions since the 17 th century on the legal field. Readers will discover a non-linear approach to legal history as this work investigates {{the ways in which}} law is created. These chapters look at factors in legal revolution such as the role of agents, the policy of applying and publicising legal norms, codification and the orientations of legal writing, and there is a focus on the publicization of law. The author uses Herbert Hart’s schemes to conceive law as a human artefact or convention, being the union between primary rules of obligations and secondary rules conferring powers. Here we learn about those secondary rules and the legal construction of the Modern state and we question the extent to which codification and law reporting were likely to revolutionize the legal field. These chapters examine the hypothesis of a legal revolution that could have concerned many countries in modern times. To begin with, the book considers the legal aspect of the construction of Modern States in the 17 th and 18 th centuries. It goes on to examine the consequences of the codification movement as a legal revolution before looking at the so-called “constitutional” revolution, linked with the extension of judicial review in many countries after World War II. Finally, the book enquires into the construction of an EU legal order and international law. In each of these chapters, the author measures the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> how the secondary rules are concerned, the role of the professional lawyers and what are the characters of the new configuration of the legal field. This book provokes new debates in legal philosophy about the rule of change and will be of particular interest to researchers in the fields of law, theories of law, legal history, philosophy of law and historians more broadly...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} economizing on supply network development. The problematization {{in this thesis}} builds on two {{starting}} points. First, the ever-increasing importance of purchasing as a function {{and the role of}} suppliers as resource providers means that the supply side of firms has become a spring of opportunities for various types of benefits. In business networks, the firms, individuals, what they do, and what they use are all related. Nothing happens in isolation and nothing in the business world stops changing. The interconnectedness and dynamism in business networks reveals the importance of network developments for the firms involved. Consequently, it is important for firms to understand developments in their supply networks. The second starting point for this study is the concept of economic sense-making, which is used to define ‘economizing’ as a concept with which to study the phenomenon of supply network development. The aim of the study is to develop a framework for analyzing how a firm economizes on supply network developments, and to develop an understanding of supply network development from a firm’s perspective. This study centers on a single qualitative case of the development of a Swedish firm’s supply network over a period of almost 13 years. The firm is an automated production flow solutions provider that has a wide network of suppliers spread around the world. Systematic combining has been the underlying methodological approach throughout the study, adjusting and matching the researcher’s selection of the theoretical and empirical worlds, resulting in the formulation of the conceptualization of the phenomenon. The frame of reference is based on the industrial networks approach. Supply networks are analyzed in terms of actors, resources, and activities, all of which are interrelated. Developing a supply network involves developing those elements and their interconnectedness. The analysis uses those concepts to analyze the focal firm’s developments in its supply network. The main result of the analysis is a framework that breaks down developments in a firm’s supply network into changes that can be analyzed in terms of the following three dimensions: the focus of the change (that is, the change of relatedness among particular network elements); the direction of the change (that is, the improvements in the network elements, pursued by the change); and the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> (that is, whether the change is of a relational character or concerns connected relationships). Based on these three dimensions, the framework suggests a way to explain how a firm economizes on supply network development in terms of economizing on scale and scope, integration, and innovation. The framework recognizes the dynamic features of economic sensemaking by discussing relativity in networks and the effects that a change {{in one part of the}} network can have on the others. That discussion is complemented by a set of managerial implications with regard to strategizing in supply network development, and positioning of the study in relation to the streams of research on sense-making and opportunity development to raise research implications. The study ends by presenting three methodological reflections regarding the researcher’s use of the systematic combining approach in case research. </p...|$|E

The findings, based on the individual case studies and a cross-case analysis, reveal that teachers experience a range of 'competing imperatives' which make a coherent perspective and consistent practice difficult, even where teachers agree in spirit with the reforms.
