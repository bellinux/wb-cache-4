5|$|Bjarne Sortland was {{appointed}} managing director. The first helicopter was delivered in May, {{with a new}} helicopter being delivered each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Havørn and Havsvale. Owner Bjørn G. Braathen stated that his goal was that the airline would reach a 50% market share. In 1990, another challenger, Mørefly, had also established themselves in the market. For the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E

5|$|All SAS Commuter {{services}} in Northern Norway were {{taken over by}} Widerøe in October 2002. Norwegian Air Shuttle took over the routes to Alta and Tromsø from 1 April 2003, but already by the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> announced they would retire their fleet of Fokker 50 aircraft, resign from short-haul routes and become a low-cost airline. Widerøe won the subsequent tender and started operating to Lakselv from 1 January 2004. SAS Braathens introduced low-frequency summer services from Oslo from 2006, which was kept for three seasons. SAS cited too low ridership from foreign tourists {{as the reason for}} the closure. Widerøe took over SAS Ground Services' operations at Banak in 2008. Norwegian introduced a new summer seasonal route from Oslo to Lakselv from 2011. Outgoing charter services started in 2012 to Burgas and Antalya. Scandinavian Airlines operated one charter flight from Tokyo and back in 2011.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for this {{activity}} was the operations that were {{taking place in the}} FATA that had displaced some 300,000 people while dozens of citizens had been killed in clashes between the militants and military.

25|$|These were {{basically}} wooden boxes on four wheels, some with drop sides, and {{were used to}} carry everything from cut flowers in baskets to coal. Tracing of individuals is impossible, but apart from four new ones at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> they were all second-hand. Numbers started at 15, reached a maximum of 35 in the 1930s, then 29 during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Most lines {{operate with}} trains running at {{intervals}} of every 5 minutes during peak hours, {{but due to}} lines overlapping, a suitable train for a journey can be as frequent as every 2 minutes. Outside of peak times lines operate trains at frequencies of every 10 minutes; however, around the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and after midnight the line frequency decreases to every 20 minutes or more on most lines. Again with line overlap this means that a suitable train will arrive (often much) more frequently.|$|E

25|$|The metre {{gauge station}} at Visp was {{originally}} located, as at Brig, in the forecourt of the SBB station building. South {{of the two}} metre gauge platform tracks {{there used to be}} a connection to the extensive depot and workshop facilities of the BVZ. For passenger traffic, the VZ had already erected a wooden shelter by the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> in 1890, and, even at that point, all of the other necessary facilities, such as toilets or a waiting hall, were provided within the standard gauge station building of the Jura-Simplon (until 1889, the Suisse Occidentale-Simplon).|$|E
25|$|Budd was a {{corporal}} in the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment when he {{was killed}} while on active service during Operation Herrick in Afghanistan. Budd died of injuries sustained during a fire fight with Taliban forces in Sangin, Helmand Province, from a bullet probably fired from a NATO weapon. The incident occurred whilst he was on a routine patrol close to the District Centre. He was the 20th UK serviceman to die in Afghanistan since the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> in November 2001. On 14 December 2006, it was announced by the Ministry of Defence that Budd would be posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, only the 13th award of the medal {{since the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} months of 1943, {{planning}} was conducted to carry out the strategy for India as originally determined at the Quebec Conference. In November, the overall plan for the dry season campaign of 1944 determined by South East Asia Command focused {{on the use of the}} Chindits in the reconquest of northern Burma. These plans were approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Cairo Conference and although other offensives in Burma were scaled back or cancelled, Stilwell's Northern Front offensive with the Chindits' participation survived the cuts. The uncertainty of the plans nevertheless meant that the plans and contingency plans for the use of the Chindits repeatedly changed up to the very <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

25|$|Under President Lula da Silva (2003–2011), {{the nuclear}} program was revived. INB’s Nuclear Fuel Factory (Fábrica de Combustível Nuclear – FCN), a commercial-scale uranium {{enrichment}} facility, became operational in 2004. However, disagreements between Brazil and the IAEA regarding the inspection procedures delayed the full <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> Brazil {{was reluctant to}} grant IAEA inspectors full visual access to its centrifuges, which were hidden by 2-meter (6.6-foot) high panels, as Brazilian authorities argued that a superior centrifuge technology had been developed {{in the country and}} it was necessary to protect these industrial secrets. After months of impasse, Brazil agreed to allow increased – but not full – visual access to the centrifuges and other industrial equipment by reducing the size of the panels covering the machinery. As a member of the Ministry of Science and Technology reportedly said at that time, Brazil was lifting the skirt and lowering the top a little, but retaining its secrets.|$|E
25|$|On 27 June 1995, LKAB, SJ and NSB {{reached an}} {{agreement}} where the three would establish a joint venture owned 51% by LKAB and 24.5% each by NSB and SJ. At the time there were 350 employees in the three companies involved in the transport, and the new company would recruit its employees among these, although it would need significantly fewer employees. The plans called for the new companies taking over operations from 1 January 1996. The organization was protested by local labor unions in Narvik. In December, Kjell Opseth created a committee under the ministry, led by State Secretary Torstein Rudihagen of the Labour Party, which {{would look at the}} reorganization, thus postponing the date of the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> In late January, the committee concluded that LKAB met the criteria to receive traffic rights. The report also showed that 55 jobs would be lost in Narvik and that the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had concerns regarding the safety of LKAB's operations.|$|E
