40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part deals with {{theoretical}} perspectives related to social rehabilitation for people with disorder kinetic apparatus. Social rehabilitation is an intervention seeking to prevent or mitigate the negative consequences of disability and helps people with disabilities to integrate to the intact population. Social rehabilitation as a social service providers provides social services under Act 108 / 2006 Sb. about Social Services, as amended. Social rehabilitation is provided through outreach, outpatient or residential services. The research seeks through qualitative research strategies to assess whether the former client Center for Disabled satisfied with the skills they have learned in the center for the disabled. To collect data using semi-structured interview "face to face. " Based on the stated objectives of the work were created by two kinds of topics. The first set of questions relates to the skills that are taught clients at the Center for People with Disabilities (social rehabilitation), particularly if former customers need skills that are learned in the Center. The second set of questions relates to the contrary, the excess of these skills, particularly if former clients of centers for disabled some of the skills that are taught at the Center for People with Disabilities reside. The respondent group was made up by 8 former clients of the Disabled Centre, established by the Archiepiscopate Charity of Prague. All obtained information is presented in case studies. Significant reduction the need in personal assistant services has been found. Although the clients declared they need services of his/her personal assistant, they are anticipated to make this activity, since they are able to manage the assistance. Their health condition does not allow performing these activities by themselves. Also, it was investigated whether the skills obtained by former clients of the Centre {{in the course of their}} social rehabilitation are sufficient or not. Out of eight respondents, seven indicated the skills they have obtained are sufficient for unassisted life in his/her apartment. Two woman respondents indicated they had to adapt furnishings in their apartments to their skills. One indicated her skills are not sufficient. The last section of the research was focused on examination of whether some skills of the respondents obtained in the Centre are in excess. Answering the question about excess skills obtained in the Centre, five respondents indicated they have not any skills in excess. Three respondents indicated they have obtained some skills in excess in the Centre. However, these activities, in many cases, can be important. One respondent indicated he does not need the skills related to shower, since he has not any <b>shower</b> <b>cubicle</b> for handicapped in his home. The second respondent indicated he cannot move from the wheelchair to the bed and back because of a new seat. The third respondent indicated she has to find new ways how to get to WC and shower since the interior of her apartment has been re-arranged. The results of the bachelor thesis will be provided to the Disabled Centre for potential enhancement of its services. It also can be source of information for the persons wishing to use this kind of service...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the sociological use of water suggests dimensions to water use beyond {{the need to keep}} hydrated or stay clean e. g. water use for fun, leisure and relaxation or the increasing popularity of power showers. At present, showers and showering account for between 25 - 30 % of daily per capita water use and the demand for separate <b>shower</b> <b>cubicles</b> has increased in the past decade and more. This suggests that the composition of UK bathrooms is on the move and that showering is a normal part of everyday activity.

This two stage study consists of laboratory experiments and in-home user studies. The objectives of which are to begin to define and empirically quantity the conditions and range of acceptability of water efficient shower-heads using physical and socio-psychological factors, and the effectiveness of the shower product to promote sustained water efficiency practices. This paper will present an overview of the variables utilised in this study and present preliminary user feedback on their current shower head, prior to undertaking the user studies.

2500|$|After {{privatisation}} in 1982, British Telecom {{introduced the}} KX100, a more utilitarian design, which began to replace {{most of the}} existing boxes. The KX100 {{was one of a}} series of designs, including the wheelchair-accessible open-sided KX200, and the triangular-footprint KX300. In January 1985, [...] Nick Kane, the Director of Marketing for BT Local Communications Services announced that the old red telephone boxes would be replaced because they [...] "...no longer meet the needs of our customers. Few people like to use them. They are expensive and difficult to clean and maintain and cannot be used by handicapped people". This time, BT did not relent, despite another vociferous campaign. Many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status. Several thousand others were left on low-revenue mostly rural sites but many thousands of recovered K2 and K6 boxes were sold off. Some kiosks have been converted to be used as <b>shower</b> <b>cubicles</b> in private homes. In Kingston upon Thames a number of old K6 boxes have been used to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes. It is estimated that 11,000 traditional red telephone boxes remain in public service. The KX+, better known as the KX100 PLUS, introduced in 1996 featured a domed roof reminiscent of the familiar K2 and K6. Subsequent designs have departed significantly from the old style red boxes. BT followed the KX series with the Multi.phone in 1999 and the ST6 in 2007.|$|R
