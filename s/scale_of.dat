40|$|Depending on the species, the {{individual}} <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> butterfly wings have a longitudinal gradient in structure and reflectance properties, {{as shown by}} scanning electron microscopy and microspectrophotometry. White <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> the male Small White, Pieris rapae crucivora, show a strong gradient in both the density in pigment granules and the reflectance. After pigment extraction by aqueous ammonia, <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> male P. r. crucivora closely resemble the unpigmented <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> female P. r. crucivora. Only a minor gradient exists in the white and orange <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> the male Orange Tip, Anthocharis cardamines. Pigment extraction <b>of</b> orange <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> A. cardamines causes bleaching. Partial bleaching transforms the scales so that they resemble certain <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> Phoebis philea that have a natural extreme gradient. Reflectance measurements on an artificial stack <b>of</b> two overlapping <b>scales</b> {{as well as on}} the scale stacks existing on intact and partially denuded wings of the Large White, Pieris brassicae, quantitatively demonstrate the reflectance enhancement by scale stacking.

The topics covered include turbulence on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> seconds and minutes, gravity waves on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> hours, weather systems on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> days, atmospheric blocking on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> weeks, the Madden–Julian Oscillation on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> months, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> years, and the North Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic, Pacific Decadal, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations on time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> decades.
