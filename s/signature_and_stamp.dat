A total of 1, 335 prescriptions were examined: 40 (3 %) were unsigned, 212 (15. 9 %) did not contain the prescribing physician's stamp, 170 (12. 7 %) were undated. There were prescriptions containing corrections (4. 6 %), and written in code (4. 4 %). Only 58. 8 % were legible and easy to understand; nevertheless all of them were dispensed. Some did not specify the name of the patient (7. 2 %). On how to use the medication prescribed, not a single prescription contained all the information required by law. Specifically, 7. 6 % lacked information on dosage, 54. 3 % on presentation, 33. 6 % on how to take the drug, and 51. 2 % on duration of treatment.

In {{many instances}} {{they provide a}} layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital seals <b>and</b> <b>signatures</b> are equivalent to handwritten <b>signatures</b> <b>and</b> <b>stamped</b> seals.

Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret; further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid. Digitally signed messages may be anything re-presentable as a bitstring: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{research is}} based on past years studies on innovation in biometric systems, {{which has led to}} verifying how, in all the biometry approach, exists a similar approach, defined in the research Biometry Paradigm, which {{is based on}} the identification and utilization of particular characteristics, having the properties to be univocal and measurable. Typical examples are fingerprint, iris, retina, hand geometry, face and so on. Starting from this consideration, we have tried to verify if a similar approach could be applied to valuable objects, such as banknotes, artworks, identification documents and, in general, to all the objects which have the necessity to be verified to fight against their counterfeiting. The research work was based on the identification of some characteristics, which can be measured in a non-destructive way, inside some notable case studies, such as banknotes, passports, drug packages, lithography, with the aim to create a method, starting from the past experiences in the biometric analysis, which allows to verify with a great accuracy objects’ authenticity. The methods developed in this research have been defined as Hylemetric Authentication, from Greek words ὕλη (hyle), for inanimate objects and μετρον (metros) for measurement. The study started from the analysis of the existing solutions adopted to put in secureness banknotes, documents, artworks’ certificates and drug packages. Starting from this analysis, in each case study, has been possible identify a set of different security systems and approach. In particular, it is possible define two categories of security approach:  Overt Authentication/Identification System, visible at human eye and verifiable in a simple manner by the final utilizer.  Covert Authentication/Identification System, not simply visible or visible under particular environmental conditions and/or using particular instrumentations. Typical examples of overt systems are holograms and intaglio printing on banknotes, shifting and changing inks, used on pharmacologic packages. Covert systems are typically ultraviolet inks, infrared patterns and so on, used always on banknotes. Sometimes, mixed systems are also proposed, such as 1 D and 2 D barcodes, which at first analysis can be considered as overt systems, but the necessity to use dedicated and sometimes also complex decoding systems, allows to catalogue it as mixed system. In fact, its presence is sometimes considered as proof of originality, but in reality the originality can be proven only analysing the content of the barcode, which sometimes results encrypted. Focusing on research case studying, banknotes presents both overt and covert solutions, whereas overt or mixed ones in general characterize drugs packages. Lithography and artworks in general have been authenticated using only paper certificate of authenticity, without any automatic or semi-automatic verification system. In any case, this approach can be categorized as overt, because the presence of a Certificate of Authenticity with <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>stamp</b> on it is generally considered sufficient to be sure on the artwork originality. Starting from this state-of-art, the research has tried to verify the possibility to apply the biometric approach to these case studies, with the aim to enforce the authentication and anti-counterfeiting process with an innovative solution. For making this, the first step is the identification, for each case study, of at least one univocal characteristic, present on the analyzed object at priori (e. g. Banknotes security fibres), or added on it (e. g. white light speckles added on drug packages), which has the requested requirements to be categorized as Hylemetric Characteristic. In particular a characteristic, to be considered as usable in the Hylemetric approach, has to have the following basic properties:  Uniqueness: every objects should be identifiable and distinguishable from all others;  Consistency: feature vector should be verifiable by multiple parties over the lifetime of the object;  Conciseness: feature vector should be short and easily computable;  Robustness: {{it should be possible to}} verify the feature vector even if the object has been subjected to harsh treatment;  Resistance to Forgery: it should be very difficult and costly, or impossible for an adversary, to forge a document by coercing a second object to express the same feature vector as the original one. For any of the case study analyzed during the research course, it has been possible to identify proper characteristics which have all these properties. The acquisition of them changes from object to object, has in biometry paradigm, depending on the object physical characteristics, but the verification approach is similar for all the analyzed ones. In banknote case, we have used metallic security fibres as Hylemetric characteristic. They have the physical property to shine in the visible spectrum when illuminated by ultraviolet light at a precise wavelength. We have acquired the fibres distribution, creating a unique identification pattern based on them. This pattern has been encrypted and then coded in a bidimensional barcode, based on DataMatrix ECC 200 Standard. The proposed encryption has been made by means of Elliptic Curve, to reduce dimensions of pattern encrypted version and cope with DataMatrix maximum storage constraint. For artworks in general, we have made some experiments on lithography and then on oil and statue. The proposed approach has to modify the Certificate of Authenticity, introducing both new information on the paper version and a new digital version of it. All the modifications are based on the extraction of an Hylemetric characteristic from the artwork. In Lithography case, the typical stone impression leave a unique grain pattern, acquirable using a digital camera. For oil paints and statue using particular image manipulations and filters is possible from the acquired image obtaining a speckle-like pattern from the object structure. Analyzing the pharmacologic products packaging, we have decided to add on them the Hylemetric characteristic, using the so called White Light Speckle technique. We have used ultraviolet ink sprayed on a package’ particular area. In this way each package has been stamped with a different Speckle Pattern. In any studied cases, independently from the acquired characteristic, has been possible defining a Hylemetric Template, which allows to authenticate the related object. In some cases the defined template has been converted into a 2 D Barcode to be directly put on the object (e. g. banknotes, drug packages), or has been codified to be inserted in a Digital Certificate of Authenticity (e. g. artworks). In the case of barcodes, we have used both standard DataMatrix, or a new 2 D Barcode based on Computer Generated Holograms, defined HoloBarcode. In some case the barcode has been proposed to be put on the object using infrared ink, to maintain the original object aspect and to increase the system security as well. The usage of infrared ink starting from the necessity to put it on banknotes, plenty of visible and invisible security artefacts. The infrared band is empty on over the 80 % of the banknote surface in both sides and it is possible to find the proper area where to put the barcode. Otherwise, the introduction of a non-standard bidirectional barcode, based on CGH, has been proposed in such cases where the object to be analysed can be heavily manipulated and ruined. HoloBarcode has the great advantage to be highly resistant to loss of information (i. e. loss of part of the barcode area) and to offer the possibility to extract information also starting from only a little part of the barcode. However, the storage capacity of these barcodes is very poor, if compared with standard 2 D Barcodes with same dimensions. In conclusion, during this research we have analysed the state-of-art of security features applied to valuable objects. Then, starting from a biometric approach, has been proposed an Hylemetric paradigm, which allows to authenticate objects starting from their intrinsic characteristics. We have made tests on different type of objects, such as banknotes, passports, lithography, oil paints, drug packages, obtaining in any case the correct definition of a Hylemetric Procedure, similar in any case, and a Hylemetric Template to be used in verification phase. After that we have also proposed a new bi-dimensional barcode, based on Synthetic Holograms, to be used in particular cases instead of Standard ones to store the Hylemetric Template for offline verification activities...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that information systems constitute a key {{tool for the}} overall performance improvement of administrative tasks in academic institutions. However at their genesis lies a latent promise of a paper-less environment that stays {{most of the time}} unfulfilled {{due to the lack of}} appropriate digital document integrity and accountability mechanisms. Academic institutions are thus most of the time still relying on traditional security trust methods based on paper documents for signing and archiving critical documents. While this method delivers an inefficient, inconvenient and costly workflow, it is still a common method to provide some sort of workable verifiable integrity and accountability that is still considered to be appropriate for the digital data that is being managed by the institutional information systems. Paper based documents have been relying on physical <b>signatures</b> <b>and</b> <b>stamping</b> policies <b>and</b> the physical properties of paper and ink for their integrity and authenticity for a long time. However, the evaluation of a paper document signature or stamp is not a straight forward process. It requires the recipient to have a notarized copy of the signer's signature or <b>stamp</b> for comparison <b>and</b> requires handwritten <b>signature</b> evaluation training that is often beyond the scope of many office employee training. This can lead to situations where the level of credibility and integrity of paper based document is not adequate and makes the verification process entirely dependent on the administrative staff capacity of recognizing hand written <b>signatures</b> <b>and</b> puts too much trust on physical stamps, some of which are non-locally issued and thus very difficult to authenticate. In critical contexts this clearly is not enough to provide appropriate levels of non-repudiation and integrity for critical documents issued by institutions. Digitally signed structured XML documents provide an interesting solution to this problem. Not only can the validation of the document be fully automatized and its integrity verifiable in real time by the information system, but it can also be implemented in such way that the information contained in such structured documents can be safely and more easily integrated into different information systems without human intervention, thus allowing for substantial cost reduction and leading to faster process work-flows with increased security and data quality. In this paper we propose a PDF based document framework where any signed XML (PDF) document, produced by the institution can be at a later stage directly dematerialized and integrated into any compliant information system in a secure way while maintaining the information integrity and the ability to be self-verifiable. This framework involves the embedding of an encapsulated XAdES signed XML document with the information used on its production as an attachment to a PDF document with an institutional rendering visualization of the signed XML data. The attached XML document and the PDF are both time stamped by an external entity and signed by employees and the issuing institution...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel, generic framework for information segmentation in document images. A document image contains {{different types of}} information, for instance, text (machine printed/handwritten), graphics, <b>signatures,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stamps.</b> It is necessary to segment information in documents so that to process such segmented information only when required in automatic document processing workflows. The main contribution of this thesis is the conceptualization and implementation of an information segmentation framework {{that is based on}} part-based features. The generic nature of the presented framework makes it applicable to a variety of documents (technical drawings, magazines, administrative, scientific, and academic documents) digitized using different methods (scanners, RGB cameras, and hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) devices). A highlight of the presented framework {{is that it does not}} require large training sets, rather a few training samples (for instance, four pages) lead to high performance, i. e., better than previously existing methods. In addition, the presented framework is simple and can be adapted quickly to new problem domains. This thesis is divided into three major parts on the basis of document digitization method (scanned, hyper-spectral imaging, and camera captured) used. In the area of scanned document images, three specific contributions have been realized. The first of them is in the domain of signature segmentation in administrative documents. In some workflows, it is very important to check the document authenticity before processing the actual content. This can be done based on the available seal of authenticity, e. g., signatures. However, signature verification systems expect pre-segmented signature image, while signatures are usually a part of document. To use signature verification systems on document images, it is necessary to first segment signatures in documents. This thesis shows that the presented framework can be used to segment signatures in administrative documents. The system based on the presented framework is tested on a publicly available dataset where it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and successfully segmented all signatures, while less than half of the found signatures are false positives. This shows that it can be applied for practical use. The second contribution in the area of scanned document images is segmentation of stamps in administrative documents. A stamp also serves as a seal for documents authenticity. However, the location of stamp on the document can be more arbitrary than a signature depending on the person sealing the document. This thesis shows that a system based on our generic framework is able to extract stamps of any arbitrary shape and color. The evaluation of the presented system on a publicly available dataset shows that it is also able to segment black stamps (that were not addressed in the past) with a recall and precision of 83...|$|R
