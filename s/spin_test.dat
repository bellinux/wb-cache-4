2500|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, pilots began {{to report that}} “during flights of the P-39 in certain maneuvers, it tumbled end over end.” Most of these events happened after the aircraft was stalled in a nose high attitude with considerable power applied. Concerned, Bell initiated a test program. Bell pilots made 86 separate efforts to reproduce the reported tumbling characteristics. In no case were they able to tumble the aircraft. In his autobiography veteran test and airshow pilot R.A. “Bob” Hoover provides an account of tumbling a P-39. He {{goes on to say}} that in hindsight, he was actually performing a Lomcovak, a now-common airshow maneuver, which he was also able to do in a Curtiss P-40. [...] An informal study of the P-39’s spinning characteristics was conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center 20-foot Free-Spinning Tunnel during the 1970s. A study of old reports showed that during earlier spin testing in the facility, the aircraft had never tumbled. However, it was noted that all testing had been done with a simulated full ammunition load, which drew the aircraft’s center of gravity forward. After finding the original <b>spin</b> <b>test</b> model of the P-39 in storage, the new study first replicated the earlier testing, with consistent results. Then, the model was re-ballasted to simulate a condition of no ammunition load, which moved the aircraft’s center of gravity aft. Under these conditions, the model was found to often tumble when thrown into the tunnel.|$|E

The {{equations of motion}} of a <b>spinning</b> <b>test</b> particle in the Kerr-de Sitter (KD) and the Vaidya-Mallett (VM) spacetimes are obtained using the methods of Papapetrou. The equations of motion in the VM spacetime were obtained using both the retarded time coordinates and the standard coordinates. Analyzing the spin equations in the retarded time coordinates, {{it was found that}} the constants of motion defined by Carmeli can equally be applied for a <b>spinning</b> <b>test</b> particle in the VM spacetime.

5000|$|Max Harlow was an {{aeronautical}} engineer and {{instructor at the}} Pasadena Junior College. Under his tutelage, the aircraft designated PJC-1 was designed and built as a class project. The PJC-1 first flew on 14 September 1937 at Alhambra, California but it crashed during an extended (more than six turn) <b>spin</b> <b>test</b> with {{the center of gravity}} ballasted to the aft limit, as it was going through the certification process—a problem generally laid at the feet the unusually rigorous <b>spin</b> <b>test</b> requirement and the government test pilot, who bailed out of the airplane after the spin [...] "flattened out." [...] The airplane struck the ground, still in the [...] "flat" [...] (longitudinally level) attitude in a bean field near Mines Field (now Los Angeles International Airport) with considerable damage; although repairable, the PJC-1 was never returned to service. PJC students then built a slightly modified airplane, which limited aileron travel with full aft-stick and incorporated a slightly larger vertical stabilizer. This became the PJC-2 model, serial number 1 certified by the FAA on 20 May 1938. It was one of the first, if not the first, airplane designed and built in the U.S. with a stressed-skin semi-monocoque structure—a revolutionary design feature for the time. Harlow saw the potential and formed the Harlow Aircraft Company to build PJC-2 aircraft at Alhambra Airport. Four aircraft were impressed into United States Army Air Forces service with the designation UC-80 in 1942, and used by Civil Aeronautics Administration inspectors after WW II.|$|E

The satellite, although damaged, was able to be repaired using a combination of prototype parts, spare flight parts and new components. It was launched ten months later on 3 February 1965 and was designated OSO 2 on orbit.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{aircraft}} manufacturer provides a specific procedure for spin recovery, that procedure must be used. Otherwise, {{to recover from}} an upright spin, the following generic procedure may be used: Power is first reduced to idle and the ailerons are neutralized. Then, full opposite rudder (that is, against the yaw) is added and held to counteract the spin rotation, and the elevator control is moved briskly forward to reduce the angle of attack below the critical angle. Depending on the airplane {{and the type of}} spin, the elevator action could be a minimal input before rotation ceases, or in other cases the elevator control may have to be moved to its full forward position to effect recovery from the upright spin. Once the rotation has stopped, the rudder must be neutralized and the airplane returned to level flight. This procedure is sometimes called PARE, for Power idle, Ailerons neutral, Rudder opposite the spin and held, and Elevator through neutral. The mnemonic [...] "PARE" [...] simply reinforces the tried-and-true NASA standard spin recovery actions—the very same actions first prescribed by NACA in 1936, verified by NASA during an intensive, decade-long <b>spin</b> <b>test</b> program overlapping the 1970s and '80s, and repeatedly recommended by the FAA and implemented by the majority of test pilots during certification spin-testing of light airplanes.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results obtained by application of flight path reconstruction (FPR) techniques to flight data collected during <b>spin</b> <b>tests.</b> The FPR methodology allows in-flight calibration of several sensors, because it {{takes advantage of the}} kinematical redundancy between parameters that usually exists in most flight test instrumentation (FTI) projects. For the particular case of <b>spin</b> <b>tests,</b> the aircraft experiences high angles of attack and sideslip, which may extrapolate the calibration limits of the vanes. Besides that, the Pitot tubes measurements become unreliable when subjected to extreme incidence angles, which corrupt airspeed measurements during the spin. However, measurements obtained before the spin entry and after spin recovery are still valid. Therefore, using the FPR, airspeed measurements are integrated along the maneuver, in order to match the data before and after spin, so that the airspeed during the spin is obtained. This methodology also provides calibration for airflow angle vanes and the values of biases that affected the accelerometers and gyros. In this work, FPR was applied to <b>spin</b> <b>tests</b> performed with three different aircraft, featuring different FTI projects. Despite the different limitations on each FTI project, the FPR was able to provide good results in all cases analyzed.
