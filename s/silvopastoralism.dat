40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} documents emphasizes {{the value of the}} hybridisation of different types of knowledge for environmental management. This is particularly true for silvopastoralism: although <b>silvopastoralism</b> appears to be a relevant way to manage large forests areas in the northern Mediterranean region, knowledge pertaining to <b>silvopastoralism</b> is distributed between foresters and pastoralists, with a lack of shared knowledge making joint action difficult. The consensus about the need of knowledge hybridisation, however, is not enough to make it happen and a whole field of research investigates the methods which can be used to create shared knowledge. This paper studies one of these methods e the participation of experts in modelling e used in a French research development program to design a technical support tool for <b>silvopastoralism.</b> After having described the modelling process conducted by forestry and pastoralists experts, it presents the conceptual <b>silvopastoralism</b> model they produced and analyses the shared knowledge e especially intermediary concepts and expert typologies e it contains. The paper finally outlines the conditions needed for the participation of experts in modelling to create shared knowledge, its limitations in generating quantitative expertise and discusses how the knowledge created can be shared with a wider audience...|$|E
40|$|Extensive land {{clearing}} for livestock production and associated land degradation {{has led to}} greater interest {{in the role of}} trees and revegetation practices such as agroforestry for achieving productivityand environmental outcomes in pastoral landscapes. RIRDC recently funded a national scale analysis (Polglase et al. 2008) of the potential to grow and profitably market wood products. Whilst there is now a growing understanding of the bio-economic interactions driving plantation hardwoods, there is little known about the economic outcomes of establishing complementary agroforestry and <b>silvopastoralism</b> in northern Australia’s lower rainfall zones (600 - 750 mm annual rainfall) including central Queensland. <b>Silvopastoralism</b> may offer landholders considerable advantages over traditional grazing systems in terms of income diversification, environmental benefits through increased woody vegetation cover andareas of stimulated versus constrained pasture growth. RIRDC commissioned this investigation to better understand whether an agro-forestry production system produces better financial and environmental outcomes than an extensive grazing system...|$|E

40|$|A silvopastoral {{experiment}} was established at Teagasc in County Wexford, Ireland, in 2002 with oak (Quercus robur L.) {{in an alley}} design and bovines. The experiment includes some treatments with trees produced with an enhanced root system (RPM). The treatments are: (1) control pasture plots; (2) RPM agroforestry (400 stems/ha); (3) conventional agroforestry (400 stems/ha); (4) RPM forestry (6600 stems/ha; and (5) conventional forestry (6600 stems/ha). The trees were successfully established and cattle were successfully managed {{in combination with the}} trees. In the first year, height growth of bare-root oaks was significantly greater in the forestry treatment compared to the agroforestry treatment and, overall, RPM oaks were taller than bare-root plants. Among the RPM trees, the agroforestry system resulted in a greater stem diameter than those in the forestry plots. Height increment was greater for RPM trees than for bare-root trees.

40|$|This {{study in}} {{northern}} Ethiopia investigated local people's {{perception of climate}} change {{and the role of}} indigenous <b>silvopastoralism</b> in adaptation to that change. Two hundred and forty respondents participated in a questionnaire survey and group discussions. Local communities perceive climate change in terms of biophysical and socio-economic indicators. In selecting, evaluating and comparing fodder trees for a climate-resilient silvopastoral system, local farmers used 20 criteria of varying importance and belonging to three categories: animal-based, plant-based and multipurpose. In terms of suitability for climate-resilient silvopastoral system, Ficus thonningii was ranked first among the top 10 species of trees with a composite score of 8. 7 out of 10, followed by Cordia africana, Eucalyptus cameldulensis and Rhus natalensis. Locally developed protocols for propagation and use of F. thonningii have enabled establishment of a climate-resilient, sustainable silvopastoral system. As this practice combines climate change mitigation and adaptation, silvopastoral practices using locally adaptable species are recommended...|$|E
40|$|N° ISBN - 978 - 2 - 7380 - 1284 - 5 International audienceIn {{northern}} Mediterranean regions, {{livestock farming}} and silviculture evolutions have them sometimes gathered sometimes separated. The marginalization of little productive and costly to exploit Mediterranean forests {{and the economic}} and climatic difficulties faced by livestock sector in these regions calls for a fresh examination of <b>silvopastoralism.</b> In woodlands, fodder production is staggered over the year and its herbaceous component is preserved longer thanks to the shadow of trees. So it makes for example a summer pastoral resource. The selective cutting of trees generates wood products which may be sold, besides conventional outlets such as triturating and firewood, through new marketing channels such as wood energy or construction. Grazing keeps underbrush under control and facilitates later silviculture operations. Reciprocally, silviculture operations increase the quantity of light reaching undergrowth and thereby favours the development of forage resources : grass growth, lower hanging foliage, increase in percent fruit set. They also facilitate animal circulation. The construction of this productive consistency asks several questions, at different scales, which the paper tries to answer offering : (i) a silvopastoral interpretation of wooded environments; (ii) a characterization of trees partial taking; (iii) a characterization of wooded areas pastoral uses; (iv) a different levels of silvopastoral project consistency analysis...|$|E
40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} which {{describes}} systems in which trees, animals and/or crops are grown together in intimate mixtures. The term does not include farm woodlands which do not involve significant biological or environmental interactions between the woodland and agricultural components. A number of papers in this volume have discussed the possibility of increasing timber production in Cumbria, in response to Britain's present high rate of timber imports and excess agricultural production. Agroforestry could contribute to this increased timber production in a manner which would be attractive to the farming community because land would sustain a significant agricultural income whilst the trees were maturing. There are several types of agroforestry. Silvoarable systems are mixtures of trees and crops, while <b>silvopastoralism</b> describes intimate mixtures of trees and animals. Agrenforestry is a term used here to emphasize the co-production of bioenergy crops with agricultural and timber crops. Agrenforestry, described later in more detail, could involve strips of energy coppice amongst agricultural crops, {{or the use of}} coppice beneath wide-spaced standard trees. It has been suggested (Lawson 1987) that there are five possible uses for rural land — food, fibre, fuel, pharmaceuticals and fun. This paper moves up the alphabet to discuss five criteria for land use decisions: economics, energy, environment, employment and enjoyment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Pasture-woodland landscapes {{result from}} {{a long history of}} <b>silvopastoralism</b> in {{mountain}} regions and provide valuable ecosystem services. They include a mosaic of grasslands, forests and wood-pastures, which is the heritage of a multipurpose management in the variable socio-economic and biophysical context of the last millennium. In the perspective of ongoing climate and land-use changes, it is crucial to assess the resilience and the adaptive capacity of such socio-ecological systems at different spatial and temporal scales. For this purpose, we developed a hierarchical, process-based, dynamic model, WoodPaM, and we simulated six scenarios of climate change and management in a real landscape of the Swiss Jura Mountains. Realistic climatic scenarios for the next century are likely to provoke critical changes in vegetation structure and composition, leading to a breakdown of resilience. This is due to the predicted fast decline of present dominant tree species, which will be slowly replaced by more adapted species. Assisted migration could reduce the risk of temporary forest breakdown, as suggested by simulations with enhanced immigration rate during the warming period. Logging could lead to landscape simplification or introduce shifting mosaic cycles depending on warming intensity. Active adaptive management involving modellers and stakeholders is a promising strategy to face such future changes...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand, nitrate (NO 3 -) {{leaching}} is a {{major environmental}} problem associated with intensive agriculture. Research suggests that plants with deeper roots and high evapotranspiration rates, such as poplars (Populus) and willows (Salix), may reduce NO 3 - leaching. In New Zealand, willows and poplars have largely been studied {{in relation to their}} soil conservation benefits, use as stock fodder, biomass production and phytoremediation of contaminated soil. This review compiles information on the use of poplars and willows in agricultural systems and explores their potential application to the management of NO 3 - leaching. Studies show reduced NO 3 - leaching under short rotation coppice willows. However, the establishment and harvesting phases are risk periods for NO 3 -leaching where nitrogen application should be avoided. A case study has identified a potential for role of poplar and willow silvopastoral systems on intensively-managed irrigated farms of the Canterbury Plains. Height restrictions due to overhead irrigation, stock fodder value and the need to restrict light competition with pastures suggest Salix viminalis (with annual coppicing) is the most suitable species for integration into these farms. Further research is needed to quantify both the possible reduction in N losses and the additional on and off-farm benefits of poplar and willow <b>silvopastoralism</b> in the context of intensive farming in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the oldest}} {{agroforestry}} systems, <b>silvopastoralism</b> uses shrubs and trees to feed ruminants. The practice {{is common in}} extensive livestock production systems, while the intensification of grass-based systems {{in the past century}} has led to the removal of woody species from agricultural temperate landscapes. In Europe however, woody species are promoted again on grasslands through environment-friendly policies due to the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration, control of soil erosion, limitation of air-borne pollutants and biodiversity conservation. Positive effects of browse on rumen digestion and parasite control have also been documented across different plant species and regions. Under optimal conditions, feeding ruminants from woody fodder sustains animal production. Nonetheless, limitations can restrict the use of woody forage into animal diets, such as the presence of anti-nutritive and toxic compounds. The incorporation of this resource in ruminant feeding systems raises the question of the management of the interface between the plant and the animal. Various management systems are practiced. Temperate species such as Salix spp. and Populus spp. are fed to sheep and cattle in fodder blocks or by pruning trees in New Zealand, and Fraxinus spp. or Corylus avellana in hedgerows supply forage to livestock in Belgium, while Leucaena leucocepahala and Desmanthus spp. browsing is common in Australia. Nowadays, ensiling and pelleting techniques are being developed as a way to store browse forage. As the renewed interest in using shrubs and trees to feed ruminants is recent, especially in temperate regions, additional research about introducing optimally this resource within systems is needed.

40|$|Conversion of Nicaragua’s {{tropical}} dry forest to cattle pasture has left a highly heterogeneous landscape where pasture is maintained against forest succession. Climate change threatens to exacerbate these divisions between conservation and agriculture by drying up limited water sources for cattle and endemic species alike. Our client, Paso Pacífico, was interested in researching the potential of silvopastoral practices in the Rivas Isthmus of Nicaragua. <b>Silvopastoralism</b> combines the interests of cattle ranchers and conservationists by improving cattle production through multifunctional afforestation measures and alternative pasture management practices. This work builds on the previous Master’s work on living fence rows (Dorgay, Muelle & Klooster 2016) in Nicaraguan cattle ranches {{by focusing on the}} impact of isolated trees in pastures on non-migratory birds, pasture and cattle health. This is the first study to combine these elements of the pastoral agroecosystem with a survey of farmer perceptions into an interdisciplinary study. We began our study with a literature review of studies concerning isolated tree impacts and silvopastoral practices. We then visited 17 cattle ranches in order to complete observational studies of native birds, measurements of pasture quality and cattle health, and semi-structured interviews with farm managers or landowners. As a result, we found that non-migratory bird visits are positively correlated with isolated trees with wide and sparse canopies and available fruit. The isolated trees were also found to have suppressed pasture grass growth yet maintain overall nutrient content underneath their canopies. However at the farm-scale, we found no correlation between the overall tree cover on ranches and cattle health suggesting supplemental feed by the trees and farmers. Overall, farmers viewed isolated trees as beneficial to cattle production and the environment. The culmination of our work is a set of recommendations to develop a culture of silvopastoral practices. The case for planting additional trees on private pasture land is supported by the evidence of lack of natural tree replacement and widely recognized benefits for cattle. By approaching incremental afforestation of cattle ranches at the landscape level, Paso Pacífico can maintain tree species diversity while incorporating farmer preference in tree plantings. Within any resulting afforestation program, a particular focus on preserving trees with wide canopies, fruiting trees, and dying or dead trees in place will preserve an unique set of resources for native birds. Finally, we recommend that future research and program design build on these studies of living fence rows and isolated trees to investigate the specific influence of socioeconomic factors and the conservation impacts of silvopastoral practices for a diversity of taxa...|$|E
