5|$|Beryl dropped {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of Louisiana, peaking at over 10inches (250mm) near Morgan City. The rainfall caused significant river flooding along the Biloxi River. Wind gusts were fairly light across the state, reaching 40mph (65km/h) in New Orleans. The winds caused light tree damage, which resulted in <b>some</b> <b>power</b> outages. A storm surge of about 5feet (1.5m) caused some coastal flooding.|$|E

5|$|The British had ceded <b>some</b> <b>power</b> in Egypt {{with the}} Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The 1936 treaty was {{designed}} to counter Benito Mussolini's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via Sudan in a new Italian empire. The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada, officially peaking at 2.8inches (71mm) in Scots Bay, Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 3.5inches (88mm); in some locations 1inch of rain fell in an hour. Additionally, a station in Fredericton, New Brunswick reported 1.77inches (45mm) in twohours. The rainfall caused some flooding, with some overflown streams flooding some streets. Moderate winds were reported along its path, which peaked at 60mph (96km/h) in southern Nova Scotia. The winds downed some tree limbs {{and led to}} <b>some</b> <b>power</b> outages.

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Debby slowly weakened, and {{was between}} Category2 and 1 when it passed south of Newfoundland early on September19. Thereafter, the storm accelerated and was moving at roughly 60mph (95km/h) towards the east. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September20, shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact was minor in the Lesser Antilles, with only light to moderate rainfall in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. On Bermuda, high winds caused <b>some</b> <b>power</b> outages and knocked over trees, though {{damage on the}} island was minimal. In addition, Debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with <b>some</b> <b>power.</b> In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
5|$|Days {{before the}} {{hurricane}} {{passed to the}} south of the state, high surf from Fico caused some beach flooding in the eastern portion of the island of Hawaii. High surf later resulted in considerable damage to roads and beachfront houses along the Big Island shores. The waves destroyed a home in Puna and wrecked a beach pavilion in Kau. The mayors of three Hawaiian cities issued a disaster declaration for their cities following the damage from Fico. In Maui, moderate waves led to road flooding near the water, though no damage occurred on the island. 60mph (95km/h) winds throughout Hawaii downed trees, resulting in <b>some</b> <b>power</b> outages. Damage from the hurricane totaled $200,000 (1978USD, $619,000 2006USD).|$|E

5|$|Power outages were {{reported}} throughout Central and North Florida, with over 93,300customers losing electricity, including about 9,500power outages between Tampa and Temple Terrace. In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked down <b>some</b> <b>power</b> lines, or left generally minor damage to homes and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A waterspout was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched down near Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some homes. At a Publix distribution center, three empty trucks were overturned. A possible tornado in Alachua County {{in the vicinity of}} Hawthorne toppled some trees and damaged a home.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov, a {{conflicted}} former student, {{lives in}} a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg. He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by <b>some</b> <b>power</b> outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.|$|E
5|$|The MFR {{issued a}} gale warning for Zimbabwe in {{anticipation}} of strong winds well inland. However, the Zimbabwe government did not issue any storm warnings until the storm moved over the country. Due to Eline maintaining a well-defined structure, it brought strong winds and heavy rainfall when it crossed into eastern Zimbabwe. The heavy rains caused rivers to overflow their banks. Officials opened flood gates along several dams to maintain their integrity, which increased flooding downstream, including in Mozambique. However, eight dams were destroyed that were used for irrigation purposes. The storm destroyed over 3,800homes in the eastern portion of the country while killing 17,000heads of livestock. Flooding also washed away roads, bridges, and <b>some</b> <b>power</b> lines. Mutare, the country's third largest city, lost power during Eline's passage. Overall the storm killed 12people in the country.|$|E

5|$|The extratropical {{remnant of}} Alberto {{produced}} strong winds across the Canadian Maritimes, including gusts of 74mph (119km/h) in the Barrington district of Nova Scotia. Sustained winds reached 51mph (83km/h). Rainfall {{from the storm}} was moderate, with some locations reporting 0.4inches (10mm) per hour; totals exceeded 2inches (50mm) in numerous areas. Due to wet grounds, the winds knocked down some trees and several tree limbs, and also downed <b>some</b> <b>power</b> lines, causing localized power outages. Moderate winds and rainfall affected Newfoundland, as well. According to a press report, the storm left four sailors missing about 230miles (370km) south of Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because they felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing <b>some</b> <b>power</b> between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|After William's {{death in}} 1164, Hugh passed into royal service, while also serving as seneschal {{to the new}} Earl of Surrey, Hamelin, the illegitimate {{half-brother}} of King Henry II. On the Cartae Baronum in 1166 he held one knight's fee in the barony of Giffard. In 1167 Hugh paid a fine that is recorded in the pipe rolls for the custody of his nephew's lands at Tickhill. In 1170, he {{was present at the}} coronation of Henry the Young King in June at Westminster Abbey, when Henry II had his heir crowned as a king during the elder Henry's lifetime. During the Revolt of 1173–74 by King Henry's sons, Hugh was a partisan of the king. The revolt was brought about by the desire of Henry's three oldest sons to gain <b>some</b> <b>power</b> during Henry's reign, and by mid 1174 the revolt had been defeated by the king. During the Revolt, Hugh fought at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham St Martin in Suffolk, a victory for royalist forces, but otherwise took little part in the revolt's suppression.|$|E

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. <b>Some</b> <b>power</b> supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{moved slowly}} over Cuba {{for two days}} before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160homes and 190trailers were damaged. Salt spray damaged crops in the region, and there was $5million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11people. The hurricane threatened the northern Yucatán Peninsula, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused <b>some</b> <b>power</b> outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500houses. Damage was estimated at $104million, and there were 74deaths in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|While the Progress Party {{dropped out}} of {{parliament}} altogether in 1977, it returned in the following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives. In this election, the political right in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support. The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared {{that it was a}} libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization of medical care, education and government-owned enterprises, as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with <b>some</b> <b>power</b> as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.|$|E
