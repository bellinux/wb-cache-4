Michael Wilmington of Chicago Tribune awarded the film four stars, writing, [...] "It's another hard-edged, funny, playfully perverse and violent exercise in movie fear and loathing, with an increasingly dark take on a world <b>spinning</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> By now, Romero has become a classicist who uses character and dialogue as much as stomach-turning special effects to achieve his shivers."
