5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back in England, Brock's brother William faced {{financial}} difficulties, as {{the bank}} {{in which he was}} a senior partner failed.

Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of his <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> his brother Irving, to be used for whatever was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E

Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill.

5|$|As an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} summer of 2005, Niedermayer was in considerable demand; 14 teams contacted his agent on the first day they were allowed to talk to him. The Devils offered him a five-year contract that would have paid him $7.8 million per season, the maximum allowed under the new salary cap, but Niedermayer chose instead to sign a four-year contract worth $6.75 million per season with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He chose to take the shorter term and lower <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> play and try to win a Stanley Cup with his brother. The Ducks immediately named Scott the team's captain. In his first season in Anaheim, 2005–06, Niedermayer scored 63 points and was named a First Team All-Star for the second time. In the playoffs, the Ducks reached the Western Conference Final, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E
5|$|Despite his success, Cagney {{remained}} {{dissatisfied with}} his contract. He wanted {{more money for}} his successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney {{announced that he would}} do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney's <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.|$|E

After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> fund his study of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture. Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team {{before returning to the}} youth team in 1982. He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from throat cancer, which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by irradiated food served to him in the camps. Seven years later, Marina Lebedeva, the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping, was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death.|$|E

In 2014, several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option, with raises which reportedly made them among the highest-paid performers on cable TV. In 2016, it was reported that several actor contracts were again renegotiated, with five of the main cast members having increased their <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> £2 million per episode for the last two seasons, which would make them the highest paid actors on television. The main cast is listed below.|$|E

He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies of Congress and the President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks.

When the regents of the University of California wanted to terminate Segré's employment owing to his foreign nationality, Lawrence managed to retain Segré by hiring him as a part-time lecturer paid by the Rockefeller Foundation. Similar arrangements were made to retain his doctoral students Chien-Shiung Wu (a Chinese national) and Kenneth Ross MacKenzie (a Canadian national) when they graduated.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine {{publicly}} questioned Youkilis' {{motivation and}} physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine {{began to play}} Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E
5|$|The post of a Whip {{normally}} required {{silence in}} the chamber of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand {{was involved in a}} difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Though {{offered a}} high <b>salary</b> <b>to</b> stay in Ottawa, Phillips {{decided to leave}} the team, and prior to the 1909 hockey season played with Edmonton of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA). The Edmonton hockey team had signed several high profile players from Eastern Canada to play for the team in the Cup challenge; only two players on the team were from Edmonton, the rest came from the east. Phillips and Lester Patrick, another player from the east, never even reached Edmonton; they met their team in Winnipeg on its way east for the Cup challenge. Phillips, who was paid $600 for the two-game series, played in the first game against the Montreal Wanderers, which Edmonton lost 7–3, but broke his ankle in the game and was forced to miss the second game, a 7–3 victory for his club.|$|E
