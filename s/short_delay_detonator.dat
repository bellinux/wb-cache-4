50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of electrical detonators: instantaneous electrical <b>detonators</b> (IED), <b>short</b> period <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> (SPD) and long period <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> (LPD). SPDs are measured in milliseconds and LPDs are measured in seconds. In situations where nanosecond accuracy is required, specifically in the implosion charges in nuclear weapons, exploding-bridgewire detonators are employed. The initial shock wave is created by vaporizing a length of a thin wire by an electric discharge. A new development is a slapper detonator, which uses thin plates accelerated by an electrically exploded wire or foil to deliver the initial shock. It is in use in some modern weapon systems. A variant of this concept is used in mining operations, when the foil is exploded by a laser pulse delivered to the foil by optical fiber.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{aiming at}} the {{questions}} that electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> have low <b>delay</b> precision and are easily affected by the blast wave in engineering blasting, the delay and control module circuit of electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> is designed based on PLD, according {{to the principle of}} electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonator.</b> The design proposal of crystal oscillator with high overload resistance and the chose of charging capacitor are put forward. The practice proved that this system has better stability and reliability. And it can reach to the design purposes of the impact resistance high Precision timing. Introduce In recent years, with the development of national economy and the acceleration of social pace, the increase of the large engineering, such as urban building demolition, construction of railway, mine safety mining, and rivers flood, makes the increase of the application of the blast and expand in size. In addition, the use of blasting has a very important role in the areas of reducing labor intensity, speeding up the construction progress and ensuring project safety. Millisecond delay blasting, which is also known millisecond blasting, is the blasting technique that the explosive package is detonated according different time by the use of millisecond delay detonato...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A design {{proposal}} {{for a kind of}} online programming electronic detonator is introduced in this paper. The safety and reliability of the design is analyzed, and then the methods for realizing the design proposal are exploited. The structure of the electronic detonator, the internal control circuit structure diagram, and part of the software flowchart, are presented. The time programmable increment step of 1 millisecond is arrived at, while the programmable delay time of this system ranging from 1 to 12000 milliseconds is obtained. Taking its safety and reliability, its accuracy in delay time, and its easy of use, into account, the online programming electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonator</b> proposed in this paper will be extensively applicable to complicated blasting engineering in the future...|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address <b>shorter</b> <b>delay</b> multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. <b>Short</b> <b>delay</b> reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|R

40|$|The {{world of}} {{blasting}} and explosive use continues to evolve into one which {{relies heavily on}} measurement, quantification, process control, and information feedback {{as a means of}} contributing to operational improvements. More than ever good blast performance, once thought to be a result of someone’s “artistic ability”, is giving way to “hard science” and measurement techniques. Variability in product performance and process control is becoming less tolerable with increasing environmental issues, regulatory pressure and public awareness. The Ensign-Bickford Company has directed its research and development effort toward improving blast performance with a shock tube initiated electronic detonator. The inherent precision of a shock tube initiation signal, coupled with an electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonator,</b> will provide the explosives industry with a practical and “user friendly” approach to precision blasting challenges. Field application of this technology has revealed numerous challenges in the measurement of both product and blast performance parameters.
