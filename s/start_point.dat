5|$|In the south, the 3rd Parachute Brigade started {{crossing}} the River Dives on 18August, delayed {{by the need}} to build a crossing to replace the bridge destroyed by the division during Operation Tonga. By nightfall the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was engaging the German rearguard and the 8th Parachute Battalion reached the outskirts of Goustranville. The next morning the brigade advance continued into Goustranville, where they came under heavy artillery fire from the high ground at Putot. Their attack faltered and Gale decided to restart the advance that night. He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the <b>start</b> <b>point</b> along the Dives canal and railway line, while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 18 June 1793 was {{the first}} decisive {{and one of the}} most celebrated {{encounters}} between British and French frigates during the French Revolutionary Wars. The action occurred off <b>Start</b> <b>Point</b> in Devon, when the British frigate HMS Nymphe encountered and chased the French frigate Cléopâtre. During the previous month, Cléopâtre and another frigate, Sémillante, had been successfully raiding British merchant shipping in the English Channel and Eastern Atlantic from their base at Cherbourg. In response, the British frigates Nymphe and HMS Venus had been ordered to intercept and defeat the French frigates and on 27 May Venus and Sémillante fought an inconclusive engagement off Cape Finisterre.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed <b>start</b> <b>point.</b> The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E

5|$|The forces {{commanded}} by the 7th SS Division were organised into northern, {{central and southern}} columns. The northern column consisted of Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion and included a company of tanks. It moved swiftly southwest from its <b>start</b> <b>point</b> near Banja Luka, and had reached Čađavica (at a crossroads halfway between Mrkonjić Grad and Ključ) by the evening of 25 May, brushing off the 16th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division deployed on the right flank of its axis of advance. The rapid advance meant that the 13th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division was unable to organise an effective defence. The 39th Krajina Division then ordered the 13th Krajina Brigade to block the road from Čađavica to Ključ {{in order to prevent}} the loss of Ključ, but only one battalion of the brigade managed to reach that position by dawn on 26 May.|$|E

In 1939, the BBC investigated using <b>Start</b> <b>Point</b> transmitting station in Devon to improve their coverage of radio in the South West.
