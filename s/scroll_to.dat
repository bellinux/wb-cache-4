Over the years, several great grandchildren of Solomon Katzenstein read from these torah scrolls in their respective Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebrations.

Psalm 37 has been said to have [...] "the strongest literary and thematic links" [...] with the Book of Habakkuk, compared to the other Psalms, and the language of Psalm 37 is borrowed by the Habakkuk pesherist in the commentary on Hab. 2:17. The similar language and themes of the Commentaries on Habakkuk and Psalm 37 have been suggested as evidence of common authorship, or at least similar interpretive methods.|$|E
