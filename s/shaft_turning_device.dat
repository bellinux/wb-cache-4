50|$|Turned, Ground, and Polished (TGP) is a {{classification}} of finishing processes {{often used for}} metal <b>shafting.</b> <b>Turning</b> (on a lathe) creates straight round bars without the strain induced by cold drawing, while grinding and polishing improves the surface finish and roundness for high dimensional accuracy.

This was typically a ball bearing positioned between the input shaft and output disk and pressed against both. When the input <b>shaft</b> <b>turned,</b> this caused the bearing to rotate in the opposite direction, and in turn caused the output disk to rotate in the original direction again, passing this on to the shaft it was connected to.|$|R

40|$|Using the 2 {{chain stitch}} sewing machine, the dynamic {{tensions}} of needle and looper threads, {{the amount of}} their threads which were fed, {{and the range of}} arm <b>shaft</b> <b>turning</b> angle when their threads were being fed, were simultaneously measured during sewing operation. The three peaks in needle thread tension curve and the two peaks in looper thread tension curve were observed, but the needle thread was fed twice and the looper thread was fed only once during a cycle of the sewing operation. As the tensions pulling out the needle thread increased, the range of arm <b>shaft</b> <b>turning</b> angle when needle thread was being fed the second time, decreased, a smaller amount of needle threads was fed and the each peak values of needle thread tension became large. Also as the tensions pulling out the looper thread increased, the same result was obtained on looper threads. However a smaller amount of needle threads was not fed the first time. As the tensions pulling out the needle thread varied, the relation between the feed length of each thread and peak tension of needle thread was shown by the regression equations...|$|R
