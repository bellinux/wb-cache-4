Design/methodology/approach: The methodology has consisted to dertemine <b>cutting</b> speed <b>of</b> each mode of tilt tool in five axes machining, and of proving a series of configurations and parameters combinations: cutting speed Vc, feed rate Vf, and tilt tool in multi-axis milling. Findings: This paper has investigated the effect of the tool orientation on the variation effective cutting speed, on the surface texture, while multi-axis milling. Experimental results have shown that disadvantages of three axes machining results from the existence <b>of</b> very low <b>cutting</b> speeds, even null when the tool axis is normal to the machined surface. This mode of machining generates a bad surface quality. Surfaces have a poor topography and important anisotropy. A suitable <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cutting</b> tool by the means of the fifth machine tool axis, improves considerably work piece machined surface quality; Good micro-geometrical surface topography and lower surface roughness.

40|$|The {{reported}} incidences of shallow failures on the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> highway earthworks {{have increased}} in recent years. This Thesis includes {{a study of the}} extent of this problem, the likely factors contributing to failure, and presents the results of empirical design and the analysis of the likely mechanism of failure. A survey was conducted, covering a total length of 570 km of selected lengths of motorway in England and Wales, which included the principal geologies encountered on the British motorway system, in particular, areas where over-consolidated clays predominate. From the survey, the basic factors that have contributed to shallow failures on the side <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> embankments and <b>cuttings</b> can be deduced, and attempts are made to quantify any long-term problems. The results show a high incidence of failure associated with the major influences of geology, age of earthworks and geometry <b>of</b> <b>slope,</b> with many more failures occurring on embankments than on cuttings. The slope angles recommended are empirically derived and can be used both in the design of new earthwork side slopes and to identify <b>slopes</b> at risk <b>of</b> failure in existing earthworks. An estimate is made of the extent of failures in the future which suggests that three times as many slopes are likely to fail than have failed so far. To study the mechanisms of failure and the behaviour of over- consolidated clays at extremely low effective stresses, an analytical method is developed which includes a detailed study of non-linear failure envelopes and the fitting of the most representative curve to peak strength data. Also a new rigorous slope stability analysis method is developed which incorporates this type of failure envelope. Back-analyses are conducted for several embankment slopes from which samples have been tested in the laboratory. Results indicate that the critical state strength rather than the peak strength governs the formation of shallow failures...|$|R

Currently, manufacturers provide {{a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> fluids, which have different combinations of lubricating and cooling properties.

To solve this problem in the software SIMULIA/Abaqus Explicit 6. 10 was developed thermomechanical model of the turning process by cutting tools with PVD-coating, which allows simulating the effect of any combination of cooling and lubricating action.
