50|$|After his battle, Spawn {{learned that}} Malebolgia had caused Urizen's release {{in an attempt}} to start Armageddon and conquer the forces of Heaven. Spawn and Angela then journeyed to Hell to stop him. During battle, Angela managed to mortally wound Malebolgia, but gets killed by him in retaliation. Consumed with anger, <b>Spawn</b> <b>takes</b> Malebolgia's head.|$|E
50|$|The game {{starts off}} with Spawn on a {{decrepit}} rooftop above Des Plaines's forgotten chapel in Des Plaines, IL. He then receives flashbacks {{of his former}} life, and his betrayal by Jason Wynn. Suddenly, a brilliant green flash of light tears through the city, signaling the demon's war against the angels in battle known as Armageddon. Knocked off the rooftops, <b>Spawn</b> <b>takes</b> to the street not only to answer the call but maybe even to get revenge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place from}} spring through fall. In the {{southern}} most populations, {{up to eight}} spawnings are possible in a season. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place most often at high tide and when the moon is new or full. Maximal spawning occurs when high spring tides coincide with night, though spawning during the day remains possible.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place at}} sea, near the coast between September and February.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place from}} June to November {{in the area}} of Delaware Bay.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place during}} the winter months, with the peak of {{activity}} occurring from December through February. Most <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf in deep waters of [...] [...] Male halibut become sexually mature at seven to eight years of age, while females attain sexual maturity at eight to 12 years. Females lay 0.5 to 4.0 million eggs annually, depending on the size of the fish.|$|R
50|$|Gulf {{butterfish}} mature {{within one}} year and rarely live past two years; <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place at discrete intervals twice a year slightly offshore.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} spring, when a seaweed nest is built and guarded by the male, {{with one or}} more females laying their {{adhesive}} eggs in it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} the spring and fall, with females {{returning}} to estuaries to release their eggs. Ovigerous (egg-carrying) females carry an average of more than 250,000 eggs.|$|R
50|$|It {{grows to}} 17 cm SL or 22 cm TL. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place {{throughout}} the year but is most intense and close to shore in October/November, and more offshore and less intensely in May/June.|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} Leiognathus splendens (N = 2112) was studied using the samples {{collected from the}} Kerala coast during 1998 - 2000. A separate scale of five stages of maturation has been developed {{for the first time}} for any Indian marine fish and applied in the present study. Analysis of data on the ova diameter in different length groups showed that <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in batches at regular intervals after the juveniles undergo the process of maturation and reach ripe stage. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place almost round the year. The length at first maturity was 75 mm. The estimated fecundity ranges from 5715 (88 mm TL) to 37160 (106 mm TL) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{flathead}} flounder spawning season is from February to April, and <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place at depths of 180 and 200 m. Females undergo one reproductive cycle {{per year and}} produce between 90,000 and 950,000 eggs during each cycle.|$|R
25|$|Striped {{bass are}} {{native to the}} Atlantic {{coastline}} of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to approximately Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in fresh water.|$|R
50|$|In {{the razor}} shell sexual {{development}} is highly synchronous. During the summer, {{they are in}} the sexual rest stage, and gametogenesis begins at the start of autumn. In winter and spring consecutive <b>spawns</b> <b>take</b> place, interrupted by gonadal restoration periods.|$|R
50|$|Anadara subcrenata becomes mature at {{a length}} of about 15 mm. Individual clams are either male or female and <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place between June and September. Fertilisation is {{external}} and the larvae form part of the zooplankton, drifting with the currents.|$|R
50|$|Striped {{bass are}} {{native to the}} Atlantic {{coastline}} of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to approximately Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in fresh water.|$|R
50|$|The Freak {{is killed}} when Spawn suffocates him with insects that were created when <b>Spawn</b> <b>took</b> The Freak's inner evils {{and gave them}} {{tangible}} form. Seeking {{to return to their}} place of origin they attempt to reenter The Freak, but in doing so suffocate him.|$|R
50|$|In Lake Chad <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place from}} in the late {{afternoon}} and evening, between 16:30-20:00 h. The eggs are shed in a single batch which represents 15% of the weight of female. When spawning the mature females are dispersed and do not form groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{reproduction}} {{of this species}} has been little studied, but {{it is thought that}} breeding takes place by releasing gametes into the sea in response to variations in environmental cues such as changes in temperature. This brittle star forms large aggregations before <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place.|$|R
50|$|Colonies of S. savaglia {{are either}} male or female. At a study {{site in the}} northwestern Mediterranean at 67 m, there {{were found to be}} more female colonies than male. <b>Spawning</b> <b>took</b> place in December when the {{seawater}} started to cool. This zoanthid can also reproduce asexually.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Truss me, would he? Todt und Holle!' {{cried the}} other, whom the blow and the brandy had driven to madness. 'We shall see. Take that, thou deyvil's <b>spawn,</b> <b>take</b> that!' He ran at me, and kicked me {{as hard as}} he could with his heavy sea-boots.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place at}} any time of year but the peak period is spring and early summer. Eggs and sperm are liberated into the water column, where {{fertilisation}} takes place. The larvae are planktonic. After several moults, the echinopluteus larva settles and undergoes metamorphosis before developing into a juvenile.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} spring and early summer. The female {{releases}} a single batch of 80,000 to 2,500,000 eggs into the water column where they are fertilised. The echinopluteus larvae form part of the zooplankton for one to two months before settling on the sea bed and undergoing metamorphosis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} shallow, saline {{portions}} of bays and other inshore areas, peaking between May and September. Silver perch mature by {{second or third}} year (by 6 inches). Adults eat crustaceans and small fishes. They may live to 6 years. This species is not currently eligible for a state record.|$|R
5000|$|It spawns {{in shallow}} waters (about 3 m) of the northeastern {{part of the}} Caspian Sea, in salinities of 8-10 ppt. It does not enter fresh water. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in {{temperatures}} of 18-20°C, from mid-May to end of June, and the young move southward relatively late in the autumn season.|$|R
50|$|Mugil liza is a detritivore {{and also}} feeds on {{filamentous}} algae. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place offshore {{in the summer}} between May and August. The fecundity rate is high and several million eggs are produced. These are non-adhesive and are pelagic. The males mature {{at a younger age}} than the females and are less numerous.|$|R
5000|$|Overall the {{territorial}} {{period of the}} males lasts from beginning of February until beginning of September, but the average duration of {{the territorial}} period per male was 47.1 days (in Corsica [...] )⁠. Male T. delaisi show territorial behaviour for 2 consecutive years. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place from mid of March until June.⁠ ...|$|R
50|$|Acropora tenuis is a {{simultaneous}} hermaphrodite. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place {{once a year}} and is synchronised among the colonies in any one locality. Packets of eggs and sperm are released into the water column and, being buoyant, rise to the surface. Here the packets break up and cross-fertilisation takes place with gametes from different colonies intermixing.|$|R
50|$|The Beckler River {{supports}} chinook and coho salmon. Chinook <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> places {{mainly in}} the Beckler and lower Rapid River. Coho use shallower side channels of the Beckler River and a few small tributaries. Adult salmon benefit from a trap-and-haul operation that transports them over a barrier on the lower South Fork Skykomish River.|$|R
50|$|This species {{grows to}} a total length of 14 cm, but {{typically}} is 9-11 cm. Adults are crepuscular, and feed on gammarids, chironomids, and young fish. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in May to June at 3-5 m depths. Eggs are deposited under stones, and the male stays guarding the eggs. The pelagic larvae feed on plankton.|$|R
50|$|Acropora grandis liberates its gametes {{into the}} sea where {{fertilisation}} <b>takes</b> place. Synchronised <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place, and {{in the part of}} its range in the Northern Hemisphere, this is four or five days after the full moon. The larvae are planktonic and drift with the currents before settling on the seabed to start a new colony.|$|R
50|$|Adults mature at two {{to three}} years of age and <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in summer. The fish congregate in shallow areas with sandy or gravelly {{substrates}} and rise to the surface. The females release their eggs in batches and the males release their milt. The eggs gradually sink to the bottom where they stick to stones and weeds.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> {{place between}} June and September. The larvae {{form part of}} the {{plankton}} {{for up to two}} months before settling on the seabed. Growth is fairly rapid with tubes extending by 1 cm (0.4 in) in a month. The worms mature in about 10 months and may live for several years.|$|R
40|$|Age, {{growth and}} {{reproduction}} of H. kelee were studied, {{and a brief}} description of its fishery in Maputo Bay (Mozambique) is given. Most material was collected from gill net fisheries during 1977 - 1980, but some was taken from shrimp trawlers operating in the same area during 1980 - 1981. Main <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place during October-January with a peak in December. There is also some evidence that <b>spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place during June-July. The size at first maturity was approximately equals 14 - 15 cm. Ageing was carried out using primary growth rings in the otoliths and length-frequency analysis of fish caught by shrimp trawlers. Von Bertalanffy's growth equation parameters were determined. Males and females grew in similar fashion. There are seasonal trends in the catch composition of the gill net fishery, showing high values during April to September and low during October to December...|$|R
50|$|Benthosema glaciale {{can grow}} to 10.3 cm SL. They have a maximum {{lifespan}} of about eight years, although typical lifespan is shorter. Maturity is reached at age 2-3 years. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place mostly in summer. In Norway, oceanic populations grow slower {{but to a}} larger size than fjord populations. Mediterranean populations have smaller body size, shorter lifespan, and might spawn throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|Female honey blue-eyes {{are sexually}} mature at {{three months of}} age or when they have reached 1.5-2 cm in {{standard}} length. <b>Spawning</b> <b>takes</b> place in spring and summer. Females spawn 40-125 eggs over 7-9 days, generally depositing them {{at the base of}} aquatic vegetation. When the young honey blue-eyes hatch, they will usually feed {{from the surface of the}} water.|$|R
