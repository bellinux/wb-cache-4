When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} and partially characterized {{a family of}} small nuclear RNAs (<b>snRNAs)</b> from three different species of the protozoan Tetrahymena. We find six distinct <b>snRNAs</b> {{ranging in size from}} 100 to 250 nucleotides. The two largest <b>snRNAs,</b> as well as an abundant, heterogenous group of smaller <b>snRNAs</b> are found in the nucleolar RNA fraction. None of the <b>snRNAs</b> are transcription products of the ribosomal RNA gene or its flanking regions, as shown by hybridization tests. The <b>snRNAs</b> are metabolically stable as determined by pulse/chase experiments and several of them contain a number of modified nuclotides. The <b>snRNAs</b> from Tetrahymena all have slightly different sizes from mammalian <b>snRNAs.</b> The cap structure of the <b>snRNAs</b> from Tetrahymena differs from that of the <b>snRNAs</b> from mammalian cells, but has not yet been fully characterized.

40|$|The {{specific}} and dynamic RNA:RNA interactions between pre-mRNA and small nuclear RNAs (<b>snRNAs),</b> especially U 2, U 5, and U 6 <b>snRNAs,</b> form the catalytic core and {{are at the}} heart of the spliceosome formation. The functionally important regions in the <b>snRNAs</b> correspond to the highly modified regions in <b>snRNAs</b> from human, rat, and plant cells. To better understand the importance of the modifications of <b>snRNAs,</b> we identified and localized the modified nucleotides in the five spliceosomal <b>snRNAs</b> of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. Twenty-two modified nucleotides, including base methylations, 2 '-O-methylations, and pseudouridines, were found in the five spliceosomal <b>snRNAs.</b> The conservation of modified nucleotides between human and S. pombe <b>snRNAs</b> is striking. In addition, most of the modified nucleotides are in or around positions that form hydrogen bonds with the pre-mRNA or with other <b>snRNAs.</b> The results are consistent with the suggestion that modified nucleotides are clustered around functionally important regions of the spliceosomal <b>snRNAs.</b> These data provide the basis for further functional studies on posttranscriptional modifications in spliceosomal <b>snRNAs...</b>|$|R

The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (<b>snRNA).</b> Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies.

25|$|At {{least five}} {{different}} kinds of snRNPs join the spliceosome to participate in splicing. They can be visualized by gel electrophoresis and are known individually as: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Their <b>snRNA</b> components are known, respectively, as: U1 <b>snRNA,</b> U2 <b>snRNA,</b> U4 <b>snRNA,</b> U5 <b>snRNA,</b> and U6 <b>snRNA.</b>|$|E
50|$|In eukaryotes, <b>snRNAs</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} to contain {{a significant amount of}} 2'-O-methylation modifications and pseudouridylations. These modifications are associated with snoRNA activity which canonically modify pre-mature rRNAs but {{have been observed}} in modifying other cellular RNA targets such as <b>snRNAs.</b> Finally, oligo-adenylation (short poly(A)tailing) can determine the fate of <b>snRNAs</b> (that are usually not poly(A)-tailed) and thereby induce their RNA decay. This mechanism regulating the abundance of <b>snRNAs</b> is in turn coupled to a widespread change of alternative RNA splicing.|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes {{the seven}} Sm core {{proteins}} bind to U 1, U 2, U 4, and U 5 <b>snRNAs.</b> In Trypanosoma brucei, Sm proteins have {{been implicated in}} binding both spliced leader (SL) and U <b>snRNAs.</b> In this study, we examined the function of these Sm proteins using RNAi silencing and protein purification. RNAi silencing {{of each of the}} seven Sm genes resulted in accumulation of SL RNA as well as reduction of several U <b>snRNAs.</b> Interestingly, U 2 was unaffected by the loss of SmB, and both U 2 and U 4 <b>snRNAs</b> were unaffected by the loss of SmD 3, suggesting that these <b>snRNAs</b> are not bound by the heptameric Sm complex that binds to U 1, U 5, and SL RNA. RNAi silencing and protein purification showed that U 2 and U 4 <b>snRNAs</b> were bound by a unique set of Sm proteins that we termed SSm (specific spliceosomal Sm proteins). This is the first study that identifies specific core Sm proteins that bind only to a subset of spliceosomal <b>snRNAs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} introns from pre-messenger RNA is {{mediated}} by the spliceosome, a large complex composed of many proteins and five small nuclear RNAs (<b>snRNAs).</b> Of the <b>snRNAs,</b> the U 6 and U 2 <b>snRNAs</b> are the most conserved in sequence, as they interact extensively {{with each other and}} also with the intron, in several base pairings that are necessary for splicing. We have isolated and sequenced the genes encoding both U 6 and U 2 <b>snRNAs</b> from the intracellularly parasitic microsporidian Nosema locustae. Both genes are expressed. Both RNAs can be folded into secondary structures typical of other known U 6 and U 2 <b>snRNAs.</b> In addition, the N. locustae U 6 and U 2 <b>snRNAs</b> have the potential to base pair in the functional intermolecular interactions that have been characterized by extensive analyses in yeast and mammalian systems. These results indicate that the N. locustae U 6 and U 2 <b>snRNAs</b> may be functional components of an active spliceosome, even though introns have not yet been found in microsporidian genes...|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1990s, it was {{discovered}} that a variant class of snRNPs exists to help in the splicing of a class of introns found only in metazoans, with highly conserved 5' splice sites and branch sites. This variant class of snRNPs includes: U11 <b>snRNA,</b> U12 <b>snRNA,</b> U4atac <b>snRNA,</b> and U6atac <b>snRNA.</b> While different, they perform the same functions as do U1, U2, U4, and U6, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{large number}} of <b>snRNAs</b> in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe {{can be divided into}} four {{non-overlapping}} groups by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against mammalian snRNP proteins. 1) Of the abundant <b>snRNAs,</b> anti-Sm sera precipitate only the spliceosomal <b>snRNAs</b> U 1, U 2, U 4, U 5 and U 6. Surprisingly, three Sm-sera tested distinguish between U 2, U 4 and U 5 and U 1 from S. pombe; one precipitating only U 1 and two precipitating U 2, U 4 and U 5 but not U 1. 2) A group of 11 moderately abundant <b>snRNAs</b> are not detectably precipitated by human anti-Sm sera, but are specifically precipitated by monoclonal antibody H 57 specific for the human B/B' polypeptides. From Aspergillus nidulans this antibody also precipitates at least 12 <b>snRNAs.</b> 3) Anti-(U 3) RNP sera do not precipitate the above <b>snRNAs,</b> but precipitate at least 6 further <b>snRNAs,</b> including the homologues of U 3. Both the anti-(U 3) RNP sera and H 57 also efficiently precipitate a number of discrete non-capped RNAs. 4) A small number of additional <b>snRNAs</b> are not detectably precipitated by any anti-serum tested to date, further analysis may identify antisera specific for these snRNPs. Western blots of purified snRNP proteins were used to identify the S. pombe proteins responsible for these immunoprecipitations. Several Sm-sera decorate a 16. 3 kD protein which may be a D protein homologue, monoclonal H 57 decorates a further protein of 16 kD and an anti-(U 3) RNP serum decorates the homologue of the 36 kD U 3 -specific protein, fibrillarin...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{structural}} and mechanistic {{similarities between the}} spliceosomal <b>snRNAs</b> and catalytically critical domains of self-splicing group II introns {{have led to the}} hypothesis that the spliceosomes and group II introns may be evolutionarily related. We have previously shown that in vitro-transcribed, protein-free U 6 and U 2 <b>snRNAs</b> can catalyze a two-step splicing reaction in trans on two short RNA oligonucleotides that is identical to the splicing reactions performed by many self-splicing group II introns. Here we show that the same two <b>snRNAs</b> can perform splicing in cis by removal of an intervening sequence from a model substrate. These results prove that the protein-free <b>snRNAs</b> are competent to perform splicing on pre-mRNAs and further strengthen the possibility of an evolutionary relationship to group II introns...|$|R
40|$|Insects are {{the most}} {{successful}} group of animals on earth, owing this partly to their very effective immune responses to microbial invasion. These responses mainly include cellular and humoral responses as well as RNA interference (RNAi). Small non-coding RNAs (<b>snRNAs)</b> produced through RNAi are important molecules in the regulation of gene expression in almost all living organisms; contributing to important processes such as development, differentiation, immunity as well as host-microorganism interactions. The main <b>snRNAs</b> produced by the RNAi response include short interfering RNAs, microRNAs and piwi-interacting RNAs. In addition to the host <b>snRNAs,</b> some microorganisms encode <b>snRNAs</b> that affect the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions. In this review, we will discuss {{the latest developments in}} regards to the role of microRNA in insect host-pathogen interactions and provide some insights into this rapidly developing area of research...|$|R
25|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is the process}} by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product.

40|$|The {{localization}} of U 1 and U 2 small nuclear RNAs (<b>snRNAs)</b> {{has been}} examined by {{in situ hybridization}} using 2 '-O-alkyl oligonucleotide probes. We have found that these <b>snRNAs,</b> which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing, localize in a speckled distribution, {{in addition to being}} present in three of four foci, in HeLa cell nuclei. However, in cells of defined passage, such as Detroit 551 and WI- 38 fibroblasts, these <b>snRNAs</b> are concentrated in nuclear speckles, and foci are not observed. The speckled distribution of U 1 and U 2 <b>snRNAs</b> is coincident with the speckled regions enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) proteins and the essential non-snRNP splicing factor SC- 35. The localization of these key components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery to speckled nuclear regions suggests that these regions may be involved in pre-mRNA splicing...|$|R
40|$|U 2 and U 6 <b>snRNAs</b> {{form part}} of the {{catalytic}} spliceosome and represent strong candidates for components of its active site.

40|$|The {{spliceosome}} removes introns from pre–messenger RNAs by {{a mechanism}} that entails extensive remodeling of RNA structure. The most conspicuous rearrangement involves disruption of 24 base pairs between U 4 and U 6 small nuclear RNAs (<b>snRNAs).</b> Here, the yeast RNA binding protein Prp 24 {{is shown to}} reanneal these <b>snRNAs.</b> When Prp 24 is absent, unpaired U 4 and U 6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) accumulate; with time, splicing becomes inhibited. Addition of purified Prp 24 protein regenerates duplex U 4 /U 6 snRNPs for new rounds of splicing. The reannealing reaction catalyzed by Prp 24 proceeds more efficiently with snRNPs than with deproteinized <b>snRNAs.</b> Pre–messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a dynamic process that promotes intron removal.

25|$|There {{are more}} than 100 classes of RNA {{modifications}} that have been found, a majority {{of which are in}} tRNA and rRNA while only three modified nucleotides have been discovered inside a coding sequence of mRNA: m6A, 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and inosine. The relevance of pseudouridine in rRNA has been documented where pseudouridylation is required for ribosome biogenesis and translational accuracy. The importance of pseudouridylation additionally seen in <b>snRNA</b> where specific pseudouridine residues have been located and identified as a needed component of pre-mRNA splicing. Previous research has focused specifically at the modifications of U2 spliceosomal RNA which are required for snRNP assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. U2 in comparison to other spliceosomal snRNAs has the most extensive modifications, including 13 pseudouridines as well as a 5' trim ethyl guanosine (TMG) cap and others. It is a mixture of modifications involving that of the pseudouridine residues that assist in the complete assembly of the 17S U2 snRNP particle needed for splicing.|$|E

40|$|In prokaryotes, small noncoding RNAs (<b>snRNAs)</b> of 50 - 500 nt are {{produced}} {{that are important}} in bacterial virulence and response to environmental stimuli. Here, we identified and characterized <b>snRNAs</b> from the endosymbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia, which are widespread in invertebrates and cause reproductive manipulations. Most importantly, some strains of Wolbachia inhibit replication of several vector-borne pathogens in insects. We demonstrate that two abundant <b>snRNAs,</b> WsnRNA- 46 and WsnRNA- 49, are expressed in Wolbachia from noncoding RNA transcripts that contain precursors with stem-loop structures. WsnRNAs were detected in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia and in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans infected with wMelPop and wAu strains, respectively, indicating that the WsnRNAs are conserved across species and strains. In addition, we show that the WsnRNAs may potentially regulate host genes and Wolbachia genes. Our findings provide evidence for the production of functional <b>snRNAs</b> by Wolbachia that play roles in cross-kingdom communication between the endosymbiont and the host...|$|R
