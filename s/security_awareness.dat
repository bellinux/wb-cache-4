5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of <b>security</b> <b>awareness.</b> The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet, network <b>security</b> situation <b>awareness</b> has attracted tremendous attention. In large-scale complex networks, network <b>security</b> situation <b>awareness</b> data presents the characteristics of large-scale, multi-source, and heterogeneous. Recently, much research work have been done on network <b>security</b> situation <b>awareness.</b> However, most of the existing methods store different types of data in different ways, which makes data query and analysis inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a graph database-based hierarchical multi-domain network <b>security</b> situation <b>awareness</b> data storage method. In our scheme, we build a hierarchical multi-domain network <b>security</b> situation <b>awareness</b> model to divide the network into different domains, which can collect and dispose the awareness data more efficiently. Meanwhile, to unify our storage mode, we also define network <b>security</b> situation <b>awareness</b> data storage rules and methods based on graph database. Finally, extensive experiments on real datasets show that our proposed method is efficient compared to state-of-the-art storage models.|$|R

2500|$|With {{the risk}} {{assessment}} complete, the IA practitioner then develops a risk management plan. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, {{and response to}} threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as Risk IT, CobiT, PCI DSS or ISO/IEC 27002, may guide development. Countermeasures may include technical tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software, policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in <b>security</b> <b>awareness,</b> or organizing personnel into dedicated computer emergency response team (CERT) or computer security incident response team (CSIRT). [...] The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most cost-effective way.|$|E
50|$|While {{information}} <b>security</b> <b>awareness</b> and high-profile breaches are at {{the forefront}} of most organization's agenda, a recent study of 220 <b>security</b> <b>awareness</b> officers by Lance Spritzner has uncovered three related key findings. First, executive and financial support are necessary for a successful <b>security</b> <b>awareness</b> program.

40|$|Almost all the organisations {{and even}} {{individuals}} rely on complex structures of data networks and networked computer systems. That complex data ensemble, the cyber domain, provides great opportunities, {{but at the}} same time it offers many possible attack vectors that can be abused for cyber vandalism, cyber crime, cyber espionage or cyber terrorism. Those threats produce requirements for cyber <b>security</b> situational <b>awareness</b> and intrusion detection capability. This dissertation concentrates on research and development of anomaly-based network intrusion detection system as a sensor for a situational awareness system. In this dissertation, several models of intrusion detection systems are developed using clustering-based data-mining algorithms for creating a model of normal user behaviour and ﬁnding similarities and dissimilarities compared to that model. That information can be used as a sensor feed in a situational awareness system in cyber security. A model of cyber <b>security</b> situational <b>awareness</b> system with multisensor fusion capability is presented in this thesis. Also a model for exchanging the information of cyber <b>security</b> situational <b>awareness</b> is generated. The constructed intrusion detection system schemes are tested with different scenarios even in online mode with real user data...|$|R

50|$|Information <b>security</b> <b>awareness</b> is one {{of several}} key {{principles}} of information security. Information <b>security</b> <b>awareness</b> seeks to understand and enhance human risk behaviors, beliefs and perceptions about information and information security while also understanding and enhancing organizational culture as a countermeasure to rapidly evolving threats. For example, the OECD's Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks include nine generally accepted principles: awareness, responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment. In the context of the Internet, this type of awareness is sometimes referred to as cyber <b>security</b> <b>awareness,</b> which is the focus of multiple initiatives, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber <b>Security</b> <b>Awareness</b> Month and President Obama's 2015 White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection.|$|E
