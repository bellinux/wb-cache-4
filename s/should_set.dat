5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, joined Matilda's faction. Hoping to seize East Anglia, he {{established}} his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Nigel faced a rapid response from Stephen, who made a surprise attack on the isle, forcing the Bishop to flee to Gloucester. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, at which Matilda was represented by Robert. The conference collapsed after Henry and the clergy insisted that they <b>should</b> <b>set</b> the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen's representatives found unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the {{previous}} year, rebelled against Stephen as well. Nigel hoped to seize East Anglia and established his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats lashed {{together to form a}} causeway that allowed him to make a surprise attack on the isle. Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, to which Stephen sent his wife.

5|$|One {{night during}} {{preparations}} for the expedition, the hermai, heads of the god Hermes on a plinth with a phallus, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and {{was seen as a}} bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, Cimon's son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades <b>should</b> <b>set</b> sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the oath of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing that the president <b>should</b> <b>set</b> policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler {{was the first to}} see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E

25|$|Before {{discussing}} Petty's economic theories, it {{is important}} to point out two crucial influences in his life. The first is Thomas Hobbes, for whom Petty acted as personal secretary. According to Hobbes, theory <b>should</b> <b>set</b> out the rational requirements for 'civil peace and material plenty'. As Hobbes had centred on peace, Petty chose prosperity.|$|E

25|$|Some {{national}} governments promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate practices. The heightened {{role of government}} in CSR has facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies. Various European governments have pushed companies to develop sustainable corporate practices.

25|$|In the {{introductory}} paragraph, Colet concludes {{by stating that}} his presence {{is due to the}} need for the Council to consider a Church reformation. First, Colet criticises the living style of the priests. Colet explains that the priests <b>should</b> <b>set</b> an example for others as be a beacon of light, because if they are instead figures of darkness, the Church will be engulfed by darkness. Colet cites four evils, referencing the Apostle, that constitute the corrupt, priestly living: devilish pride, carnal concupiscence, worldly covetousness, and worldly occupations.|$|E
25|$|Beatty was {{promoted}} to full admiral on 1 January 1919 and to Admiral of the Fleet on 1 May 1919. He was created 1st Earl Beatty, Viscount Borodale and Baron Beatty of the North Sea and Brooksby on 18 October 1919. He became First Sea Lord on 1 November 1919. In this capacity {{he was involved in}} negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 in which it was agreed that the United States, Britain and Japan <b>should</b> <b>set</b> their navies in a ratio of 5:5:3, with France and Italy maintaining smaller fleets.|$|E

The referendum was held and the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of independence. In April 1993 independence was achieved and the new state joined the United Nations.|$|E

25|$|The {{initial stage}} of {{research}} yielded the following results: experts developed a common terminology {{to describe the}} protective properties of the respirators; a methodology for measuring protection factors in different conditions of respirators' usage in the workplaces and laboratories; and the realization that national legislation <b>should</b> <b>set</b> limits {{for the use of}} all types of respirators based on their performance, measured not in the laboratory, but in the workplaces. The first studies also clearly confirmed that the use of respirators is the most unreliable method of protecting workers from all known methods. Therefore, respirators should be used only when other methods can not be used; or when other methods can not reduce the exposure of air pollution on people to an acceptable safe level.|$|E

25|$|The World Rainforest Movement {{has argued}} that poor {{developing}} countries could be pressured to accept reforestation projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism in order to earn foreign exchange simply {{to pay off the}} interest on debt to the World Bank. Tensions also exist over forest management between the sovereignty claims of nations states, arguments about common heritage of mankind and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities; the Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) arguing the anti-deforestation programs could merely allow financial benefits to flow to national treasuries, privilege would-be corporate forest degraders who manipulate the system by periodically threatening forests, rather than local communities who conserve them. The success of such projects will also depend on the accuracy of the baseline data and the number of countries involved. Further, {{it has been argued that}} if biosequestration is to play a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic climate change then coordinated policies <b>should</b> <b>set</b> a goal of achieving global forest cover to its extent prior to the industrial revolution in the 1800s.|$|E
