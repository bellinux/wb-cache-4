Because it sublimes into large quantities of carbon dioxide gas, which could pose a danger of hypercapnia, dry ice should only be exposed to open air in a well-ventilated environment. For this reason, dry ice is assigned the <b>S-phrase</b> [...] {{in the context of}} laboratory safety. Industrial dry ice may contain contaminants that make it unsafe for direct contact with foodstuffs. Tiny dry ice pellets used in dry ice blast cleaning do not contain oily residues.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and flow cytometry as proliferation markers in regenerating rat liver containing metastases. STUDY DESIGN: Rats containing colorectal liver metastases were killed at various days after 70 % partial hepatectomy or a sham operation. [H- 3]thymidine and 5 -bromo- 2 'deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, PCNA expression and flow cytometry {{were used to}} evaluate liver cell proliferation. RESULTS: The assessment of proliferating liver cells by PCNA expression and BrdU incorporation was more reliable than autoradiography. PCNA expression correlated well with BrdU incorporation (r=. 68, P=. 003) and autoradiography (r=. 57, P=. 02) in regenerating liver. BrdU incorporation and PCNA expression were higher in hepatectomized rats as compared to sham-operation rats at days 1 - 4 after hepatectomy. Flow cytometry of propidium-stained nuclei from livers of hepatectomized rats showed {{a higher proportion of}} S-phase nuclei as compared to S-phase nuclei in control rats. The correlation coefficients of the number of <b>S-phrase</b> nuclei, BrdU-positive nuclei and PCNA-positive nuclei were. 39 (P CONCLUSION: Flow cytometry and PCNA expression are simple and reliable methods of studying proliferation in metastases containing rat liver after partial hepatectomy...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Thymosin beta 10 (Tβ 10) {{is one of}} β-thymosin family members, has a highly conserved polar 5 kDa peptides. This peptide is now regarded {{to be a small}} actin-binding protein and thereby induce depolymerization of the intracellular F-actin networks. Alteration of Tβ 10 expression may alter the balance of cell growth, cell death, cell attachment and cell migration. Tβ 10 also affects cell metastasis as well as proliferation, apoptosis and vascularization of cancer cells. But function of Tβ 10 appear to be rather different between cancer cells, and the molecular mechanisms of β-thymosins to regulate cell apoptosis and proliferation in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) cell lines are unclear. In this study, we used lung adenocarcinoma cell line A 549, added Tβ 10 or down-regulated the expression of Tβ 10. We observed the change of apoptosis, proliferation and cell cyclin ability in A 549 and the mechanisms underline them were also identified. Methods After A 549 was treated with 100 ng/mL recombinant human Tβ 10 or siTβ 10, apoptosis rate of A 549 and cell cycle distribution were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). CCK- 8 assay was employed to determine the proliferation of A 549. The mRNA level of P 53, Caspase- 3, Cyclin A and Cyclin E were determined by real-time PCR. The protein level of P 53, Caspase- 3, Cyclin A and Cyclin E were detected by Western blot. Results Add Tβ 10 can inhibit the apoptosis and prompt the proliferation of A 549. It can also increase the cell rates of <b>S-phrase</b> and G 2 /M-phrase, decrease the expression of P 53 and Caspase- 3, but increase the expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E. Interferance of Tβ 10 can prompt the apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of A 549. It can also increase the cell rates of G 0 /G 1 -phrase, increase the expression of P 53 and Caspase- 3, but decrease the expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E. Conclusion In lung cancer cell line, Tβ 10 can inhibit the apoptosis by increase P 53, drive cells into the S and G 2 /M-phase, prompt cell proliferation by increase the expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E. Tβ 10 may become a potential biomarker and therapy target for non-small cell lung cancer...|$|E

40|$|More than 50 million {{compounds}} with molecular struc-tures {{are known}} today. Reliable hazard {{information is available}} {{for only a few}} thousand of them. Nevertheless, laws and regulations can (and have to) be applied to all chemical substances used in a laboratory. For this pur-pose, a new web-based system [1] has been developed for the online evaluation of hazardous substances. Using a web form which offers a structure editor, any given structure can be submitted to a SciDex-driven back-end [2]. In the first step of evaluation, the backend runs a database query to a CLAKS-Database [3] with more than 140 000 known substances. If the substance is already known to the database, the backend returns the applicable danger symbols, R-and <b>S-Phrases.</b> If it is not found in the database, a substructure analysis according to several reg-ulations will be done. Furthermore, relevant degradation compounds are calculated and analysed. Relevant laws and regulations are e. g. European Hazard Law [4], the Chemical Weapons Convention [5], German law about narcotics [6], regulations about explosives [7] and lists of known poisons...|$|R
