5000|$|Shot peening is a {{solution}} process for flattening a deformed steel belt in which {{the surface of the}} belt is hammered with small spherical stainless steel or carbon steel balls called peening shot. Every single small piece of shots hitting the steel belts functions as a small peening hammer, transmitting a small indentation or dimple on the steel belt surface. In order for the indentation to be formed, the steel belt surface layer must yield in tension. The compressed grains help to recover the surface to its real surface (original surface) producing a hemisphere of cold-worked metal extremely stressed in compression. Overlapping indentation create a homogeneous layer of residual compressive stress. It is well known that cracks will not lead up nor propagate in a compressible <b>stressed</b> <b>zone.</b> Because nearly all fatigue and stress corrosion failures create at the surface of a part, compressive stresses generate by shot peening provide very important increases in life time.Note that: ...|$|E

In order to investigate the effect of water saturation on the mechanical properties of low-permeability rocks, uniaxial compression tests were conducted on siltstone with different water contents. The effects {{of water on the}} strength, elastic moduli, crack initiation and damage thresholds were observed for different water saturation levels. It was found that 10 % water saturation level caused {{more than half of the}} reductions in mechanical properties. A new approach is proposed to analyze the stress-strain relations at different stages of compression by dividing the axial and lateral stress-strain curves into five equal <b>stress</b> <b>zones,</b> where <b>stress</b> <b>zones</b> 1 – 5 refer to 0 %– 20 %, 20 %– 40 %, 40 %– 60 %, 60 %– 80 % and 80 %– 100 % of the peak <b>stress,</b> respectively. <b>Stress</b> <b>zone</b> 2 represents the elastic range better than <b>stress</b> <b>zone</b> 3 which is at half of the peak stress.

The latter, so-called “ duplex process ”, combines a nitriding pre-treatment {{in order to obtain}} a hard and stiff substrate and a PVD coating {{in order to reduce the}} friction coefficient and improve the wear resistance of tools and mechanical components. Prior to fatigue testing, the surface modifications were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), residual stress distribution, Vickers nano-hardness measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. For the quenched and tempered steels, the PVD coating acts as a high compressive residual <b>stressed</b> <b>zone</b> able to increase the fatigue resistance of the coated component. On the contrary, for the duplex-treated samples, a limited increase in the fatigue limit was detected with respect to uncoated nitrided samples.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{present the results}} of in situ {{synchrotron}} X-ray diffraction measurements of fatigue crack-tip strain fields following a 100 % overload (OL) under plane strain conditions. The study is made on a bainitic steel with a high toughness and fine microstructure. This allowed a very high (60 mu m) spatial resolution to be achieved so that fine-scale changes occurring around the crack-tip were captured along the crack plane at the mid-thickness of the specimen. We have followed the crack as it grew through the plastic/residually <b>stressed</b> <b>zone</b> associated with the OL crack location. We observed two effects; one when the enhanced plastic zone is ahead of the crack and one {{after it has been}} passed. Regarding the former {{it was found that the}} compressive stress at the crack-tip initially falls sharply, presumably due to the increased plastic stretch caused by the OL. This is associated with a concomitant fall in peak tensile stress at K-max, the elastic excursion between K-min and K-max remaining essentially unchanged from before OL. Subsequently discontinuous closure as seen previously for plane stress caused by crack face contact at the OL location limits the elastic strain range experienced by the crack tip and thereby retards crack growth.

These are the most <b>stressed</b> <b>zone</b> of the rolls where cracks systematically initiate.

The main landslide unit is a large DSGDS (Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation) which extends on an area of 3. 75 km 2 and affects the Western flank of Mount Ganderberg (altitude 2330 m) stretching for 1200 m.

Hypersonic flows over the vehicle SARA at zero-degree angle of attack in a chemical equilibrium and thermal non-equilibrium are modeled by the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which has become the main technique for studying complex multidimensional rarefied flows, and that properly accounts for the non-equilibrium aspects of the flows. The emphasis {{of this paper is}} to examine the behavior of the primary properties during the high altitude portion of SARA reentry.

40|$|Abstract-Gear teeth failure due to fatigue is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} observed. Even a slight reduction in the root tensile stress results in great increase in the fatigue life of a gear. If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root fillet curve and so on. Most of the above methods do not guarantees the interchangeability of the existing gear systems. This work presents the possibilities of using the stress redistribution techniques by introducing the stress relieving features in the <b>stressed</b> <b>zone</b> to the advantage of reduction of root fillet stress in spur gear. This also ensures interchangeability of existing gear systems. In this work, combination of circular and elliptical stress relieving features are used and better results are obtained than using circular stress relieving features alone which are used by earlier researchers.
