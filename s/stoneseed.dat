50|$|Lithospermum is a genus {{of plants}} {{belonging}} to the family Boraginaceae. The genus is distributed nearly worldwide, but most are native to the Americas {{and the center of}} diversity is in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Species are known generally as gromwells or <b>stoneseeds.</b>|$|R

50|$|Lithospermum incisum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by several common names, including narrowleaf <b>stoneseed,</b> fringed gromwell, narrowleaf puccoon, and plains <b>stoneseed.</b> It is native to much of central Canada and the United States, where it is known from many types of habitat. It is a hairy perennial herb growing from a taproot and woody caudex. It produces a cluster of stems up to about 30 centimeters long. The stems are lined with narrow, pointed leaves up to 6 centimeters long. The slender, trumpet-shaped flowers are pale to bright yellow or gold, and may approach 4 centimeters long. The corolla face is 1 to 2 centimeters wide, its lobes sometimes ruffled.|$|E
50|$|Lithospermum latifolium is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by the common names American gromwell and American <b>stoneseed.</b> Its native range is centered in the Midwestern United States, where it is found in calcareous forests. It is a hairy, tall perennial herb that produces small yellow flowers in late spring.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-cheeked {{chipmunk}} {{feeds on}} {{the seeds and}} fruits {{of a variety of}} plants. Grass seeds have been found in its cheek pouches, so it may store some food for later use. In {{the early part of the}} year, fungi are eaten and the acorns from oak trees and the seed capsules of <b>stoneseed</b> are eaten over a long period of the year. Insect wings have been found among the stomach contents, so some animal food may also be consumed.|$|E
50|$|Lithospermum californicum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by the common name California <b>stoneseed.</b> It is native to southern Oregon and northern California, {{where it can be}} found in many types of mountain habitat, such as forest, woodland, and chaparral. It is a hairy perennial herb growing from a taproot and woody caudex. It produces a clump of branching, spreading stems up to about 40 centimeters long. The stems are lined with widely lance-shaped, lightly hairy leaves up to 5 centimeters long. The flowers appear near the ends of the stem branches, each with a calyx of narrow, pointed sepals. The corolla is bright golden yellow and nearly a centimeter wide at the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Lithospermum ruderale is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by the common name western <b>stoneseed</b> or lemonweed. It is native to western Canada and the western United States, {{where it can be}} found in many types of habitat. A perennial herb growing from a taproot and woody caudex, it is covered with fine, more or less upright, hairs, especially on the stems. It produces a cluster of erect leafy stems 20 to 50 centimeters tall. The stems support lance-shaped leaves up to 8 centimeters long. Bunches of flowers with leaf-like bracts appear toward the top of the stem amongst the leaves. The corolla is light yellow, often slightly greenish, and about a centimeter long and wide. The style is short. The fruit consists of one or two, sometimes four, clustered glossy grey nutlets, 3.5 to 6, sometimes as much as 8 mm long. This plant was used as a contraceptive by several Native American groups, including the Navajo and Shoshone. Studies on mice showed the plant reduced their fertility.|$|E
40|$|Some {{believe that}} natural {{is synonymous with}} safe. This can be dangerous. With {{the passage of the}} Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA) in 1994, more labels will list an herb’s {{expected}} action. However, the active ingredient(s) in many herbs and herbal supplements are still not known. Herbs should be used with the same caution you would use with any drug. The following list consists of the most commonly used herbs that should be avoided during preconception, pregnancy, or during any cycle when a woman may be pregnant. Some herbs on this list might be utilized by a trained herbalist during preconception and pregnancy, and under such proper guidance can be safe. However, a woman should not self-medicate with the following botanicals. These herbs are grouped according to their action.

40|$|About 4 farms {{breeding}} Blonde d’Aquitaine (farm A), Piemontese (farms B and D) and Limousin (farm C) bulls {{were used}} in a 3 year research project to {{study the effects of}} supplementation of a phytotherapic compound (containing ginger and European <b>stoneseed)</b> on performance, meat quality and fatty acid composition of finishing bulls. In each farm, 20 bulls were divided in two balanced groups: treatment (TRT, n = 10) and control (CTR, n = 10) group. The two groups were placed in two separate pens where concentrate and straw were offered ad libitum. During the last 60 days before slaughtering (finishing period), the phytotherapic compound (50 g/head/day) was added into the diet of the TRT group. Animals were weighted every 2 weeks in order to calculate the Average Daily Gain (ADG) of the trial. At the end of the experimental period, bulls were slaughtered and muscle conformation, fat covering, pH and temperature were measured on carcasses. On beef samples were analyzed color, drip losses, cooking losses, meat cooking shrinkage and shear force. Moreover, fatty acid profile and sensory traits of meat were also investigate on samples collected in farm A and D. The TRT groups of farms A and B showed higher (p< 0. 05) ADG compare to the respective CTR group. Very few significant differences of physical, chemical and sensory characteristics emerged on beef samples. Globally, the supplementation with the phytotherapic compound did not negatively affect meat quality. The obtained results thus suggest that the considered plant extracts might enhance bulls’ performance but further investigations should help to clarify the dose-response relationship...|$|E
