40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the traditional process based on the use of sulfides, an unhairing process in drum by hydrogen peroxide was developed for the production of high-quality bovine upper leather. A preliminary investigation at laboratory scale has allowed us to set out the optimal process conditions, in terms of H 2 O 2 dosage and pH, in order to achieve an effective unhairing and a compatible swelling of the hide. The pilot and industrial scale runs have assessed the industrial feasibility of the process that allows the production of a versatile base for different final applications of the leather (either chrome or vegetable tanned), and appear practical to implement as well as compatible with existing machinery. The finished leather obtained by the innovative unhairing process shows good physical-mechanical and technical properties comparable with those of the traditional process, and the leather was technically assessed as satisfactory and suitable for use in the production of high quality upper leathers. The major pollutants of the oxidative unhairing, either as absolute concentrations or if normalized with respect to the <b>salted</b> <b>weight</b> of hide processed, appear quite similar to those from the traditional process. The evident advantage is obviously the complete absence of dissolved sulfides in the exhaust baths of the oxidative process.

The biodegradable polymers {{used in this}} study were poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). A polymer/salt composite was first prepared by a solvent casting process. After drying, the composite was extruded to form a tubular construct. The salt particles in the construct were then leached out leaving a conduit with an open-pore structure. PLGA was studied as a model polymer to analyze the effects of <b>salt</b> <b>weight</b> fraction, <b>salt</b> particle size, and processing temperature on porosity and pore size of the extruded conduits. The porosity and pore size were found to increase with increasing <b>salt</b> <b>weight</b> fraction. Increasing the salt particle size increased the pore diameter but did not affect the porosity. High extrusion temperatures decreased the pore diameter without altering the porosity. Greater decrease in molecular weight was observed for conduits manufactured at higher temperatures. The mechanical properties of both PLGA and PLLA conduits were tested after degradation in vitro for up to 8 weeks. The modulus and failure strength of PLLA conduits were approximately 10 times higher than those of PLGA conduits. Failure strain was similar for both conduits. After degradation for 8 weeks, the molecular weights of the PLGA and PLLA conduits decreased to 38 % and 43 % of the initial values, respectively. However, both conduits maintained their shape and did not collapse. The PLGA also remained amorphous throughout the time course, while the crystallinity of PLLA increased from 5. 2 % to 11. 5 %. The potential of seeding the conduits with cells for transplantation or with biodegradable polymer microparticles for drug delivery was also tested with dyed microspheres.

40|$|As {{part of a}} U. S. Geological Survey {{study in}} Juab Valley in central Utah from 1991 to 1994, the {{chemistry}} of ground - and surface -water samples was determined. Total dissolved solids in the ground water of southern Juab Valley have historically been higher, in general, than ground water {{in other areas of}} Utah. Total dissolved solids for ground-water samples from this study ranged from 623 to 3, 980 milligrams/liter. High-sulfate chemical data of previous studies suggested that the major source of ground-water salinity is the dissolution of gypsum (hydrous calcium sulfate) from the Arapien Shale. Sulfur- 34 to sulfur- 32 isotopic ratio data have confirmed that dissolved Arapien Shale is the major source of salinity in southern Juab Valley water. This thesis study of southern Juab Valley had four main objectives: 1) define the present chemistry of the ground and surface water; 2) qualitatively determine the mineralogy of the Middle Jurassic Arapien Shale; 3) determine the major sources of salinity; and 4) determine the main flow path in the ground-water system. Chemical data show that the water in southern Juab Valley is predominantly of a calcium-magnesium-sulfate-bicarbonate composition. X-ray diffraction determined the mineralogy of the Arapien Shale as primarily calcite and quartz. Mineralogy of the acid-insoluble residue is illite, chlorite, quartz, and a trace of feldspar. Based on chemical, isotopic, and simple <b>salt</b> <b>weight</b> percent data, dissolution of gypsum is the major source of salinity in southern Juab Valley water. Using the chemical and isotopic data as input, a mass balance computer software program (NETPATH) helped to determine that the gypsum is derived from the Arapien Shale.

The immune system specifically targets {{the cells of the}} adrenal cortex and destroys them, but Addison’s disease can also be caused by a severe infection such as tuberculosis.

Increased skin pigmentation is caused by a deficiency of the adrenocortical hormone hydrocortisone. Its normal behavior would be as negative feedback at the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary gland to decrease secretion of corticotropin. Because hydrocortisone is not able to be produced in Addison’s disease, the pituitary gland continues to secrete corticotropin which binds to the receptor for melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It then causes melanocytes to produce more pigment, thus darkening the skin tone.|$|R
