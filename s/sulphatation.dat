40|$|Aims: In {{this study}} the {{concentration}} of SO 2 in Khark Island was evaluated via passive sampling. Materials and Methods: The climate {{of the region and}} SO 2 level were investigated during one year. For SO 2 sampling, <b>sulphatation</b> pages was used and SO 2 was determined by PbO 2 method monthly. The climate data was obtained from Khark airport meteorology station. Results: For SO 2 sampling, the <b>sulphatation</b> pages were installed at six locations in the region for a month. The results indicate the level of this gas is more than air standard. So that, SO 2 concentration in residential Khark area was more than 8. 5 ΅g/cm 2 day. Conclusions: High gas concentrations and climate conditions can cause accelerated corrosion of facilities and can have adverse effects on human and natural resources of the island...|$|E
40|$|Gypsum {{crystallization}} {{on natural}} building stones due to <b>sulphatation</b> processes {{is a well}} known and widely described phenomenon in deterioration studies. The gaseous SO 2 of the polluted environment reacts with the carbonate of the stone, resulting into gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) crystallization {{on the surface and}} inside the porous structure of the material. In order to obtain quantitative information on porosity and pore structure change before, during and after <b>sulphatation,</b> the process should be monitored on the same sample. With the aid of non-destructive high-resolution X-ray computed tomography we investigated various types of porous limestones before, during and after in vitro-induced gypsum crystallization processes. A 3 D image with a resolution of 2. 5 µm was obtained during each step of gypsum crust formation. Besides the visualization of the gypsum crystallization, also quantitative information on porosity and pore structure changes could be obtained. For each stone type, radial porosity, open pore structure, partial porosity and distribution of equivalent and maximum opening of the pores has been calculated with the software program Morpho+. The blistering of the gypsum crust on the calcareous sandstone has been quantified, and the secondary porosity provoked by the dissolution of calcite has been calculated in 4 dimensions. The results of this research contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the evolution of pore structure changes due to deterioration. This process results in zones of changed porosity with a subsurface weakening due to loss of coherence and crustal induration. A better understanding thus allows quantification of future material loss and durability change...|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids {{are present}} in almost all {{terrestrial}} plants, where they provide UV-protection and colour. Flavonoids have a fused ring system consisting of an aromatic ring and a benzopyran ring with a phenyl substituent. The flavonoids {{can be divided into}} several classes depending on their structure. Flavonoids {{are present in}} food and medicinal plants and are thus consumed by humans. They are found in plants as glycosides. Before oral absorption, flavonoids undergo deglycosylation either by lactase phloridzin hydrolase or cytosolic β-glucocidase. The absorbed aglycone is then conjugated by methylation, <b>sulphatation</b> or glucuronidation. Both the aglycones and the conjugates can pass the blood-brain barrier. In the CNS several flavones bind to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA-receptor resulting in sedation, anxiolytic or anti-convulsive effects. Flavonoids of several classes are inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A or B, thereby working as anti-depressants or to improve the conditions of Parkinson’s patients. Flavanols, flavanones and anthocyanidins have protective effects preventing inflammatory processes leading to nerve injury. Flavonoids seem capable of influencing health and mood...|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a linear}} non-sulphated glycosaminoglycan, used in {{dermatology}} as a biomaterial for bioengineering purposes, temporary dermal filler, stimulation of wound healing {{as well as}} drug vehicle in topical formulations. In addition to the well-characterized structural properties, extensive research on HA has revealed a range of vastly immunemodulatory effects, dependent on its size. In this in vitro study we investigated the ability of HA-S 3, a small fragment HA (MW, molecular weight: 68 kDa) with degree of <b>sulphatation</b> of 3 and of HA fraction (MW: 210 kDa) to reduce the bacterial induced inflammatory response in spontaneous immortalized keratinocytes. To this purpose, HaCaT cells were treated for 24 hours with 25 µg/ml of E. Coli derived bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in absence or presence of small fragment HA-S 3 or HA. Cell viability was thereafter assessed using trypan blue stain and interleukin (IL) - 8, IL- 1 β and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) concentrations were determined in cell supernatants by single enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that cell viability was not affected either by HA-S 3 or HA which in turn were able to reduce LPS-induced mortality. HA and especially HA-S 3 were able to significantly reduce LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our observation might suggest new perspectives {{in the development of}} HA-S 3 containing topical products able to modulate cutaneous inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|Normal bone {{homeostasis}} {{involves a}} balance between osteoblast and osteoclast action, regulated by hormones and cytokine stimuli. Hemodialysis patients appear to have increased production of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in serum. IL- 1 {{plays a role in}} the synthesis, degradation and degree of <b>sulphatation</b> of ECM components such as glycosaminoglycans. Also, continuous changes in the ECM involve enzymes such as beta-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase (beta-NAG) and beta-d-glucuronidase (beta-GLU) which act on different GAG classes and collagen fibers. We examined the effects of IL- 1 alpha on ECM synthesis and the related enzymes in human uremic osteoblast cultures. We also measured the levels of IL- 1 beta, and IL- 6 and alkaline phosphatase activity. In biopsies of uremic bone there was less ECM deposition than resorption associated with changes in osteoblast morphology. In vitro osteoblast proliferation was higher (P</= 0. 01), and extracellular GAG lower (P</= 0. 01) than in controls. The enzyme beta-NAG was high (P</= 0. 05) but there were no noteworthy changes in beta-GLU. ELISA of the medium indicated spontaneous production of IL- 1 beta and IL- 6, which significantly increased after IL- 1 alpha treatment compared to controls. IL- 1 alpha reduced alkaline phosphatase activity (P</= 0. 01) in uremic osteoblast cultures. IL- 1 acts on osteoblasts with decreases in GAG synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity, while beta-NAG increases. This lead to a reduction in the organic component in ECM and its mineralization, and to changes in the regulation of cytokine activity by GAG. The enzymatic breakdown might be facilitated by metabolic acidosis and failed osteoblast differentiation; these factors could be correlated with different degrees of osteodystrophy...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{can act as}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) {{and scatter}} or absorb light thus influencing many important processes in the atmosphere. The CCN activity of atmospheric aerosols depends mainly on the water solubility of their chemical components. Besides inorganic salts also polar and water-soluble organic compounds {{are responsible for the}} water solubility of atmospheric aerosols. Humic-like substances (HULIS) constitute {{a major part of the}} water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) fraction of atmospheric aerosols and may thus be largely involved in cloud condensation processes. However, hitherto little is known about the chemical composition and structure of HULIS. Structure elucidation was performed by different mass spectrometric techniques of the WSOC fraction and specially of HULIS from atmospheric aerosols collected in the city of Basel. HULIS were cleaved into smaller substructures by thermochemolysis using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The simultaneously methylated substructures were separated by gas chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, composition and fragmentation behaviour of HULIS were studied by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap multiple mass spectrometry (LC-MSn). Structure elucidation of the WSOC fraction by thermochemolysis GC-MS Solid phase extraction (SPE) was applied to separate the HULIS from the rest of the WSOC and inorganic compounds. Analysis of HULIS by thermochemolysis GC-MS revealed that aliphatic monocarboxylic acids (C 9, C 10, C 12, C 14, C 16 and C 18), aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (C 4 - 10), mono-, di- and trihydroxylated benzoic acids, as well as benzenedicarboxylic and benzenetricarboxylic acids were the main substructures. However, HULIS could not be completely analysed by thermochemolysis GC-MS. A dark brownish residue persisted after thermochemolysis. Its chemical composition remained unknown, since no further structural information could be retrieved by pyrolysis. Reference compounds such as fulvic acids, humic acids and lignin were analysed by thermochemolysis GC-MS as well. Their substructures were very similar to those of HULIS, which indicated fossil fuel burning or combustion of lignin containing biomass as possible sources. Moreover, thermochemolytical degradation of model compounds containing ester and ether groups was investigated. Aromatic esters, and esters with aliphatic and aromatic partial structures degraded easily. However, aromatic ethers and ethers with aliphatic and aromatic partial structures were less prone to cleavage. In conclusion, HULIS probably contain aromatic esters, and esters with aliphatic and aromatic partial structures rather than aromatic ethers and ethers with aliphatic and aromatic partial structures. Principal component analysis was used to compare the fingerprint patterns in the thermochemograms of HULIS taken at different sampling dates. A seasonal variation of the composition was observed. HULIS composition of spring, summer and autumn samples seemed to be similar. However, HULIS from November, December, January and February were completely separated from the rest. Hydroxylated aromatic carboxylic acids were more abundant in the HULIS of these filter samples. Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids seemed to be typical for HULIS in spring, summer and autumn filter samples. Structure elucidation of the WSOC fraction by LC-MS WSOC was separated into five fractions using a HPLC column containing a 300 Å pore size reversed stationary phase. Mass spectrometry revealed that HULIS in fractions I-IV consisted of polar compounds of lower mass with a mass distribution between m/z 100 - 400 and a maximum at m/z 240. HULIS in fraction V were less polar substances of higher mass with a mass distribution between m/z 100 - 900 and a maximum at m/z 500. MS 2 and MS 3 spectra showed that carboxylic and hydroxyl moieties were predominant functional groups of HULIS. Moreover, fragment m/z 97 was detected in most MS 2 and MS 3 spectra. TOF-MS and deuterium exchange experiments identified m/z 97 as HSO 4 -. These experiments supported the existence of sulphate covalently bound to HULIS. Furthermore, a loss of - 80 u (SO 3) was observed in the fragment spectra. However, it could not be clearly associated to sulphonated or sulphated HULIS as both sulphonation and <b>sulphatation</b> of HULIS are possible in the atmosphere. Quantification of sulphate covalently bound to HULIS was performed by source fragmentation of HULIS detecting HSO 4 - as m/z 97. Combined concentrations in fractions I-V were similar to other polar organic compounds common in atmospheric aerosols. A slight seasonal trend was observed with higher concentrations in winter and summer than in spring and autumn. However, the trend might be within the normal fluctuation of the concentrations. Concentrations of inorganic HSO 4 - did not correlate with those of organosulphates, which indicated that <b>sulphatation</b> reaction of HULIS does not only depend on the amount of sulphate in the atmospheric aerosol, but on other factors such as temperature, solar irradiation, acidity of other chemical components present in aerosols. Combined structural information obtained by thermochemolysis GC-MS and LC-MS allowed to propose defined structures for lower mass HULIS based on 2 - 3 substructures as well as for higher mass HULIS with 3 - 4 substructures. In addition, sulphate is covalently bound. The mass distributions of the postulated substructures were in good agreement with the recorded full scan spectra of HULIS...|$|E
40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} {{the definition of the}} size/extent of major decay phenomena in the Venetian architectural surfaces caused by the impact of the local environment and its variation due to the effects of the climate changes occurred in the last years. Decay patterns observed on historical buildings and data related to the surrounding environment have been taken into account for evaluating the impact of climate changes on the built Cultural Heritage of Venice. This contribution aims to animate a network of Cultural Heritage stakeholders devoted to promote an effective and sustainable preservation policy. 1. Introduction The surfaces of built Cultural Heritage of Venice have been exposed in the last century to a particularly aggressive environment, not only related to the presence of brackish water and marine aerosol, but also due to the atmospheric pollution produced by the local industries and the extensive use of fossil-oils [1]. In recent years a better air quality has been assessed, however frequent and intense high tides and meteoric precipitations, enhanced by climate changes, and the lack of preservation and maintenance of the natural defences (e. g. barrier islands and coastal wetlands) make Venice Lagoon and its coasts progressively more vulnerable [1 - 4] [...] The impact of the climate changes on the historic architectonic surfaces in Venice is therefore of crucial importance {{for the development of a}} sustainable preservation plan for the Venetian Cultural Heritage. General models and data which relate climate changes and construction materials are available [5], but specific studies for more complex systems, such as historical centres, are still absent. Furthermore, the quantitative relationship between pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables and stone degradation is still difficult to clear out [6]. 2. Discussion: Effects of climate change on architectural surfaces in Venice Climate changes have exacerbated the well-known degradation factors present and intrinsic in the Venetian environment (e. g. the capillary rise of salt solution, the marine aerosol, etc.) and others related to the human overexploitation of the lagoon resources [6, 7]. The decay due to <b>sulphatation,</b> nitration and oxidation is expected to be reduced, thanks to the decrease of the associated pollutants [4], but erosion and washout processes - in particular for carbonatic materials - will continue and most probably increase due to the raise of CO 2 and acidic precipitations [1, 3, 5, 8]. In addition to air pollution, marine aerosol, often wrongly considered as a mere co-factor, is another important degradation factor since it induces surface roughness and crust formation [8]. The nowadays frequency and height of the tides are mainly responsible for enhancing the erosion effects due to water waves and rising damp within the buildings [1]. An emblematic situation is the SOCIETÀ CHIMICA ITALIANA Divisione di Chimica dell’Ambiente e dei Beni Culturali 11 narthex of St. Mark’s Basilica, flooded by tides ≥ + 80 cm SLM, which increased from an average of 43 times/year in 1983 - 1993 to 118 times/year in 2004 - 2014 [9]. 3. Final considerations For better understanding the peculiar situation in Venice in relation to the future climate changes, the integration and implementation of existing database are necessary. In this prospect, the selection of case studies and their monitoring over time should be promoted, together with an accurate research and standardization of old and ancient archive data, often not taken into consideration as not published or promoted by local stakeholders. This contribution will show some of the collected literature data and underline the difficulty of working with old and often not scientifically organised data.
