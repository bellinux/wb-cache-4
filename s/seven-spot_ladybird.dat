The chalcid wasp Aphelinus mali is used as a biological control and this wasp has been deliberately or accidentally introduced into most regions where the woolly apple aphid occurs.

[...] Rootstocks have been developed which convey resistance to the aphids to the roots but they {{do not appear to be}} effective against aerial infestation. Growers have also tried to prevent nfestation by preventing the crawler stage of the nymph from climbing into the crown but these have proven ineffective as aphids can colonise the crown from neighbouring trees. As well as the parasitoid, Alphelinus mali, these aphids are preyed on by the bug Anthocoris nemoralis, ladybirds, hoverfly larvae and lacewings. The presence of earwigs Forficula auricularia on the tress can reduce the levels of aphid infestation, so encouraging these insects by providing shelters may be another means of biological control. Exclsuion experiments in Poland showed that the earwigs, and to a lesser extent the <b>seven-spot</b> <b>ladybird</b> Coccinella septempunctata were important in controlling the numbers of aphids later in the season while in the early Spring the pine ladybird Exochomus quadripustulatus was the main predator on the aphids.

Here we show that microsporidia carried by H.  axyridis can kill A.  bipunctata following the oral uptake of spores, suggesting that their horizontal transmission via intraguild predation may help the invader to outcompete its native competitor. The native <b>seven-spotted</b> <b>ladybird</b> (Coccinella septempunctata) is thought to be less susceptible both to the spread of H.  axyridis and to its microsporidia. To investigate whether the distinct levels of pathogen susceptibility in these three ladybird species are determined by their immune systems, we compared the immunity-related transcriptomes of untreated beetles and beetles challenged with suspensions of bacteria and yeast. We found that H.  axyridis carries three and four times as many genes encoding antimicrobial peptides representing the attacin, coleoptericin and defensin families than C.  septempunctata and A.  bipunctata, respectively. Gene expression studies following the injection of bacteria and yeasts into beetles revealed that members of these three antimicrobial peptide families are also induced more strongly in H.  axyridis than C.  septempunctata or A.  bipunctata.

Force measurements were performed with tethered walking insects, both males and females, on five different substrates: (i) smooth glass plate, (ii) smooth solid Al 2 O 3 (sapphire) disc, and (iii–v) porous Al 2 O 3 discs (anodisc membranes) with the same pore diameter but different porosity. The traction force of beetles ranged from 0. 16 to 16. 59 mN in males and from 0. 32 to 8. 99 mN in females. In both sexes, the highest force values were obtained on smooth solid surfaces, where males showed higher forces than females. On all three porous substrates, forces were significantly reduced in both males and females, and the only difference within these surfaces was obtained between membranes with the highest and lowest porosity. Males produced essentially lower forces than females on porous samples. The reduction in insect attachment on anodisc membranes {{may be explained by}} (i) possible absorption of the secretion fluid from insect adhesive pads by porous media and/or (ii) the effect of surface roughness.

Behaviours assessed were intensive searching, extensive searching, cleaning and stationary. An additional assay considered avoidance by C. septempunctata of mycosed (B. bassiana) C. septempunctata cadavers compared to uninfected C. septempunctata cadavers or in vitro B. bassiana. Experiments were conducted at both summer (20 C) and winter simulated temperatures (4 C).

We therefore modelled the ratios of pairs of behaviours, logarithmically transformed, using recently-developed methods in which trials where a behaviour was not recorded (leading to zero-valued observations) were regarded as censored observations bounded above by an arbitrarily small number. The analysis showed that adult C. septempunctata avoided contact with leaf and soil surfaces inoculated with B. bassiana and mycosed cadavers.

The possible ecological implications of a plant’s response to touch on plant–insect interactions have not been explicitly investigated. We examined whether plant response to 1 min daily touching over a period of 6 days affects host plant acceptance by the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi L. on maize and by the black bean aphid Aphis fabae Scop. on bean, as well as olfactory preference of an aphid predator, <b>seven-spotted</b> <b>ladybird</b> Coccinella septempunctata L. Maize plants responded to touch with significant reduction in plant height, total plant biomass, leaf weight, leaf surface, shoot/ root ratio and specific leaf area (SLA), while bean plants responded with reduced stem height and reduced SLA. Both aphid species showed significantly reduced acceptance of touched plants compared with untouched plants. The two aphid species and male and female ladybirds preferred volatiles from untouched plants over those from touched plants. Volatiles in the headspace of touched and untouched plants were collected and identified. Stepwise discriminant analyses identified (E) -nerolidol and (E) -bcaryophyllene in maize and 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one and an unidentified sesquiterpene in bean as the best discriminating compounds in the volatile profiles of touched plants.

40|$|Prey species often possess defences (e. g. toxins) {{coupled with}} warning signals (i. e. aposematism). There is growing {{evidence}} that the expression of aposematic signals often varies within species and correlates with the strength of chemical defences. This {{has led to the}} speculation that such signals may be 2 ̆ 7 honest 2 ̆ 7, with signal reliability ensured by the costliness of producing or maintaining aposematic traits. We reared larval <b>seven-spot</b> <b>ladybirds</b> (Coccinella septempunctata) on a Low or High aphid diet and measured the effects on warning signal expression (elytral carotenoid pigmentation, conspicuousness, spot size), levels of defensive alkaloids (precoccinelline, coccinelline), and relationships between these traits. High-diet individuals had greater total precoccinelline levels, and elytra carotenoid concentrations at adulthood which was detectable to a typical avian predator. However, larval diet did not significantly affect adult body mass or size, spot size or coccinelline levels. Elytra carotenoid concentrations correlated positively with total precoccinelline levels in both diet groups and sexes. However, the relationship between elytra carotenoid concentrations and total levels of coccinelline depended on sex: in both diet groups, elytra carotenoids and coccinelline levels were positively correlated in females, but negatively correlated in males. Spot size and coccinelline levels correlated positively in Low-diet individuals, but negatively in High-diet individuals. These results point to physiological linkages between components of aposematism, which are modulated by resource (i. e. food) availability and affect the honesty of signals. Developmental diet, but also sex, influenced the relationships between signals and toxin levels. Ladybirds are sexually size dimorphic, and thus in comparison with males, females may be more susceptible to resource limitation and more likely to be honest signallers. Â© 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Predatory ladybirds, {{as natural}} enemies of aphids, can {{influence}} their prey in various ways, for example by consuming them or making the aphids drop {{off from their}} host plants. In this study, I have examined whether aphids can respond to the semiochemicals released from ladybirds. The tritrophic system chosen for my study will be barley plant (Hordeum vulgare L) - aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) and an aphid predator, the <b>seven-spotted</b> <b>ladybird</b> (Coccinella septempunctata L.). In the laboratory experiments, a significant reduction of aphid host acceptance was observed on plant with previously presented ladybirds in comparison with control plants (without ladybirds). Aphid host acceptance was studied using a no-choice settling test. Aphids could respond to tracks left by ladybirds, showing avoidance responses in the choice test. In the olfactory experiments, aphid avoidance responses to volatiles released from ladybird adults and their track were correlated {{to the number of}} ladybirds that had previously been present on the plant. Volatiles released from both ladybird sexes may induce aphid response but aphids responded more intensively to female ladybirds than male. The results from these experiments indicate that aphids can discover the previous presence of ladybirds. Aphids, like parasitoids or competing female ladybirds, can recognize chemical components in the volatiles exuded by ladybirds and show avoidance responses to the places with former presence of predatory ladybirds. Aphid host plant acceptance and aphid settling on the plants were significantly affected by the previous presence of ladybird adults, both sexes. From an applied point of view, it would be very interesting to identify semiochemical components from ladybird tracks and potentially utilize them to reduce aphid population development in the field. This might lead to better biological aphid control and a remarkable reduction in the pesticide use...|$|R

In a field experiment with different barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes in mixed and pure stands, adult <b>seven-spot</b> <b>ladybird</b> Coccinella septempunctata, a polyphagous predator, preferred a specific combination of genotypes over the single genotypes alone before aphids {{had arrived in the}} crop, and again when aphids were emigrating. In laboratory experiments on adult ladybird orientation to odour from barley, ladybirds were attracted/arrested by the mixed odour of the same barley genotype mixture that was preferred in the field. Exposure of one barley genotype to volatiles from the other also caused the odour of the exposed plants to become more attractive to ladybirds. The results support the hypothesis that plant volatiles may attract or arrest foraging adult ladybirds, contributing to the selection of favourable habitats, and they show that within-species plant genotype mixing can shape interactions within multitrophic communities...|$|E

Parasitism rates of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, on broad bean plants, Vicia faba, which had been sprayed with a mixture of the chemicals, were lower than those on control plants.

Specifically the roles of plant semiochemicals in the location of plants infested with M. persicae by these natural enemies were examined. I investigated the olfactory responses of female C. septempunctata to volatiles collected from M. persicae and four Brassica cultivars; Brassica rapa, B. juncea, B. napus cultivar ‘Apex’ and B. napus cultivar ‘Courage’ and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana that were: undamaged, previously infested by M. persicae and infested with M. persicae. C. septempunctata showed no attraction to volatiles from M. persicae alone. C. septempunctata significantly changed its searching behaviour in response to plant volatiles from B. rapa, B. napus cv. ‘Apex’ and Arabidopsis infested with M. persicae. C. septempunctata was also found to display a significant turning bias when foraging on a branching horizontal wire stem. A model was developed to investigate how turning biases affect the foraging efficiency of C. septempunctata in dichotomous branched environments. Simulations using this model indicated that turning biases could potentially increase searching efficiency. D. rapae showed a significant preference for volatiles from M. persicae infested wild-type Arabidopsis but no preference to volatiles from M. persicae alone or M. persicae honeydew. Volatile emissions by Arabidopsis were shown to be localised {{to the area of}} aphid-infestation rather than systemic. Using gas chromatography plants infested with M. persicae were shown to emit a quantitatively different volatile blend than undamaged plants. In experiments with jasmonate mutants of Arabidopsis the jasmonate (octadecanoid) wound response pathway was implicated as being important for the production of M. persicae induced volatiles, attractive to D. rapae.
