40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a novel digital subtraction technique for <b>serial</b> intra-oral <b>radiography,</b> which would allow the detection of subtle variations in grey values. Digital images of the maxilla of a dried human skull and of a fresh pig mandible were acquired using intra-oral photostimulable phosphor plates (Digora FMX, Soredex, Helsinki) with an aluminium calibration stepwedge incorporated in the filmholder. Exposures were made with an X-ray tube for intra-oral radiography (Prostyle Intra, Planmeca, Helsinki). During pilot testing, parameter settings were adapted to reach an optimal contrast. Exposures were repeated within a 1 -week interval to determine the test-retest reliability of the development. After in vitro and in vivo testing, the exposure technique and software development were used to evaluate its applicability in a pilot clinical case. Although parameter settings remained stable during the in vitro studies, the clinical exposures yielded non-linear digital images, thus, not readily suitable for data acquisition and comparison of the regions of interest. To allow further analysis, image processing was carried out using self-developed software for semi-automated linearisation and optimised contrast normalisation. This processing significantly increased the precise quantisation of jawbone density and the assessment of subtle bone density changes in arbitrarily selected regions of interest of in vivo exposures. The clinical applicability of the technique is demonstrated in a pilot case. It was demonstrated that minute densitometric deviations could be detected.

40|$|BackgroundIschemic {{preconditioning}} {{has been}} shown to improve the outcomes of hypoxic tolerance of the heart, brain, lung, liver, jejunum, skin, and muscle tissues. However, to date, no report of ischemic preconditioning on vascularized bone grafts has been published. MethodsSixteen rabbits were divided into four groups with ischemic times of 2, 6, 14, and 18 hours. Half of the rabbits in each group underwent ischemic preconditioning. The osteomyocutaneous flaps consisted of the tibia bone, from which the overlying muscle and skin were raised. The technique of ischemic preconditioning involved applying a vascular clamp to the pedicle for 3 cycles of 10 minutes each. The rabbits then underwent <b>serial</b> plain <b>radiography</b> and computed tomography imaging on the first, second, fourth, and sixth postoperative weeks. Following this, all of the rabbits were sacrificed and histological examinations were performed. ResultsThe results showed that for clinical analysis of the skin flaps and bone grafts, the preconditioned groups showed better survivability. In the plain radiographs, except for two non-preconditioned rabbits with intraoperative ischemic times of 6 hours, all began to show early callus formation at the fourth week. The computed tomography findings showed more callus formation in the preconditioned groups for all of the ischemic times except for the 18 -hour group. The histological findings correlated with the radiological findings. There was no statistical significance in {{the difference between the two}} groups.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the radiographic and scintigraphic courses of union in cervical interbody fusion using hydroxyapatite (HA) grafts or iliac bone autografts. Methods: Twelve patients under-went both <b>serial</b> plain <b>radiography</b> and bone scintigraphy during the 12 mo after surgery. Serial plain radiographs were obtained every month {{until the end of}} the study period. Bone scintigrams with 99 mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) were ob-tained at 2 wk and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 mo. Uptake of 99 mTc-HMDP in the graft was expressed as a ratio of the counts in the graft to those in the axis. Results: In the HA graft group, the plain radiographs of all patients showed a radiolucent stripe that disappeared 7. 3 6 1. 5 (mean 6 SD) months after surgery. In the autograft group, a radiolucent stripe around the graft was not seen for any patient, and union was confirmed by follow-up radiographs within 6 mo after surgery. The serial changes in the 99 mTc-HMDP uptake ratio showed no difference between the 2 groups. The 99 mTc-HMDP uptake ratio peaked 1 mo after surgery and decreased rapidly to a plateau within 2 mo. Conclusion: In the HA graft group, despite the presence of a radiolucent stripe around the graft for more than 6 mo, the scintigraphic course of union was not different from that in the autograft group. The likelihood is that the presence of a radiolucent stripe around the HA graft in the early months after surgery is not always a sign of pseudoarthrosis.

40|$|Object. Hydroxyapatite cement (HAC) is {{used with}} {{increasing}} frequency by craniofacial surgeons for building facial and skull base structures and by neurosurgeons for cranioplasty. Failures of HAC in cranioplasty {{have been attributed to}} breakage due to subjacent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsations through the dura mater. The authors describe a technique that involves inserting a resorbable MacroPore perforated plate to dampen CSF pulsations and then pouring HAC over the plate to fill a cranial defect and complete skull contouring. Methods. Fifteen children ranging in age from 2 to 9. 5 years were included in the study; the size of the skull defects in these patients ranged from 6. 25 to 42. 5 cm 2, with a mean of 20. 65 cm 2. Patients in whom the combined MacroPore-HAC devices were implanted underwent follow-up examinations that included <b>serial</b> skull <b>radiography</b> and computerized tomography scans. No fractures of the implants were demonstrated. At 6 months postsurgery, small fingerlings of new bone growth appeared in the underside of the HAC plate, probably spanning from the dura through perforations in the MacroPore plate. At intervals ranging from 18 months to 20 years after implantation, the gaps between cranial bone edges and that the HAC began to blur, culminating in the complete bonding of host bone with the margin of the HAC plate. All implants remained radiopaque and maintained size, thickness, and shape. Conclusions. The findings of this study are promising and indicate that the combined use of HAC and a bioresorbable undercarriage that is osteoconductive, such as the MacroPore perforated plate, may produce a versatile and lasting cranioplasty in children. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Background: Congenital lobar em-physema is {{an illness}} {{characterized}} by an overdisten-tion of one or sometimes two lobes of the lung. The term 'lobar emphysema' {{is in fact a}} misnomer. In this lesion, the walls of the pulmonary alveoli are not de-stroyed; instead a ball-valve mechanism leads to bronchial obstruction. The causes of this obstruction include reduced bronchial cartilage, bronchial carti-lage dysplasia, inflammatory processes, thick sputum, bronchial mucosal webs, bronchial stenosis, and the pressure exerted by the vasculature on the bronchus. Most cysts develop in the upper lobe of the left lung, but both lobes of the left lung were involved in the present case. Case Report: A male infant with a birth weight of 1400 g was born through cesarean section due to twin pregnancy. Due to prematurity and respiratory dis-tress, and with the diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease, treatment with surfactant was initiated for him. Patient weaned from the ventilator after 4 days, but was again connected to because of oxygen re-quirement. Breath sounds on the left gradually de-creased, and heart sounds were heard better on the right. Chest radiography showed primary radiolu-cency due to fluid retention in the lungs followed by a gradual emphysema appearance and mediastinal shift to the right and lung herniation to the opposite side in the form of double shadow. The respiratory problems got worse gradually. Therefore, the intra-tracheal tube was moved to the right to improve res-piration. Radiological signs were noticeable in <b>serial</b> chest <b>radiographies.</b> Surgical consultation was done for the patient, one month after the appearance of symptoms. Finally the patient underwent a thora-cotomy with the diagnosis of left lobar emphysema. Since both lungs were affected, total thoracotomy was done and pathology examination later confirmed the diagnosis of lobar emphysema. No concomitant abnormality was observed in this case...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nature of intrinsic musculo-skeletal adaptations resulting from experimental alteration of the orofacial environment. A new occlusal configuration was devised which modified oral sensory stimuli, subsequently prompting anterior positioning of the mandible of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during functional jaw movements at four defined stages of maturation. Specific skeletal, dental, and neuromuscular adaptations were studied and interrelated by means of serial electromyography, <b>serial</b> cephalometric <b>radiography</b> with metallic implants, and microscopic analysis. The study was divided into two time periods. During the 13 -week control period, normal growth data were gathered from the four age groups. During the 13 -week experimental period, specific neuromuscular and skeletal alterations caused by the experimental conditions were identified. Postural activity in the muscles of mastication and presumably the postural position of the mandible were altered by the induced changes in the oral environment. The superior head of the lateral pterygoid gradually increased in activity, first during functional movements and then during the maintenance of mandibular postural position. The superior head appeared to function as a principal forward positioner of the mandible. This activity decreased or disappeared by the end of the experiment. At the end of the experimental period, ten of the twelve experimental monkeys demonstrated an anteroposterior alteration in molar relationship. No single adaptive process could be isolated and identified as the sole cause of any effective alteration in maxillomandibular relationship at any age level. Rather, each resulting relationship was the composite of specific complementary (and occasionally antagonistic) adaptations throughout the craniofacial complex. Mandibular skeletal adaptations occurred primarily in the infant and juvenile animals in which the extent and direction of growth at the condyle were altered. Dentitional adjustments in the mandible were most notable in the adolescent and adult animals. In the nasomaxillary area a decrease in the vertical displacement of the maxillary complex was noted in all but three of the experimental animals. Horizontal displacement of the maxillary complex and the drift pattern of the maxillary dentition were also affected, but the expression of this effect was variable. After 13 weeks, little histologic evidence of physiologic or pathologic responses to the induced protrusive function was evident in the sacrificed animals. These histologic findings were consistent with past studies which suggest that the adult temporomandibular joint was stable and resistant while the growing articulation was responsive to functional changes. The results of this study further indicated that a chronologic correlation existed between the occurrence and disappearance of altered neuromuscular function and the re-establishment of skeletal balance. As skeletal balance was restored through specific structural adaptations, the need for compensatory muscle function was reduced. Further, the nature and extent of the specific skeletal and dental adaptations depended upon the level of maturation of the animal...|$|R

A Bihapro stem was implanted in 23 patients (with {{a mean age of}} 60. 9 years) and a Citation stem in 13 patients (with a mean age of 59. 7 years). All patients underwent <b>serial</b> <b>radiography</b> of the affected hip (follow-up time: 12 months). Baseline periprosthetic and overall BMD were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) 1 week and 12 months after hip replacement. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined according to Gruen's system (ROIs 1 - 7). RESULTS: All stems were classified as radiographically stable. Bone ongrowth (spot welds) was present in zones 1 and 2 in all patients with the Bihapro stem. The distribution of baseline densities was very similar in the two groups of patients. In Bihapro implants a significant increment of mineralisation was present in ROI 1 after 1 year; ROIs 2 to 7 showed no density variation. The following observations were made regarding the Citation implants: no increment in density was shown in ROI 1; the differences in densities among the ROIs were significant after 1 year in the global evaluation (p = 0. 004); the comparison between the single ROIs showed decalcification in ROIs 2 and 7 and a density increment in ROI 5.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate {{the reliability of}} the integrated Shape Imaging System scan (Oxford Metrics Ltd, Oxford, UK) in detecting progression of scoliosis and the use of back shape data in predicting scoliosis progression. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: At first presentation and every 3 - 6 months during the follow-up period, all patients underwent integrated Shape Imaging System scans and radiographic examinations, from which the Cobb angle was measured. The follow-up period was 18 - 49 months (mean = 31. 4 months). METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity and progression of the Cobb angle. The spinal fusion, brace, and observation groups were compared using analysis of variance and the student's t test to detect significant differences among groups in the progression of deformity as measured by the integrated Shape Imaging System parameters and the Cobb angle. RESULTS: Three of the Integrated Shape Imaging System parameters detected significant progression in the spinal fusion group 1 year earlier than the Cobb angle. Only one of the Integrated Shape Imaging System parameters detected a significant difference in progression between the brace and observation groups. CONCLUSIONS: The Integrated Shape Imaging System technique demonstrated significant changes in this group of patients with progressive scoliosis. Serial measurements of back surface shape, particularly the size of the rib hump, may be predictive of progression.

40|$|Gross facial bone {{destruction}} following trigeminal rhizotomy by G. HURST, (Leeds) It {{is widely}} recognized that trigeminal nerve sectioning {{is complicated by}} a distressing paraesthesia in the anaesthetic area. In a series of 382 patients who underwent trigeminal rhizotomy, 213 (55. 7 per cent) developed unpleasant 'crawling ' and 'drawing ' sensations (Peet and Schneider, 1952). Such patients are also prone to a crescent-shaped area of nasal ulceration which may spread to involve the cheek and upper lip, termed the trigeminal trophic syndrome (Finlay, 1979). Case History A 48 -year-old female presented in 1968 with a ten-year history of right facial pain, due to trigeminal neuralgia. She subsequently under-went right retro-Gasserian trigeminal rhizotomy, with sectioning of all three divisions and the motor root, in 1969. Initially the patient did well, but the following year she was noted to have ulceration of the right nasal mucosa and a perforated nasal septum. This progressed, neces-sitating plastic surgery in 1972. The following year, destruction of the right lateral wall of the nasal cavity was visible radiographically (Fig. 1). Over the following seven years she suffered two episodes of bacterial meningitis, gradually worsening facial disfigurement and shrinkage, and blindness of the right eye, necessitating enuclea-tion. The trigeminal sensory loss remained unilateral. <b>Serial</b> <b>radiography</b> revealed progres-sive right-sided bone destruction. During this time, investigations revealed a variably elevated E. S. R., but persistently negative serological tests for syphilis and no histological evidence of vasculitis or neoplasia. However, lethal midline granuloma was suspected on clinical grounds and steroid treat-ment commenced in 1972, although the patient's continuing survival made this unlikely. In 1980 she finally admitted to persistent scratching with her finger, inside the right nasal cavity, because of an irresistible itching sensa-tion.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elaborate}} a model in the rat permitting analysis of bone modeling to correct fracture deformity. Among conceivable regulators of this process, the study focused on the peripheral nervous system by analyzing markers of regenerating (GAP- 43), mature (PGP 9. 5) and sensory (CGRP) nerve fibers at the fracture site. CGRP has been suggested to be a potent promotor of bone formation through stimulation of osteoblasts and inhibition of osteoclasts. A total of 113 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups with tibial fracture and one control group with intact tibia. Mid-shaft fracture was produced by three-point manual bending and fixed with an intramedullary nail in either straight alignment, posterior (31 degrees) or anterior angulation (27 degrees), thereby creating a convex and a concave side of the diaphyseal fracture in the two latter groups. Fracture heating and modeling were assessed by <b>serial</b> <b>radiography,</b> histology, immunohistochemistry and bone mineral uptake studies.

Radiography showed that the fracture callus rapidly became greater on the concave side compared to the convex in both the anterior and posterior angulation group. The callus thickness reached a peak at day 21 post fracture and from day 21 to 35 it decreased significantly on the convex side reflecting resorption. Complete fracture healing was observed at day 35. Analysis of the fracture angulation over time showed that it was corrected from 27 to 11 degreesmost of which was achieved already during the first 21 days after fracture. The adaptive changes in the proximal growth plate resulted in an 8 degrees correctional tilt of the epiphysis. In contrast to previous reports, our findings clearly reflect that most spontaneous correction of angular fracture deformity occurs in the diaphysis instead of the growth plate and notably, quite early during healing, not afterwards. This was confirmed by bone mineral uptake studies showing intense mineralization, i. e., bone formation, from day 7 to 35 on the concave side of the fracture, while on the convex side bone resorption predominated. Site-specific differences in local bone turnover, e. g., to correct angular fracture deformity, may prove to be orchestrated by the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, neuronal immunohistochemistry was applied to the tissues. Fracture of tibia was found to elicit a tremendous increase in nerve immunoreactivity. GAP- 43 and CGRP positive nerve fibers were detected already on day 3 in the fracture hematoma, between day 7 and 14 also in avascular fibrocartilaginous callus and woven bone. The first PGP 9. 5 fibers were seen on day 7. Semi-quantitative analysis showed a peak in neuronal CGRP immunoreactivity on day 21 representing a 38 fold increase in anterior angulation fracture and 27 fold increase in straight alignment fracture as compared to intact tibia. Comparison of the two opposing sides of anterior angulation fracture, disclosed a significant increase in CGRP immunoreactivity on the concave side coinciding with the inflammatory and early modeling phase of healing. In conclusion, angular tibial fracture in the rat elicits site-specific differences in bone formation and bone resorption within the same bone. Correction of fracture deformity by modeling occurs early, concomitantly with healing. The model proposed offers new possibilities to analyse pertinent regulators of local bone turnover. The occurrence of the "bone promoting" neuropeptide CGRP is strongly increased in fracture healing and modeling. The overwhelming predominance of CGRP nerve fibers on the concave side compared to the convex side in angular fracture suggests an important role of the peripheral nervous system in correcting diaphyseal fracture deformity by modeling...|$|E
