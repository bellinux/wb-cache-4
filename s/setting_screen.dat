40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} opportunities to safely turn off frequently overridden drug-drug interaction alerts (DDIs) in computerized physician order entry (CPOE). Design: Quantitative retrospective analysis of drug safety alerts overridden during 1 month and qualitative interviews with 24 respondents (18 physicians and 6 pharmacists) about turning off frequently overridden DDI alerts, based on the Dutch drug database, in a hospital <b>setting.</b> <b>Screen</b> shots and complete texts of frequently overridden DDIs were presented to physicians of internal medicine, cardiology, and surgery and to hospital pharmacists who were asked whether these could be turned off hospital-wide without impairing patient safety, {{and the reasons for}} their recommendations. Results: Data on the frequency of alerts overridden in 1 month identified 3, 089 overrides, of which 1, 963 were DDIs. The category DDIs showed 86 different alerts, of which 24 frequently overridden alerts, accounting for 72 % of all DDI overrides, were selected for further evaluation. The 24 respondents together made 576 assessments. Upon investigation, differences in the reasons for turning off alerts were found across medical specialties and among respondents within a specialty. Frequently mentioned reasons for turning off were "alert well known," "alert not serious," or "alert not needing (additional) action," or that the effects of the combination were monitored or intended. For none of the alerts did all respondents agree that it could be safely turned off hospital-wide. The highest agreement was 13 of 24 respondents (54 %). A positive correlation was found between the number of alerts overridden and the number of clinicians recommending to turn them off. Conclusion: Although the Dutch drug database is already a selected reduction from all DDIs mentioned in literature, the majority of respondents wanted to turn off DDI alerts to reduce alert overload. Turning off DDI alerts hospital-wide appeared to be problematic because of differences among physicians regarding drug-related knowledge and of differences across the hospital in routine drug monitoring practices. Furthermore, several reasons for suppression of alerts could be questioned from a safety perspective. Further research should investigate when each of the following might help: changes in alert texts; new differential alert triggers based on clinician knowledge or specialty; and nonintrusive alert presentation so long as serum levels and patient parameters are measured and stay within limits...|$|E

50|$|By using <b>sets</b> of <b>screens</b> and cuts, this 2-1-2 {{formation}} can be maneuvered into a 1-3-1 formation, {{with the}} ball-handler on the wing. Once in position, the {{player in the}} low post (the second cutter) will <b>set</b> a <b>screen</b> for the ball-handler (the first cutter). The first cutter quickly passes {{the ball to the}} player on top at the perimeter (the fourth cutter), and then, depending on how the defense react, makes a cut to the basket either down the base line or over the top from the free throw line. Meanwhile, the fourth cutter will pass the ball to the player on the other wing (the fifth player), and quickly go down to the free throw lane and <b>set</b> a <b>screen</b> for the second cutter. The second cutter then make another cut across the free throw line. After the first two cuts are clear, the player in the middle at the free throw lane (the third cutter), who have been <b>setting</b> double <b>screens</b> for the previous two cuts, will now fake a step towards the basket and then break off to the top {{on the side of the}} circle, and the fourth cutter will go to the wing position initially taken by the first cutter. Note that at this point the players are again in the original 1-3-1 formation, except flipped to the other side.|$|R
