5|$|In 1360 {{the king}} {{conducted}} {{an inquiry into}} Southampton's defences and in 1363 he established a wider commission to examine how best to improve them. The commission came {{to a number of}} conclusions: the town walls <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> maintained and kept clear of housing and other obstructions; the number of gateways in the walls should be reduced; and a water-filled ditch should be built to further reinforce the walls on the west. The enquiry also concluded that the outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing the sea should be filled in to form a more defensible line.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better,</b> as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E

25|$|The {{conservative}} English authors Frances Trollope (1779–1863) and Elizabeth Gaskell (1810–65) both {{thought that}} women <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> educated {{so they would}} be less dependent on men. Trollope thought that financially secure women should go beyond providing moral education to their children, and should express in public their maternal values, social concerns and caring outlook. Her novels repeatedly show how a young heroine can improve a corrupt society through her moral influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a physician's recommendation for the HPV vaccine also contributes to low vaccination rates and controversy surrounding the vaccine. A 2015 study of national physician communication {{and support for the}} HPV vaccine found physicians routinely recommend HPV vaccines less strongly than they recommend Tdap or meningitis vaccines, find the discussion about HPV to be long and burdensome, and discuss the HPV vaccine last, after all other vaccines. Researchers suggest these factors discourage patients and parents from setting up timely HPV vaccines. In order to increase vaccination rates, this issue must be addressed and physicians <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> trained to handle discussing the importance of the HPV vaccine with patients and their families.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{experts are}} advocating that the U.S. federal {{government}} launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics, strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation economic development initiatives, especially to strengthen regional clusters. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program {{would also be}} targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating {{in such areas as}} precision manufacturing, information technology, and clean energy, other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt, carbon footprint, and oil dependence. The U.S. Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative. In addition, federal grants in R, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to Japan, Finland, South Korea, and Switzerland in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> procured to metropolitan areas, the essential engines of the American economy.|$|E

500|$|Blaine's cornea {{was deeply}} {{scratched}} {{in the incident}} and he needs surgery. The club wants revenge on Sebastian; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton, but Will asks them to let the system handle it. Artie (Kevin McHale) refuses: he is fed up with being told it will get better and says it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> now, and leaves. Despite wanting revenge, Kurt is unwilling to use violence, so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about {{the composition of the}} damaging slushie. He challenges her to a duel: the song [...] "Smooth Criminal". He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt, and hits her with an unadulterated one. Santana secretly recorded the encounter, and plays her evidence to New Directions, who in turn invite the Warblers to their auditorium, show them that they [...] "get" [...] Jackson better by performing [...] "Black or White", and reveal to the Warblers the proof that Sebastian deliberately tried to injure one of them.|$|E
500|$|Aside from this, however, Madonna {{also wanted}} to explore the British club musical scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. In such a way, she decided to work with several European {{producers}} and composers within the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his [...] "very European sensibility". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, sessions started {{taking place in the}} Chappell Studios of Encino, California. Björk accepted the offer to write a track for Madonna's album, and wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious". Once the song demo had been finished, Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called [...] "Bedtime Story", which became the album's third single. Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, felt that the album's title was a pun; [...] " [...] is referring to (possible erotic) stories told at bedtime (in bed). In a way (the album) is really a book of stories you can tell your kids at bedtime [...] sexuality explained to children [...] Madonna has always thought that children <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> informed in that aspect".|$|E

Having composed her first poem, in German, {{at the age of}} four, she continued her education in Dorset and Surrey and began writing poetry in English.

In 1995, he was also given control of a regular monthly comic, Jim Lee's WildC.A.T.S., starting with issue No. 21, which he would continue to write for fourteen issues. The series followed two groups of superheroes, one of which is on a spaceship headed back to its home planet, and one of which remains on Earth. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin was critical of the run, feeling {{that it was one of}} Moore's worst, and that [...] "you feel Moore <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than this.
