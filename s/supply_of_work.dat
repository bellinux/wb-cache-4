Her collaboration with Ms. Walker provided an opportunity for her to write music for Batman: The Animated Series at Warner Bros. Studios.

40|$|The author finds {{evidence}} of a downward-sloping labor supply curve for urban areas in Peru from cross-sectional household data for 2002 and pooled data for available years from 1985 to 2000. Individuals respond to lower hourly earnings {{with an increase in}} the quantity <b>supplied</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> hours. This behavior would help to explain the increasing trend in average work hours in Peru (this average for male workers in Lima, the capital city, rose from 50. 5 to 53. 9 weekly hours between 1985 and 2000; meanwhile, 33. 4 % of workers had weekly schedules above 60 hours in 2002). Another finding is the increase in hours supplied due to pressure from the more numerous cohorts recently entering the Peruvian labor market. Copyright � 2008 The Author.

Miller and Son had successfully reprinted American comic book company Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr stories in the U.K. However, in 1953 Fawcett were party to a protracted lawsuit brought by National Comics (now DC Comics) claiming plagiarism of their Superman character. Fawcett cancelled their Captain Marvel titles, leaving Leonard Miller without reprint material for their best-selling British titles. Miller approached Mick Anglo to create an replacement; [...] "One day Leonard Miller phoned and {{said he wanted to}} see me urgently. His supply of the American material for the Captain Marvel series had suddenly been cut off. Had I any ideas? ... So I quickly told him I had plenty of ideas, and for my trouble I received a regular <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for the next six years." [...] Anglo replaced the Captain Marvel family with almost identical characters, Marvelman, Young Marvelman, and Kid Marvelman. In the six years between the relaunch of Captain Marvel Adventures as Marvelman from issue #25 (February 3, 1954) and Anglo leaving L. Miller in 1960, he was responsible for scripting 736 issues of Marvelman, Marvelman Family and Young Marvelman the [...] "best-loved and best-known British superhero" [...] and the longest-running British superhero. Gaining further mileage from the Marvelman material, in 1954 Anglo wrote one issue of Captain Universe for Arnold Books, a near-identical character to Captain Marvel and Marvelman.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} labor supply when {{tax evasion}} is an option, using a discrete choice model on pooled Norwegian survey data from 1980 and 2001. Direct labor supply elasticities, conditional on sectors, {{are in the}} range of 0. 2 - 0. 4. The elasticities are higher for work that is not registered for taxation, than for registered work. Overall wage increases {{have a positive impact on}} the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> registered <b>work</b> and a negative impact on <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> unregistered <b>work.</b> In addition to economic factors such as wages and tax rates, also social norms and opportunities for tax evasion at the work place have an impact on the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> unregistered labor. The model is used to simulate the impact on labor <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> changes in the tax structure, such as the lowering of marginal tax rates. The fraction of the population who did unreported work was reduced from 1980 to 2001. Lower and less progressive tax rates after 1980 have contributed to this reduction. Although taxes matter for <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> both reported and non-reported labor, the impact is not strong. Social norms and opportunities for tax evasion at the work place are also important in explaining the change. Labor supply; tax evasion; survey data; microeconometrics...|$|R
