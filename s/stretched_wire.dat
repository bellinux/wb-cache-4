25|$|The {{drift tube}} (DT) system {{measures}} muon {{positions in the}} barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a <b>stretched</b> <b>wire</b> within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) {{as well as by}} calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon’s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2m x 2.5m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.|$|E

50|$|Working area: Working {{area is the}} plastically {{deforming}} {{area for}} drawing materials. Length and cone angle are the two factors for the working performance of this area. If the working area is too short, excessive pressure to the working area will be generated by the metal stretched. For the above reason, the tensile stress increased significantly, resulting in the accelerated wear of the mold. The principles for {{the selection of the}} length of the working area are as follows: a. The working area used for <b>stretching</b> soft metal <b>wire</b> is shorter than the working area used for stretching hard metal wire; b. The working area used for <b>stretching</b> metal <b>wire</b> with small diameter is shorter than the working area used for <b>stretching</b> metal <b>wire</b> with a large diameter; c.The working area worked under the condition of wet lubrication is shorter than the working area worked under the condition of dry lubrication. As for the taper angle, the taper angle is smaller when stretching steel, while the cone angle should be larger when stretching non-ferrous metals and its alloys.|$|R

5000|$|When a <b>stretched</b> <b>wire</b> string {{is excited}} into motion by {{plucking}} or striking, a complex wave travels outward {{to the ends}} of the string. As it travels outward, this initial impulse forces the wire out of its resting position all along its length. After the impulse has passed, each part of the wire immediately begins to return toward (and overshoot) its resting position, which means vibration has been induced. Meanwhile, the initial impulse is reflected at both ends of the string and travels back toward the center. On the way, it interacts with the various vibrations it induced on the initial pass, and these interactions reduce or cancel some components of the impulse wave and reinforce others. When the reflected impulses encounter each other, their interaction again cancels some components and reinforces others.http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/ ...|$|E

5000|$|Stretched octaves {{are caused}} by the physics of {{standing}} waves in a <b>stretched</b> <b>wire.</b> The pitch of each overtone produced by a piano string {{is determined by the}} ratio of the string's restoring force (expressed as a spring constant), divided by its mass per unit length. In an ideal piano string, the only restoring force would be due to the tension in the string. In practice, piano strings are made from high-carbon steel, which is stiff. Young's modulus of the string steel (tempered high-carbon steel) is what defines the stiffness and does not change with the temper. The stiffness adds an extra restoring force to each string; the amount of this extra force depends on the amount of bend being induced in the string. Higher normal modes bend the string more, inducing more stiffness-related force and sharpening the pitch of the resulting overtone.|$|E
