50|$|The Terminal 3 spans 1.2 {{kilometers}} and {{the apron}} {{is able to}} serve 40 aircraft. When finished, T3 will be an aerotropolis terminal. Terminal 3 {{will be able to}} serve 60 airplanes from the current 40 airplanes.The terminal will serve 25 million international passengers each year. When the terminal becomes fully operational,the airport authority expects to connect 70 international destinations, up from the current 30.This is a modern terminal specifically designed to cater as a transit point for international airlines. Spanning 422,804 sq m, the new terminal is slightly larger than Changi Airport's Terminal 3. It has 10 gates for international flights and 18 for domestic, 206 check-in counters, 38 <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> and 12 bag drop counters, 48 aerobridges, two four-star hotels, meeting rooms, duty-free shops, retail outlets, restaurants and multi-storey carparks.Total area of the main building of new terminal 3 is about 331,101m2, the parking building 85,578 m2 and the VVIP passengers building 6,124 m2. The check-in area of the terminal is arranged in the form of eight clusters.

50|$|As of January 2016, new {{concourse}} extensions {{adjacent to}} the current terminal building are under construction. The construction is projected to increase the overall size of the passenger terminal to 225,000 m2. The extensions are opened in stages in 2012-2014. In May 2015, the new extension of terminal A (the main building) was finished, which contains new offices, an airport lounge and new passport control desks, and it differs by design compared to other terminal parts. When completed, the second segment of a new passenger terminal will be {{twice the size of}} Terminal 5 at London Heathrow - the equivalent of 61 football fields. New premises area of 235,000 sq. meters (2,529,000 ft1) (segment T2) will be mounted to the left wing of the existing terminal. There will be about 100 check-in counters, 40 <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> kiosk, as well as special jetways for the world's largest passenger aircraft Airbus A380. As a result, the total area of the passenger terminal (including the expansion of the current main segment T1) will increase by more than double to nearly 500,000 square meters. It was designed by British company RMJM and uses the under-the-roof concept, which means that passengers from all flights will be serviced within a single terminal. One of Europe's largest air hubs - Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport - operates under this concept. The complete construction will be complete by March 2018. All concourses will remain connected and plan to increase the efficiency of the airport operations and passenger connections by using ICAO and IATA transfer technologies. Moreover, under the construction plans the new parking space is included, which will allow to accommodate under 1500 cars. The parking space is due to finish this year.Currently, the part of the airport terminal, which used as the entrance to Aeroexpress platform, is under reconstruction, the old platform is demolished and shifted into the new one, with a temporary terminal, which will work during the reconstruction process. This is done to connect two parking sectors: major and {{on the right side of}} the railway line; and to form another exit, direct from the baggage claim at domestic arrivals. Moreover, the path to the Aeroexpress platform is planned to be underground. This will allow to form the perspective project of the new terminal, construction of which is planned to commence in 2020.|$|E
40|$|As {{more and}} more {{airlines}} have introduced technology-based <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> services, {{it has become increasingly}} important to understand the factors affecting airline passengers' attitudes toward this new form of check-in services and also their intentions, especially from Asian passengers' perspectives. An empirical study was conducted among Taiwanese airline passengers using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as the basic research model while considering additional factors for further analysis such as external stimuli, perceived service quality, perceived behavioral control, need for service, and perceived risk. The findings revealed that attitude and external stimuli best explain passengers' behavioral intentions to use the kiosks, whereas perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have little effect on their intentions. These findings suggest that airlines in Taiwan should persuade passengers to acquire a more positive attitude toward the new check-in kiosks and should consider implementation of incentive strategies in encouraging passengers to adopt the <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> service.

40|$|Due to {{maintain}} {{the flow of the}} check-in process of air passengers, it is essential that services that ensure this process have been carried as quickly and effectively. One of the major current problems in this area is the efficiency of clearance {{of a large number of}} passengers over the check-in counters. By the gradual development of so-called <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> services eventually delegate some activities in check-in process to passengers and the entire clearance process to speed up. In this article the authors deal with current state of the use of <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> services in the world and predict the expected evolution of these services in the future. Subsequently, the authors present a new design of self-service kiosk and graphical user interface (GUI) of application such self-service check-in kiosk based on the analysis of the functions and features of similar solutions available on the market and with considering all currently known IATA requirements and the criteria relating to disabled passengers in order to lighten the load check-in counters and thereby accelerated the clearance of the passenger at the airport. The aim of the authors was to create a cost competitive solution offering such new features and services that do not offer other solutions, with an emphasis on improving the efficiency of the check-in process of passengers at the airport. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} hospitality {{service industry}} is changing {{with the introduction}} of new self-service technologies (SSTs) and their rapid adoption by customers. Examples of SSTs include hotel reservation websites, <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> kiosks and mobile telephone service applications. The introduction of these electronic channels for communication with customers offers further opportunities for customer relationship management if customers choose to interact with them. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the customer decision-making processes and underlying motivations for SST usage in multi-channel hospitality service environments. The data collection method employed was short qualitative interviews with 133 passengers at the departure area of an international airport. The findings contribute to an understanding of how and why customers use SSTs, which is critical from an eCRM perspective, in that many sectors of the hospitality industry may encourage or indeed require customers to use SSTs. As a result, this element of chosen/forced usage may have a huge impact on the user-company relationship...|$|E
40|$|With today’s airline system {{operating}} with record load factors, {{the consequences of}} traveling customers having an inconvenient experience has become a sensitive area for air carriers in maintaining a competitive advantage. Even though considerable {{progress has been made}} with <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> procedures for customers, the procedures that airline employees have to accomplish for patrons to traverse the airport and, finally, obtain a seat on the aircraft are numerous and time consuming. At Purdue University, the Aviation Technology Graduate Operational Assessment and Improvement class developed a gap analysis of present processes and what could be obtained with existing technology and process enhancement. This analysis focused on customer and baggage check-in procedures from arrival at the airport to aircraft entry at the gate. What resulted from this study was the realization that large reductions in process times could be achieved and customer service benefits obtained with the elimination of non-value tasks through customer self-use of existing technology and task reductions, such as RFID and biometric equipment. The study also indicated that a large portion of customer check-in could be accomplished with no contact or interaction with airline customer representatives, strengthening the concept of improvement in customer satisfaction and increased service levels...|$|E
40|$|With an {{increasing}} investment in self service technologies, companies have {{the possibilities to}} realize industrialization of service offerings. That means companies could satisfy customers at a lower cost. But before companies can benefit from self-service technologies, the willingness of customers to try out and adopt technology-based self-service (TBSS) should be questioned since such a service option requires many efforts from customers and changes their behaviour and habit to some extend. The purpose {{of this research is}} to contribute to understanding customers’ adoption behaviour of TBSS. Based on a classic adoption theory and extant TBSS researches, the research purpose is realized by investigating the customers’ different adoption behaviour and how they relate to innovation attributes, customer characteristics and situational factors. This research is mainly a descriptive and explanatory research based on the literature reviews. Exploratory research has also been included in the pilot study in order to refine the conceptual framework and questionnaire. Qualitative approach was mainly used in pilot study and quantitative approach was mainly used in later empirical study for a case setting as the <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> service at airports. 96 samples of respondents were interviewed based on the questionnaire. Data analysis is mainly based on the quantitative results, supported by the qualitative information and literature reviews. A lot of findings were produced by this research. Three distinct stages in the customer adoption process, namely avoid using, trial and repeat using, are very important to understand customers’ adoption behaviour of TBSS. Relative advantages, easy to use and control were found as important innovation attributes relate to different adoption behaviour. Need for avoiding interaction and consumption rate were found to be important factors among customer characteristics. Finally in terms of situational factors, relative length of waiting lines at alternative check-ins and whether the environment is crowded are important factors to affect customers’ adoption behaviour.

40|$|The {{growth of}} new {{innovative}} technologies in service delivery and increasing labor costs make service providers {{to think about}} new service delivery options which allow customers to serve themselves as an alternative way. These new services potentially offer consumers round-the-clock access to services, including during emergencies. These kinds of new services are known as Technology-Based Self-service delivery (TBSS). TBSS delivery is classified into two category of services which are on-site (at firms site) and off-site service (at customer home/place) : the customer's interaction with the technology can be direct or indirect. This research {{will focus on the}} on-site TBSS with direct interaction between the customer and technology: this thesis attempts to investigate and analysis the factors that influence intention to adopt <b>self</b> <b>check-in</b> machines (kiosks) from the Iranian flight passengers point of view. In order to achieve our objective a famous attitudinal model has been chosen which has two parts, the core model and the moderating variables: the core model includes attitudes toward TBSS which has three determinants (performance, ease of use and fun) and then attitudes influence the intention to use TBSS. The moderating variables are divided into two groups, customer traits (self-efficacy, inherent novelty seeking, need for interaction, self-consciousness) and situational factors (waiting time and social anxiety). This research will study on the relationships between the core model constructs and the moderating variables effects on the relationships within the core attitudinal model for TBSS. The measures and hypotheses were analyzed using LISREL technique. The results showed that in the core model performance and ease of use factors influence the attitudes, but the fun factor was not significant: also attitudes significantly influence the intention to use TBSS. The results of moderators indicate that marketers should promote the performance or reliability of TBSS when the target passengers are likely to have either one or all of following characteristics: 1) high self-efficacy, 2) high inherent novelty seeking, 3) Low need for interaction, 4) high self-consciousness. Also marketers should promote ease of use of their TBSS if their target passengers are likely to have either one or all of following characteristics: 1) Low self-efficacy, 2) Low inherent novelty seeking, 3) High need for interaction, 4) Low self-consciousness: and also when it is expected to have high waiting time and crowded environment. Finally in order to have un-crowded environment and decrease the waiting time the reliability (performance) and ease of use aspects of TBSS should be highly considered in the service design.
