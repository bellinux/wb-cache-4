5|$|Treaties {{with the}} Maasai in 1904 and 1911 {{forced them to}} give up all of their {{northern}} grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized {{and some of the}} land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the game, ABC {{requested}} {{that it be}} rescheduled from 5:00p.m. to 8:00p.m. Eastern Time, {{so that it could}} be broadcast live in primetime hours. However, the request was declined by the IIHF, after the Soviets complained that it would cause the game to air at 4a.m. Moscow Time, as opposed to 1a.m. Moscow Time. As a result, ABC decided not to broadcast the game live for the U.S. audience, and tape delayed it for broadcast during its primetime block of Olympics coverage instead. Before the game aired, ABC's Olympics host Jim McKay openly stated that the game had already occurred, but that they had promised not to spoil its results. In order to accommodate coverage of the men's slalom competition, portions of the game were also edited for time. To this day <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> watched the game on television still believe that it was live.|$|E

500|$|The {{field of}} 34 drivers {{was the biggest}} in an IndyCar series race in 14 years. A typical oval track race has six to eight fewer drivers, except for the Indianapolis 500, which {{normally}} has a 33-car field. ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote: [...] "Obviously more cars presents more danger. They wanted {{a whole lot of}} cars cause obviously this is their season finale and they wanted it to be a big deal. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> were driving in this event yesterday had no business being in it. Some of them had never driven on a track like this. That was a mistake". Chris Powell, president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, defended the race, saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing. He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event, none of those concerns had been raised with him.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. Records premiered {{the final}} mix of [...] "Ghost" [...] for {{streaming}} on December 10, 2013, {{and the song}} became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a [...] "demented dance-floor delight." [...] A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to [...] "make you nostalgic for the long weekend just gone (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday {{is just a little}} bit closer than it should be." [...] Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they found out I was a fan, {{and it turns out that}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck?

60|$|There was {{an opinion}} among <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the letter {{should not be}} stamped by the sender. The proper {{thing to do was}} to drop a penny for the stamp into the box along with the letter, and then Lizzie would see that it was all right. Lizzie's {{acquaintance}} with the handwriting of every person in the place who could write gave her a great advantage. You would perhaps drop into her shop some day to make a purchase, when she would calmly produce a letter you had posted several days before. In explanation she would tell you that you had not put a stamp on it, or that she suspected there was money in it, or that you had addressed it to the wrong place. I remember an old man, a relative of my own, who happened for once in his life to have several letters to post at one time. The circumstance was so out of the common that he considered it only reasonable to make Lizzie a small present.|$|E

So long as the people that own the barns and fences don't object, I don't see what the public has got to do with it. And I never saw anything so very sacred about a big rock, along a river or in a pasture, that it wouldn't do to put mineral paint on it in three colours. I wish <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> talk about the landscape, and WRITE about it, had to bu'st one of them rocks OUT of the landscape with powder, or dig a hole to bury it in, as we used to have to do up on the farm; I guess they'd sing a little different tune about the profanation of scenery. There ain't any man enjoys a sightly bit of nature--a smooth piece of interval with half a dozen good-sized wine-glass elms in it--more than I do. But I ain't a-going to stand up for every big ugly rock I come across, as if we were all a set of dumn Druids. I say the landscape was made for man, and not man for the landscape." ...|$|E
60|$|Caesar gives, in his narrative, very {{extraordinary}} {{accounts of}} the customs and modes of life of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> he encountered. There was one country, for example, {{in which all the}} lands were common, and the whole structure of society was based on the plan of forming the community into one great martial band. The nation was divided into a hundred cantons, each containing two thousand men capable of bearing arms. If these were all mustered into service together, they would form, of course, an army of two hundred thousand men. It was customary, however, to organize only one half of them into an army, while the rest remained at home to till the ground and tend the flocks and herds. These two great divisions interchanged their work every year, the soldiers becoming husbandmen, and the husbandmen soldiers. Thus they all became equally inured to the hardships and dangers of the camp, and to the more continuous but safer labors of agricultural toil. Their fields were devoted to pasturage more than to tillage, for flocks and herds could be driven from place to place, and thus more easily preserved from the depredations of enemies than fields of grain. The children grew up almost perfectly wild from infancy, and hardened themselves by bathing in cold streams, wearing very little clothing, and making long hunting excursions among the mountains. The people had abundance of excellent horses, which the young men were accustomed, from their earliest years, to ride without saddle or bridle, the horses being trained to obey implicitly every command. So admirably disciplined were they, that sometimes, in battle, the mounted men would leap from their horses and advance as foot soldiers to aid the other infantry, leaving the horses to stand until they returned. The horses would not move from the spot; the men, when the object for which they had dismounted was accomplished, would come back, spring to their seats again, and once more become a squadron of cavalry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had heard}} of Sadler and his camps," [...] said he; [...] "and in this {{beautiful}} month and in this beautiful weather I {{thought it would be}} well to investigate them. I accordingly went to Mr. Sadler's, where I arrived yesterday afternoon. I found Mr. Sadler a very definite man, and, I am sorry to say, that as he immediately defined me as a tramp, he would listen to no other definition. 'You have no money to pay for food and lodgings,' said he, 'and you come under my tramp laws. I don't harbor tramps, but I don't kick them out into the woods to starve. For labor on this place I pay one dollar and a half a day of ten hours. For meals to day-laborers I charge fifteen cents each. If you want your supper, you can go out to that wood-shed and split wood for one hour.' I was very hungry; I went out into the wood-shed; I split wood for one hour, {{and at the end of}} that time I had a sufficient meal. When I had finished, Mr. Sadler sent for me. 'Do you want to stay here all night?' he said. 'I do,' I answered. 'Go, then, and split wood for another hour.' I did so, and it was almost dark when I had finished. In the morning I split wood for my breakfast, and when I had finished I went to Mr. Sadler and asked him how much he would charge for a luncheon wrapped in a piece of paper. 'Seven and a half cents,' he said. I split wood for half an hour, and left Sadler's ostensibly to return to the station by the way I had come; but while I had been at work, I found from the conversation of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> one of the camps was occupied, and I also discovered in what direction it lay. Consequently, after I had passed out of the sight of the definite Peter Sadler, I changed my course, and took a path through the woods which I was told would lead to this road, and I came here because I might just as well pass this way as any other, and because, having set out to investigate camp life, I wished to do so, and I hope I may be allowed to say that although I have seen but little of it, I like it very much." ...|$|E
