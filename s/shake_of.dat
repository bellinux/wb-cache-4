5|$|In {{this highly}} sexualized {{environment}} a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened {{areas of the}} establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.|$|E

He was buried at Penney Farms, Florida, on March 29, 1980. At his funeral, held at the Penney Memorial Church in Penney Farms, Goodman was eulogized by Executive Secretary of the Order of the Arrow William F. Downs: [...] "The <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> [...] hand, sincerity of greeting, twinkle in the eye, smile and dignity immediately relayed...the feeling of confidence from the leader, so necessary to build teamwork. Urner made you feel important".|$|E

2500|$|... "I'm interested," [...] Leibowitz argued, [...] "solely {{in seeing}} that that poor, moronic colored boy {{over there and}} his co-defendants in the other cases get a square <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the dice, because I believe, before God, they {{are the victims of}} a dastardly frame up." [...] He called Price's {{testimony}} [...] "a foul, contemptible, outrageous lie."

2500|$|Calling {{the game}} {{refers to the}} act of {{catchers}} to decide the type of pitch delivered to home plate. Catchers comprise {{a high percentage of}} baseball managers. [...] 15 of 30 Major League Baseball managers were former catchers. Because the catcher is considered a captain on the field (and some, such as Thurman Munson and Jason Varitek were in fact team captains), he is often in charge of planning defensive plays. The catcher will give signs to the pitcher for what pitch is to be thrown. The majority of the time it is done through a number system. Each number will represent a different pitch, and then the pitcher can either agree or disagree with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his or her head. These signals get more complicated when a runner is on second base, because the runner's vantage point when he takes his lead gives him a direct view of the catcher's hand and a simple signal can be relayed by the runner to the batter. Signals are not always done by the number system. Varitek was known for giving signals by touching certain parts of his chest protector.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{selector}} Barrington watched some 80 days {{of county}} cricket {{each year to}} check new talent and help choose the team. From 1976 he was the manager or assistant-manager in every England tour. In those days a manager led the social side of the tour with speeches and dinners, which initially caused him some difficulty, relations with the local cricketing authorities, umpires and the TCCB as well as coaching and training the side. His strengths were that he had toured these countries before, had contacts, a natural good humour and was an excellent ambassador for the game he loved. As a coach few were better at fielding practice and helping batsmen with their technique in the nets. While he did not coach bowlers so well he could guide them through the weaknesses of the opposition batsmen and general strategy. Although he often grumbled to his team and off the cuff to the English press he was always diplomatic in his official statements. He was an avuncular figure popular with the England players who held him in great respect and called him 'the Colonel', but could also tease him and [...] "eagerly awaited the traditional Barrington reaction of hands on hips, eyes cast {{in the air and}} a resigned <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head".|$|E

5000|$|Like many nuclear units, it {{is derived}} from top secret {{operations}} of the Manhattan Project during World War II.
