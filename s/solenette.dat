50|$|Adult <b>solenette</b> feed on {{a variety}} of small benthic organisms, mainly {{crustaceans}} (copepods, amphipods, and cumaceans), bivalve molluscs, and polychaete worms. The diet of the <b>solenette</b> varies by geographical region; <b>solenette</b> from the English Channel feed on a larger variety of prey than those from the Bay of Biscay, and take proportionally more polychaetes as opposed to crustaceans and molluscs for the Bay of Biscay. Feeding activity peaks in summer and declines markedly in winter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solenette</b> is {{too small}} to be of {{commercial}} interest and is usually discarded by fishers. It is caught as bycatch in trawls, sometimes in large numbers, and historically has often been confused with the young of the common sole. Between 1985 and 2006, the range of the <b>solenette</b> increased significantly in the North Sea, which is believed to be a consequence of rising sea bottom temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solenette</b> {{or yellow}} sole, Buglossidium luteum, is {{a species of}} {{flatfish}} in the family Soleidae, and {{the only member of}} its genus. It is characterized by its small size, low-slung semi-circular mouth, and regularly placed dark fin rays. A common and widespread species, it is native to sandy bottoms in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is of little commercial value.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} more {{specific}} habitat requirements than other widespread Atlantic flatfish {{such as the}} European plaice, common sole, and common dab. It is concentrated in waters moderately influenced by estuary outflows, at a salinity of 29-33 ppt, and is absent from the mouths of the largest estuaries where the salinity is lower. The <b>solenette</b> is often found on or half-buried in muddy or muddy-sandy substrates.|$|E
50|$|Vanstraelenia chirophthalma, the African <b>solenette,</b> is {{a species}} of sole native to the Atlantic coast of Africa where it is found from Guinea-Bissau south to Angola. Occurring at depths of from 8 to 100 m, this species is of {{importance}} to local commercial fisheries. This species grows to a length of 28 cm TL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
50|$|The lateral line scales number 55-70, and are {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} with short, strongly curved intercanalicular striae. The coloration of the eyed side is variable, frequently yellowish or light brown {{with or without}} darker blotches or spots. The dorsal and anal fins are sandy with every 5th or 6th (occasionally 4th or 7th) fin ray dark {{for the majority of}} their lengths. The <b>solenette</b> can change its color to better match its background.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solenette</b> {{occurs in}} the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland and Scotland southward, {{as well as in}} the North Sea, Kattegat and the Baltic Sea. It also {{occurs in the}} Mediterranean Sea, {{including}} the Adriatic Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus. It has been reported from a range of 5 - 450 m, but is rare in very shallow waters. The highest abundances occur at depths of 5 - 15 m in the English Channel and at 20 - 35 m in the Bay of Biscay. Their distribution is not restricted by sediment type as in some other flatfish species. In the Solway Firth, there is a general movement offshore in the winter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solenette</b> spawns in February in the Mediterranean, from March to June in the Bay of Biscay, and in July and August in {{the western}} English Channel, North Sea, and western Ireland. The eggs are small and {{distinguishable}} from those of other soles by having only a few large oil globules. The larvae hatch at about 2 mm long, with metamorphosis beginning at about 7 mm long and being complete at 8-9 mm. In appearance the larvae {{are similar to those}} of the common sole, but with fewer large stellate chromatophores. There is also a distinct patch of pigment on the ventral abdominal wall, and the distinct shape of the head is also apparent in the early stages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} of the soles in European waters, the <b>solenette</b> usually measures 10 - 13 cm long and attains a maximum length of 15 cm. It has an oval, compressed, slightly elongate body with both eyes {{on the right side}} of the head. The snout is rounded with the upper jaw slightly elongated to form a [...] "beak". The diameter of the upper eye is less than the distance between it and the front of the head. The dorsal fin begins on the anterior profile of the head, with 65-78 fin rays. The anal fin contains 49-63 fin rays, and the caudal fin is connected to the dorsal and anal fins by a small membrane. The pectoral fin on the eyed side is small, with 3-5 fin rays, and the one on the blind side is reduced to 1 long and 1-2 short fin rays.|$|E
40|$|Changes in spatial {{distribution}} in several fish {{species have been}} related to recent increase in global temperature. In the North Sea, both a poleward shift and a shift to deeper water have been observed. Here, we study the underlying mechanism of these shifts in a comparative study {{of the changes in}} distribution of two boreal flatfish species (plaice Pleuronectes platessa and dab Limanda limanda) and three Lusitanian flatfish species (sole Solea solea, <b>solenette</b> Buglossidium luteum, and scaldfish Arnoglossus laterna) as recorded in annual bottom trawl surveys carried out in the North Sea in late summer since 1985. The distribution is analysed in relation to the bottom temperature {{at the time of the}} survey as well as to the seasonal maximum bottom temperature earlier in the year. It is shown that the boreal species plaice and dab moved to deeper water and maintained the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced in earlier periods, while the Lusitanian species sole, <b>solenette,</b> and scaldfish experienced an increase in the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced while maintaining their depth distribution. This overall response varied between length classes, reflecting a preference for higher temperature of the smaller length classes. The results lend support to the hypothesis that the fish displayed a direct response to the maximum temperature that occurred during the growth season before the time of sampling...|$|E
40|$|Climate change, {{specifically}} temperature, {{affects the}} distribution and densities of species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, {{we looked at the}} effect of temperature during winter and spawning period on latitudinal range shifts and changes in abundance of two non-commercial North Sea fish species, <b>solenette</b> (Buglossidium luteum) and scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna). Both species have increased in abundance and moved to the north since the late 1980 s, coinciding with a series of mild winters. In 1996, following a very cold winter, the abundance of both species temporarily decreased as they retracted to the south. The shift in temperature affected adult habitat conditions, allowing them to immigrate into new areas where they subsequently reproduced successfully. We can conclude this because recruitment improved following the increase in abundance. The recruitment relates significantly to the higher adult stock and higher temperatures. The predictions of higher average temperatures and milder winters in the North Sea make it likely that these species will increase further in abundance and move northward. The observed increase in abundance of these small flatfish species will affect the North Sea food web and therefore commercial species, e. g. plaice, by predation on juveniles and competition for benthic food resource...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that increasing mesh number in the circumference of a diamond-mesh trawl codend can reduce size selection for round fish, whereas selection for flat fish species is unaffected. This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available {{with regard to the}} effect of increasing mesh number in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of round fish and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals aimed at improving trawl fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a round fish species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) and <b>solenette</b> (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in mesh number around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50 % retention length (L 50) for red mullet by 2. 5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the diet of six {{demersal}} and semi-pelagic fish species (dab, <b>solenette,</b> dragonet, lesser weever, whiting and horse mackerel) in the Thorntonbank wind farm and its surrounding areas. Stomach {{analyses were conducted to}} unravel changes in feeding patterns and to discriminate between effects of the presence of the turbines and effects as a result of fisheries displacement at the border of the wind farm concession area. Differences were observed between impact, fringe and reference stations. The fullness index indicated that fish had a fuller stomach close to the wind turbines and at the borders of the concession area. This might be an indication of a higher food availability around the wind turbines. The stomach content of dab revealed more amphipods and especially hard substratum species (e. g. Phtisica marina) in the impact area compared to the reference area. However, the most abundant hard substratum species present on the turbines (i. e. the amphipod Jassa herdmani and the crab Pisidia longicornis) were not found in any of the dab stomachs. This can probably be linked to the sampling distance (500 - 1500 m) or to the prey preferences of dab. In general, differences in feeding patterns between sampling stations were observed. Whether these differences originated from the wind turbine presence or from changes in fisheries activities can only be unequivocally confirmed by replication within and between the wind farm(s) and by an optimisation of the sampling strategy...|$|E
40|$|Since {{about ten}} years DNA microarrays are {{indispensable}} tools for genomic and biomedical research. They are used predominantly for expression profiling but are increasingly employed {{for the analysis of}} complex environmental samples. This thesis presents the development of a DNA microarray prototype for the identification of gadoid and flatfish species from the southern North Sea. First of all partial sequences of mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and 16 S rRNA genes were determined for adult gadoid and flatfish specimens. Based on COI and 16 S rDNA alignments capture oligonucleotide probes were selected, spotted onto glass slides and the resulting DNA microarrays were tested successfully with fish samples. COI DNA sequences showed sufficient sequence variability for the selection of capture probes even for the discrimination of closely related fish species, e. g. flounder and European plaice, whereas 16 S rDNA sequences were too conserved within the families Pleuronectidae and Gadidae to select species specific probes, but were very suitable for the selection of probes for Soleidae and Scophthalmidae species, due to the presence of highly variable regions. The evaluation of 34 COI probes for the identification of Atlantic cod, whiting, flounder, dab, European plaice, American plaice, lemon sole and common sole and 10 16 S rDNA probes for turbot, brill, common sole and <b>solenette</b> resulted in 34 species specific, 6 false negative and 4 cross reacting probes. Signal strength varied considerably among all probes and was correlated with the position of the probe binding region and influenced by the concentration of the target DNA and the presence of non target DNA. LNA-modified COI probes showed in some cases improvements concerning the specificity and the sensitivity but altogether increased the proportion of false negative or cross reacting probes. Some probes with HEG 2 spacers exhibited increased signal intensities but spacers also resulted in cross hybridizations...|$|E
40|$|Fishing affects {{patterns}} of energy use in fish populations, {{as demonstrated by}} changes in population energy consumption and the size and age when energy demands are greatest. We compare theoretical predictions and observed {{patterns of}} energy use (expressed as the primary production required to support fish production) by North Sea fish, based on simple and widely applicable theory that links life history parameters, fishing mortality (F), trophic transfer efficiency and relationships between size and trophic level (as determined using nitrogen stable isotope analysis). For the demersal species that dominate total biomass, relationships between size and trophic level were quite consistent among years. There were large decreases in relative energy requirements of all exploited demersal populations except plaice Pleuronectes platessa during the last 3 to 4 decades. Relative energy requirements of plaice were more stable because smaller plaice, which now dominate the exploited population, feed at higher trophic levels than larger plaice. The sizes and ages when population energy demands were greatest fell with increasing fishing mortality and differences between the predicted (F = 0) and observed ages at maximum energy demand were greater in larger species. Currently, the energy demands of most species peak early in life (1 - 3 years) and largely reflect patterns of recruitment, leading to a homogenisation of the trophodynamics of the fish community. The fate of energy {{that is no longer}} used by commercially exploited species is not clear, partly because of the infrequent and untargeted monitoring of species that are more resilient to fishing. However, we conducted a preliminary assessment of the energy demands of <b>solenette</b> Buglossidium luteum, a very abundant small flatfish in the central North Sea that has increased in abundance in recent years. The solenette's high abundance and resilience to fishing, suggests that it now requires 35 % of primary production in part of the central North Sea, energy that may have supported larger species in a less heavily fished ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Samples of the {{demersal}} fish fauna {{have been collected}} by beam trawl from the coastal waters of northwest Europe (49 – 57 °N, 8 °W 9 °E) by the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, since 1990, during {{the third quarter of}} the year. Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Bight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limanda limanda were abundant. In the Channel and {{to the west of the}} UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially poor cod Trisopterus minutus, <b>solenette</b> Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the lesser weever, Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen flatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Flatfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes (< 30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two faunal types. The additional influence on demersal populations of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion. Without further information on the distribution of fishing effort, it is not possible to separate the influence of natural faunal changes between regions from that of artificial changes caused by fishing activity...|$|E
40|$|In the European Union, the {{collection}} of discard data is enforced through the Data Collection Regulation or Framework (DCF) of the European Commission (EC). To comply with this ruling, approximately ten trips of discard-intensive beam-trawlers are being monitored annually since 1999 (Helmond and Overzee, 2010). In 2009, revisions to the DCF (2008 / 949 /EG), required member states to increase sampling intensity to i) improve the precision of their estimates and ii) the number of sampled métiers. To meet this requirement within an affordable budget, the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, part of Wageningen University and Research) set up a collaborative project between the Dutch fishing industry and the research institute to recruit a ‘reference fleet’ of vessel owners {{willing to participate in}} a selfsampling programme. In the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. In total, 155 trips were sampled in 2011, of which 27 trips (17 %) were considered invalid due to missing or incomplete information. During the 128 valid self-sampling trips 248 hauls were sampled. While the majority of observations were done on board beamtrawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm targeting flatfish, data was collected from eight other metiers as well. These included beam trawls with other mesh sizes or target species assemblages, otter trawls and seines. This led, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling compared to the previous observer-based sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available now. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensivelysampled métiers. Large-mesh beam- and otter trawls (100 - 119 mm) on average landed more than they discarded. In the other métiers, combined fish and benthos discards exceeded the volume of landings. The majority of discards comprised of benthic (invertebrate) species such as common starfish (Asteria rubens); sand star (Astropecten irregularis); swimming crab (Liocarcinus holsatus); and serpent star (Ophiura ophiura). Most frequently discarded fish species of no commercial value included: dragonet (Callionymus lyra); grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus); scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna); <b>solenette</b> (Buglossidium luteum); and lesser weaver (Echiichthys vipera). Among commercially-valuable fish, common dab (Limanda limanda) and European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) were the most frequently discarded species...|$|E

This programme complemented the existing observer programme. In the observer programme, vessels were selected quarterly from a pool of available vessels, whereas in the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. Missing and/or wrong information precluded the inclusion of 17 % and 13 % of all self-sampled trips in 2009 and 2010. In total, 9 and 10 observer, and 63 and 132 valid self-sampling trips were completed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. For these remaining valid self-sampled trips, procedures were developed to test whether data quality was comparable with i) other self samples from the reference fleet and ii) comparable observercollected data (i. e. temporally and spatially overlapping trips). In addressing i), there were no unusual patterns in the length frequencies of self-sampled discards of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in 2009 and 2010. In addressing ii), no significant differences in the discard rates of plaice between the two programmes were found. There was no evidence that sampling may have been biased at the vessel level, justifying the decision to present all discard estimates independent of the programme type. While in both programmes the majority of observations were done onboard beam-trawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm, in the self-sampling programme data from four additional beam- and otter-trawl métiers with two 70 - 99 and 100 - 119 mesh size ranges and other target species assemblages (i. e mixed crustaceans and/or demersal fish) were collected. This lead, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensively-sampled métiers.
