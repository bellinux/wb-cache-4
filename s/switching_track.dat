The railroad expanded, then downsized {{to a mere}} 1.14 mi of <b>switching</b> <b>track</b> near Fordyce. After the liquidation of Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, F&P acquired the line between Fordyce and Crossett, via Banks, Craney, Hermitage, Ingalls, Vick, Broad, Emery, and Whitlow.|$|E

Then a cast member will switch a green <b>switching</b> <b>track</b> aligned for the shops. After that, the train goes on the full route to the station.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{work was}} on the {{southern}} portion of the GN-Bahn, so that service began on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstraße and Schönleinstraße. Between these stations was the Hermannplatz station, which had been built {{as part of the}} simultaneous construction of the first north-south U-Bahn, finished 4 years earlier; here passengers were {{now for the first time}} able to transfer from one [...] "large profile" [...] (wide-body) line to another. A <b>switching</b> <b>track</b> was built between the two.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 {{a change}} in {{corporate}} strategy resulted in the unused part of the railroad being formally abandoned and dismantled. Since that time, PNW has operated 5 miles of <b>switching</b> <b>track</b> in Prescott, with traffic being between the sawmill, a Firestone Rubber Plant and the Missouri Pacific (now Union Pacific) connection. The Prescott sawmill changed hands several times over the years. Current owner Potlatch has closed the mill and sold the railroad to Arkansas Midland. Firestone is currently the only customer.|$|E
50|$|Timber {{brought the}} railroad. The part of Louisiana that {{included}} Calcasieu Parish {{was home to}} the finest longleaf pine in the world. When combined with the stands of cypress and other hardwood lumber, logging was a lucrative prospect. The railroad gave life to Vinton, starting with a <b>switching</b> <b>track.</b> Although {{there would be a}} depot later, Vinton began as a whistle stop called Blair. The source of the name is unknown. Some have speculated that the railroad siding took its name from a local family. However, no family named Blair was in residence in the area at that time.|$|E

50|$|After {{the final}} trip around Storybookland at Disneyland closing time, the train will {{continue}} to the switch near the Storybookland loading dock. Then it will stop. One of the cast members will then switch the green <b>switching</b> <b>track</b> to the backstage spur. Once aligned, the train continues slowly into the shops. If another train should be out, the switch is switched so the train can continue running. Otherwise, the switch is aligned for the shops. Once parked, the cast members shut off the I6 engine and disassemble the train set and do maintenance on each rolling stock. At one point, the fuel truck filled with either gasoline or compressed natural gas comes and refuels the Thriftmaster engines.|$|E

50|$|Storm Runner is {{the first}} {{accelerator}} coaster to utilize over-the-shoulder restraints {{and the first to}} have a dual-loading station with <b>switch</b> <b>tracks.</b> Likewise, it was also the first accelerator coaster to feature inversions; Kanonen at Liseberg was the second.|$|R

50|$|A single {{slip switch}} works on the same {{principle}} as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or <b>switch</b> <b>tracks</b> to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot <b>switch</b> <b>tracks.</b> This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|R
5|$|The coaster {{features}} a dual station which {{is connected to}} the main <b>track</b> using a <b>switch</b> <b>track</b> segment (similar to a railroad switch). Dual-station operation allows for two trains to be loaded simultaneously for more efficient operation. This configuration existed since the ride debuted at Geauga Lake.|$|R
