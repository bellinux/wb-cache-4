40|$|We {{confirm the}} recent claims that, in the {{infrared}} limit of Hořava-Lifshitz gravity, the scalar graviton becomes a ghost if the sound <b>speed</b> <b>squared</b> is positive on the flat de Sitter and Minkowski background. In {{order to avoid the}} ghost and tame the instability, the sound <b>speed</b> <b>squared</b> should be negative and very small, which means that the flow parameter λ should be very close to its General Relativity (GR) value. We calculate the cubic interactions for the scalar graviton which are shown to have a similar structure with those of the curvature perturbation in k-inflation models. The higher order interactions become increasing important for a smaller sound <b>speed</b> <b>squared,</b> that is, when the theory approaches GR. This invalidates any linearized analysis and any predictability is lost in this limit as quantum corrections are not controllable. This pathological behaviour of the scalar graviton casts doubt on the validity of the projectable version of the theory.

The background dynamics is solved and particle production associated with rapidly oscillating Hubble parameter is studied in detail. In addition, production of gravitons through the non-minimal derivative coupling with the inflaton is studied. We also {{find that the}} sound <b>speed</b> <b>squared</b> of the scalar perturbation oscillates between positive and negative values when the non-minimal derivative coupling dominates over the minimal kinetic term. This may lead to an instability of this model.

50|$|Jaime - Jaime {{works at}} a feverish pace, with no issues besides Sheilla {{dropping}} subtle hints about whether his measurements were accurate or his joins were square. Like the other contestants, Jaime has trouble using his <b>speed</b> <b>square</b> to determine the correct angle. When he seeks Justin for advice on using it, he discovers that his angles are wrong, and tries many times to fix the angle. Although he believes that Sheilla was no help at all, eventually Jaime does run out of things to adjust, and his final result is correct. He finishes with only two minutes left on the clock, {{and is the only}} person to finish correctly within the time limit.|$|E
50|$|Candace - Because it {{took her}} five whole minutes to make a single cut in her wood with her {{crosscut}} saw in the skills evaluation (only {{to give up and}} use the power tools), Justin is doing the cutting for Candace. Just soon after Justin begins assembling the frame himself, leaving Candace out of the picture. This, however, did not mean that she was done - neither saw that her vertical boards were cut too short (meaning that their angles were not correct either). Although both eventually notice this, Candace, even with Justin's help, is puzzled by where to place the <b>speed</b> <b>square</b> so that she could measure the proper angles. After 70 minutes, Candace gets the correct frame, but is clueless as to why the frame is correct.|$|E
50|$|If a right {{triangle}} has two angles that equal 45° {{then the two}} sides are equidistant. The rafter is the hypotenuse and the legs or catheti of the triangle are the top wall plates of the structure. The side cut is located at the intersection of the given pitch column and the side cut of the hip/valley row. The regular hip/valley rafter runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and jack rafters have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.The side cut of the hip/valley rafter = (Tangent)(12) = side cut in inches. The side cuts in the rafter table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devises use 90° as 0° in construction. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used with tools like the <b>speed</b> <b>square.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{coupling}} {{between a}} light scalar field and neutrinos {{has been widely}} discussed as a mechanism for linking (time varying) neutrino masses and the present energy density and equation of state of dark energy. However, it has been {{pointed out that the}} viability of this scenario in the non-relativistic neutrino regime is threatened by the strong growth of hydrodynamic perturbations associated with a negative adiabatic sound <b>speed</b> <b>squared.</b> In this paper we revisit the stability issue in the framework of linear perturbation theory in a model independent way. The criterion for the stability of a model is translated into a constraint on the scalar-neutrino coupling, which depends on the ratio of the energy densities in neutrinos and cold dark matter. We illustrate our results by providing meaningful examples both for stable and unstable models.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a new updated solar model taking {{advantage}} of recent reexamination of the nuclear reactions rates and of the microscopic diffusion of helium and heavy elements. Our best model fits the helioseismic data reasonably well: {{the base of the}} convective zone is at r= 0. 715 Ro, the photospheric helium in mass fraction is 0. 243 and the sound <b>speed</b> <b>square</b> difference between the Sun and the model is < 1 %. This model leads to a reestimate of the neutrinos fluxes : 7. 18 SNU for the chlorine experiment, 127. 2 SNU for the gallium detector and 4. 82 10 ^ 6 /cm 2 /s for the B 8 neutrino flux. Acoustic and gravity mode predictions are also estimated. We present 3 models which respect the helioseismic constraints and fit the seismic observations better by {{taking advantage of}} the known physical uncertainties: nuclear reaction rates, CNO abundances and microscopic diffusion. We conclude that the standard model in side its inherent uncertainties, is robust {{in the light of the}} present acoustic mode detection and that the neutrino fluxes prediction is not well constrained.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{cosmology}} {{of an extended}} version of Horndeski theories with second-order equations of motion on the flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. In addition to a dark energy field χ associated with the gravitational sector, we take into account multiple scalar fields ϕ_I (I= 1, 2 [...] .,N- 1) characterized by the Lagrangians P^(I) (X_I) with X_I=∂_μϕ_I∂^μϕ_I. These additional scalar fields can model the perfect fluids of radiation and non-relativistic matter. We derive propagation speeds of scalar and tensor perturbations as well as conditions {{for the absence of}} ghosts. The theories beyond Horndeski induce non-trivial modifications to all the propagation speeds of N scalar fields, but the modifications to those for the matter fields ϕ_I are generally suppressed relative to that for the dark energy field χ. We apply our results to the covariantized Galileon with an Einstein-Hilbert term in which partial derivatives of the Minkowski Galileon are replaced by covariant derivatives. Unlike the covariant Galileon with second-order equations of motion in general space-time, the scalar propagation <b>speed</b> <b>square</b> c_s 1 ^ 2 associated with the field χ becomes negative during the matter era for late-time tracking solutions, so the two Galileon theories can be clearly distinguished at the level of linear cosmological perturbations.

40|$|In {{previous}} work, we {{have shown}} that recent updated standard solar models cannot reproduce the radial profile of the sound speed {{at the base of}} the convective zone (CZ) and fail to predict the Li 7 depletion. In parallel, helioseismology has shown that the transition from differential rotation in the CZ to almost uniform rotation in the radiative solar interior occurs in a shallow layer called the tachocline. This layer is presumably the seat of large scale circulation and of turbulent motions. Here, we introduce a macroscopic transport term in the structure equations, which is based on a hydrodynamical description of the tachocline proposed by Spiegel and Zahn, and we calculate the mixing induced within this layer. We discuss the influence of different parameters that represent the tachocline thickness, the Brunt-Vaissala frequency {{at the base of the}} CZ, and the time dependence of this mixing process along the Sun's evolution. We show that the introduction of such a process inhibits the microscopic diffusion by about 25 %. Starting from models including a pre-main sequence evolution, we obtain: a) a good agreement with the observed photospheric chemical abundance of light elements such as He 3, He 4, Li 7 and Be 9, b) a smooth composition gradient at the base of the CZ, and c) a significant improvement of the sound <b>speed</b> <b>square</b> difference between the seismic sun and the models in this transition region, when we allow the phostospheric heavy element abundance to adjust, within the observational incertitude, due to the action of this mixing process. The impact on neutrino predictions is also discussed. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures, to be published in ApJ (used emulateapj style for latex 2 e). New email for A. S.

40|$|In the {{approach}} of the effective field theory of modified gravity, we derive the equations of motion for linear perturbations {{in the presence of a}} barotropic perfect fluid on the flat isotropic cosmological background. In a simple version of Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) theories, which is the minimum extension of Horndeski theories, we show that a slight deviation of the tensor propagation <b>speed</b> <b>squared</b> c_ t^ 2 from 1 generally leads to the large modification to the propagation <b>speed</b> <b>squared</b> c_ s^ 2 of a scalar degree of freedom ϕ. This problem persists whenever the kinetic energy ρ_X of the field ϕ is much smaller than the background energy density ρ_m, which is the case for most of dark energy models in the asymptotic past. Since the scaling solution characterized by the constant ratio ρ_X/ρ_m is one way out for avoiding such a problem, we study the evolution of perturbations for a scaling dark energy model in the framework of GLPV theories in the Jordan frame. Provided the oscillating mode of scalar perturbations is fine-tuned so that it is initially suppressed, the anisotropic parameter η=-Φ/Ψ between the two gravitational potentials Ψ and Φ significantly deviates from 1 for c_ t^ 2 away from 1. For other general initial conditions, the deviation of c_ t^ 2 from 1 gives rise to the large oscillation of Ψ with the frequency related to c_ s^ 2. In both cases, the model can leave distinct imprints for the observations of CMB and weak lensing. Comment: 20 pages, 4 figures, published in JCA...|$|R

Increasing that speed by 50% to 90 km/h (25 m/s) compares to a fall from 32 m - an increase of 125%.

In general, this model is known to provide an enhanced slow-roll inflation caused by gravitationally enhanced friction. We find violent oscillations of Hubble parameter which induces oscillations of the sound <b>speed</b> <b>squared,</b> implying the Lagrangian instability of curvature perturbation ζ under the comoving gauge φ= 0. Also, it is shown that the curvature perturbation blows up at ϕ̇= 0, leading to the breakdown of the comoving gauge at ϕ̇= 0. Therefore, we use the Newtonian gauge to perform the perturbation analysis where the Newtonian potential is employed as a physical variable. The curvature perturbation is not considered as a physical variable which describes a relevant perturbation during reheating. Comment: 1 + 18 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in JCA...|$|R
