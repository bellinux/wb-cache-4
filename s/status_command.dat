5000|$|In 1979, Simplex {{introduced}} the LifeAlarm 2100, the industry's first networked multiplex building control {{system that was}} capable of handling fire alarm, security, HVAC, synchronized time, and watchman's tour. It centered on a large CPU console with built-in CRT display and keyboard that controlled the system's remote transponders (smaller self-sufficient panels connected to the DC Communications loop that distributed the system's I/O). In 1981, the 2100 was replaced with the popular and less-expensive 2120-series. Unlike the 2100, the 2120's main CPU {{came in the form}} of a traditional wall-mount panel that was field-programmable, but several more options for remotely controlling the system through external CRT consoles and <b>status</b> <b>command</b> centers were now made available. The main panel featured a vacuum fluorescent display screen, DOS-based EEPROM programming, built-in printer, and a voice evacuation option. The 2120 was finally discontinued in 1992. These systems were possibly the first fire alarm systems with a screen display. Though flexible and robust, these systems were often criticized for being difficult to operate and troubleshoot. These two computer-based systems were accompanied by the conventional 2001-series. First released in 1978, the 2001 was a highly customizable system that used plug-in modules. Some were common to every system (basic controls), while many other options were available, including signal coding cards, waterflow monitor cards, and many others. These cards were also compatible with Simplex's multiplex systems. In 1988, the 2001 was discontinued in favor of the 4001 and 4002 series (which came out in 1985 and 1986, respectively), and the 1000-point 4100 addressable system which was introduced that year, along with the 4903 series light/strobe plates, which replaced the 2903/2904 series. Around 1992, the 2120 was replaced with the 4120-series networked panel, and the 508-point 4020 addressable system was introduced at the same time, with the new 2099/4099 series T-Bar pull stations. In 1993, Simplex began manufacturing their 4903 mechanical horn strobe series, along with the 4904 and 4901 horns. In 1994, Simplex {{introduced the}} 4004, 4005, and 4009 NAC extenders. In 1998, the 4903 electronic horn strobe was released, and in 2001, Simplex introduced the TrueAlert-series, cited as being the industry's first addressable notification appliances which can be tested individually with a magnet without activating the entire system. The 4100U, a consolidated upgrade of Simplex's three largest addressable systems, followed in 2002, and was again updated in 2010 with the current 4100ES. [...] From time to time, SimplexGrinnell has used Cooper Wheelock, Gentex and Federal Signal notification appliances, mostly for outdoor/weatherproof applications. However, this is becoming less frequent with the introduction of weatherproof TrueAlert signals. When the weatherproof TrueAlerts came out in 2010, so did the TrueAlert chime/strobes and multi-tone horn/strobes. In 2014, Simplex released a new line of addressable notification appliances known as the TrueAlert ES. These signals are capable of reducing wiring, undergoing [...] "self testing", strobe candela choice from the FACP, and make it easy to add new signals. This line includes the regular horn/strobes, multi tone horn/strobes capable of outputting a 520Hz Low Frequency tone for sleeping areas, outdoor signals, speaker/strobes, and Simplex's first ever line of LED devices.|$|E

Examining the strategies of 26 luxury wine firms informs the authenticity of specific brands. Creating an impression of authenticity required creating a sincere story consisting of a creative blend of industrial and rhetorical attributes. Sincerity was achieved through the public avowal of hand crafted techniques, uniqueness, relationship to place, passion for wine production, and the simultaneous disavowal of commercial motives, rational production methods, and the use of modern marketing techniques. For the wineries, appearing authentic was critical in order to reinforce their <b>status,</b> <b>command</b> price premiums and ward off competitors. Images of authenticity were accomplished by developing a sincere story that enabled the firms to maintain quality and relevance while appearing above commercial considerations.

40|$|The Atmosphere-Space Interactive Monitor (ASIM) is {{a project}} running under the {{guideline}} and financial support of the European Space Agency (ESA). The ASIM instrument consists of several high resolution, optical cameras and an X-ray and Gamma-ray detector. The ASIM payload is to be installed on the Columbus module on International Space Station (ISS) which will orbit the Earth {{at an altitude of}} 300 - 400 km, and will observe the Earth's atmosphere for a time span of two years after installation. A new H- 2 B heavy lift rocket carrying the H- 2 Transfer Vehicle (HTV) is expected to install ASIM onto the Columbus module in 2014, which is developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The main goals of the ASIM project are to study the Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) and Terrestrial Gamma Flashes (TGFs) with their effects on the atmosphere and space, and to collect the data related to the Earth's atmosphere, including the climate changes. The ASIM payload consists of a Modular X-ray and Gamma-ray Sensor (MXGS), six high resolution optical cameras, six photometers and other supporting electronics. Further the MXGS instrument consists of two detector modules named the CZT and the BGO having high imaging capability and are sensitive to Photons having energy range of 10 keV to 20 MeV. The University of Bergen is working together with the Danish National Space Center (DNSC), University of Valencia, the Polish Academy of Sciences Warszawa and many other research groups on this project {{under the supervision of the}} European Space Agency (ESA). The University of Bergen is responsible for the development of the MXGS-detector plane, Detector array and its Front End Electronics (DFEE). At the time of writing, the project is in phase C/D where a full-fledged ASIM payload engineering model for Flight Version is under development. The phase C/D will end with the installation of final Flight Version of ASIM onto the ISS. For testing the MXGS instrument in the lab at UiB, a readout and configuration program is developed in LabVIEW programming environment. This thesis describes the designing, and development of the readout and configuration program developed for the MXGS instrument in LabVIEW environment. A LabVIEW program is developed and used to communicate with different detector modules in MXGS instrument. The user can use this program from the PC to send commands to the detector (RCU-Readout Control Unit), to configure the ASICs in the detector modules (to activate them for event signals) and for acquisition and analysis the measurement data in the form of real-time plots visualization on the PC monitor. Each detector assembly unit consists of a RCU (Readout Control unit). The RCU hosts a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). There are number of Control and Status Registers defined in the various modules of the RCU firmware. The developed program creates an interface between the user and these CRs/ SRs to trigger the various functions in the detector. Whenever any photon event occurs on the detector, the science data packets (SCDPs) contain the photon energy and time information is created at the RCU. These SCDPs are made available for analysis on the user's PC in the form of real-time visual plots by using the LabVIEW program. A Control and <b>Status</b> <b>Command</b> Interface (CSCI) is developed, where it is much easier to send commands to the RCU and to verify the results. A separate graphical user [URL]...|$|E
