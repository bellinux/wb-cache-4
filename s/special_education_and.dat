Studies at the national and state levels have frequently been conducted in the form of surveys, and provide only preliminary information about the status of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> in charter schools. There is a paucity of case specific information about the management <b>and</b> delivery of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> services in open-enrollment charter schools. A within-case study research design was used for this investigation utilizing qualitative methods of structured open-ended interviews, observations at the schools, and document analysis. Administrators at four open-enrollment charter schools were interviewed to gather data for this multi-case study. The data supported the hypotheses related to <b>special</b> <b>education</b> services in open-enrollment charter schools. The schools in this study provided <b>special</b> <b>education</b> services with an inclusion model for the first two years. In their first years of operation, charter schools face challenges of small budgets, few if any <b>special</b> <b>education</b> students, <b>and</b> difficulty finding <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers <b>and</b> other staff. In the third year and beyond, the schools were able to add <b>special</b> <b>education</b> services <b>and</b> staff and were more stable in terms of budget and operations.
