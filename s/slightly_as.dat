5|$|Late in {{the evening}} of September 18, Karl {{attained}} Category3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that day into a Category4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of an}} eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category3 hurricane. At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the summer}} of 2006, the Stadtbahn was the main {{thoroughfare}} for long-distance trains, which usually stopped at Zoologischer Garten and Ostbahnhof (which was renamed in 1998). When the new Hauptbahnhof opened on 28 May 2006 {{the importance of the}} line diminished <b>slightly,</b> <b>as</b> many trains now would use the new north-south line connected to the Hauptbahnhof. The remaining intercity trains on the Stadtbahn, mainly those heading toward Hanover and Cologne, now usually call at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof.|$|E
5|$|After being {{classified}} as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness. A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230miles (370km) of the Azores and started {{to show signs of}} deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only <b>slightly,</b> <b>as</b> both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it {{moved to the}} north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised <b>slightly.</b> <b>As</b> a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E

5|$|Early on September19, Typhoon Fanapi made {{landfall}} over eastern Taiwan near Hualien City with {{winds of}} , according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. The storm subsequently weakened over land, dipping southwestward as convection diminished over the northern {{portion of the}} storm. However, the storm resumed its westward trajectory and soon moved over the Taiwan Strait as a severe tropical storm. The thunderstorms reorganized <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> Fanapi reached open waters, and a nearby ship reported winds of 120km/h (75mph). Early on September20, the storm made a second landfall on southeastern China near Fujian and weakened further over land, although thunderstorms persisted southeast of the circulation along the coast. Fanapi weakened into a tropical depression later that day and dissipated late on September21.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{towards the}} northwest, Prapiroon {{reached its peak}} {{intensity}} early on August3. The JMA estimated that Prapiroon peaked with winds of 120km/h (75mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg), while the JTWC estimated that the storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph 1-minute winds). Prapiroon maintained this intensity for 12hours before weakening <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it made landfall near Shangyang at 12:00UTC. At the time of landfall, the JMA downgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, with winds of 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC analyzed Prapiroon to have had winds of 120km/h (75mph 1-minute winds). Due to the interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened. Early on August5, both agencies issued their final advisories on Prapiroon as it dissipated over central Guangxi.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bob {{was one of}} the costliest {{hurricane}}s in New England history. The second named {{storm and}} first hurricane of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season, Bob developed from an area of low pressure near The Bahamas on August 16. The depression steadily intensified, and became Tropical Storm Bob late on August 16. Bob curved north-northwestward as a tropical storm, but re-curved to the north-northeast after becoming a hurricane on August 17. As such, it brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on August 18 and August 19, and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). After peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h), Bob weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it approached the coast of New England.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Tico is one {{of three}} major hurricanes to strike Mazatlan. The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak {{tropical}} disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October7, 1983. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575mi (930km) south of Acapulco. On October12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October13. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. Early on October19, it reached peak winds of 130mph (215km/h). It weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it approached the coast, and at about 1500UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125mph (205km/h). The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|In Massena, {{the forests}} along NY420 subside <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it passes by {{industrial}} warehouses and residences. The route curves {{back to the}} northwest as it enters the village of Massena. Just past the village line, NY420 crosses the St. Lawrence Subdivision, a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation. The highway continues on, curving northward to cross the Raquette River. It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY37 south of the village center. NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north {{into the heart of}} the village as Main Street.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} week, the Royalist forces held the siege, {{but did not}} engage with the town again until 6 May, when they attacked the town in three places during a thick fog. The defenders were caught out <b>slightly,</b> <b>as</b> many of their soldiers were eating their evening supper. The Parliamentarians rallied quickly, and within an hour had repelled the attack. An account kept by the Lyme Regis garrison records that around one hundred of the besieging army had been killed, while the garrison had only lost one man. The following day, Maurice requested a parley so that the dead could be buried. That request was granted, {{in exchange for the}} town's defenders being able to claim any weaponry on the battleground. Over the next week, there was little fighting between the armies, and a further seven ships arrived to aid the town, including 240 soldiers from Sir William Waller's army, and on 15 May a further 120 men were sent by the Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|The first {{advisory}} {{from the}} NHC was issued at 11:00AST on October4; at this time, {{the system was}} officially named Grace, the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature. Although Grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclone development, low wind shear allowed the convection to persist. A steady northeastward track {{was taken by the}} storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic. The storm intensified <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures, with winds estimated at 65mph (100km/h) early on October5; operationally it was held at 70mph (110km/h), but was downgraded due to uncertainties in the storm's intensity as it was progressing over cold waters.|$|E

5|$|The route headed {{northwest}} from US20, {{intersecting with}} Pontiac Road (CR490) as it curved {{back to the}} north and entered the village of Angola. Within Angola, NY323 followed Main Street northward past several blocks of homes and business. At Orchard Avenue, the street turned to the northwest, roughly paralleling Big Sister Creek as both exited the village limits. Past this point, the amount of development along the route dropped <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it continued northward toward the hamlet of Evans Center. NY323 crossed over Big Sister Creek south of the community before ending at a junction with NY5 {{in the center of the}} hamlet.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{traveled}} east-northeastward paralleling the Gulf Coast of the United States, {{and eventually}} made landfall on the Florida panhandle early on June 29. It weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>as</b> it traversed inland, {{and entered the}} Atlantic Ocean just offshore Georgia during the morning. At this point, the storm attained its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h), though it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone within the six hours that followed. Late during the day, the extratropical storm reached New Jersey, and entered Maine on June 30. The 2003 reanalysis made only minor adjustments to the storm's intensity and track created by Partagás and Diaz, which included moving the point of landfall westward and increasing windspeeds on June 29 based on readings received in Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
