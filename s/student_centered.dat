A new building designed with this purpose in mind, they argue, would include more venue space, meeting space, centralized student services, food options and general entertainment. In addition, moving the <b>student</b> <b>center</b> to the Garret parking lot would be more of a focal point for students to congregate on campus. Those who argue the necessity of building a new <b>student</b> <b>center</b> cite the positive effect of peer institutions' larger or more comprehensive <b>student</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R
