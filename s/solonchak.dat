40|$|Vegetation {{activity}} within continental Europe and the Mediterranean Basin {{is changing}} and extreme {{warm and dry}} events cause substantial reductions in vegetation activity. This region covers {{a wide variety of}} climate regimes, soil and land cover types. Distinguishing the response of the vegetation to extreme heat, drought and compound events as a function of land cover type, climate regime and soil type allows to better explain regional and local differences in vegetation response. This research analyses the temporal evolution of the impact of extreme heat, drought and compound events on the observed NDVI during the growing season, aggregated by land cover, soil and climate types. The results show 31 % reduction of the median vegetation activity, though highly variable depending on local conditions in climate, soil and vegetation type. The maximum impact was observed for extreme warm and dry compound events, one month after the extreme event occurrence, and recovery took up to 4 months. Furthermore, the impact of extreme heat and drought on vegetation activity increases when moving to colder climates with the largest change occurring in high latitude natural land cover types. The soil properties affecting the impact of extreme droughts on vegetation activity were mainly related to root depth limitations, water regulating properties and ecophysiological properties. Within a temperate climate, water availability and water regulating properties of the soil were found most important; in water limiting conditions those showing limiting root development con- ditions linked to abrupt textural changes (e. g. Luvisol), accumulated salts (e. g. <b>Solonchak)</b> or unfavorable soil structure (compaction, swelling/shrinking) were more impacted and had a slower recovery. Within a hot and dry temperate climate, there were major differences in the overall productivity rather than a different response to extreme events. These differences were mainly related to growth limiting conditions due to accumulated salts in the soil profile (e. g. Calcisol, <b>Solonchak).</b> Furthermore, it was found that vegetation activity of stable forest ecosystems was strongly impacted by extreme climatic events, especially in Northern Europe. The controlling fac- tors defining the impact of extreme warm and dry events were found to be a complex combinatory of soil, climate and ecophysiological properties (e. g. Podzols and mycorrhiza networks in Northern Europe). With the expected increase of extreme climatic events, the current stable and productive sys- tems will be most affected and large reductions in vegetation activity can be expected, partly {{due to the lack of}} ecophysiological adaptation of plants towards the change in climate...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the chemical speciation of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cr in four selected soil types {{representative of the}} more abundant agricultural soils in the central Ebro river valley in Aragón. Gypsisols, Calcisols, <b>Solonchaks</b> and Solonetzs represent around 20 % of the total soil surface in the region. A total of 12 selected sites have been sampled and five subsamples were taken in each site to create a composite sample. The four elements have been analysed by the sequential extraction procedure of Tessier et al. [Anal. Chem. 51 (1979) 844. ] by emission atomic spectrometry of solid state (ICP OES). Very little amounts of Fe and Mn were retrieved from the exchangeable phase, the ready available for biogeochemistry cycles in the ecosystems. Therefore, low quantities of Fe and Mn can be taken up by plants in these alkaline soils. Cr was not detected in the bioavailable forms as well as Zn that was only present in negligible amounts in very few samples. The absence of mobile forms of Cr in all soils eliminates the toxic risk both in the trophic chain and from its migration downwards the soil profile.

40|$|AbstractThe {{geochemistry}} of carbonatic/sulphatic soils of {{the southern}} Angara region is distinguished for its uniqueness as regards macro-as well as microelements. According to contents of some elements, the territory represents a contrasting positive geochemical anomaly: the soils are enriched above the average concentration (hereinafter referred to as Clarke) in Ca, S, Cl, P, Sr, Zn and Cu. But according to contents of many other elements, such as Rb, K, Ba, Cr, Ga, Zr, Ti and Pb, including lanthanides (Y, La, Ce, Pr and Nd), it is the territory of negative anomaly. Gleyic solonchaks are particularly strongly depleted, perhaps due to leaching the elements. Soils develop peculiar bonds between elements. Strong enrichment in P and Sr depends on sulfur accumulation in soils. Potassium depletion is accounted for by a deficiency of alumosilicates. Ba content decreases {{with an increase in}} the amount of calcium in the soil. The content of lanthanides depends directly on the amount of alumosilicates and indirectly on the content of carbonates. There is a difference in the geochemistry of separate lanthanides.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is a better {{understanding}} of the distribution and formation of salt efflorescences by mineralogical examination. Dominant sodium sulphate and sodium chloride surface efflorescences were selected for investigation. 24 samples were collected between 1999 and 2005 from 16 sites. The soil types were <b>solonchak</b> and meadow solonetz. Basic soil and groundwater analyses were performed according to the standard methods. Minerals were determined by X-ray diffractometry and SEM combined with microanalysis. The evaporation experiments were carried out in a Sanyo Versatile 350 HT environmental test chamber. It was concluded that common sulphate salts form rare and unique mineral associations on salt affected soils in Hungary. Comparing the groundwater compositions and the mineral associations of surface efflorescences or that of precipitated evaporites of groundwaters, the conclusion can be drawn that groundwater composition is reflected much better by the mineral association of experimentally precipitated evaporates of the groundwater than by the mineral associations of surface efflorescences. These differences suggest that the soil matrix may have an effect on the crystallization of minerals (e. g. gypsum, thenardite) in the efflorescences. The differences also suggest that in the surface efflorescences the precipitation process does not come to the end in all cases (minerals with high solubility are missing). Concerning the data on groundwater level depths in case of different (sodium carbonate versus sodium sulphate and sodium chloride) efflorescences, there is a tendency of declining groundwater table in the sequence of these soils. This difference can be explained by the difference (increase) in the solubility of various salt minerals. It was recognized that the change in the major component of surface efflorescenes in time (i. e. the sodium carbonate and sodium carbonate chloride versus sodium sulphate efflorescences before and after 1998) can be explained by the decline of the groundwater level and by the decreasing hydromorphic influence in the lowland area during the 19 th and 20 th century. Finally it can be stated that the presented research — which mainly focused on mineralogical aspects — has contributed to the earlier knowledge on surface salt efflorescences, which was based only on their chemical composition...|$|E
