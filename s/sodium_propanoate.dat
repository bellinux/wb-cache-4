40|$|Aq. solns. of <b>sodium</b> <b>propanoate</b> (NaOPr) and n-butanoate (NaOBu) {{have been}} studied at concns. of c ⪅ 3 M by {{broadband}} dielec. relaxation spectroscopy over the frequency range 0. 2 ≤ ν/GHz ≤ 89 at 25 °C. Three relaxation modes were resolved, centered at (approx.) 1, 8, and 18 GHz, for both sets of solns. The two faster modes {{were assigned to the}} cooperative relaxation of "slow" and bulk water mols. Detailed anal. of the spectra indicated that both OPr- and OBu- were strongly hydrated, with ∼ 23 and ∼ 33 slow water mols. per anion, resp., at infinite diln. These effective hydration nos. include ∼ 6 water mols. hydrophilically bound to the carboxylate moiety, with the remainder arising from the hydrophobic hydration of the nonpolar alkyl chains. The latter shows a characteristic rapid decrease with increasing solute concn., which facilitated the sepn. of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions. The lowest frequency mode was a composite with contributions from ion-cloud, ion-pair, and anion relaxations. Although this low intensity mode provided specific evidence of weak ion pairing between Na+(aq) and the carboxylate anions, reliable ests. of the assocn. const. could not be made because of its composite nature...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric {{relaxation}} spectra {{have been}} measured for aqueous solutions of sodium n-alkylcarboxylates (Cm- 1 H 2 m- 1 COONa, where m = 1 - 5), trifluoroacetate, benzoate, methylsulfate, and methanesulfonate {{over a wide}} range of frequencies (0. 2 ≤ v / GHz ≤ 89) up to the saturation limit at 25 °C. Measurements were also made on sodium acetate(aq) at 15 ≤ T/°C ≤ 35. The spectra were best described by a superposition of three Debye processes (3 D model), except for sodium formate which is best fitted with a 2 D model. The modes of the 3 D model can be assigned to bulk water relaxation centred at 18 - 20 GHz along with two other relaxations at relatively lower frequencies. In aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>propanoate,</b> butanoate, pentanoate and benzoate the relaxation process centred at 8 GHz is assigned to water molecules with reduced dynamics (‘slow water’) hydrating the anions, whereas for formate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, methylsulfate, and methanesulfonate this is a composite mode due to slow water and anion reorientation. For aqueous sodium acetate, trifluoroacetate, methylsulfate, and methanesulfonate the relaxation mode centred at 1 GHz, which was not resolved for aqueous sodium formate, is assigned to overlapping ion-cloud and ion-pair relaxations. For aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>propanoate,</b> butanoate, pentanoate and benzoate that mode (at 1 GHz), at lower concentrations, is a composite of ion-pair and/or ion-cloud relaxations and the reorientation of carboxylate anions, while at higher concentrations only the carboxylate ions contribute. From the amplitudes of bulk and slow water effective hydration numbers of the anions were determined. It turns out that –COO- binds 5 - 6 H 2 O molecules over the entire concentration range, with 1 - 2 of them essentially frozen on the timescale of our experiment. At low concentrations additionally 6 - 10 water molecules per –CH 3 respectively –CH 2 – group are slowed down in their rotational motions but this contribution strongly decreases with increasing salt concentration due to solvation-shell overlap and possibly anion clustering. At infinite dilution, –CF 3 and –C 6 H 5 (phenyl group) bind 15 and 27 slow H 2 O molecules respectively, due to hydrophobic hydration of these groups. However, the hydrophobic hydration number of these groups decreases strongly with increasing solute concentration. Methylsulfate and methanesulfonate also essentially slowdown the dynamics of H 2 O molecules in their hydration shell(s), with only 1 - 2 water molecules becoming completely immobilized on the DRS timescale in the case of methanesulfonate and none for methylsulfate. At infinite dilution, the total hydration number of methylsulfate and methanesulfonate is 14. 4 and 12. 5, respectively. Analysis of the relaxation mode centered at 1 GHz revealed that the association between Na+ and the biologically relevant anionic head groups (–COO-, –OSO 3 -, and –SO 3 -) in aqueous solutions is very weak and water mediated with formation of 2 SIPs. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{two stage}} Lucite Alpha Process for the {{industrial}} manufacturing of methyl methacrylate (MMA) {{represents one of}} the most efficient technologies currently available for the large scale production of this important chemical commodity. The second stage of this process, which involves the condensation of methyl propanoate (MeP) with formaldehyde over a heterogeneous fixed bed catalyst, however, still shows great scope for improvement. Herein the development of a novel homogeneous catalytic system that would promote the condensation of either propanoic acid or MeP with formaldehyde is explored. Since C–C bond forming reactions which proceed via C–H activation pathways typically display high atom efficiency, our efforts were particularly focussed on employing a functionalisation strategy that is mediated by C–H activation. In the case of propanoic acid, the possibility of achieving regioselective α-methylenation by linking the substrate to phosphorus was evaluated. Thus, a series of acyloxyphosphines and acylphosphites derived from either propionic acid or phenylacetic acid was prepared and, where stability allowed, fully characterised. Some of the resultant simple mixed anhydrides posed problems relating to their stability, and the stabilisation of such ligand systems by using electronic and / or steric effects was therefore explored. In addition, the coordination chemistry and in solution behaviour of Rh(I) and Ru(II) complexes containing these ligands was examined. Similar to the free ligands, complexes derived from these mixed anhydrides rearranged in solution via a number of decomposition pathways, with the specific pathway dependent {{on the nature of the}} auxiliary ligands. For most of these complexes, however, ligand decarbonylation was the route of preference for decomposition. Despite the instability of these complexes, a selection of Rh(I) mixed anhydride complexes were assessed for their potential as C-H activation catalysts in reactions aimed at the α-methylenation of saturated carboxylic acids. Furthermore, the stabilisation of Rh(I) mixed anhydride complexes with chelating auxilary ligands, such as bisphosphines or N-substituted diphosphinoamines, was explored. In particular, a series of new Rh(I) mixed anhydride complexes containing dppe, dppb and dppbz as secondary ligands were prepared and the effects of these secondary ligands on the in solution stability of these complexes assessed. As MeP represents the final product in the first stage of the Alpha process and not propanoic acid, the utilisation of PNP iridium pincer complexes in the regioselective sp³ C–H activation of MeP and related esters was also examined. The factors that govern the regioselectivity of such reactions were of great interest to us and, in particular, the effects of water on the reactivity and regioselectivity of these reactions were explored. For MeP, preferential C–H activation of the methoxy group was found to proceed under anhydrous conditions and the catalytic functionalisation of this site with ethene using this activation approach was considered. Formaldehyde, employed in the second stage of the Alpha process, is a difficult substance to manufacture and handle, especially on a large scale. A preliminary study on the in situ production of anhydrous formaldehyde via the catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol was therefore performed. During this study, catalytic systems based on carbonate salts and / or transition metal complexes were considered. In the hope of reducing the number of steps required in the production of MMA, a new one-pot cascade reaction for the indirect α-methylenation of MeP with methanol was developed. Although the production of MMA using this system only proceeded with low efficiency, the obtained results serve as an important proof of concept for future developments in this area. Finally, the capacity of a series of simple bases to catalyse the condensation of MeP with formaldehyde was assessed as part of a fundamental study directed towards determining the factors that govern the efficiency of this reaction. In addition, the extent to which each base effects the deprotonation in the α-position of MeP was determined with the aid of deuterium labelling experiments. Similarly, using <b>sodium</b> <b>propanoate</b> as model base a rough estimate of the kinetics of deprotonation could be made based on the degree of deuterium incorporation over time. These studies suggested that the low efficiency of this condensation reaction is not caused by ineffective deprotonation but rather by the weak nucleophilicity of the generated carbanion. For this reason, attempts to increase the electrophilicity of formaldehyde through Mannich-type condensations reactions involving secondary amine and carboxylic acid additives were made...|$|E
