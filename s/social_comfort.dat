No doubt she had received benefit from the discourses which she had heard from that gentleman each morning; and, let us hope, benefit also from the much longer discourses which she had heard from Mr Stumfold's curate on each evening. The Rev. Mr Maguire was very powerful, but he was also very long; and Miss Mackenzie, who was hardly as yet entitled to rank herself among the thoroughly converted, was inclined to think that he was too long. She was, however, patient by nature, and willing to bear much, if only some little might come to her in return.

Its other half, its poet, is Goethe, a man quite domesticated in the century, breathing its air, enjoying its fruits, impossible at any earlier time, and taking away, by his colossal parts, the reproach of weakness, which, but for him, would lie on the intellectual works of the period. He appears at a time when a general culture has spread itself, and has smoothed down all sharp individual traits; when, in the absence of heroic characters, a <b>social</b> <b>comfort</b> and cooperation have come in. There is no poet, but scores of poetic writers; no Columbus, but hundreds of post-captains, with transit-telescope, barometer, and concentrated soup and pemmican; no Demosthenes, no Chatham, but any number of clever parliamentary and forensic debaters; no prophet or saint, but colleges of divinity; no learned man, but learned societies, a cheap press, reading-rooms, and book-clubs, without number.

The appeal had been unnecessary and superfluous. It cannot be said that Phineas and his affairs were matters of as close an interest to Lady Chiltern as to Lady Laura. If any woman loved her husband beyond all things Lord Chiltern's wife did, and ever had done so. But there had been a tenderness in regard to the young Irish Member of Parliament, which Violet Effingham had in old days shared with Lady Laura, and which made her now think that all good things should be done for him. She believed him to be addicted to hunting, and therefore horses must be provided for him. He was a widower, and she remembered of old that he was fond of pretty women, and she knew that in coming days he might probably want money;--and therefore she had asked Madame Max Goesler to spend a fortnight at Harrington Hall. Madame Max Goesler and Phineas Finn had been acquainted before, as Lady Chiltern was well aware. But perhaps Lady Chiltern, when she summoned Madame Max into the country, did not know how close the acquaintance had been.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the grazing, <b>social</b> and <b>comfort</b> {{behaviour}} of the indigenous purebred Ankole cattle breed and crossbred (Holstein × Ankole) animals under typical management conditions in south western Uganda. Twelve focal animals in each of four groups (two groups per genotype) were observed regarding their grazing, <b>social</b> and <b>comfort</b> behaviour on pasture. No significant differences in grazing behaviour patterns (eating, walking, standing) were found between the genotypes. Resting occurred only very rarely in both genotypes. Walking distances of Ankole and Ankole × Holstein crosses were also similar. There was no difference in the occurrence of agonistic interactions between the two genotypes. However, Ankole cattle engaged in more non-agonistic social interactions than their crossbred counterparts. Individual distances were lower in Ankole heifers and more herd mates were found within a radius of 5 m around the Ankole animals. The most important comfort behaviour pattern in both genotypes was self-licking, which occurred to similar frequency in Ankole and crossbred heifer groups. Crossbred animals scratched themselves and rubbed on objects more often than Ankole heifers. Although Ankole cattle and their Holstein crosses did not differ in grazing, distances walked and agonistic behaviours, the significant differences between the two genotypes in herd cohesion and comfort behaviour may pose challenges on the management of crossbred animals under extensive open grazing conditions as present in south western Uganda. Thus, apart from (re) productive performance traits, behavioural traits of both genotypes may also be taken into account for breeding decisions and management under current production conditions...|$|R

When our world becomes unstable, we worry about losing our jobs, our professional standing, our income, and all the physical, psychological, and <b>social</b> <b>comforts</b> that come with these.

The attribute which sets this village a part from most other small countryside villages is the fact that the crime rate is amongst the lowest in Sweden as well as the social security feeling within the inhabitants are amongst the highest. We traveled 2298 kilometers back and forth to be able to interview professionals and gather empiric material for this study. The method we have used for data collection has been in the form of semi structured interviews. We have used previous research concerning collaboration, <b>social</b> <b>comfort,</b> social discomfort and fear of crime as our aid to analyze our findings with the help of theories regarding different types of communites (gemeinschaft and gesellschaft) invented by Ferdinand Tönnies (2001) and Human Service Organisation by Hasenfeld (1983).

I argue that, though animated by attitudes of awe (“awefull”), both leading scientists and religious founders have encountered the difficulty in representing and introducing this awe to the large public via “awesome” artifacts.

40|$|The {{effects of}} early life {{stressors}} on the developing infant can be severe. These effects include, {{but are not}} limited to, disordered attachment behavior in childhood, behavioral problems throughout childhood and adolescence, and increased risk for developing psychiatric illnesses later in life. Recent work in monkey models of early life stress suggests that the timing of the stressor is of paramount importance in determining the exact nature of the long-term behavioral disturbances. In monkeys, when stress is experienced at one-week of age, a pattern of decreased social affiliation and increased anxious behaviors develops that is not unlike children with the inhibited form of reactive attachment disorder. Conversely, if the stress is experienced at one-month of age, a pattern of increased social affiliation and increased anxious behaviors develops that resembles children with the disinhibited form of reactive attachment disorder. The work presented in this thesis describes two more features in this monkey model that depend on the timing of the early life stress. First, analysis of the acute behavioral response to the early life stress indicates that infants experiencing this stress at one-week of age immediately respond by increasing their level of nonsocial contact comforting behaviors, while infants experiencing the stress at one-month of age immediately respond by increasing their level of <b>social</b> <b>comforting</b> behaviors. It will be shown that the levels of each of these behaviors can predict aspects of the longer term behavior when measured between two and three months of age in their social rearing group environments. Next, it will be shown that gene expression in the amygdala, a brain region that controls socioemotional behaviors, also critically depends on the age at which early life stress is experienced. Furthermore, the expression of Guanylate Cyclase 1 á 3 in this brain region will be shown to correlate with certain differing aspects of behavior again measured between two and three months of age. Collectively, these studies may offer clues in determining very early which children are at risk for psychopathology following early life stress, and represent early work in determining a potential therapeutic target for the risks that ensue...|$|R

I tested these ideas in a seven-year, four-wave prospective longitudinal survey study of 450 amateur musicians.

Reliance on the combustion of fossil-fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, as sources of energy has, since the industrial revolution, caused atmospheric CO 2 to increase to the current level of 400 ppm by volume; an increase of 25 % from the 1960 s when monitoring started. Climatologists predict that an increase to 450 ppm would have irreversible effects on the Earth’s environment and recommend that, in order to preserve the conditions in which civilization developed, levels be reduced to below 350 ppm.
