40|$|A simple {{depth gauge}} has been {{designed}} to ensure, easily and quickly, the proper length of screws in bone surgery. The instrument of this type most often seen in general use consists of a slim steel bar with a hook or right angle on the distal end. Upon this rod is mounted a sliding metal collar with a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> to fix it firmly to the rod at the desired place. This device has certain drawbacks, the most important of which is that the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> must be screwed in firmly or not at all. When the instrument has been passed through the <b>screw</b> <b>hole,</b> the bent end engaged in the opposite cortex, and the sliding collar pushed against the proximal cortex, the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> must be engaged firmly. This C manoeuvre often prevents the dis- (i,) engagement of the instrument and its withdrawal from the drill hole.

The instrument described here (Fig. 1) is designed to overcome these difficulties. I...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{surgical}} treatment sequence for secondary orbitozygomatic complex (OZC) reconstruction is described. Orbital reconstruction is performed before OZC repositioning. A surgical plan is made: the affected OZC is virtually osteotomized and aligned with a mirrored {{model of the}} unaffected OZC. A patient-specific implant (PSI) is designed for orbital reconstruction. <b>Screw</b> <b>holes</b> from the primary reconstruction are used for fixation. Primary <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions at the repositioned OZC are embedded in the design, to guide OZC repositioning. A second patient-specific design is made for guidance at the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. The workflow was utilized in two patients. The PSI was positioned using navigation feedback. After repositioning of the zygomatic complex, the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions at the infraorbital rim and zygomaticomaxillary buttress seemed to align perfectly: no <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> adjustments were necessary. Minor deviations were seen between planned and acquired PSI position; the mean errors between planned and acquired OZC position were 1. 5 and 1. 2 mm. Orbital reconstruction with a PSI before OZC repositioning ensures true-to-original orbital reconstruction. The use of old <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions enables the PSI {{to be used as}} a static guide for ON repositioning. The combination of static and dynamic guidance increases predictability in secondary OZC reconstruction.

40|$|There have been, in some rare cases, {{difficulties}} with clamping of inserts with U-holes in their tool holder. According to the complaints, the inserts {{could not be}} properly clamped or could fracture when clamped. A study has shown that variations in clamping behaviour are mainly depending by {{the position of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in the tool holder and the centering of the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in the insert. The focus of this project has been the centering of <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in insert. It has been shown that the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> are not always enough centered in the insert. The problem may occur after a certain step in the production, i. e. peripheral grinding. Today, the centering can be measured by a certain measurement jig. The measurement jig has a very good Gauge R and R value but is not easy to use, especially {{if it is to be}} reinstated into the production. The aim of this thesis has been to use SmartScope for developing a new method for measuring the centering of <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in insert. The goal with the new method was to be able to measure faster and to be easier to use than the existing one. The project was started with exercises and exploration of some of the functions of SmartScope and its software Measuremind 3 D. Parallel with this, a study was made of the existing documentation for a better understanding of the problem. A method which measures how well the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> are centered in their inserts has been developed. The method consists of a number of measuring tools which are joined into a measurement sequence. Measurements of single inserts are fully automated. Provided that a system which picks and puts the inserts in specific locations can be implemented, a series of inserts can be measured fully automated.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringScrews {{are common}} {{orthopaedic}} hardware used {{to secure a}} fractured bone. After the bone has healed, the screws may be removed, and the vacant <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> introduce a potential site for re-fracture, which is a known complication. The current study simulated a laboratory torsional fracture test of a composite analogue tibia with vacant <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> by using a finite element (FE) model, and {{the results from the}} simulation were compared to those obtained experimentally. Variations of the FE model were also analyzed to investigate the effects of failure model, <b>screw</b> <b>holes,</b> element size, rotation direction, and simplification of the model's geometry. This FE model was set up the same as the experimental torsion test, with a section from the distal portion of the tibia. The proximal end of the section was subjected to an axial load and rotated, while the distal end was fixed. The FE model contained 102, 126 first order tetrahedral elements and 24, 817 nodes, and it utilized an isotropic linear elastic material law with material properties obtained from the composite analogue manufacturer. Comparisons between the FE model variations considered the fracture torque, fracture angle, torsional stiffness, principal stress contour, and maximum shear stress contour. The results predicted a fracture torque within the standard deviation of the experimental data, and the percent of strength reduction caused by the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> agreed with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAccurate {{positioning}} of locking screws depends on accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the locking compression plate (LCP). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion. HypothesisTilting and shallow locking <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> and combination-type holes make it difficult to insert the drill sleeve in the LCP. Materials and methodsTwenty-seven 3. 5 mm LCP metaphyseal insertion holes were selected (Philos®, LPHP®, DMTP®, low-band DMTP® [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the plate. Variables relating to LCP drill sleeve insertion time were analyzed. ResultsIt took an average 6. 6 seconds to insert the drill sleeve accurately in the holes. Insertion time increased with the tilt of the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> but not with shallowness. Insertion time in combination-type holes was longer (8. 8 seconds) than in single locking holes (5. 6 seconds).

5000|$|<b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the <b>set</b> <b>screw's</b> point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the <b>screw.</b> <b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R
