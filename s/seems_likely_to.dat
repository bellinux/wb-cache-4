5|$|Kaoru is the {{instructor}} of the Kamiya Kasshin martial-arts school. She inherited her fighting style {{and a small}} dojo from her father, who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died defending a comrade during the Seinan War. At {{the beginning of the}} story, Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone; she <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lose it when Kenshin helps her. Despite occasional mood swings and a reputation for bad cooking, she is independent, compassionate, courageous and a good fighter. In her first appearance, Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri Battosai, who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin-ryu. Kaoru is saved by the real Battosai, Himura Kenshin, and invites him to her dojo.|$|E
5|$|The {{extreme length}} of Æthelberht's reign {{also has been}} {{regarded}} with skepticism by historians; {{it has been suggested}} that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem: Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburh, <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E

Although there is still uncertainty about the motives of the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau—possibly a deranged outcast, possibly a religious extremist—the United States is reviewing security along the 5,525-mile (8,890km) line which separates the two countries (including the Alaskan land border).|$|E

25|$|Second, heat {{transfer}} from exhaust {{to the vehicle}} <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1g ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding were provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Although much {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread. Bodies of water have been found to serve as a reservoir, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera did not occur in the Americas for most of the 20th century after the early 1900s in New York City. It reappeared in the Caribbean toward the end of that century and <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> persist.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic {{power is}} also {{generated}} {{during a time}} of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23GW in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, due to support cuts in the large markets of Germany and Italy, strong growth <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue {{for the rest of the}} decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.|$|E

500|$|The {{means and}} speed {{by which the}} Picts {{converted}} to Christianity is uncertain. The process may have begun early. Evidence for this includes the fact that St. Patrick, active in the fifth century, referred {{in a letter to}} [...] "apostate Picts", indicating that they had previously been Christian, but had abandoned the faith. In addition the poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, does not remark on the Picts as pagans. Conversion of the Pictish élite <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have run over a considerable period, beginning in the fifth century and not complete until the seventh and conversion of the general population may have stretched into the eighth century.|$|E

500|$|There is a {{mandatory}} {{life sentence for}} murder in England and Wales. David Ormerod describes the evidence for abolishing it [...] instead giving judges discretion to impose a life sentence, or some lesser term [...] as [...] "overwhelming" [...] since murders and murderers differ greatly, as in any other crime. However, no government has yet, or <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to,</b> institute such reform. The former role of the Home Secretary in deciding the minimum time spent in jail was successfully challenged {{with reference to the}} ECHR in R v Home Secretary, ex p Anderson, but the mandatory life sentence itself has been judged compatible. The sentencing and release of life prisoners was reformed by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} when the ritualised custom of selling a wife by public auction first began, but it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{have been some}} time {{towards the end of}} the 17thcentury. In November1692 [...] "John, ye son of Nathan Whitehouse, of Tipton, sold his wife to Mr. Bracegirdle", {{although}} the manner of the sale is unrecorded. In 1696, Thomas Heath Maultster was fined for [...] "cohabiteing in an unlawful manner with the wife of George ffuller of Chinner... haueing bought her of her husband at 2d.q. the pound", and ordered by the peculiar court at Thame to perform public penance, but between 1690 and 1750 only eight other cases are recorded in England. [...] In an Oxford case of 1789 wife selling is described as [...] "the vulgar form of Divorce lately adopted", suggesting that even if it was by then established in some parts of the country it was only slowly spreading to others. It persisted in some form until the early 20th century, although by then in [...] "an advanced state of decomposition".|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} Christianity in Scotland has been {{traditionally}} seen as dependent on Irish-Scots [...] "Celtic" [...] missionaries {{and to a}} lesser extent those from Rome and England. Celtic Christianity had its origins in the conversion of Ireland from late Roman Britain associated with St. Patrick in the 5th century. In the 6th century, monks from Ireland were operating on the British mainland. St Ninian is the figure associated with a monastery founded at Whithorn in what is now Galloway, although it is generally accepted that Ninian may be a later construct. St Columba left Ireland and founded the monastery at Iona off the West Coast of Scotland in 563 and from there carried out missions to the Scots of Dál Riata and the Picts. It seems likely that both the Scots and Picts had already begun to convert to Christianity before this period. Saint Patrick referred in a letter to [...] "apostate Picts", suggesting that they had previously been Christian, while the poem Y Gododdin, set in the early 6th century does not remark on the Picts as pagans. Conversion of the Pictish élite <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have run over a considerable period, beginning in the 5th century and not complete until the 7th.|$|E
