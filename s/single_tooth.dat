5|$|In Spain {{there are}} several traditions about beings with vampiric tendencies. In Asturias {{highlights}} the Guaxa, which is described as an old vampire who sticks his <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> and sucks the blood of its victims. Cantabria equivalent exists in the name Guajona. Catalonia is {{the legend of the}} Dip, an evil vampire dog.|$|E
5|$|Microdontia of a <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> is {{more likely}} to occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in {{pituitary}} gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur {{on one side of the}} face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.|$|E
5|$|A <b>single</b> <b>tooth,</b> MACN Pv-RN 248, is {{currently}} {{identified as a}} Ferugliotherium upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium. Like the latter, it has cusps that are compressed {{from front to back}} and that are connected {{to the center of the}} crown by low crests.|$|E

50|$|Wareolestes rex {{was first}} found and named from the fossil mammal beds of Kirtlington, Oxfordshire, England. The holotype is a <b>single</b> molar <b>tooth,</b> {{originally}} {{described as a}} lower molar, but later argued to be an upper molar. Only a few more <b>single</b> <b>teeth</b> were found from the same site in the subsequent years.|$|R
5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} {{from a few}} dozen {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described {{on the basis of}} a <b>single</b> <b>tooth.</b> Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus was the {{original}} type species, but the holotype {{was based on a}} <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since. In March 2000, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature changed the type species to the much better known I. bernissartensis, with the new holotype being IRSNB 1534. The original Iguanodon tooth is held at Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand in Wellington, although it is not on display. The fossil arrived in New Zealand following the move of Gideon Mantell's son Walter there; after the elder Mantell's death, his fossils went to Walter.|$|E
5|$|The <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> of Trapalcotherium is {{identified}} as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps; as a first molar because it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as labial, {{in the direction of}} the lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, the direction of the tongue). The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide. Part of the back labial corner is missing.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{long-term}} {{follow-up study}} was to collect up to 17 years of survival data of endodontically treated <b>single</b> <b>teeth</b> {{with or without a}} prefabricated metal post. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Single</b> <b>teeth</b> were provided with direct composite resin core-crown reconstructions with or without posts by 15 operators. Restorations consisted of either a prefabricated metal post and a composite core-crown reconstruction or a post-free direct composite reconstruction. Allocation of either restoration was performed by balanced drawing. These restorations were not covered by an artificial crown. The study sample consisted of 87 patients who received 98 core-crown reconstructions. The performance of the restorations was evaluated based on data collected from the files of the clinicians currently monitoring the oral health of the patients. The survival probability was analyzed at different levels: on the restoration level and on the level of the tooth carrying the restoration. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival probabilities. RESULTS: Post placement showed no influence on the survival probability at either level (P >. 05). The estimated overall survival rate at 17 years was 53 % +/- 14 % at the restoration level and 79 % +/- 11 % at the tooth level. CONCLUSION: The results of this long-term follow-up study showed no difference in survival probabilities between different direct composite resin core-crown reconstructions of endodontically treated <b>single</b> <b>teeth</b> (with or without a post) ...|$|R

5|$|Tupaia miocenica is {{a fossil}} treeshrew from the Miocene of Thailand. Known {{only from a}} <b>single</b> <b>tooth,</b> an upper first or second molar, it is among the few known fossil treeshrews. With a length of 3.57mm, the tooth is large for a treeshrew. At the back lingual corner (the side of the tongue), the tooth shows a small cusp, the hypocone, that is {{separated}} from the protocone {{in front of it}} by a narrow valley. The condition of the hypocone distinguishes this species from various other treeshrews. In addition, the presence of a well-developed but simple mesostyle (a small cuspule) is distinctive.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E

5|$|Tupaia miocenica was {{described}} in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in {{a report on the}} fossil mammals of Li Mae Long, a Miocene site in Thailand. The animal is known from a <b>single</b> <b>tooth,</b> which according to Mein and Ginsburg's comparisons most closely resembles the living treeshrews of the genus Tupaia. The specific name, miocenica, refers to the animal's occurrence during the Miocene. Only a few other fossil treeshrews are known, and T.miocenica is the only fossil species from Thailand. When it {{was described}}, it was the only Miocene representative of Tupaia, but a second species, Tupaia storchi, was named from the Late Miocene of Lufeng, China, in 2012.|$|E
5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago) of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. It {{contains}} a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, {{on the basis of a}} single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, Trapalcotherium, was described in 2009 on the basis of a <b>single</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fossils of the extinct {{red panda}} Parailurus anglicus have been {{unearthed}} from China {{in the east}} to Britain in the west. In 1977, a <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington. This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia. In 2004, a tooth from a red panda species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. The tooth dates from 4.5–7 million years ago. This species, described as Pristinailurus bristoli, indicates that a second, more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene. Cladistic analysis suggests that Parailurus and Ailurus are sister taxa. Additional fossils of Pristinailurus bristoli were discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in 2010 and in 2012. The frequency with which panda fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played {{a large role in}} the overall ecosystem of the area.|$|E
5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a <b>single</b> <b>tooth</b> carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E

Materials and methodsA study comparing 3 different treatment alternatives for a <b>single</b> missing <b>tooth</b> was conducted. Data were collected by panoramic radiographic examination. Age, gender, and treatment method for a <b>single</b> missing <b>tooth</b> were recorded. Differences between the groups were examined using one-way ANOVA, and multiple comparisons were evaluated by using Tukey’s HSD test. A Chi-squared test was used to compare qualitative data. The significance level was set to 5 %. ResultsOf 1953 examined radiographs, 218 (11. 16 %) patients were found to have a <b>single</b> missing <b>tooth.</b> Of these 218 patients, 101 (46. 3 %) had FPD restorations, and 23 (10. 6 %) had IRCs. Ninety-four (43. 1 %) patients had no restorations. The mean age of patients with FPDs was significantly higher than that of patients with no restorations (P 0. 05). FPDs and IRCs in the anterior region were significantly more prevalent compared to the posterior region (P< 0. 01). ConclusionsThe great majority of patients with a <b>single</b> missing <b>tooth</b> had a higher interest in FPDs than IRCs. Patients with no replacement were also prevalent...|$|R
