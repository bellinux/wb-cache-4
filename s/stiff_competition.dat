5|$|Surrey University {{participates in}} an annual sports festival called the Varsity Games. The {{university}} competes against other {{institutions such as}} Royal Holloway, University of London and Kingston University.

5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. The practice was to avoid games on Thursday and Monday nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> from Thursday Night Football, ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, and Monday Night Football.|$|E
5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> was present in the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E

50|$|The 1980s {{started with}} a {{worldwide}} steel depression. That, coupled with <b>stiffer</b> <b>competition,</b> resulted in a significant downturn for the company.

5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> {{from each}} other and from third parties {{interested}} in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett {{has pointed}} out {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal {{that resulted in a}} $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin {{had to deal with the}} arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E
5|$|The hotel faced <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> {{from the}} early 20th century, {{with a range of}} new hotels {{springing}} up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), The St. Regis (1904), The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.|$|E

5|$|Faced with <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> and an {{inability}} to increase its own capacity, Rogers Locomotive Works was purchased by ALCO in 1905. Rogers' last independently built locomotive was serial number 6271, a 0-6-0 tank locomotive built for W. R. Grace & Company in February 1905. ALCO continued building locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913 when manufacturing at the plant ceased permanently. Locomotives built at the Rogers plant under ALCO are generally referred to as locomotives built by ALCO-Rogers. ALCO used the Rogers plant buildings as warehouses well into the 1920s, but eventually sold off all of the property. The original Rogers erecting shop was converted into office space and was still in use in that manner as late as 1992.|$|E
40|$|The largest U.

An alternative to the traditional bank office, the supermarket branch enables banks to improve the efficiency of the branch network and offer greater convenience to customers. Although the largest U. S. {{commercial banks}} have enjoyed strong earnings in recent years, they are under considerable pressure to restructure their retail opera-tions. A stagnant deposit base and <b>stiffer</b> <b>competition</b> in the marketplace for financial services have made the overhead costs of an extensive branch network increas-ingly onerous. To cut costs and remain competitive, these banks are deploying phone centers, introducing the next generation of automated teller machine...|$|R

5|$|None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake {{the nightly}} ratings crown, but World News Tonight still offered <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> at second place. As the {{millennium}} approached, Jennings {{and the network}} started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped The New York Times Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, The Century; production on the monumental project started in 1990, {{and by the time}} it aired, it had cost the network $25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, , on the History Channel in April 1999.|$|E

Chambers won all his preliminary races and reached the final, along with Lewis-Francis and Jason Gardener, but he suffered a cramp mid-race {{and ended up in}} last place. He later revealed that he had feigned injury as the brief hamstring cramp was caused by drug abuse. The English sprinters had the three slowest times in the final, with Lewis-Francis also beset by injury.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of the {{two films}} was marred by Donner's bad {{relationship}} with the Salkinds, with Richard Lester acting as mediator. With the film going over-budget, the filmmakers decided to temporarily cease production of II and move that film's climax into the first film. Despite Supermans success, Donner {{did not return to}} finish Superman II, and it was completed with Lester, who gave the film a more tongue-in-cheek tone. The Salkinds also cut Brando for financial reasons, while John Williams quit as composer due to turning his attention to other projects. Superman II was another financial and critical success, despite <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the same year. In 2006, after receiving many requests for his own version of Superman II, Richard Donner and producer Michael Thau produced their own cut of the film and released it on November 28, 2006. The new version of the film received positive response from critics and the stars of the original film.|$|E

It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to stay inside the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart.

Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E
5|$|When Gilberto {{moved to}} England and began {{training}} with Arsenal, {{he bought a}} house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire. Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to the new way of life in London. However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool {{in the second half of}} the FA Community Shield game in which he scored the winning goal. As the 2002–03 FA Premier League season began, Gilberto faced <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> for a place in midfield from compatriot Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002. However, his legal problems continued, since his transfer to England still was not fully resolved. As a result, Gilberto instructed his lawyers to start legal proceedings against Atlético Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002. For the second half of the 2002–03 season, he remained a regular starter in the Arsenal side. Even though he suffered a lapse in form towards the end of the season, he won an FA Cup winner's medal, playing in the final at the Millennium Stadium as Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced <b>stiff</b> <b>competition</b> from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E
