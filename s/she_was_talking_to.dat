500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Brynden [...] "Blackfish" [...] Tully in the series, {{spoke about}} his character's {{encounter}} with Brienne of Tarth, {{in an interview}} with IGN, noting [...] "Brienne represented for him his young self, a person of integrity, a soldier of integrity, {{trying to do the right}} thing. That added to the conflict he felt of what was the right thing to do: whether to send men to Sansa or not." [...] He continued by saying about their relationship to each other, [...] "She spoke very clearly to power. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> an older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where he acknowledges that to her face. It's very touching and sad, and I think that's what it's about. He's really recognizing the next generation of what I once was." ...|$|E
500|$|The Doctor takes Clara to {{the next}} morning in the TARDIS, and {{they go to a}} cafe to try to {{understand}} the happenings. [...] Clara uses computer skills that she picked up from her uploading experience to track the uploaders to their base at the Shard. [...] The Doctor encounters people inside the café under the control of Miss Kizlet who distract him long enough for a server disguised as the Doctor to upload Clara completely. An angered Doctor sets out to the Shard on an anti-gravity motorbike and crashes it into Miss Kizlet's office. He demands that she release all the minds that have been uploaded, but Miss Kizlet refuses. The Doctor then reveals that he is still at the café and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the server he had hacked which he then uses to upload Miss Kizlet to the network. Trapped in the network, she orders her subordinates to release her (with the Doctor ensuring that they do so using a pad that controls her employees). By doing this, everyone else including Clara, is restored.|$|E
