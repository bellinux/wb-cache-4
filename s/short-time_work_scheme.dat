30|$|However, Germany is not {{the only}} country that has gone through the crisis without a {{significant}} rise in unemployment. For example, the Netherlands had a similar experience. And indeed, there are factors that make both cases comparable. First, the Netherlands experienced a transitory shock in external demand. The nature of the main shock was therefore similar to that in Germany. Second, the Netherlands also faces long-term shortages of skilled workers, which created incentives for firms to retain their qualified workforce during the crisis. Moreover, it is also the case that Dutch firms were in a financially good position when the crisis hit the country, and the government created a new <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>scheme</b> during the crisis (Cahuc and Carcillo, [2011]). These factors appear important to adopt and to sustain a strategy of labor hoarding during the Great Recession. The crisis also had a relatively modest impact on the Austrian labor market. Similar to Germany and the Netherlands, the crisis hit the country as a transitory external demand shock, and a <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>scheme</b> existed during the crisis. Additionally, Austria is expected to face long-term shortages of skilled workers (Walterskirchen, [2001]).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> as a device to mitigate {{the negative effects of}} the current global recession on employment levels. <b>Short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> have been regarded as a popular and successful counter-cyclical policy to maintain workers in employment. However, by comparing and contrasting the experience of Germany and Italy, we argue that the effectiveness of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> should only be evaluated in relation to (i) the institutional set-up within which they operate, and (ii) the whole set of labour market policies adopted by each country...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 18 June 2014 Examining Board: Professor Russell Cooper, Penn State University, Supervisor Professor Arpad Abraham, EUI Professor E. J. Bartelsman, VU University Amsterdam Professor Christian Bayer, University of Bonn. The three {{chapters}} of this thesis {{contribute to a}} literature which {{emphasizes the importance of}} microeconomic heterogeneity for macroeconomic outcomes. In my work I focus on firm heterogeneity. I investigate the US labor market implications of a drop in the number of new firms, study the cyclical effects on productivity due to limits in the reallocation of capital across firms, and quantify the effectiveness of a policy which attempted to save jobs in Germany by altering firm incentives for lay-offs. The first chapter of this thesis investigates the role of new firms (‘start-ups’) in the US labor market. Start-ups and young firms grow faster and create more net jobs than older, incumbent firms. Yet since 2007 the number of start-ups in the US has declined by over 20 %, accounting for {{a large part of the}} persistently high unemployment rate. I claim that this fact is related to the unprecedented fall in the value of real estate. Based on the empirical evidence I construct a model that captures the idea that start-ups require external financing, for which real estate is used as collateral. I calibrate and compute a quantitative competitive industry model with endogenous entry and exit, firm heterogeneity, labor adjustment costs, and aggregate shocks. It generates a ‘jobless recovery’ similar to what we observed in the US in the aftermath of the 2007 - 09 recession and is able to explain over 80 % of the increase and persistence in unemployment since the recession. The second chapter, joint work with Russell Cooper, studies the productivity implications of frictions in the reallocation of factors. Recent empirical work has shown that misallocation of factors can have sizeable effects on the levels of aggregate output and productivity. We are interested in the question whether these frictions can also produce important cyclical movements. We find that the effects are quantitatively important in the presence of fluctuations in adjustment frictions and/or the cross sectional variation of profitability shocks. These fluctuations depend on higher order moments of the joint distribution of capital and plant-level productivity rather than mean values alone. Even without aggregate productivity shocks, the model has quantitative properties that resemble those of a standard stochastic growth model and match important facts about the cyclicality of reallocation and firm productivity dispersion. The last chapter, joint work with Russell Cooper and Moritz Meyer, studies the employment and productivity implications of short-time work (‘Kurzarbeit’) in Germany. During the years 2009 - 10 this policy was intended to provide incentives for firms to adjust labor input by reducing hours per worker instead of firing workers. Using confidential German firm micro data we estimate a model of costly labor adjustment. We use the estimated model to simulate the effects of the policy during the recent recession, trying to quantify in how far the German <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>scheme</b> reduced the allocative efficiency of the German labor market...|$|E
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> {{will depend on}} their design and {{the context in which}} they are applied.

The {{effectiveness of}} <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> also depends on other labour market institutions in the national setting.

30|$|Boeri and Bruecker (2011) {{document}} the cross-country impact of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> {{during the crisis}} (including Luxembourg). They report that <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> take-up dampens the response of employment and identify a threshold at which <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> begins to help prevent employment losses (GDP contraction of 1.5 % or more). Using these parameter estimates, they calculate {{the number of jobs}} potentially saved by these schemes during 2008 – 2009. For Luxembourg, up to 0.3 % of 2008 Q 4 employment may have been saved. However, Boeri and Bruecker (2011) note that the application of the same coefficients across all countries may underestimate these effects for countries with efficient <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> arrangements already in place.|$|R
50|$|Employment {{protection}} legislation (EPL) {{includes all}} types of employment protection measures, whether grounded primarily in legislation, court rulings, collectively bargained conditions of employment, or customary practice. The term is common among circles of economists. Employment protection refers both to regulations concerning hiring (e.g. rules favouring disadvantaged groups, conditions for using temporary or fixed-term contracts, training requirements) and firing (e.g. redundancy procedures, mandated prenotification periods and severance payments, special requirements for collective dismissals and <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes).</b>|$|R
30|$|It {{follows that}} the size of the slump needed to make a {{separation}} efficient is increasing in the degree of fixity, which varies across types of workers and depends positively on the size of recruitment and training costs, and the expected length of the employment relationship (Oi 1962). Recent studies of the effect of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> explore this argument in more detail. Arpaia et al. (2010) cite avoidance of dismissal costs and savings on recruitment and training costs as strong incentives for employers to participate in <b>short-time</b> <b>work.</b> Crimmann et al. (2010) also note that firms enrolling in such schemes must first assess the direct monetary costs associated with heavy workforce turnover.|$|R

30|$|Boeri and Bruecker (2011) also {{investigate}} how <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> interact with labour market institutions. They find that EPL strictness and bargaining centralisation indices have {{positive effects on}} national <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> take-up rates, supporting the hypotheses presented in the previous section. They also investigate the impact of firm business conditions, structural characteristics, human capital investment and labour force composition on firm take-up rates. Using German establishment data for 2009, they find that both a fall in past sales and low expectations for future revenue negatively affect the take-up rate, while high competitive pressures induce firms to increase it. The authors conclude that <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> “take-up rates are mainly affected by contemporaneous or anticipated shocks rather than by long-lasting structural problems”. Furthermore, the intensity of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> use increases with firm size, export share and share {{of research and development}} activities. Interestingly, the share of employees with higher educational attainment is associated with lower take-up, and the negative impact increases with the level of education. The share of employees on part-time or fixed-term contracts appears to reduce the share of firm employment in <b>short-time</b> <b>work,</b> supporting the hypothesis that permanent employees provide stronger incentives for firm participation. Finally, collective pay agreements do not have a clear effect on firm participation, although the impact may be negative.|$|R
30|$|The results {{indicate}} the STW raises hours flexibility {{by increasing the}} contemporaneous output elasticity of working time and helps to preserve jobs {{in the context of}} a recession by making employment and unemployment less elastic with respect to output. A key finding is that the timing of STW is crucial. <b>Short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> had a significant impact on preserving jobs during the crisis. The largest impact is observed in Germany, Italy and Japan where in the second half of 2009 employment is estimated to have been, respectively, 580.000, 130.000 and 445.000 higher than what it would have in the absence of STW. However, the same estimates also suggest that the continued use of STW during the recovery exerted a negative influence over the job-content of the recovery. As a result, the net effect on employment has fallen importantly in the recovery and in a few countries even has become negative.|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{literature}} {{arguing that}} countries with high employment protection legislation have worst labour market performance. Yet, the overall impact of the crisis on France’s labour market was comparatively limited. To solve this puzzle, this paper makes four points. First, it shows that France’s labour market problems have not historically been about high EPL. Second, the crisis in France was not as acute as in the Euro area. Third, {{the costs of the}} crisis were concentrated on certain labour market groups. Finally, the government introduced several labour market policies in response to the crisis and labour market dualisation increased despite falling policy dualism. While deregulation seems – if anything - to have made matters worse, the government also introduced <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes,</b> prolonged unemployment benefits, and extended active labour market policies. Overall this paper advances our understanding of labour market performance and policies in France during the crisis...|$|R
50|$|According to Barone (2001) {{with the}} acronym EPL economists {{refer to the}} entire set of {{regulations}} that place some limits to the faculties of firms to hire and fire workers, {{even if they are}} not grounded primarily in the law, but originate from the collective bargaining of the social partners, or are a consequence of court rulings. In particular, provisions favouring the employment of disadvantaged groups in society, determining the conditions for the use of temporary or fixed-term contracts, or imposing training requirements on the firm, affect hiring policies, while redundancy procedures, mandated pre-notification periods and severance payments, special requirements for collective dismissals and <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> influence firing decisions. The nature of these restrictions on the firms’ freedom to adjust the labour input is quite similar in all OECD countries, but the actual procedural details and the overall degree of stringency implied by them varies considerably. These provisions are enforced through the worker’s right to appeal against his lay-off.|$|R
40|$|Government {{schemes that}} {{compensate}} workers {{for the loss}} of income while they are on short hours (known as <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> compensation <b>schemes)</b> make it easier for employers to temporarily reduce hours worked so that labor is better matched to output requirements.

3000|$|While {{employment}} growth slowed down, {{it did not}} turn negative between 2008 and 2015 despite the sharp contraction in the export-oriented manufacturing sector, but also construction, transportation, as well as banking activity. In {{the second half of}} 2009 job creation effectively came to a standstill, with employment remaining virtually unchanged (excluding independent workers). Despite the severity of the GDP decline, employment adjustment remained small, reflecting significant labour hoarding. Firms’ preference to reduce hours worked rather than employment levels relates to extensive use of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> (e.g. in manufacturing) and structural shortages of skilled labour (e.g. in the banking sector). In the latter case, firms’ reluctance to cut jobs may reflect expected difficulties in the recruitment of new employees with required skills in the next upturn. Cross-border workers, who account for more than 40 % of total domestic employment, were particularly severely affected by the crisis. This is mainly related to the fact that cross-border workers are overrepresented in sectors with high shares of temporary contracts or internationally-oriented sectors (e.g. manufacturing, finance, business services and transportation). 8 [...]...|$|R
30|$|As expected, higher {{unemployment}} {{is associated with}} a reform stance leaning towards an increased generosity of unemployment benefits and extensions of ALMPs. The reform stance in Labour Taxation is instead strongly negatively related to the unemployment rate. Quite intuitively, deep crises are linked to reforms towards less regulated Wage Setting systems and more generous Active Labour Market Policies. Episodes of large and negative output gaps are associated with an increased need to improve the responsiveness of wage setting to the labour market slack and to re-train and re-qualify the long-term unemployed and re-integrate into the labour force those that have dropped out of the labour force. Deep crises are also associated to less generous Other Welfare Benefits. Episodes of output gaps below minus 4 % are often associated with situations of protractedly high unemployment. In those conditions, benefit generosity (particularly <b>Short-Time</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Schemes)</b> is often brought back to its previous level to prevent benefit dependency after having been increased during the years where unemployment has been building up.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper aims at {{analyzing}} the astonishingly mild {{response of the}} German labor market to the severe demand shock {{that occurred in the}} aftermath of the financial crisis.

The crisis mainly affected export-oriented manufacturing firms in Germany’s thriving regions. Before the crisis those firms were the engines of growth and suffered from a shortage of qualified professional workers. Moreover, training costs are relatively high and dismissals would entail a significant loss in firm-specific human capital. Supported by the generous <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes,</b> these factors contributed to the high willingness of crisis-stricken firms to pursue a strategy of massive labor hoarding. By contrast, the comparatively high employment protection does not seem to play a major role in explaining the adjustment behavior of German firms in the current crisis...|$|R

40|$|This report summarises {{the changes}} OECD {{countries}} {{have made to}} their labour market policies {{in response to the}} downturn, as of mid- 2009. All countries have implemented one or more changes to directly sustain labour demand, either through expanding job subsidy or public sector job creation programmes, lowering employer social contributions, establishing or expanding <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes,</b> or some combination of the three.  On policies to improve the employment prospects of the unemployed, much of the focus is on expanding the capacity of public employment services, job search assistance and training programmes. Relatively few countries have formally altered activation or mutual obligation requirements in response to worsening labour market conditions, and where they have, requirements have been tightened in most cases.  Around half of OECD countries have moved to increase the incomes of job losers by increasing the generosity of unemployment benefits or extending coverage to those previously excluded. A number of countries have also provided new or expanded support for job losers through social assistance, training allowances, housing support or health insurance.  While most of the policy responses have focused on those out of work {{as the result of the}} downturn, a number of countries have stepped up resources for training existing workers or apprentices to improve their labour market prospects or provide income support for low income earners through the tax system...|$|R
40|$|The Great Recession {{triggered}} {{a resurgence of}} <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> (STW) throughout the OECD. Several countries introduced from scratch STW or significantly expanded {{the scope of the}} programmes already in place. In some countries like Italy, Japan and Germany between 2. 5 and 5 per cent of the workforce participated in <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> at the trough of the recession. In this paper we analyse the rationale for short time work benefits and their effects on labour adjustment from both a cross-country and a time-series perspective. We find that STW actually contributed to reduce job losses during the Great Recession. However, the number of jobs saved, according to our macroeconomic estimates, is smaller than the full-time equivalents jobs involved by these programmes, pointing in some cases to sizeable deadweight costs. Other institutions, like plant-level bargaining over hours, wages and employment levels may be more effective than STW in encouraging adjustment along the intensive margins in presence of temporary shocks. Our results also suggest that STW cannot be readily extended to countries having much different institutional configurations as the demand for STW is very much affected by other institutions such as employment protection legislation and the degree of centralization of collective bargaining. The micro evidence from firm-level data in Germany is more encouraging as to the effectiveness of STW, pointing to rather moderate deadweight losses. We interpret this result as due to specific design features of the German STW that could make it more effective in addressing the moral hazard problems related to reliance on subsidised hour reductions. The German Kurzarbeit scheme is indeed discouraging 100 per cent hours reductions and is experience-rated. intensive margin, short-time...|$|R
30|$|So {{the impact}} of an {{increase}} in the prevalence of part-time work on poverty will depend on how these key determinants of poverty risks for part-timer are affected. The wages of part-timers may have decreased or gone up during the crisis, depending on which jobs became redundant and which were created. The most insecure low-paid jobs are usually the first to go during the recession, but at the same time, labour law reforms allowed precisely more insecure low-level part-time jobs to be created (Lang et al. 2013). On the other hand, the poverty risk for some part-time workers may have been limited with the expansion of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> (Hijzen and Venn 2011; Leschke 2012). The way household employment patterns changed may be even more important. In the initial phase of the crisis, a shift took place from dual to female breadwinner couples, which was more pronounced in countries that were hit the hardest (European Commission 2013 c). A number of studies looking at the added worker effect during the recent crisis have found strongly variable patterns across Europe (Cho and Newhouse 2013; Ghignoni and Verashchagina 2012; Khitarsishvili 2013). An increase in male involuntary part-time employment may indicate short-time working to avoid lay-offs; a substantial increase in the numbers of involuntary female part-timers may suggest incomplete added worker effects (European Commission 2013 c). This can explain why during the crisis the share of labour income obtained from part-time workers increased for households in the bottom quintiles (Bazen and Salverda 2015).|$|R
40|$|The Great Recession {{that has}} haunted the world since 2008 {{has made the}} crucial {{importance}} of effective public employment services (PES) pain- fully apparent. Unemployment has been hovering at about 10 per cent in the European Union (EU) and the USA, long-term unemployment {{is on the rise}} almost everywhere in the Western world, and in many places youth unemployment is over 20 per cent, leaving behind entire lost generations. But even before the global financial crisis, un- and under- employment was a challenge for policy-makers and individual workers alike. For that reason, PES have long been important institutions for the operation of modern labour markets, performing tasks that range from the provision of financial assistance to workers without jobs to acting as critical players in matching vacancies with jobseekers and equipping workers with the skills they need to succeed in rapidly changing labour markets. In many countries, they also function as the ‘employer of last resort’ through the organization of direct job creation schemes, the facilitation of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> (Kurzarbeit) and/or the provision of employment subsidies to firms willing to train or hire disadvantaged workers. Given their pivotal role, {{it is hardly surprising that}} PES have been exposed to massive modernization efforts in recent decades, frequently resulting in complete restructuring. Most of these reforms have been driven by a strong belief in the value of ‘new public management’ (NPM) techniques that revolve around introducing new systems of performance, quality and case management, while separating purchasers from service providers (Weishaupt, 2010 a) ...|$|R
30|$|In Germany, for example, (un)employment has {{adjusted}} by a {{much smaller}} margin, while hours worked have decreased much more than in most European countries. According to some economists, {{this was due to}} the extensive use of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> (STW) <b>schemes</b> such as Kurzarbeit in Germany (Boeri and Brückner 2011); but others have suggested that, since the use of such arrangements, was not much greater than in recessions in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the use of short time work cannot alone explain the remarkable resilience of the German labour market 5. In contrast, evidence for the United States reveals that employers resorted more towards external adjustment rather than internal mechanisms (namely, hours worked and wages), despite firms using the hours worked “margin“ more than in any previous recession (Fernald 2012). Section 2.3 describes in depth these different channels of labour market adjustment, as they are {{important to keep in mind}} when doing cross-country comparisons.|$|R
30|$|While low {{individual}} earnings {{are an important}} part of the story, most low-paid individuals are not poor, essentially because poverty is (conventionally) assessed at the level of the household (Marx and Nolan 2014). The majority of the working poor are single earner households, whereas many part-time workers are in dual earner households. The poverty risk of part-time workers thus depends on the household context and varies widely across individuals for that reason but also across countries reflecting the differing roles that part-time work plays in the household income ‘package’ (Rodgers 2003; Debels 2008); (Horemans and Marx 2013). The fact that part-time jobs are often concentrated among women with caring responsibilities (Fouarge and Muffels 2008) also means that the households affected are more likely to include child and elderly dependants, which also affects their poverty risk since household income will be adjusted to take the number of persons relying on it into account in assessing poverty status. The final element in understanding the poverty risk for part-timers is social protection, and here, limited entitlements for part-timers to benefits may play an important role. Hours and/or earnings thresholds restrict access to unemployment benefits for part-time workers, especially for those in marginal or few-hours part-time jobs (Leschke 2007; OECD 2010). For other type of benefits like pensions and sickness, there may be restrictions as well (Buschoff and Protsch 2008). On the other hand, especially in countries where ‘making work pay’ has been prominent (Immervoll and Pearson 2009; Marx and Verbist 2008; Marchal and Marx 2015), there may be supports directed at part-time and other low-paid workers to maintain their link with the labour market (European Commission 2011). In the economic crisis, <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes</b> to keep unemployment down have involved benefits (Hijzen and Venn 2011).|$|R
30|$|The {{reaction}} of the German labor market to the Great Recession 2008 / 09 was – especially compared to other countries – relatively mild. This “German Miracle” occurred due to various reasons. On the one hand, Germany had to – unlike countries such as Ireland and the United States, which both faced a slump in domestic demand combined with a real estate crisis – deal with a world demand shock that mostly affected economically strong firms (Rinne and Zimmermann 2011; Schneider and Gräf 2010). On the other hand, various flexibility instruments at the firm level, combined with discretionary adjustments of the institutional framework by policy makers (i.e. enhancement of the <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> <b>schemes),</b> enabled firms to adjust their workforce along the internal rather than the external margin (Möller 2010). In addition, far reaching labor market reforms between 2002 and 2005, initiated to fight the high and persistent unemployment that had evolved {{since the end of}} the seventies, had significantly altered the core elements of the labor market, including active and passive labor market policies, the organizational structure of labor offices as well as the pension system. The speed and depth of the reforms were quite remarkable when it is considered that the German welfare state had been typically depicted as the prime example of a “frozen welfare state”, highly resistant to change (see, among others, Esping-Andersen 1990; Manow and Seils 2000; Kemmerling and Bruttel 2005; Konle-Seidl et al. 2010). In summary, the actions taken during the reforms led to higher working incentives and better matching between labor demand and supply in the period before the Great Recession, and were therefore considered as one of the main reasons for the mild reaction (Gartner and Klinger 2010). The reforms also had the general goal of increasing the labor force participation of those with young families.|$|R
30|$|There {{has been}} a strong {{interest}} in <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> (STW) <b>schemes</b> during the global financial crisis. Using data for 23 OECD countries for the period 2004 Q 1 to 2010 Q 4, this paper analyses the quantitative effects of STW programmes on labour market outcomes. Special attention is given to the dynamic aspects of the relationship between output shocks and labour market outcomes. The results indicate the STW raises hours flexibility by increasing the output elasticity of working time and helps to preserve jobs {{in the context of a}} recession by making employment and unemployment less elastic with respect to output. A key finding is that the timing of STW is crucial. While STW helped preserving a significant number of jobs during the crisis, its continued use during the recovery may have slowed the job-content of the recovery. By the end of 2010, the net effect of STW on employment was negligible or may even have become negative. However, the gross impact of STW on the number of jobs saved per quarter remains large and positive in the majority of countries.|$|R
40|$|In all European countries, {{emergency}} policy {{measures have}} been introduced in order to counteract the employment consequences of the economic crisis.

Countries which already had STW schemes, such as Kurzarbeit in Germany and Austria and the Cassa Integrazione Guadagni (CIG) in Italy, have loosened the eligibility requirements and extended their maximum duration. This paper focuses on the issue whether the economic crisis has spurred any convergence in the use of STW in these three social-insurance countries - Austria, Germany and Italy - or whether policy change has rather occurred in a path-dependent fashion. In order to do so, the paper also adopts a systemic approach, focusing on relationships of complementarity or functional substitution and equivalence among the various schemes comprising income maintenance systems to tackle the risks of partial or total unemployment. In addition to shedding light on a rather under-researched province of contemporary welfare states such as STW, this article also aims to contribute to the debate on the analytical levels in the study of social policy by showing the relevance and potential of adopting an intermediate level of analysis between a regime-centred and a programme-centred approach. short time work; unemployment compensation; social protection; convergence; path dependenc...|$|R

We argue that this expansion of <b>short-time</b> <b>work</b> is an inefficient way to provide insurance to workers, as it entails cross-subsidies which reduce aggregate production.
