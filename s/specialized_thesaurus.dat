40|$|In {{our second}} {{participation}} in the CLEF retrieval tasks, our first objective was to propose better and more general stopword lists for various European languages (namely, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Finnish) along with improved, simpler and efficient stemming procedures. Our second goal was to propose a combined query-translation approach that could cross language barriers and also an effective merging strategy based on logistic regression for accessing the multilingual collection. Finally, within the Amaryllis experiment, we wanted to analyze how a <b>specialized</b> <b>thesaurus</b> might improve retrieval effectiveness...|$|E

In the present work we investigate the possibilities to find synonyms for terms of the parliaments thesaurus automatically. We propose to use distributional similarity (DS). In an experiment with pairs of synonyms and non-synonyms we train and test a classifier using distributional similarity and string similarity. Using ten-fold cross validation we were able to classify 75 % of the pairs of a set of 6000 word pairs correctly...|$|E

The analysis results {{of this type of}} resources are compared with the terms included into a <b>specialized</b> <b>thesaurus</b> in this area. By this comparative study, the author systematizes which are the contributions of the free tagging in front of the traditional skills on content analysis. The thesauri can make good use of the folksonomies like a high quality source for updating and expanding the terminological scope. This aim must be considered a priority if a central role for thesauri in the full-text search systems is pretended in an immediate future...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{analysis}} of methods for automatic generation of a specialized thesaurus. The main algorithm of generation consists of three stages: selection and preprocessing of a text corpus, recognition of thesaurus terms, and extraction of relations among terms. Our work is focused on exploring methods for semantic relation extraction. We developed a test bench that allow to test well-known algorithms for extraction of synonyms and hypernyms. These algorithms are based on diﬀerent relation extraction techniques: lexico-syntactic patterns, morpho-syntactic rules, measurement of term information quantity, general-purpose thesaurus WordNet, and Levenstein distance. For analysis of the result thesaurus we proposed a complex assessment that includes the following metrics: precision of extracted terms, precision and recall of hierarchical and synonym relations, and characteristics of the thesaurus graph (the number of extracted terms and semantic relationships of diﬀerent types, the number of connected components, {{and the number of}} vertices in the largest component). The proposed set of metrics allows to evaluate the quality of the thesaurus as a whole, reveal some drawbacks of standard relation extraction methods, and create more eﬃcient hybrid methods that can generate thesauri with better characteristics than thesauri generated by using separate methods. In order to illustrate this fact, one of such hybrid methods is considered in the paper. It combines the best standard algorithms for hypernym and synonym extraction and generates a <b>specialized</b> medical <b>thesaurus.</b> The hybrid method leaves the thesaurus quality on the same level and ﬁnds more relations between terms than well-known algorithms. </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the suggestion of}} a Music Microthesaurus, MiMu, with terms based in articles found in the Teclado & Áudio magazine and in references from the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, aiming the specialization of music-related subject representations, therefore seeking better indexing and retrieval of desired information. It also features a literature review concerning aspects of music-related documentation, emphasizing the librarian’s role in that process and issues related to the retrieval of information taking into account the various supports of music documents. The review includes a referential approach to the main themes of documentary languages, analyzing natural and controlled languages, schemes of documentary classifications, exemplifying of some that are used in music, and concept theory and terminology. It presents definitions and functions of thesauruses, given the origins of terms and their applications, exemplifying the collection of terms, the categorization and the process of relationships, as well as the thesaurus’ presentation and considerations about the applicability of specific software. In the methodology, the main orientations, steps and examples adopted in the making and structuring of the MiMu, as well as a research done as a pre-test, consisting of the creation of an article index by librarians, using samples of the Teclado & Áudio magazine and the final report from the thesaurus as an assistance to the task. It presents appendixes containing a report concerning the collection of terms, forms, a table and a frame comprising a research overview and the MiMu’s report in alphabetic order. Its considerations include drawbacks to this work’s planning, such as the absence of the indexing subject in the literature review and the need for deep researches in music-related Library Science works. MiMu is considered an important contribution to the subject in focus, though it needs to be reviewed by a diversified group of researchers, by projects of divulgation and expansion, so that it potentially becomes a <b>specialized</b> music <b>thesaurus,</b> as a whole...|$|R
40|$|In {{participating}} in this CLEF evaluation campaign, our first objective is to propose and evaluate various indexing and search strategies for the Russian language, {{in order to obtain}} better retrieval effectiveness than that provided by the language-independent approach (n-gram). Our second objective is to more effectively measure the relative merit of various search engines when used for the German {{and to a lesser extent}} the English language. To do so we evaluate the GIRT- 4 test-collection using the Okapi, various IR models derived from the Divergence from Randomness (DFR) paradigm, the statistical language model (LM) together with the classical tf. idf vector-processing scheme. We also evaluated different pseudo-relevance feedback approaches. For the Russian language, we find that word-based indexing with our light stemming procedure results in better retrieval effectiveness than does 4 -gram indexing strategy (relative difference around 30 %). Using the GIRT corpora (available in German and English), we examine certain variations in retrieval effectiveness that result from applying the <b>specialized</b> <b>thesaurus</b> to automatically enlarge topic descriptions. In this case, the performance variations were relatively small and usually non significant...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: On November 18 th, NLM {{marks the}} 50 th {{anniversary of the}} Medical Subject {{headings}} (MeSH). MeSH {{was first published in}} 1960, although its seeds planted in December 1947; it was noted that the increasing complexity of medical scientific literature necessitated increasingly sophisticated approaches to organization and access. Medical Subject Headings has translation into Spanish and Portuguese known as Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS), trilingual and structured vocabulary created in the 1960 ’s by BIREME (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information). Material and methods: Spain collaborates with this project since 2003 and through its Surveillance Terminology Unit belonging to the Spanish National Library of Health Sciences (BNCS) from the Institute of Health Carlos III, which uses the work of experts in medical terminology to carry out two important tasks: from one hand, the translation into Spanish of the new terms that the NLM identifies annually and on the other hand, the revision and adaptation into Spanish of the terms already reflected in the thesaurus. Results: The main success result of this collaboration is an updated <b>thesaurus</b> <b>specialized</b> on Health Sciences with medical terminology adapted to Spain. Appart from its applications on specialized databases, the Spanish National Library of Health Sciences (BNCS) contributes through DeCS terms in the unified terminology development project, UMLS- Unified Medical Language System of the NLM, with the responsibility of the updating and sending of new terms in Spanish. Conclusions: This posters attempts to reflect, in a graphic way, the whole role of the Spanish National Library of Health Sciences in this project, explaining the categories already translated, the work still pending, as well as the challenges that may be considered...|$|R
