40|$|This report {{addresses}} the related problems of trajectory generation and time-optimal path tracking with online obstacle avoidance. We consider {{the class of}} four-wheeled vehicles with independent <b>steering</b> and driving <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{also referred to as}} pseudo-omnidirectional vehicles. Appropriate approximations of the dynamic model enable a convex reformulation of the path-tracking problem. Using the precomputed trajectories together with model predictive control that utilizes feedback from the estimated global pose, provides robustness to model uncertainty and disturbances. The considered approach also incorporates avoidance of a priori unknown moving obstacles by local online replanning. We verify the approach by successful execution on a pseudo-omnidirectional mobile robot, and compare it to an existing algorithm. The result is a significant decrease in the time for completing the desired path. In addition, the method allows a smooth velocity trajectory while avoiding intermittent stops in the path execution...|$|R

5000|$|In 1828, {{the wooden}} wheels were {{replaced}} by two large iron wheels; steam engines of [...] were later added as auxiliary. When constructed, the iron wheels were the largest in Britain. The diameter of <b>each</b> <b>wheel</b> was 50 ft, 157 ft in circumference, and 12 ft broad, or 11 ft within the buckets. There were 120 buckets <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>Each</b> bucket contained [...] of water. The wheels made three revolutions per minute, and passed 360 buckets per minute, [...] of water per wheel, 7,920 for the two, equal to 210 tons of water per minute. They were 500 nominal horsepower. These wheels were a tourist attraction in their day and continued in service until the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{control laws}} are derived {{for a simple}} {{dynamical}} model of a car with fourwheels. A separate rotational torque acts <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel,</b> while separate <b>steering</b> torques act <b>on</b> the front pair and rear pair of wheels. Thus, in the model dealt with here, {{the motion of the}} car is controlled by a total of six torques. A control law is developed for the car to perform a point-to-point maneuver. This maneuver is performed using three different control modes, that is, using six, five, and four control torques...|$|R
50|$|The {{conventionally}} designed chassis {{was made}} of channel section side members suitably braced by cross members.Suspension was by eight quarter-elliptic springs in front—four to <b>each</b> <b>wheel</b> giving independent front springing. Rear suspension was by ordinary half-elliptical springs to a beam axle. The single brake for the front wheels {{was a part of}} the differential unit. The rear brakes were <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel.</b> Electrical equipment was six-volt and a five lamp set supplied with dip and switch control to the head lights was included. The tyre size is 4+1/2 x 18 in.|$|R
5000|$|As introduced, the Servi-Car had a {{drum brake}} {{on the front}} wheel and another drum brake inside the rear axle housing, {{decelerating}} both rear wheels. [...] In 1937, the braking system was upgraded to have a drum brake <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel.</b> [...] A hydraulic rear brake system was introduced in 1951. The very last Servi-Cars, built late in their last model year, would have disc brakes on all three wheels.|$|R

5000|$|This {{wet weather}} has {{considerably}} affected the incline {{just below the}} Lodge. The horses' feet sunk in very deep {{and they have been}} down once or twice—I do not think your Grace would wish them to pass over it again until something has been done. Some burnt ballast put down would make the footing firmer. On Monday three separate trucks ran off the line on the incline, but the road has since been firmed in. Letter from Ralph Jones to the Duke, 26 June 1871 The surveyors designing the line had worked {{on the assumption that the}} wagons would have a load <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel</b> of 2+1/2 LT and had designed the line accordingly. As it turned out, the four-wheeled wagons used had an average weight of 3+1/2 LT and each carried 6 - 7 LT of goods, meaning this limit was regularly exceeded. The coal wagons used on the line weighed 5 LT each and carried 10 LT of coal, meaning a load <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel</b> of 3+3/4 LT.|$|R
5000|$|Differing of {{the number}} of teeth (effectively diameter) <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel</b> allows {{mechanical}} advantage to be changed. By increasing or decreasing the ratio of teeth between the drive and driven wheels one may change the ratio of rotations between the two, meaning that the rotational drive and torque of the second wheel can be changed in relation to the first, with speed increasing and torque decreasing, or speed decreasing and torque increasing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a concept of}} a warning system to prevent rollover of heavy vehicles. The system consists of several sensors which measure the heavy vehicle dynamics. Initially these dynamics states are observed using observers, and then, knowing the infrastructure characteristics, the risk of rollover is predicted and assessed using the lateral acceleration of the vehicle, {{the height of the}} centre of gravity, and the Load Transfer Ratio (LTR). This coefficient is calculated using the estimated load <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1962, the Mercedes-Benz W112 {{platform}} featured an {{air suspension}} on the 300SE models. The system used a Bosch main valve with two axle valves {{on the front}} and one on the rear. These controlled a cone-shaped air spring <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel</b> axle. The system maintained a constant ride height utilizing an air reservoir that was filled by a single-cylinder air compressor powered by the engine. In 1964, the Mercedes-Benz 600 used larger air springs and the compressed air system also powered the brake servo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{has seen a}} modern {{development}} in cars. The new Volvo XC90 (from 2016 year model and forward) has a transverse leaf spring in high tech composite materials, a solution {{that is similar to}} the latest Chevrolet Corvette. This means a straight leaf spring, that is tightly secured to the chassis, and the ends of the spring bolted to the wheel suspension, to allow the spring to work independently <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>wheel.</b> This means the suspension is smaller, flatter and lighter than a traditional setup.|$|R
