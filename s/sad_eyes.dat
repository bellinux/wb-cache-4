500|$|... "Part 9: The State of Dreaming", premiered on 2 March, {{presents}} Diamandis {{lying on}} a bed while [...] "alternating between <b>sad</b> <b>eyes</b> and a big smile". It begins with a black-and-white filter, although transitions into color after the first minute. It was followed by [...] "Part 10: Lies" [...] on 17 July, and employs a similar black-and-white to color technique. Diamandis is first seen looking into the camera wearing little makeup, and is later shown walking {{into the woods and}} sitting at a dinner table in the rain. The final music video [...] "Part 11: Electra Heart" [...] introduced the previously-unreleased title track; the clip itself contains footage from the earlier music videos. It symbolically ended the promotional era for Electra Heart, with Diamandis having tweeted [...] "Goodbye, Electra Heart!" [...] on 8 August, the same day the video was released.|$|E
500|$|In his memoirs, Ernst {{said he had}} {{difficulty}} persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother. Before one visit, he found the child [...] "whimpering under a sofa, full of despair." [...] He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too. [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you do love me," [...] Elisabeth replied. Margaret Eagar thought the child's eyes were the saddest she had ever seen. [...] "Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face," [...] she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that [...] "I shall never see this again." [...] However, despite Elisabeth's <b>sad</b> <b>eyes,</b> she was generally a sweet, happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute.|$|E

2500|$|Known to cricketing {{colleagues and}} cricket fans as [...] "Arkle" [...] after the racehorse, but always [...] "Rags" [...] to himself, {{he was one}} of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1980. The cricket writer Colin Bateman said, [...] "The Retford imp was, and still is, one of the most fondly admired figures in the game... the rolling gait and big <b>sad</b> <b>eyes</b> make him Chaplinesque – and like all clowns, there is pathos behind the public image... At times, genius sat on Randall's {{shoulders}} – the only trouble was it would not stop fidgeting". Randall played 47 Tests and 49 One Day International matches for England as a right-handed batsman before retiring to become a coach and cricket writer.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{suggestions}} {{of the potential}} of a Byronic heroine in Byron’s works. Charles J. Clancy claims that Aurora Raby in Don Juan possesses many of the characteristics typical of a Byronic hero. Described as “silent, lone” in the poem, her life has indeed been spent in isolation - she has been orphaned from birth. She validates Thorslev’s assertion that Byronic heroes are “invariably solitaries” (Clancy, 29). Yet, like her male counterpart, she evokes an interest from those around her, “There was awe in the homage which she drew” (XV, 47). Again, this is not dissimilar to {{the description of the}} fascination that Byron himself encountered wherever he went (McCarthy, 161). Her apparent mournful nature is also reminiscent of the regretful mien of the Byronic hero. She is described as having deeply <b>sad</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] "Eyes which sadly shone, as Seraphs' shine" [...] (XV, 45). This was a specific characteristic of the Byronic hero (Clancy, 30). This seems to express a despair with humanity, not unlike the despair present in Byron's Cain, as Thorslev notes. She herself admits to despairing at [...] "man's decline" [...] (XV, 45), therefore this brings her into direct comparison with Cain's horror at the destruction of humanity (Clancy, 31).|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Skinner {{came closer}} to the {{carpenter}} from Hickleybrow, and spoke in a confidential manner, and one <b>sad</b> <b>eye</b> regarded the distant village, and one was bright and wicked.

60|$|Suddenly, as his <b>sad</b> <b>eye</b> fell {{lower and}} lower from {{scanning}} their magically quiescent persons, his glance lit upon his own clutched hand, which rested on his knee. Some paper protruded from that clutch. He knew not how it had got there, or whence it had come, though himself had closed his own gripe upon it. He lifted his hand and slowly unfingered and unbolted the paper, and unrolled it, and carefully smoothed it, {{to see what it}} might be.|$|R
60|$|He moved a thin {{shrunken}} brown hand {{gently in}} the air in time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his <b>sad</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

60|$|The snow lay thick {{upon the}} graves, {{and the day}} was cold and dreary; but there was many a <b>sad</b> <b>eye</b> {{watching}} that black procession as it passed from the vicarage to the church, and from the church to the open grave. There were men and women standing in that churchyard who had bandied vulgar jests about their pastor, and who had lightly charged him with sin; but now, when they saw him following the coffin, pale and haggard, he was consecrated anew by his great sorrow, and they {{looked at him with}} respectful pity.|$|R

She tells him: [...] "Dara Lynn don't know who ate the ear off her candy rabbit and I don't know who did it, but Jesus knows. And right this minute Jesus is looking down with the <b>saddest</b> <b>eyes</b> on the person who ate that chocolate." [...] Marty's very religious mother teaches him that people should not sin or they will be [...] "separated forever from God's love." ...|$|R
