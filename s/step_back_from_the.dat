5|$|In the 1950s, Har Gobind Khorana and {{co-workers}} developed a phosphodiester method where 3’-O-acetylnucleoside-5’-O-phosphate 2 (Scheme 3) was activated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Ts-Cl). The activated species were reacted with a 5’-O-protected nucleoside 1 {{to give a}} protected dinucleoside monophosphate 3. Upon the removal of 3’-O-acetyl group using base-catalyzed hydrolysis, further chain elongation was carried out. Following this methodology, sets of tri- and tetradeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized and were enzymatically converted to longer oligonucleotides, which allowed elucidation of the genetic code. The major limitation of the phosphodiester method consisted {{in the formation of}} pyrophosphate oligomers and oligonucleotides branched at the internucleosidic phosphate. The method seems to be a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more selective chemistry described earlier; however, at that time, most phosphate-protecting groups available now had not yet been introduced. The lack of the convenient protection strategy necessitated taking a retreat to a slower and less selective chemistry to achieve the ultimate goal of the study.|$|E
25|$|Linn {{introduced}} {{the successor to}} his revolutionary machine in 1982. The LinnDrum, often erroneously called the LM-2 (LM-1 stood for Linn/Moffett/1 and Moffett wasn't with the company {{by the time the}} LinnDrum came around), contained more sounds (including cymbals), more options for programming sounds (step programming mode), and 5 programmable trigger inputs, but was a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LM-1 in that it removed the ability to tune all of the individual drum sounds (hi-hat, bass, cowbell, tambourine, sidestick, and many other sounds were no longer tunable). It retailed for $2,500 less than the original LM-1 and although it added some additional features, the cost-cutting measures were quite notable. Although the LinnDrum helped make electronic drums more affordable for the common musician, it is still not as revered as the LM-1 and generally {{can be found on the}} used market for much less.|$|E
500|$|The satirical single [...] "Sunny Afternoon" [...] was {{the biggest}} UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and {{displacing}} the Beatles' [...] "Paperback Writer". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E

500|$|Further changes {{occurred}} {{prior to}} the start of the fourth season; executive producers Braga and Rick Berman both took a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show and brought in Manny Coto as the new showrunner for Enterprise. Coto found that after he got through the Nazi story left over from season three, he would have greater freedom to connect the series to [...] He described that cliffhanger as one in which the characters needed to be written out of, as there was no set plan in place on how to resolve it. He made the decision to switch the story from being purely-time travel based to one which featured alternate history, while resolving the Temporal Cold War, and wrote the script for both parts himself.|$|E
500|$|Outside Japan, {{the game}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, which primarily {{focused on the}} changes in the game from its predecessor. Reviewers generally praised the graphics. The Edge review described the environments as [...] "entirely captivating" [...] and said that the [...] "visual and audio design is marvellous", and Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot praised the graphics as beautiful and visually diverse. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com disagreed, however, saying that the art [...] "represents a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> splendor of Final Fantasy XIII". The music received mixed reviews; Parish said that the music was great, applauding the unique styles, but Simon Parkin of Eurogamer felt that the music [...] "suffers from a lack of coherent direction", and tracks often failed to match their scenes. Dale North of Destructoid felt that the soundtrack was [...] "wonderfully varied and lots of fun" [...] and predicted that [...] "traditionalist" [...] fans of Final Fantasy music would not like it as much because of the varied new styles.|$|E
500|$|Second, Schulz is {{credited}} with being the first center to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> line while playing defense. [...] Prior to Schulz's innovation, centers played in the line on defense. [...] In 1905, Schulz began dropping back from the line, enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across the field of play. [...] At the time, the innovation {{was referred to as}} a [...] "roving center", but it was effectively the birth of the linebacker position in American football. [...] Asked how he developed the [...] "roving center" [...] idea, Schulz noted that the backs started from five yards behind the line and concluded, [...] "No back living could move five yards while I was moving four". [...] He described his thinking to Coach Yost this way: [...] "It's all very simple, Yost. The ball carrier travels five yards while I travel only four yard to meet him. [...] I know of no back who can beat me in a five-yard race after giving me a one-yard handicap".|$|E

2500|$|The new Corolla {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] Camry, also having styling commonality with its little brother, the Yaris. It has been criticized for its sluggish steering and handling, and for its inexpensive interior materials which some regard a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous generation. Reviewers note that the Corolla represents a gradual evolution over the previous iteration, without straying too far from the formula as a plain but reliable, fuel-efficient, simple and inexpensive form of transportation.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 December 2007, Ahmed Akoli Akoli, {{then the}} {{political}} {{secretary of the}} MNJ, outlined the group's demands as decentralization and [...] "ethnic balance", a greater share and transparency in the extraction of northern resources, with government and military in the north [...] "recruited from the Tuareg population... and not an army consisting mainly of members of other ethnic clans who serve their own purposes, and who do not identify with the Tuareg people".

Jepsen viewed her predicament as an opportunity to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> overexposure and reflect on what direction to take with her next album. She met with her record label and management after The Summer Kiss Tour wrapped up in late 2013, stating: [...] "'I want you to put your faith in me that I'll come back when it's ready,' and they did and I'm very lucky to have a team that wasn't about trying to mass produce things and was really more looking at the quality of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft Temporary and Agency Worker Directive (...) [...] This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to agency regulation, {{in the interests of}} labour market flexibility. According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the draft Directive in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its [...] and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6 week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights click in (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City have been calling for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12 week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only for pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E
2500|$|Kern's last Broadway {{show in the}} 1920s was Sweet Adeline (1929), with a {{libretto}} by Hammerstein. [...] It was {{a period}} piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from Hoboken, New Jersey (near Kern's childhood home), who becomes a Broadway star. [...] Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> innovations in Show Boat, or even the Princess Theatre shows. [...] In January 1929, {{at the height of}} the Jazz Age, and with Show Boat still playing on Broadway, Kern made news on both sides of the Atlantic for reasons wholly unconnected with music. He sold at auction, at New York's Anderson Galleries, the collection of English and American literature that he had been building up for more than a decade. The collection, rich in inscribed first editions and manuscript material of eighteenth and nineteenth century authors, sold for a total of $1,729,462.50 – a record for a single-owner sale that stood for over fifty years. Among the books he sold were first or early editions of poems by Robert Burns and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and works by Jonathan Swift, Henry Fielding and Charles Dickens, as well as manuscripts by Alexander Pope, John Keats, Shelley, Lord Byron, Thomas Hardy and others.|$|E
