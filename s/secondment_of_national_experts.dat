40|$|The three European Free Trade Area (EFTA) {{countries}} Norway, Island and Liechtenstein {{are connected}} to the European Union (EU) through the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. This agreement implies that {{a significant part of the}} EU legislation is to be continuously adopted by the before mentioned EEA countries. Yet, these countries have no impact on the process of forming new laws and proposals in the EU. Consequently, channels that might influence this process are of great importance to the EEA countries. The use <b>of</b> seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> can represent such a channel. The research question in this thesis is thus: Does the Norwegian government use seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> in the European Commission as a channel for influence, information and to acquire competence, and do the <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> behave as <b>national</b> representatives? Research on <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> has shown that they can be used as strategic instruments on behalf <b>of</b> <b>national</b> governments. Yet, studies have also indicated that the behavior <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> is influenced by organizational and institutional factors, and the experts therefore do not act as national representatives. This thesis thus presents two hypotheses. The first hypothesis postulate that because the <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> are the only group <b>of</b> Norwegian <b>national</b> civil servants working for the Commission the government will seek to exploit the secondment system to increase their influence on the policy process. The second hypotheses expect the experts' perception of their role as independent agents for the Commission is the main obstacle for the government's effective use of the experts. This is a qualitative case study. It benefits from an original body of interview data, derived from national officials and <b>national</b> <b>experts.</b> It also includes several government documents and evaluations. The analysis finds that in spite of the fact that the experts emphasize their role as a national representative, the Norwegian government does not use the experts as strategic instruments in order to promote national interests. Thus, it is not the role perception <b>of</b> the <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> that represents the main obstacle for an effective use <b>of</b> the <b>secondment,</b> but a lack of coordination, and an attitude of reserve towards the use of informal channels by the national government...|$|R
