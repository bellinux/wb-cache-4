The soils were sampled at three different locations at depths of 2 to 3 m such that the in-situ overburden pressures were about 30 - 40 kPa. The normal pressures used in the test are: 6, 12. 5, 25, 50, 100 kPa; while the shearing rates are: 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mm/minutes. The samples were consolidated prior to shearing in the di- :ect shear apparatus. Preliminary test indicated that the average time required for consolidating the sample before shearing is less than l 0 minutes.

In this study, a total of 35 direct shear tests at different shearing rates under different normal stresses were conducted on specimens prepared by mixing different proportions of kaolin and glass beads. The changes in volume and water content of sheared specimens and the mesostructure of shear surfaces were studied. The results reveal a positive correlation between volume change and deviation of water content between the shear zone and outer zones, suggesting that the shear-induced volume change occurred primarily in the shear zones. Moreover, high normal stress and low <b>shearing</b> <b>rate</b> produced a relatively small void ratio in the shear zones, facilitating volumetric contraction of the specimen and the development of polished and evenly slickensided shear surfaces.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of linear perturbations is studied in magnetized plasma shear flows with a constant <b>shearing</b> <b>rate</b> and with gravity-induced stratification. The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation {{is used in}} order to examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes: Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown that for flows with arbitrary <b>shearing</b> <b>rate</b> there exists a finite time interval of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations for moderate and high <b>shearing</b> <b>rate</b> solar plasma flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem of angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars.

Particle {{confinement}} in H-mode plasmas on DIII-D {{is strongly}} {{affected by the}} turbulence regimes {{as well as the}} ExB <b>shearing</b> <b>rate.</b> We observe a strong increase in particle transport when the plasma transitions from an Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) regime to a Trapped Electron Mode (TEM) regime by changing the heating from Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) to Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH). The theoretical increase in particle transport is driven by an increase in outward particle flux outside the mid-radius, as calculated with the trapped gyro-Landau fluid model TGLF. This is due to a switch in the turbulence group velocity from the ion to the electron direction. Perturbed experimental particle transport coefficients confirm the strong increase in outward diffusion outside ρ = 0. 6. We also observe a strong increase in density fluctuations at the TEM scale-length in the plasmas with ECH heating. We were able to limit the density reduction in these ECH heated plasmas, by changing the torque input, in order to increase the ExB <b>shearing</b> <b>rate.</b> We find that the plasmas with the best particle confinement in the TEM regime are those in which the ExB <b>shearing</b> <b>rate</b> is of similar strength or exceeds the linear growth rate.
