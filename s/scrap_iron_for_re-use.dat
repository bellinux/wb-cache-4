50|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues in India's mining sector is the lack of assessment of India's natural resources. A number of areas remain unexplored and the mineral resources in these areas are yet to be assessed.

50|$|During the Second World War, {{trenches}} were dug in {{the sports}} ground and special courses were run in fuel efficiency, economical bread production {{and the making of}} wartime gym shoes. The iron railings at the front (which had cost £600) were lost to the War effort and the nation's need <b>for</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> <b>for</b> a paltry £30. The College never closed during this time and after the heavy bombing in November 1940, hundreds of homeless citizens were housed at the college. A number of bombs were dropped on the building, but it escaped with little damage.|$|R
50|$|The new station {{also had}} a single {{platform}} which was situated on the Down side immediately above the A505 Luton-Dunstable road. The main station building comprised two floors: the entrance and station booking office were on the lower floor while the main station facilities at platform level which were reached by steps. Following {{the extension of the}} platform in November 1890, a signal box was situated on the platform which had views over the countryside towards Skimpot and Blows Down. The box remained in operation until 22 July 1934. Two sidings ran down the centre of the goods yard behind the station. These received coal for local traders and handled <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> <b>for</b> the dealer who occupied part of the goods yard.|$|R

2500|$|In 1935, Crawford went to Melbourne {{where he}} stayed for eleven years, {{excluding}} {{the five years}} he spent in war service. He was involved in groups during his time in Melbourne such as the Left Book Club, the Victorian Communist Party, The Unity Theatre and the Worker's Voice, which was the forerunner of the Victorian Guardian. During pre-war period, the Worker's Voice had the largest circulation of any Communist Party paper in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] During the years {{he worked as a}} journalist, Crawford passionately helped to expose the struggles of the times. For example, he helped to expose the spy mission of the German naval submarine commander, Count von Luckner also known as the 'Yachtsman adventurer'. Luckner was a Nazi who travelled around the world spying for Adolf Hitler. Due to his participation in the 'No <b>Scrap</b> <b>Iron</b> <b>for</b> Imperialist Japan' demonstrations in Melbourne, Crawford spent two days in the jail cell that Ned Kelly was incarcerated in just before he was hung. Alan Marshall and Crawford interviewed Hewlett Johnson, The Red Dean of Canterbury, together for the Worker's Voice. The Red Dean, also known as Dr Hewlett Johnson, was the dean of Canterbury in 1931 and has been described as [...] "one of the most famous men in the world". Marshall noted Crawford as being an outstanding journalist {{and one of the best}} at the Worker's Voice.|$|R
25|$|In 1940, West Amargosa was {{transferred}} to the MoWT. She was initially operated under the management of Sir W. Reardon Smith & Sons. Management was later transferred to John Morrison & Co Ltd, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. West Amargosa was due to join Convoy HX 119, which departed from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on 6 April 1941 and arrived at Liverpool, Lancashire on 22 April. She was recorded as carrying a cargo of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> bound <b>for</b> Middlesbrough, Yorkshire. Instead, she joined Convoy SC 28, which departed from Halifax on 9 April and arrived at Liverpool on 28 April. Her destination was now given as West Hartlepool, Co Durham. She left the convoy at the Clyde, joining Convoy WN 228, which departed the Clyde on 1 May and arrived at Methil, Fife on 5 May.|$|R
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Baltimore, Empire Simba headed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to take on another load of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> <b>for</b> the UK. After making her way to Halifax by early February, she sailed on 9 February {{as a part of}} Convoy HX-108, but dropped out and joined up with Convoy SC-22, a slower convoy that had left Halifax a day earlier. Off the Northern Ireland coast, the convoy escorts broke off and Empire Simba and three other ships sailed into the Irish Sea. Headed to her {{destination}} of Port Talbot, Empire Simba was {{at the back of the}} line of the four ships. At 1300 hrs on 1 March, a Heinkel He 111 bomber of Kampfgeschwader 27, Luftwaffe attacked the column, and had a near miss on Empire Simba. The force of the explosion shattered the main water injection pipe in the engine room, flooding her engine room and leaving the ship dead in the water. The German bomber, with smoke trailing from it after being hit by bullets from one of Empire Simbas two Hotchkiss Mark I machine guns, headed off for Ireland. There were no towing vessels immediately available for Empire Simba, so as darkness approached, Empire Simbas crew abandoned the ship for the escorting trawler. Taking the ship's two machine guns, the chronometer, and some personal belongings, the crew were landed at Milford Haven. Empire Simba was saved and towed into Birkenhead, where the officers rejoined with their erstwhile ship. During an overnight bombing raid on the night of 12/13 March, German bombers parachuted land mines on Birkenhead. One landed on Empire Simba and exploded, causing significant damage to the ship.|$|R
5000|$|On the 110th {{anniversary of}} the [...] "Golden Spike" [...] on May 10, 1979, two {{purpose-built}} replicas of the UP #119 and the Jupiter #60 were brought together on a specially relaid 1½ mile section of track. As the original Jupiter was <b>scrapped</b> <b>for</b> <b>iron</b> in 1901 and No. 119 was broken up two years later, the two replica locomotives were built in California with $1.5 million of federal funds. They were reconstructed using scaled-up measurements taken from photographs of the original engines.|$|R

The crew for the newly British ship was shipped from Liverpool on the Cunard Line ocean liner [...] to New York via Halifax and bussed to Galveston, Texas, to take possession of the ship. Sailing from that port, they took on a load of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> and headed <b>for</b> Bermuda. At Bermuda, West Cohas joined a convoy to Halifax {{and then on to}} Liverpool. At about 1030 hrs on 19 August West Cohas lost track of the convoy but continued on independently, arriving at Liverpool on 23 August. West Cohas sailed for Methil five days later and arrived on 1 September.|$|R
50|$|In {{the eleven}} mounds opened at Jiwnri, vessels {{containing}} bones, <b>scraps</b> of <b>iron,</b> stones <b>for</b> sharpening knives, copper bracelets and shell ornaments were discovered and similar finds {{were made at}} Gati. The conclusion at which Major Mockler arrived was that the places had been used for purposes of interment, {{the bones of the}} deceased being placed occasionally in an earthen pot, but more generally {{on the floor of the}} dumb. Pots containing food, weapons and sometimes a lamp, were the accompaniments of the corpse, which was apparently exposed previous to burial. In Sir Thomas Holdich's opinion the structures are possibly relics of the Dravidian races, which dispersed eastward on being ousted by the Semites from Chaldaea.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Hexavalent {{chromium}} {{is highly}} toxic to most living organisms and a known human carcinogen by the inhalation route of exposure. Therefore, treatment of Cr(VI) contaminated wastewater is essential before their discharge {{to the natural}} water bodies. Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) can be beneficial because a more mobile and more toxic chromium species is converted to a less mobile and less toxic form. Zero-valence-state metals, such as <b>scrap</b> <b>iron,</b> can serve as electron donors for reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The influence of pH on <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> capacity to reduce Cr(VI) was investigated in this study. Maximum reduction capacity of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> was observed {{at the beginning of}} the column experiments; the lower the pH, the greater the experiment duration with maximum <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> reduction capacity. The experimental results showed that highest maximum reduction capacity of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> was 12. 5 mg Cr(VI) /g <b>scrap</b> <b>iron,</b> at pH 2. 0, and decreased with increasing pH up to 1. 9 mg Cr(VI) /g <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> at pH = 7. 3.
