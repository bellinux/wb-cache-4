40|$|This {{program of}} {{research}} investigated {{the nature and}} processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present {{a risk factor for}} posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that <b>specific</b> <b>retrieval</b> deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that <b>specific</b> <b>retrieval</b> is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to <b>specific</b> <b>retrieval</b> deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one's self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues. This program of research extends current theories of autobiographical memory by identifying risk, maintenance, and recovery factors in the context of PTSD...|$|E

Even though the feature set was tuned for a particular data set and similarity measures, the evaluated distance measures are general and can be applied to any set of features.

40|$|Six {{separate}} {{experiments were}} conducted to investigate the effects of <b>specific</b> <b>retrieval</b> procedures on recall, recognition, confidence and the confidence / accuracy relationship for these retrieval domains. In experiment I the effects of retrieval procedures were considered {{as part of a}} recognised police interview technique, the Cognitive Interview (CI), while in experiments 11, 111, and IV the retrieval procedures involved discrete context manipulations. Experiments V and VI focused exclusively on the confidence / accuracy relationship for recall as a function of <b>specific</b> <b>retrieval</b> procedures and question type. Results indicated that although frequently improving {{the quality and quantity of}} recall, the Cl and other types of context reinstatement manipulation did not reliably improve recognition accuracy from lineup presentations, nor did they have a significant moderating effect upon the confidence / accuracy relationship. However in experiment TV in which a long (three month) delay was utilised significant effects of context manipulation on recognition performance were found. With regard to confidence, experiment I indicated that the Cl was responsible for a significant increase in confidence of recall but not recognition. Results from experiments II, III, and iv indicated non consistent effects of context manipulation on confidence, rating-q for either recall and recognition. With regard to the confidence / accuracy relationship, results from the initial five experiments indicated that in very few instances was confidence and accuracy significantly related. However, in experiment VI confidence and accuracy was found to be reliably and consistently related The most important finding to emerge from this research suggests the retrieval procedure undergone by a witness (interactive interview / passive questionnaire), to be an important moderator of the confidence / accuracy relationship. As such the results are supportive of Leippe's (1980) two premises in which it is suggested that as reconstructional and social influences increase, the confidence / accuracy relationship will correspondingly decreas...|$|E

40|$|Practicing the {{retrieval}} of some information {{can lead to}} poorer {{retrieval of}} other related information, a phenomenon called retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF).

Not only domain experts, but also average non-expert users {{are interested in}} searching domain speci¯c (e. g., medical and health) information from online resources. However, a typical problem to average users is that the search results are always a mixture of documents with di®erent levels of readability. Non-expert users may want to see documents with higher readability {{on the top of}} the list. Consequently the search results need to be re-ranked in a descending order of readability. It is often not practical for domain experts to manually label the readability of documents for large databases. Computational models of readability needs to be investigated. However, traditional readability formulas are designed for general purpose text and insu±cient to deal with technical materials for domain <b>specific</b> information <b>retrieval.</b> More advanced algorithms such as textual coherence model are computationally expensive for re-ranking a large number of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose an effective and computationally tractable concept-based model of text readability. In addition to textual genres of a document, our model also takes into account domain specific knowledge, i. e., how the domain-specific concepts contained in the document a®ect the document's readability. Three major readability formulas are proposed and applied to health and medical information retrieval. Experimental results show that our proposed readability formulas lead to remarkable improvements in terms of correlation with users' readability ratings over four traditional readability measures...|$|R
