5000|$|Joseph Shuttleworth {{suggested}} a hydraulic tube; water pressure {{rather than a}} partial atmospheric vacuum, would propel the train. In mountainous areas where plentiful water was available, a pumping station would be unnecessary: the water would be used directly. Instead of the flap to seal the slot in the tube, a continuous shaped <b>sealing</b> <b>rope,</b> made of cloth impregnated with india-rubber would be within the pipe. Guides on the piston would lift it into position and the water pressure would hold it in place behind the train. Use of a positive pressure enabled a greater pressure differential than a vacuum system. However {{the water in the}} pipe would have to be drained manually by staff along the pipe after every train.|$|E

40|$|Combined cycle ramjet/scramjet engines being {{designed}} for advanced hypersonic vehicles, including the National Aerospace Plane (NASP), require innovative high temperature dynamic seals {{to seal the}} sliding interfaces of the articulated engine panels. New seals are required that will operate hot (1200 to 2000 F), seal pressures ranging from 0 to 100 psi, remain flexible to accommodate significant sidewall distortions, and resist abrasion over the engine's operational life. This report reviews the recent high temperature durability screening assessments of a new braided <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> concept, braided of emerging high temperature materials, that shows promise of meeting many of the seal demands of hypersonic engines.

40|$|Achieving {{efficiency}} and performance goals of advanced aircraft and industrial systems are leading designers to implement high temperature {{materials such as}} ceramics and intermetallics. Generally these advanced materials are applied selectively in the highest temperature sections of the engine system including the combustor and high pressure turbine, amongst others. Thermal strains that result in attaching the low expansion-rate components to high expansion rate superalloy structures can cause significant life reduction in the components. Seals are being designed to both seal and to serve as compliant mounts allowing for relative thermal growths between high temperature but brittle primary structures and the surrounding support structures. Designers require high temperature, low-leakage, compliant seals to mitigate thermal stresses and control parasitic and cooling airflow between structures. NASA is developing high temperature braided <b>rope</b> <b>seals</b> {{in a variety of}} configurations to help solve these problems. This paper will describe the types of seals being developed, describe unique test techniques used to assess seal performance, and present leakage flow data under representative pressure, temperature and scrubbing conditions.

40|$|The {{assembly}} joints {{of modem}} solid rocket motor cases are generally sealed using conventional O-ring type seals. The 5500 + F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic insulation. Special compounds are used to fill insulation gaps {{leading up to the}} seals to prevent a direct flowpath to them. Design criteria require that the seals should not experience torching or charring during operation, or their sealing ability would be compromised. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings of the Space Shuttle solid rocket nozzle assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. NASA is investigating different approaches for preventing torching or charring of the primary O-rings. One approach is to implement a braided <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> upstream of the primary O-ring to serve as a thermal barrier that prevents the hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals. This paper presents flow, resiliency, and thermal resistance for several types of NASA <b>rope</b> <b>seals</b> braided out of carbon fibers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the seals when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. <b>Rope</b> <b>seals</b> braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over six minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Room and high temperature flow tests are presented for the carbon seals for different amounts of linear compression. Room temperature compression tests were performed to assess seal resiliency and unit preloads as a function of compression. The thermal barrier seal was tested in a subscale "char" motor test in which the seal sealed an intentional defect in the gap insulation. Temperature measurements indicated that the seal blocked 2500 F combustion gases on the upstream side with very little temperature rise on the downstream side...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1800s, residences in {{most cities}} were {{supplied}} with town gas generated from coal at local [...] "gashouses." [...] The gas was carried in cast iron pipes, introduced in 1843, typically with bell-and-spigot joints <b>sealed</b> with <b>rope</b> and molten lead. In the 1800s and early 1900s, most natural gas discoveries were made while exploring for oil. Natural gas was usually an unwanted byproduct of oil production. In the 1870s steel pipe replaced cast iron. In 1883, Pittsburgh {{became the first}} major city supplied with natural gas. Other cities followed, {{but only if they}} were close to natural gas wells. Because natural gas was a byproduct, it was priced cheaply, and, where available, undercut the market for town gas. In 1891, one of the longest pipelines of the time was built, a 120-mile long pipeline from the gas fields of Indiana to Chicago, without compression.|$|R

50|$|Oil leakage was {{commonplace in}} {{the first few years of}} production, though the problem was {{eventually}} addressed by aftermarket cam cover gaskets made from reusable rubber. Later 900 series Lotus engines included a revised cam tower that greatly improved the cam cover sealing design. The later cam towers can be retrofitted to the earlier 907 engines. Early Jensen-Healey engines (1972-1973) had oil supply issues that made the oil pressure slow to build on start-up. Some early engines also had issues with oil drainage which resulted in too much oil being retained in the cam carriers. Differences between early and late 907 engines included <b>rope</b> <b>seals</b> for the rear of the crankshaft versus regular spring-loaded rubber lip seals for the rear of the crankshaft on later 907 engines.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} {{the winter in}} Iceland, Erik returned to Greenland in 985 {{with a large number}} of colonists. Out of 25 ships that left for Greenland only 14 arrived, 11 were lost at sea. The Icelanders established two colonies on the southwest coast: the Eastern Settlement or Eystribyggð, in modern-day Qaqortoq, and the Western Settlement or Vestribyggð, close to present-day Nuuk. (Eventually, a Middle Settlement grew, but many people suggest it formed part of the Western Settlement.) The Eastern and Western Settlements, both established on the southwest coast, proved the only two areas suitable for farming. During the summers, when the weather favored travel more, each settlement would send an army of men to hunt in Disko Bay above the Arctic Circle for food and other valuable commodities such as <b>seals</b> (used for <b>rope),</b> ivory from walrus tusks, and beached whales.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{mechanical system}} in advanced hypersonic engines is the panel-edge seal system that seals {{gaps between the}} articulating horizontal engine panels and the adjacent engine splitter walls. Significant advancements in seal technology are required to meet the extreme demands placed on the seals, including the simultaneous requirements of low leakage, conformable, high temperature, high pressure, sliding operation. In this investigation, the seal concept design and development of two new seal classes that show promise of meeting these demands will be presented. These seals include the ceramic wafer seal and the braided ceramic <b>rope</b> <b>seal.</b> Presented are key elements of leakage flow models {{for each of these}} seal types. Flow models such as these help designers to predict performance-robbing parasitic losses past the seals, and estimate purge coolant flow rates.

40|$|High {{temperature}} seals {{are required}} for advanced hypersonic airframe applications. In this study, both spring tube thermal barriers and innovative wafer seal systems were evaluated under relevant hypersonic test conditions (temperatures, pressures, etc.) via high temperature compression testing and room temperature flow assessments. Thermal barriers composed of a Rene 41 spring tube filled with Saffil insulation and overbraided with a Nextel 312 sheath showed acceptable performance at 1500 F in both short term and longer term compression testing. Nextel 440 thermal barriers with Rene 41 spring tubes and Saffil insulation demonstrated good compression performance up to 1750 F. A silicon nitride wafer seal/compression spring system displayed excellent load performance at temperatures as high as 2200 F and exhibited room temperature leakage values that were only 1 / 3 those for the spring tube <b>rope</b> <b>seals.</b> For all seal candidates evaluated, no significant degradation in leakage resistance was noted after high temperature compression testing. In addition to these tests, a superalloy seal suitable for dynamic seal applications was optimized through finite element techniques...|$|R
50|$|Piston seals were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the piston seal increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam spring cylinders were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs. Wood in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also coupling rods.|$|R
40|$|Future {{turbine engines}} and {{industrial}} systems will be operating at increased temperatures to achieve more demanding efficiency and performance goals. In the highest temperature {{sections of the}} engine new material systems such as ceramics and intermetallics are being considered to withstand the harsh thermal environment. Components constructed of these low expansion-rate materials experience thermal strains and a resulting reduction of life when rigidly attached to high expansion-rate, superalloy support structures. Seals are being designed to both seal and to serve as compliant mounts allowing for relative thermal growths between high temperature but brittle primary structures and the surrounding support structures. Previous seal research yielded several braided <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> designs which demonstrated the ability to both seal {{and serve as a}} compliant mount. The hybrid seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with a superalloy wire sheath (cobalt based superalloy). The all ceramic seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with multiple ceramic (alumina-silica) sheath layers. Program goals for braided <b>rope</b> <b>seals</b> are to improve flow resistance and/or seal resilience. To that end, the current report studies the test results of: baseline and modified hybrid seals; two stage hybrid and two stage all-ceramic seal configurations; and single stage hybrid and single stage all-ceramic seal configurations for a range of seal crush conditions. Hybrid seal modifications include increasing the sheath braid angle and core coverage. For the same percent seal cross-sectional crush, results show that increasing the hybrid seal braid angle increased seal stiffness and seal unit load, resulting in flows approximately one third of the baseline hybrid seal flows. For both hybrid and all-ceramic seals, two stage seal configurations significantly outperformed single stage configurations. Two stage seal flows were at least 30 % less than the single stage seal flows for the same seal crush. Furthermore, test results of single stage seals indicate that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, a specific seal crush condition exists at which minimum flows are achieved (i. e. increasing seal crush beyond a certain point does not result in better flow performance). Flow results are presented for a range of pressures and temperatures from ambient to 1300 F, before and after scrubbing. Compression tests results show that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, seal preload and stiffness increase with seal crush, but residual seal interference remains constant...|$|R
40|$|Durable, {{flexible}} sliding seals {{are required}} in advanced hypersonic engines {{to seal the}} perimeters of movable engine ramps for efficient, safe operation in high heat flux environments at temperatures of 2000 to 2500 F. Current seal designs {{do not meet the}} demanding requirements for future engines, so NASA s Glenn Research Center is developing advanced seals and preloading devices to overcome these shortfalls. An advanced ceramic wafer seal design and two types of seal preloading devices were evaluated in a series of compression, scrub, and flow tests. Silicon nitride wafer seals survived 2000 in. 1000 cycles) of scrubbing at 1600 F against an Inconel 625 rub surface with no chips or signs of damage. Flow rates measured for the wafers before and after scrubbing were almost identical and were up to 32 times lower than those recorded for the best braided <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> flow blockers. Canted coil springs and silicon nitride compression springs showed promise conceptually as potential seal preloading devices to help maintain seal resiliency. A finite element model of the canted coil spring revealed that {{it should be possible to}} produce a spring out of high temperature materials for applications at 2000 + F...|$|R
40|$|The leading Aeronautics program within NASA is the High Speed Research Program (HSR). The HSR program's highest {{priorities}} are high pay-off technologies for airframe and propulsion systems {{required for a}} high speed civil transport (HSCT). These priorities have been developed collaboratively with NASA, FAA and the US Industry (Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric). Phase one of the HSR program started on 1990, and concentrated on the environmental challenges of minimizing NOx and noise. The first program goal {{is to reduce the}} NOx emission index to less than 5 (Concord NOx index is 20 and is unacceptable), in order to have little impact on the earth's ozone layer. The second goal is to reduce noise levels to FAR Stage 3 (or better), comparable to those of subsonic aircraft (far below the Concorde noise levels that require exemptions form less stringent standards). This requirement greatly impacts the nozzle design increasing its length and complexity and poses unique sealing challenges. Phase two started in 1993 and initiated work on the technologies required for an economical HSCT. Materials technologies under development include a ceramic-matrix-composite combustion liner, lightweight materials for the nozzle, as well long-life turbomachinery disk and blade alloys. Other required materials are being developed under the DOD-IHPTET program, where there is close cooperation. Economic goals translate into the development of technologies for tri-class service, 5000 nautical mile range aircraft with a ticket price no more than 20 % over the subsonic ticket price. The potential market could be as large as 1500 aircraft, according to a Boeing study. Technology alone will not enable this airplane, yet without enabling technologies "on the shelf", it will not occur. The HSCT engine will be the largest engine ever built and operate at maximum conditions {{for long periods of time}} posing a number of challenges. The HSR engine mission requires that rotating equipment stay at take-off condition temperatures for hours not minutes per flight. Hence rotating equipment and seals must operate for many thousands of hours at extreme temperatures. It is anticipated that the nozzle will be 12 feet long and roughly 4 ft. by 5 ft. in cross-section with a nominal airflow of 800 lbs/sec. The complex function of the nozzle (including an ejector for noise attenuation) combined with long life place new demands on nozzle seal design. Three inlet configurations are under consideration with attendant sealing challenges, as will be illustrated herein. Four of these engines are required to propel a 5000 nautical mile class vehicle which demand that component reliability be at the highest possible level. In response, an HSR seals session was implemented as a part of the 1997 -Seals and Secondary Flow Workshop. Overview presentations were given for each of the following areas: inlet, turbomachinery, combustor and nozzle. The HSCT seal issues center on durability and efficiency of rotating equipment seals (including brush seals), structural <b>seals</b> (including <b>rope</b> <b>seals</b> and other advanced concepts), and high-speed bearing and sump seals. Tighter clearances, propulsion system size and thermal requirements represent extremes that challenge the component designers. This document provides an initial step toward defining HSR seal needs. The overview for HSR seal designs includes, defining seal objectives, summarizing sealing and materials requirements, presenting relevant seal cross-sections, and identifying technology needs for the HSR office...|$|R
50|$|After {{crushing}} a Zealot revolt led by Barabbas, Clavius, a Roman Tribune, is sent by Pontius Pilate {{to expedite}} a crucifixion already in progress. Three {{days later he}} is appointed to investigate the rumors of a risen Jewish Messiah. Pilate orders him to locate the missing body of Yeshua, one of the crucified men. In doing so, Pilate seeks to quell an imminent uprising in Jerusalem before the Emperor arrives. Failing to secure Yeshua's body, Clavius, {{with the support of}} his loyal aide Lucius, attempts to locate and question the disciples of Yeshua and those involved in his crucifixion and burial for clues to his disappearance. Numerous leads are dug up, and their accounts soon become increasingly miraculous and difficult to believe. Some of the followers, like a prostitute named Mary Magdalene and a man named Bartholomew, seemingly speak only in riddles and refuse to betray any others. Clavius' intense investigative methods soon begin to disturb both Romans and Hebrews alike, and Pilate, under pressure from many sides and fearful of Caesar's wrath, becomes increasingly distant and unsupportive. Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now little more than a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, in the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and <b>ropes</b> <b>sealing</b> the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier running away in fear, and that he had not seen anything like this before. Clavius, however, believes that the soldier was merely drunk. Other informants also fail to provide much useful information.|$|R
