25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} tests {{differ from}} most other imaging modalities in that diagnostic tests primarily show the physiological {{function of the}} system being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT <b>scan,</b> <b>head</b> CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body PET scans or PET/CT scans, gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, MIBG and octreotide scans.|$|E

40|$|A new <b>scanning</b> laser <b>head</b> is {{designed}} to use single Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) for performing measurements up to {{6 degrees of freedom}} (DOF) at a target. The <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> is supported by a rotating hollow shaft, which allows the laser beam to travel up to the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> from an opposite direction where an LDV is set up. The <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> is made of a set of two mirrors, which deflects the laser beam with an angle so that the rotation of the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> produces a conical scan. When measurements are performed at {{the focal point of the}} conical scan then three translational vibration components can be measured, otherwise the very small circle scan, before and after the focal point, can measure up to 6 degrees of freedom, including three translations and three rotations.

40|$|AbstractLaser Texturing and Laser Engraving of {{free form}} {{surfaces}} are interesting alternative to EDM and micro milling in the fabrication of moulds and dies. The {{material removal rate}} {{of this process is}} typically very low and the maximum working area is limited by the maximum travel range of the galvanometric <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> and also by the maximum deflection of the scanner or the surface curvature. As a consequence, in order to manufacture large or free form surfaces, a set of placements of the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> respect to the work piece must be calculated and controlled by the CNC. The number of these placements can be quite high due the small amount of material removed in each of them and the non-operative time spent to move the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> can be relevant compared to the overall time. In this work a method based on the solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem is proposed with the aim to optimise the number of displacements of the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> and generally {{in order to reduce the}} number of movement of the numerically controlled axes.

40|$|The {{inspection}} and maintenance of bridge decks is a procedure that requires objectivity and systematic steps; great benefits would derive from the adoption of automated techniques minimizing the human intervention. From this point of view, the laser scanner technology can provide excellent results; in order to reconstruct the geometry of the underbridge, the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> can be mounted on a motorized cart travelling on a walkway moved by a truck. The motion of the laser <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> must be compensated in post-processing {{in order to obtain}} a reliable reconstruction of the underbridge geometry; the accuracy of the reconstruction depends on the accuracy of the trajectory itself. This paper describes the actions undertaken to improve a measurement system based on noncontact techniques (laser distance meters and vision systems) aimed to reconstruct the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> trajectory with respect to a reference system integral to the bridge deck. The measurement uncertainty of the proposed system was evaluated by numerical simulations and then experimentally verified. At first, the developed mathematical model was validated through a comparison with an ideal system simulated in SimMechanics. Experiments performed in a controlled environment proved the validity of the proposed approach...|$|R
30|$|As {{the pair}} of s tips (on a blunt {{scanning}} probe tip) is scanned over the surface, each tip would encounter the largest charge density in the x direction at different positions of the <b>scanning</b> <b>head</b> holding the two tips. If the tip separation w were precisely (an integer times) the periodicity of the real-space lattice/structure, the conduction signal would simply be twice as large and the topographic image would be unchanged except for brightness from what a single tip would yield. If, on the other hand, the tips were separated by any other distance, the two tips would register different tunneling charge densities at each position of the <b>scanning</b> <b>head,</b> and {{the pair of}} conduction signals would beat against each other, altering the topographic image registered.|$|R
50|$|Experience {{building}} and testing the first prototype identified {{a number of}} key issues. The scanner technology chosen provided great depth of field (useful for identifying surface features), but required a large volume for the mirror assembly (which had to be strengthened to withstand vibrations). Furthermore, the armour, support flanges, and water pipes limited further sediment penetration and caused sediment disturbance. It was desirable to move the entire water gallery into the centre of the scanner module so that penetrator heads could be rapidly changed in the field. It was likely that different shapes would be more effective in different sediment textures and fabrics. These decisions led to an alternate scanner technology that had been developed and marketed mostly in the early 2000s. It is known by various names such as contact imaging, direct imaging, or LED indirect exposure (US Patent 5499112). In this technology, a string of LEDs strobe the primary colours onto an imaging plane. Illumination is crucial so the imaging plane must be close. Reflected light from the imaging plane is directed into an array of light guides which lead to CCD elements. The physical arrangement between the light guides and the imaging plane is what limits the depth of field using this technology. Tests using consumer scanners indicated that the imaging plane could be 1-3 mm away from the <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> for full resolution images, but dropped off quickly beyond that. Scene features 5 mm or more away from the <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> were almost unidentifiable. Since the primary value of SP imagery is two-dimensional, this limitation was a small trade off for the great savings in space. The solid-state technology is robust to vibration and no mirrors are necessary. Unfortunately, UV illumination was difficult to provide without a custom-designed <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> and was therefore not included in the second prototype.One major advantage of SPI is that it reliably provides sediment information regardless of water clarity. However, many SPI applications such as habitat mapping and side-scan sonar ground-truthing, would benefit from imagery of the seabed’s surface when visibility permits. Since the tether provided a source of power and computer connectivity with the surface vessel, adding a digital camera to image the seabed surface immediately adjacent to the sediment profile was another conceptually simple addition. A laser array surrounding the camera provided a means to correct the geometry of the seabed surface image (since it is captured at a variable angle) and its scale. Such imagery provides a larger reference frame in which to interpret the adjacent sediment profile and permits a more informed estimation of the habitat connectivity of multiple profiles. A longitudinal section of the second prototype with the seabed surface camera is presented in Figure 11. The typical deployment configuration is shown in Figure 12.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal was}} to obtain the {{greatest}} imaging area in the smallest cylindrical volume using a consumer flatbed scanner. Typical flatbed scanners image an area of about 220 x 300 mm (660 cm2), so a system had to be found which could be reconfigured to fit inside a sealed transparent capsule. There are two basic imaging methods in modern flatbed scanners. From the 1980s to the late-1990s the market was dominated by systems that could capture an image from any depth of field. Most such digital imaging devices used a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) array. In a CCD, discrete dots of photosensitive material produce a specific charge based on the intensity of light hitting it. A CCD does not detect colour. In this technology, a scene is illuminated, a narrow band of reflected light from the scene passes through a slit (to eliminate light coming from other directions), is then concentrated by an array of mirrors (typically folded into a box) into a prism typically a few centimetres in length. The prism splits the light into its constituent colours. Small CCD arrays are carefully placed {{at the point where}} the primary colours are sharply focused. The separate colour intensities are combined to composite values and recorded by the computer (or scanner electronic assemblies) as a line of pixels. The moving <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> then advances a short distance to gather the next line of the scene. Thus resolution in one axis is determined by CCD array size and focused optics, while the other axis’ resolution is determined by the smallest reliable step the <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> advancing motor can make. The optical assemblies of this type of scanner are fairly robust to vibration, but the traditional light source (a cold cathode tube of balanced colour temperature) is not. It was therefore replaced with an array of solid-state white light emitting diodes (LEDs). Another advantage of this replacement is that the sources could be alternated between white light and ultraviolet (UV) of about 370 nm wavelength. This UV light source allowed detection of visibly fluorescing materials (typically tracer minerals or hydrocarbons) by the prototype.A suitable <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> model that could be reconfigured to fit within an 80 mm diameter cylinder was located, and the scanner’s standard stepper motor was modified to fit within the same space. The entire unit was then mounted on a stainless steel pivot and rotated by a spring-loaded friction wheel pressing against the inner wall of the cylinder. Since the perimeter of the cylinder (250 mm) was smaller than the typical scan path (300 mm) the motor gearing was reduced to improve along-path scan resolution, the resulting change in image geometry was relatively easy to correct in the image capture software. The resulting assembly is shown in Figure 8.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between the non-photo blue and black ink is vast enough that digital image manipulation can separate the two easily. If a black-and-white bitmap setting is scanned in, the exposure or threshold number can be set high enough to detect the black ink or dark images being scanned, but low enough to leave out the non-photo blue. On a threshold scale of 0-255, this number would be approximately 140. Only with a considerably high threshold setting will the blue be detected; this however may greatly distort black lines and add {{a lot of noise}} and black speckles, making the image potentially almost unrecognizable. Scanning in black-and-white makes it possible for the non-photo blue still to serve its original purpose, as notes and rough sketching lines can be placed throughout the image being scanned and remain undetected by the <b>scan</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

In the 1970s, the hospital {{became one of the first}} in the United Kingdom to acquire a CAT <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> scanner, when it did so under Jacobson's guidance. Neurosurgery in Dundee would remain at the Royal Infirmary, only being transferred to Ninewells when DRI closed.

50|$|The DAT {{recorder}} mechanism {{was considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive than an analogue cassette deck mechanism due to the rotary helical <b>scan</b> <b>head,</b> therefore Philips and Panasonic Corporation developed a rival digital tape recorder system with a stationary head based on the analogue compact cassette. The DCC was cheaper and simpler mechanically than DAT, but did not make perfect digital copies as it used a lossy compression technique called PASC. (Lossy compression was necessary to reduce the data rate to a level that the DCC head could record successfully at the linear tape speed of 4.75 cm/s that the compact cassette system uses.) DCC was never a competitor to DAT in recording studios, because DAT was already established, and as it was launched {{at the same time}} as Sony's Minidisc format (which has random access and editing features), it was not successful with consumers either. However, DCC proved that high quality digital recording could be achieved with a cheap simple mechanism using stationary heads.|$|E

Certain techniques such as fMRI image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used fluorophores have excitation spectra in the 400 - 500 nm range, whereas the laser used to excite the two-photon fluorescence lies in the ~700 - 1000 nm (infrared) range. If the fluorophore absorbs two infrared photons simultaneously, it will absorb enough energy to be raised into the excited state. The fluorophore will then emit a single photon with a wavelength {{that depends on the}} type of fluorophore used (typically in the visible spectrum). Because two photons are absorbed during the excitation of the fluorophore, the probability for fluorescent emission from the fluorophores increases quadratically with the excitation intensity. Therefore, much more two-photon fluorescence is generated where the laser beam is tightly focused than where it is more diffuse. Effectively, excitation is restricted to the tiny focal volume (~1 femtoliter), resulting in a high degree of rejection of out-of-focus objects. This localization of excitation is the key advantage compared to single-photon excitation microscopes, which need to employ additional elements such as pinholes to reject out-of-focus fluorescence. The fluorescence from the sample is then collected by a high-sensitivity detector, such as a photomultiplier tube. This observed light intensity becomes one pixel in the eventual image; the focal point is scanned throughout a desired region of the sample to form all the pixels of the image. The <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> is typically composed of two mirrors, the angles of which can be rapidly altered with a galvanometer.|$|E
5000|$|... where W = work, F = force, and d=distance. Displacing any {{sediment}} grain {{requires a}} certain amount of work to overcome both inertia and the friction generated by all adjacent grains (both static and dynamic). The wedge does displacement work by using less force at the cost of increasing the distance the grain must travel. In order {{to reduce the size of}} an SPI device it makes sense to reduce the amount of work required to displace sediment for a given imaging area. Being in an aquatic environment gives the first advantage to reducing work. By increasing the water content of sediments, both static and dynamic coefficients of friction from grain-on-grain interactions are greatly reduced. At these large physical scales, viscosity interactions are very small compared to friction. Therefore, fluidising sediments would allow an SPI device to displace more and coarser sediments with less downward force. (Of course all mass-energy is conserved - more work is required to pump the water into sediments - but at least that can be done away from the wedge.) It is important to cleanly separate sediments to be fluidised and removed from the sedimentary fabric that must be imaged intact. Water lubrication can be used to reduce the amount of force required and lessen required workload, but can we also reduce the distance grains need to be displaced? The imaging mirror is the greatest constraint to reducing grain displacement so it makes sense to dispense with it. A number of commercial and consumer line scanners exist which digitise an image by moving in a plane recording the colour and intensity of light encountered. Flatbed scanners and digital photocopiers are examples of this technique. Light shining from the device reflects off the scene to be imaged to a sensor located near the light source. The light’s path can be folded and manipulated by a series of intermediary mirrors and lenses to a small linear sensor array or directly to a large array of tiny sensors. Pushing a thin flatbed scanner into sediments requires much less work than pushing a large prism, as concluded by Keegan et al. (2001):“In terms of its current design, the size of the prism in the SPI array impedes penetration in all but the softer, less compact sediments. When, for the sake of enhanced penetration, it becomes necessary to use the full complement of lead weights (66kg), the system becomes difficult to handle on smaller craft with restricted lifting equipment. Size and, correspondingly, weight could be reduced if the prism could be replaced to act more as a slim ‘digging blade,’ the whole exposed face of which could be digitally scanned in situ. Such a blade would not only facilitate easier and deeper penetration but also extend the use of SPI to more compact, fine to medium sands. The authors have already experimented with a suitable casing that penetrated these more resistant deposits to depths exceeding 55cm, however, a physically robust scanner that will tolerate the shock of impact and have a level of resolution adequate to the purpose remains to be identified.”The engineering problems of resolution, weight, and pressure and shock-resistance are compounded by keeping the scanner in a rectangular configuration (Patterson et al. 2006). Most underwater equipment is housed in cylinders because cylinders present a smaller surface area for enclosing a given volume than a rectangular enclosure. For a given surface (imaging) area, fewer sediment grains will need to be displaced a shorter distance when imaged from the perimeter of a cylinder than the oblique face of a wedge. It is a conceptually simple matter to modify a consumer flatbed scanner so that its <b>scan</b> <b>head</b> (containing light source and sensor array) moves in a circular path instead of a plane as illustrated in Figure 7. This configuration change allows for a more efficient wedge geometry or, as we’ll see later, permits its elimination.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we develop a device for {{determining}} the linear displacement between a linear grating and a <b>scanning</b> <b>head.</b> Then, the standard technique used for generating the optical signals is double grating imaging: Moiré, Talbot or Generalized grating imaging configurations. The accuracy and resolution of optical encoders improves when {{the period of the}} diffraction gratings decreases. When the period of the grating is smaller than 10 um, double grating configuration is not valid since the mechanical tolerances are too restrictive. In our case, we use a diffraction grating of 4 um and then the Talbot distance is about 30 um for visible light. As a consequence, we have used an interfero-diffractive configuration where one diffraction grating is used. The light coming from a laser-diode impinges the diffraction grating. The diffracted orders are redirected using a retro-reflector and then they interfere. As a consequence, an optical sinusoidal signal is obtained.
