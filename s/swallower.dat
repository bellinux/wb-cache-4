The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a [...] "real Indian" [...] sword <b>swallower,</b> and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the skočná, follows.

A replacement is required. Vašek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda's flattering words ("We'll make a pretty thing out of you").|$|E

2500|$|Block brought {{humor to}} What's My Line?. On one show, upon a {{contestant}} being {{revealed to be}} a skunk breeder, Block was surprised they hadn’t been able to guess his occupation because, [...] "After all, the fellow had a certain air about him." [...] Block {{was able to bring}} levity to what may otherwise have been serious, dry topics, such as with the appearance of Estes Kefauver, a U.S. Senator who was leading an investigation into organized crime. Much of the investigation was televised and Block suggested to Kefauver he change the name of his broadcast to [...] "What's My Crime?". Block also created what became a tradition of the show's opening. At the beginning of the show each panelist would introduce the panelist sitting beside them, except for the last who would introduce Host John Daly. It was Block's idea, as the last panelist, to break from the simple, straightforward introduction and instead introduce Daly with a joke. This was later taken up by Bennett Cerf after Block's departure. It also fell to Block as the comedian, then later Steve Allen and Fred Allen, to participate in what Gil Fates called his [...] "Gambits". Prior to the broadcast, Fates would hint to Block a line of questioning for one of the guests which he felt would generate the most laughs. Fates has said it required a comedian to sense from his clues what would generate laughter. For example, with a guest who manufactured girdles, Block was advised to ask questions about kitchen items. On the show Block asked, [...] "Will it make ice-cubes?" [...] To a professional sword <b>swallower</b> he asked, [...] "Do you work outdoors–or is yours considered an inside job?." [...] While technically not cheating, as the panelist was not told the guest's profession, the practice was eventually discontinued in light of the quiz show scandals.|$|E

60|$|At length Mr Snittle Timberry rose in {{the most}} {{approved}} attitude, with one hand in the breast of his waistcoat {{and the other on}} the nearest snuff-box, and having been received with great enthusiasm, proposed, with abundance of quotations, his friend Mr Vincent Crummles: ending a pretty long speech by extending his right hand on one side and his left on the other, and severally calling upon Mr and Mrs Crummles to grasp the same. This done, Mr Vincent Crummles returned thanks, and that done, the African <b>Swallower</b> proposed Mrs Vincent Crummles, in affecting terms. Then were heard loud moans and sobs from Mrs Crummles and the ladies, despite of which that heroic woman insisted upon returning thanks herself, which she did, in a manner and in a speech which has never been surpassed and seldom equalled. It then became the duty of Mr Snittle Timberry to give the young Crummleses, which he did; after which Mr Vincent Crummles, as their father, addressed the company in a supplementary speech, enlarging on their virtues, amiabilities, and excellences, and wishing that they were the sons and daughter of every lady and gentleman present. These solemnities having been succeeded by a decent interval, enlivened by musical and other entertainments, Mr Crummles proposed that ornament of the profession, the African <b>Swallower,</b> his very dear friend, if he would allow him to call him so; which liberty (there being no particular reason why he should not allow it) the African <b>Swallower</b> graciously permitted. The literary gentleman was then about to be drunk, but it being discovered that he had been drunk for some time in another acceptation of the term, and was then asleep on the stairs, the intention was abandoned, and the honour transferred to the ladies. Finally, after a very long sitting, Mr Snittle Timberry vacated the chair, and the company with many adieux and embraces dispersed.|$|E
6000|$|The serpent of Vedic myth is, perhaps, {{rather the}} robber-guardian than the <b>swallower</b> of the waters, but Indra is still, like the Iroquois Ioskeha, [...] "he who wounds the full one".(1) This {{example of the}} wide {{distribution}} of a myth shows how the question of diffusion, though connected with, is yet distinct from that of origin. The advantage of our method will prove to be, that it discovers an historical and demonstrable state of mind as {{the origin of the}} wild element in myth. Again, the wide prevalence in the earliest times of this mental condition will, to a certain extent, explain the DISTRIBUTION of myth. Room must be left, of course, for processes of borrowing and transmission, but how Andamanese, Australians and Hurons could borrow from each other is an unsolved problem.|$|E
