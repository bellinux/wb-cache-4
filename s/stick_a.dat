25|$|Primitive hunting {{weapons are}} the only weapons {{permitted}} for some types of modern-day hunting. For example, the newly opened 2007 Florida Alligator Hunt specifically prohibits firearms due {{to the dangers of}} firing bullets around bodies of water, and recommends instead the use of a detachable-head harpoon for hunting alligators during the nighttime hours that hunting is permitted. A bang <b>stick,</b> <b>a</b> specialized type of firearm, is then often used to sever the spinal cord of the alligator just {{to the rear of the}} head. This kills the alligator immediately upon its being taken, as required by regulatory laws governing the hunt.|$|E

25|$|An {{ice hockey}} stick {{is a piece}} of {{equipment}} used in ice hockey to shoot, pass, and carry the puck across the ice. Ice hockey sticks are approximately 150–200cm long, composed of a long, slender shaft with a flat extension at one end called the blade. The blade is the part of the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 25 to 40cm long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size and preference. The blade is positioned at roughly a 135° angle from the axis of the shaft, giving the <b>stick</b> <b>a</b> partly 'L-shaped' appearance. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but it has some flexibility to benefit some shots.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{six players}} on the ice, they are {{typically}} divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term skaters is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The forward positions consist of a centre and two wingers: a left wing and a right wing. Forwards often play together as units or lines, with the same three forwards always playing together. The defencemen usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their <b>stick.</b> <b>A</b> substitution of an entire unit at once is called a line change. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when shorthanded or on a power play. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the crease in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted {{at any time during}} the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing on the fly. A new NHL rule added in the 2005–06 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ice the puck.|$|E

IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a [...] "pretty great track". He added, [...] "it almost overplays the track's originally understated drama, his additions enhance the song and demonstrate that in a contemporary context." ...|$|E

500|$|Art {{designer}} Sylvain Despretz {{claimed the}} art department {{was assigned to}} create something that had {{little or nothing to}} do with the Superman comic book, and also explained that Peters [...] "would bring kids in, who would rate the drawings on the wall as if they were evaluating the toy possibilities. It was basically a toy show." [...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside.

Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to <b>stick</b> <b>a</b> sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera".

500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, in a psychoanalytical {{review of}} The Crab with the Golden Claws, commented that this book {{witnessed}} Tintin's [...] "real {{entrance into the}} community of human beings" [...] as he gains an [...] "older brother" [...] in Haddock. He also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality. In particular, he believed {{that there was a}} strong homoerotic subtext between Haddock and Tintin, represented in the two delirious sequences; in one, Haddock envisions Tintin as a champagne bottle frothing at the top (thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis), while in the other, Tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle, with Haddock about to <b>stick</b> <b>a</b> corkscrew into him (thereby symbolising sexual penetration). However, Apostolidès notes, in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred with Apostolidès on this point, also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes. He also noted that in this Adventure, the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a Belgian street leads Tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of [...] "Tintin the detective" [...] found throughout the series.|$|E

500|$|As the {{principal}} designer, Hall's personal experiences and philosophies strongly impacted the game: Keen's red shoes and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses {{due to his}} belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, {{such as that of}} the id.

The team separated the game from its Super Mario Bros. roots by adding non-linear exploration and additional mechanics like the pogo <b>stick.</b> <b>A</b> suggestion from Miller that part of the popularity of Super Mario Bros was the presence of secrets and hidden areas in the game led Hall to add several secrets, such as an entire hidden level in the first episode, and a [...] "Galactic Alphabet" [...] in which signs in the game were written, which if deciphered by the players revealed hidden messages, jokes, and instructions.|$|E
500|$|The United States {{developed}} its own {{kinetic energy}} penetrator (KEP) tank {{round in the}} form of an Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding-Sabot (APFSDS) round, using a depleted uranium (DU) alloy long-rod penetrator (LRP), designated as the M829, followed by improved versions. An immediate improvement, known as the M829A1, was called the [...] "Silver Bullet" [...] after its good combat performance during the Gulf War against Iraqi T-55s, T-62s and T-72 tanks. The M829 series centers around the depleted uranium penetrator, designed to penetrate enemy armor through kinetic energy and to shatter inside the turret, doing much damage within the tank. In 1998, the United States military introduced the M829A2, which has an improved depleted uranium penetrator and composite sabot petals. In 2002, production began of the ($10,000 per round) M829A3 using a more efficient propellant (RPD-380 <b>stick),</b> <b>a</b> lighter injection-molded sabot, and a longer (800mm) and heavier (10kg / 22lb) DU penetrator, which is said to be able to defeat the latest versions of Russian Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA). This variant is unofficially referred to by Abrams tank crews as the [...] "super sabot". In response to the M829A3, the Russian army designed Relikt, the most modern Russian ERA, which is claimed to be twice as effective as Kontakt-5. A further improved M829E4 round with a segmented penetrator to defeat Relikt has been under development since 2011 and was to be fielded as the M829A4 in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{design was}} largely driven by Tom Hall: Romero and {{especially}} John Carmack were focused {{almost exclusively on}} the programming; Wilbur {{was not involved in}} the game's design; and Adrian Carmack joined late in development and found the project's [...] "cute" [...] art style, till then mostly created by Hall, far-removed from his preferred, darker, style.
