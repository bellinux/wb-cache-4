Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after {{producing}} Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: [...] "We'll probably do another [...] next year," [...] Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he [...] "was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really liked this character". Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.|$|E

In February 1993, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen by Cates as host also for the fourth straight time.

[...] According to an article by Army Archerd published in Variety, Crystal initially declined to host again citing his busy film schedule that included Mr. Saturday Night and [...] However, after Cates sent him a funeral wreath with a poem declaring [...] "The <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are dead without you" [...] followed by a head of a fake dead horse similar to one featured in the film The Godfather, Crystal accepted the role as emcee.|$|E

Frakes enjoyed the episode too, saying, [...] "A fabulous show. Those were the kind of chances we took first season that when they worked, they worked great. It was a very chancy <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved it." [...] Director Paul Lynch also thought that the Bynars were [...] "great".

[...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing <b>show,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|Guber {{became the}} new {{president}} of Sony Pictures Entertainment and tried to purchase the film rights of Contact from Warner, but the studio refused. Coincidentally, in 1989, Obst was hired as a new executive at Warner and began to fast track the film, by hiring more writers. Roland Joffé was eventually hired to direct, using a screenplay by James V. Hart. Joffé almost commenced pre-production before he dropped out and Obst then hired Michael Goldenberg to rewrite the script, who finished his second draft in late 1993. Goldenberg's second draft rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in Contact and Robert Zemeckis was offered the chance to direct, but he turned down the opportunity in favor of making a film based on the life of Harry Houdini. [...] "The first script [...] I saw was great until the last page and a half," [...] Zemeckis recalled. [...] "And then it had the sky open up and these angelic aliens putting on a light <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, 'That's just not going to work.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{composition}} begun after Strange Music label-mate ¡Mayday! sent Tech N9ne {{the song}} with their and Kendall Morgan's vocals on it. He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the <b>show,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this <b>show.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E
2500|$|According to Steffan Chirazi's 1993 book The Real Story, Patton {{first met}} Faith No More during 1986. In the book, Patton {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "Faith No More played Eureka in a pizza parlour place Mr. Bungle played dozens of times. There were 6 people there and 3 of them were my friends. It was really bad, a really pathetic <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} them standing around the van really upset. Puffy was really uptight wanting to know where to get weed. Nobody was talking to him, I think he asked us because we were just hanging around. Their situation then never even registered with me, touring was unreal, Warner Bros. was like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. At that time I didn't wanna know about any of that shit".|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bell and {{his family}} moved to Los Angeles to create a new soap opera. During this time, his three children, William Jr., Bradley, and Lauralee Bell, each became {{involved}} in soap operas. Lauralee Bell worked as an actress on The Young and the Restless. Bradley Bell co-created The Bold and the Beautiful with his father. William Bell Jr. became involved in the family's production companies as president of Bell Dramatic Serial Co. and Bell-Phillip Television Productions Inc. [...] "It's worked out very well for us because we really all worked in very different aspects of the show," [...] William Bell Jr. said. [...] "With my father and I, it was a great kind of partnership and pairing {{in the sense that he}} had a total control of the creative side of the <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't have even the inclination to interject in what he was doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ray Collins {{rejoined the}} Mothers of Invention for the {{recording}} of the album, as his high falsetto was suited for the recordings. According to Collins, [...] "I brought the 'style of being raised in Pomona, California, being raised on the Four Aces, the Four Freshmen, Frankie Lane, Frank Sinatra and Jesse Baldwin. The early influences of R came into the Southern California area when I was probably in the tenth grade in high school. And I remember Peter Potter's <b>show,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think I recall the first R tune on there was 'Oop-Shoop'. Frank actually had more influences from the 'real blues', you know, like Muddy Waters, those kind of people. But I wasn't into that in my early life. I was more of the pop culture, pop radio things, and it's always been more of a favourite of mine than the early blues stuff - even though I love John Lee Hooker and all those people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burr's weight, {{always an}} issue for him in getting roles, became a public {{relations}} problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told Us Weekly years later: [...] "I have been asked {{a number of times}} to do his <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC." [...] In later life, his distinctive physique and manner {{could be used as a}} reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer's opinion that [...] "asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs … is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault." [...] A character in a 1989 short story refers to Burr as [...] "grossly overweight" [...] in Ironside.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new series}} is a {{continuation}} of the old series, with the story continuing after a 20-year break. It does not take the events of the 1990s TV movies [...] or [...] as canon. Instead we find the characters 20 years after the events of the Season 14 cliffhanger. In an interview with UltimateDallas.com, writer/producer Cynthia Cidre was asked to describe the new Dallas. She responded, [...] "I tried to be really, really respectful of the original Dallas because it was really clear to me that the people who love Dallas are [...] Trekkies, really committed to that <b>show</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really did not understand that before, so I never wanted to violate anything that had happened in the past. On the other hand that was the past, twenty years had gone by, so at the same time I think we're properly balanced between the characters of Bobby Ewing, J.R. and Sue Ellen. I also have the new cast and it's John Ross and Christopher, the children of Bobby and J.R., and their love interests. Total respect and a balance of old and new." ...|$|E
