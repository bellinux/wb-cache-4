25|$|The team {{travelled}} 160 {{miles north}} after the disastrous First Test {{to play at}} Gympie. The Queensland Country XI Thomas Allen won the toss and batted. Allen himself top-scored with 53, with Len Johnson making 40 and Herbert Zischke 32. Peter Smith proved useful in another minor game and took 5/80 as the home side were dismissed for 208. The reserve openers Paul Gibb (31) and Laurie Fishlock (62) made an opening stand of 82, Joe Hardstaff <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> way to 64 and the all rounder James Langridge 42. The local fast bowler Tim Ball took 5/69 and Len Johnson 3/51 as the MCC were out for 282, but the leg-breaks of Don Tallon's brother Bill were hit for 0/73. Back in to bat the Queensland XI made a solid 311/9 with James Cockburn (41), Tim Allen (40), Colin Stribe (75) and Keith Gartell (52 not out) seeing out the draw.|$|E

[...] It also secured the 100th win for batterymate Adam Wainwright. [...] Molina added a single for two of the Cardinals' five hits.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} home {{belonged to}} a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20 month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy knelt down and <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> cheek. He said, [...] "My God, I didn't know {{this kind of thing}} existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know." [...] Clark labeled what lay before them a [...] "national disgrace." [...] Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his first}} day of trial, Whelan was noted as wearing an [...] "irreproachable" [...] black silk hat, black frock coat, white vest with narrow gold chain and back pants, and exhibiting a [...] "jaunty" [...] demeanor. He sat with folded arms, {{listening}} intently to the trial proceedings and eating apples. He was entranced by the flies walking on {{the ceiling of the}} courthouse, and laughed audibly when a constable lost his footing and slipped while trying to bring him out of the defendant's box. Agnes Macdonald wrote in her journal that he was a [...] "small, mean-looking" [...] man, who <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> moustache nervously.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first three}} days were lost to heavy rain and only 13 hours play were {{available}} when the captains {{went out on the}} fourth afternoon to toss, Johnson winning and putting England in to bat. Hutton was out quickly, but Graveney effortlessly <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> way to 111 out of 182 in two and a half hours, adding 176 with May (79). Crowdey was out first ball, but Compton (84) and Bailey (72) added 134 and Hutton declared on 371/7, easily England's best score of the series. Amazingly Bailey gave Lindall his wicket to record his 100th England wicket in the mistaken belief that with was the fast bowler's last Ashes Test and [...] "at one stroke achieved heights of Australian popularity to which he could scarcely have aspired". Lindwall ending with (3/77) and his captain (3/68).|$|E

2500|$|According to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Muʿizza) (...) was the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's {{favorite}} cat. In legend, Muhammad awoke {{one day to}} {{the sounds}} of the Adhan, the Muslim daily call to prayer. Preparing to attend, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on the sleeve of his prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He then smiled and gently <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> beloved cat three times. While the folktale of Muezza is found in both Muslim and non-Muslim sources and many hadith reference cats in a positive manner, it {{does not appear to be}} attested before the 20th century. It may be based on a similar story told by the followers of the medieval Sufi sheikh Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, who is also said to have cut his sleeve because a cat was sleeping on it, then stitched it up later and said [...] "nothing changed".|$|E
2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk and {{his family}} did not enjoy the {{benefits}} of white men. His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing a coat and vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress like other people, and have plenty to eat all the time, much of the time he was hungry and could not buy medicine or go to the doctor when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross. Sadly, it was rumored that Chief Flying Hawk died of starvation.|$|E
2500|$|The fast bowling of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller {{was seen}} off by England's opening {{partnership}} as Len Hutton (94) and Cyril Washbrook (65) made another century stand; 137 runs in 178 minutes. Bradman declined {{to take the}} new ball when 200 runs were made (as was the custom in those days) and was rewarded when Bruce Dooland (3/133) removed Washbrook and Edrich and Colin McCool caught Hutton lbw. Wally Hammond was in so much pain from fibrositis that he took 12 aspirin before {{he went out to}} bat and was bowled by Ernie Toshack for 18 to leave England 202/4. Denis Compton (147) <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> way to 147, adding 118 with Joe Hardstaff (67), 61 with Jack Ikin (21) and 74 with Norman Yardley (18 not out). It was his third first-class century in a row and [...] "It was amazing to see Compton occasionally run down the pitch, change his mind, and either play the ball like a baseball bunt, or scamper back to ground his bat in time to get {{the benefit of the doubt}} on a stumping appeal". Lindwall thought he should have been stumped before he reached his century, [...] "but I could well understand the umpire's explanation...that the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease". In any case Lindwall quickly ended the innings with the new ball, he caught and bowled Compton to have England 455/7. In the next over he sent Alec Bedser's off-stump cart-wheeling back to the wicketkeeper, then bowled Godfrey Evans first ball, shaved Doug Wright's stumps before bowling him second ball - 3 wickets in 4 balls to end the innings for 460. This was the nearest that Lindwall ever got to a hat-trick.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next stop}} was in Sydney {{to play the}} champions New South Wales. Ian Craig was captain of Australia as well as New South Wales, which had won the Sheffield Shield 8 times since the war, the last 4 in succession, and {{would go on to}} win another 5. On a wicket known to take spin Jim Laker was unfit to play, as was Peter Loader, Willie Watson, still {{recovering}} from his knee surgery, Fred Trueman had a cold, but volunteered to play and Peter May had recovered sufficiently to captain the team. Craig won the toss and batted on a sunny day on a good wicket. After Sid Carroll was bowled by a Trueman outswinger in the first over Jim Burke made a ponderous 104 and Neil Harvey a somewhat quicker 149 to finish the day on 243/1. Taking the new ball the next day Trueman (2/62) had Harvey caught off a skyer, which brought in Norm O'Neill, who <b>stroked</b> <b>his</b> way to 84 not out. The other batsman went for runs and Lock (4/121) picked up the wickets of Burke, Craig (who looked very unwell) and Brian Booth for ducks and Alan Davidson for 8. Richie Benaud was caught and bowled off a Trevor Bailey long-hop and Craig declared on 391/7 before O'Neill could complete his century. The MCC openers were soon out; Arthur Milton (10) bowled by the huge Gordon Rorke (1/15) and Peter Richardson (21), caught by Harvey off Peter Philpott. Peter May (29) and Tom Graveney (36) saw out the second day, but the next highest scorer was last man Brian Statham with 27 as the New South Wales leg-spinners Richie Benaud (5/48) and Philpott (4/87) worked their way through the order, leaving [...] "Barnacle Bailey" [...] on 14 not out in a total of 177. The improvement of Benaud's bowling since his great tour of South Africa was evident just two weeks before the first Test. Craig enforced the follow on, but the MCC recovered as Richardson (87) and Milton (81) put on 170 for the first wicket, easily their best effort of the tour. Philpott took 5 catches in the match and removed both openers, one off Davidson (2/37) and the other off Benaud (2/84) and the MCC slumped to 217/4. Tom Graveney (59), Roy Swetman (52) and Colin Cowdrey (42 not out) played out the last day and the tourists ended on a comfortable 356/4. Strangely Swetman, using his feet more than the other batsman, played the spinners better than the other batsmen, who were struggling. After the match the MCC announced that John Mortimore would be sent out to reinforce the team as it appeared that the pitches would take spin. He was also an all-rounder who could strengthen the lower order batting and his arrival would allow the team to rest Laker and Lock in the state games.|$|E
