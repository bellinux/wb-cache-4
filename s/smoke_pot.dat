2500|$|Lloyd's {{career was}} not all laughs, however. [...] In August 1919, while posing for some promotional still {{photographs}} in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a <b>smoke</b> <b>pot.</b> It exploded and mangled his hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. [...] The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was {{in the act of}} lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. [...] Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, [...] "I thought I would surely be so disabled that I {{would never be able to}} work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive. I still think so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haggard's {{immediate}} response was denial. He told a Denver television station, [...] "I {{did not have}} a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver... I am steady with my wife.

We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine in our house. We don't do that kind of thing." [...] Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: [...] "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election [...] especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and <b>smoke</b> <b>pot,</b> and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E

Billboard magazine rated the song three and half out of five stars, calling it [...] "a haze of nostalgia". The review acclaimed Snoop Dogg's effortless flow, although it criticized the flow by Whiz Khalifa labeled its delivery as [...] "forceful" [...] and [...] "punchy" [...] since it [...] "gets on top of the beat and harshes the mellow laid-back production." [...] In a similar review, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy had a positive opinion towards Dogg's verses, while finding the single [...] "cool and addictive". However, he felt that the flavor of the recording didn't last long. In negative perspective, Shea Serrano from LA Weekly compared the track's atmospheric to the [...] "inside of a cloud (smoke), a celebration or idea of what some teenagers who <b>smoke</b> <b>pot</b> would like". The reviewer continued by saying that you can't have a song where the protagonists are not young, wild & free, addressing such critics to Snoop Dogg.|$|E
