50|$|A <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> - also {{referred}} to as an operating light or surgical lightheadis a medical device intended to assist medical personnel during a surgical procedure by illuminating a local area or cavity of the patient. A combination of several surgical lights {{is often referred to as}} a “surgical light system”.|$|E
50|$|A lack of {{diagnostic}} markers for liver failure {{makes it difficult}} to predict which patients may experience liver failure, and the mechanism of liver failure is poorly understood. A retrospective European study identified 31 EPP patients receiving a liver transplant between 1983 and 2008, with phototoxic reactions in 25% of patients who were unprotected by <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> filters. The same study noted a 69% recurrence of the disease in the grafted organ. Five UK liver transplants for EPP have been identified between 1987 and 2009.|$|E
40|$|Ergonomic {{problems}} of <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> {{systems have been}} indicated by surgeons; however, the underlying causes are not clear. The aim of this dissertation is to assess the problems in detail, and subsequently clarify the underlying causes. In {{the first stage of}} the research, the observation method was used to quantify the luminaire use during 46 hours of open routine surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. The location of the observation study was the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis hospital in Delft, which employs the Berchtold Chromophare C series as the <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> system. The results showed that every 7. 5 minute a luminaire action takes place, intended to reposition the luminaire. Of these LAs, 74 % was performed by surgeons and residents. For 64 % of these LAs the surgical tasks of OR-staff were interrupted. Observed difficulties were collision of the luminaire against any object, or that the luminaire was out of reach for the surgeon in a sitting posture. The primary difficulty appeared in the kinetic relation during the SLS and user interaction, as manoeuvrability of the luminaire was cumbersome and in some situations the system was immovable. These problems primarily occur during the repositioning of the luminaire 2 dimensional plane of the pendant arms. In the second research stage a valid simulation model of the <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> system was constructed in MSC Adams software to allow virtual experiments to analyse the system mechanics. The model showed that the required force during luminaire usage depends on the location of the luminaire its work field and are on average higher than ergonomically acceptable. Primary cause of this difficulty with the current systems is the two pendant arms construction as the highest forces were found when the luminaire was directly below the ceiling suspension or in the peripheral region of the work field. In those regions the pendant arms are either in parallel or serial alignment. The force spectrum for luminaire use showed a diffuse image, ranging from 14 Newton till unlimited quantities when the system is unmovable. The average required force is 136 Newton in the region where the observed luminaire use was primarily undertaken. In addition, the software engineering model which was constructed in this study is applicable as a test procedure to analyse <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> systems. As a result, this dissertation stated novel insights into the OR lighting problem during open routine surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. And it presented a valid simulation model of a <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> system Berchtold Chromophare C series. The protocol for the model construction can be user to analyse <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> system of different brands using engineering software simulation. Furthermore, this dissertation presented a direction for future research and an improved user system interaction of the luminaire during surgical procedures.

5000|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs.In summary, the key topics for planning the <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> system include: ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> is an {{important}} tool for surgeons to create and maintain good visibility on the surgical task. Chapter 1 gives background {{to the field of}} (surgical) lighting and related terminology. Although the <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> has been developed strongly since its introduction a long time ago, the last decades only minor developments have been made. This lack of significant development suggests that the current state of surgical lighting is perfectly developed and functions without any flaws. However, literature might give a different perspective. Apparently, despite the lack of significant developments in surgical illumination, the current surgical lighting systems are not good enough yet.

40|$|In this {{research}} {{the ability of}} the ventilation system in an operating room to keep the operating table and the instrument tables free from airborne bacteria has been evaluated in an experimental mock-up for different ventilation systems under various static circumstances. To accomplish this, the VDI 2167 particle test {{has been used as a}} basis. In this test particles are released on the floor and smoke concentrations are measured on the operating table. The VDI 2167 method was able to distinguish the different systems, but did not provide for a complete evaluation. The thermal balance in the room plays a major role in whether a laminar downflow system works and the VDI method does not incorporate this into the tests in an adequate manner.

50|$|Operating {{rooms are}} spacious, easy to clean, and well-lit, {{typically}} with overhead <b>surgical</b> <b>lights,</b> {{and may have}} viewing screens and monitors. Operating rooms are generally windowless and feature controlled temperature and humidity. Special air handlers filter the air and maintain a slightly elevated pressure. Electricity support has backup systems {{in case of a}} black-out. Rooms are supplied with wall suction, oxygen, and possibly other anesthetic gases. Key equipment consists of the operating table and the anesthesia cart. In addition, there are tables to set up instruments. There is storage space for common surgical supplies. There are containers for disposables. Outside the operating room is a dedicated scrubbing area that is used by surgeons, anesthetists, ODPs (operating department practitioners), and nurses prior to surgery. An operating room will have a map to enable the terminal cleaner to realign the operating table and equipment to the desired layout during cleaning.|$|R

This paper describes results from a series of measurements that aim to qualify and quantify the influence of the shape of an operating lamp on the disturbance of the air flow around the lamp. Visualization and particle concentration measurements in combination with a fixed particle source are used to study the upward transport mechanism of particles underneath an operating lamp. Air velocity measurements are used to determine to quantify the size of the wake underneath the lamp. Several different shapes are used in this investigation. The results of the investigation are used to compare with the laminar flow indexes by Leenemann and Oostlander and to assess how well they describe the performance of a lamp with regard to keeping the air clean.

Method: The stock lens mount and lens were removed from a GoPro Hero 4 camera, and was refitted with a Peau Productions SuperMount and 25 mm lens. The modified GoPro Hero 4 camera was then fixed to an overhead <b>surgical</b> <b>light.</b> Results: Camera settings were set to 1080 p video resolution.

40|$|Optical imaging {{requires}} appropriate light sources. For image-guided surgery, {{in particular}} fluorescence-guided surgery, a high fluence rate, a long working distance, computer control, and precise control of wavelength are required. In this article, {{we describe the}} development of light-emitting diode (LED) -based light sources that meet these criteria. These light sources are enabled by a compact LED module that includes an integrated linear driver, heat dissipation technology, and real-time temperature monitoring. Measuring only 27 mm wide by 29 mm high and weighing only 14. 7 g, each module provides up to 6, 500 lx of white (400 – 650 nm) light and up to 157 mW of filtered fluorescence excitation light while maintaining an operating temperature ≤ 50 °C. We also describe software {{that can be used}} to design multimodule light housings and an embedded processor that permits computer control and temperature monitoring. With these tools, we constructed a 76 -module, sterilizable, three-wavelength <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> source capable of providing up to 40, 000 lx of white light, 4. 0 mW/cm 2 of 670 nm near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence excitation light, and 14. 0 mW/cm 2 of 760 nm NIR fluorescence excitation light over a 15 cm diameter field of view.

This is a retrospective study of 26 patients with early stage Tis-T 1 SqCCa of the larynx treated with PHOTOFRIN-mediated PDT. Intravenous PHOTOFRIN (porfimer-sodium) (dose 2. 0 mg/kg) was administered outpatient, followed by intraoperative photoactivation at 630 nm via fiberoptic microlens surface delivery (<b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> dose 50 – 100 J/cm 2) 48 – 60 h later. As much as 16 out of 26 patients (62 %) have demonstrated complete remission (average follow-up 40 months).

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the illumination characteristics of LED lights objectively to ease the selection of <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting.</b> Methods. The illuminance distributions of 5 main and 4 auxiliary lights were measured in 8 clinically relevant scenarios. For each light and scenario, the maximum illuminance E-c (klux) and the size of the light field d(10) (mm) were computed. Results. The results showed: that large variations for both E-c (25 - 160 klux) and d(10) (109 - 300 mm) existed; that using auxiliary lights reduced both E-c and d(10) by up to 80 % and 30 %; that with segmented lights, uneven light distributions occurred; and that with colored LED lights shadow edges on the surgical field became colored. Conclusions. Objective illuminance measurements show a wide variation between lights and a superiority of main over auxiliary lights. Uneven light distributions and colored shadows indicate that LED lights still need to converge to an optimal desig...|$|R

Solutions of distribution of airflow velocity, temperature, relative humidity and so on are presented and discussed. The PMV and PPD are calculated for assessing thermal comfort based on TCM model. The simulation {{results show that the}} values of PMV and PPD in some parts of human body are not within the standard acceptable range defined by ISO, but its comfortableness satisfies China national standard GB/T 18049 request.

40|$|Erythropoietic protoporphyria, EPP, is an {{inherited}} disease {{in which the}} main clinical manifestations are painful cutaneous sensitivity to intense light and liver disease which in some requires liver transplantation for survival. This thesis originated in questions and perceived limitations in understanding that accompanied {{the management of the}} patient in Study I. Study I-II details the successful reversal of liver failure in an EPP patient, compiles treatment modalities in a comprehensive literature review and reports curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) which had previously never been attempted in this context. HSCT leads to long-standing genotypic correction in the erythroid tissues and that this is enough to prevent the phenotypic manifestations. In Study II, we discuss some differences between EPP mouse models and human EPP and conclude that findings in EPP mice models should be interpreted with caution before they are applied to human EPP. Study III explores the risk for and the protection from phototoxic injuries caused by surgical luminaires. In this study we explored the risk for burn injuries in non-transplant surgery, the characteristics of optimal filters for use during liver transplant surgery, and different models to study light induced phototoxicity in vitro. We concluded that <b>surgical</b> <b>light</b> is harmless for EPP patients that are not in cholestatic liver failure and undergoing liver transplantation, that a yellow filter which blocks wavelengths below 470 nm seems optimal for liver transplantation and that an in vitro erythrocyte assay was a good model for studying phototoxicity. Study IV is a comprehensive review of the Swedish EPP cohort including demographic, clinical, biochemical and genetic features. An extensive questionnaire, genotyping and testing {{of a large number of}} biochemical parameters were used to collect data. In 2008 the prevalence in Sweden was 1 : 180, 000. Nine novel ferrochelatase mutations were found. Women had a lower erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration than men and tended to have a higher vitamin D concentration. Alterations in red blood cell parameters, iron parameters and liver function tests were common and 20 % had previously been diagnosed with gall stone disease. Life quality was markedly reduced by the disease and available treatments for phototoxicity had poor efficacy for most. The most common reported age at onset of symptoms was the first year of life, yet the mean age at diagnosis was 22 years. This diagnostic delay had worsened in the 21 st century. Study V describes all EPP patients that have been liver transplanted in Europe. We identified 37 transplants in 33 patients and compiled the overall outcome, the frequency of EPP specific complications such as disease recurrence in the graft, phototoxic burn injuries and postoperative neuropathy, any EPP specific treatments that had been used preoperatively and background characteristics including EPP genotype and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations. The overall survival was 80 percent at one year and 66 percent at five and ten years. Recurrent EPPrelated graft disease was common but did not seem to affect long-term survival. None of the patients that had been protected by light filters were burnt, in contrast to 20 % of the unprotected patients. Fifteen percent had prolonged postoperative motor neuropathy. Some of the limitations in knowledge that motivated this thesis have been elucidated but study results also point to several aspects of EPP that deserve further attention...|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} factors to {{consider}} when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install <b>surgical</b> <b>lights</b> or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does {{not interfere with the}} anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the head end without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the head end. Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.|$|R
40|$|During the surgery, the {{lighting}} unit often {{needs to be}} manually adapted. However, the manual manipulation may cause loss of concentration, loss of time and increased risk of infections. To improve the manipulation, a semi-automated lighting system commanded by the surgeon is suggested. The commands are given via a pointer device to indicate the desired location and orientation of the light beam. The pointer device is tracked in space with a low-cost infrared 6 DOF real-time system based on Nintendo Wii-Remotes. In this study, the precision and accuracy of the tracking system was tested with static markers, dynamic markers and with the pointer device. Moreover, the wound reconstruction was evaluated. The {{results showed that the}} tracking system is sufficiently precise and repeatable. On the other hand, the position accuracy was lower than expectations, especially with the pointer device. It is concluded that the method of collecting relevant parameters with a pointer device using a low-cost tracking system is promising for the <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> control application when a proper mapping of the system coordinates to the real world coordinates is achieved.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the need to}} have calibrated cameras in surgery rooms. Data can then be collected during surgeries to assist the surgeons and it can later be used for postoperation analysis. Typical techniques for camera calibration are not adequate for a medical environment due to the cameras constantly moving and with no rigid area always in the cameras’ view. The proposed approach is to calibrate cameras attached to <b>surgical</b> <b>lights</b> by utilizing extra cameras placed on the ceiling. The ceiling cameras find the position of the light cameras and calibrate their extrinsic parameters. This indirect calibration method provides an accurate method of camera calibration without limiting the normal operations of the surgeons. On average the indirect calibration was able to locate the light camera to 4. 81 mm of the position found by a standard camera calibration. The indirect calibration was also able to perform simple tracking to within 1. 28 mm of the location given by direct calibration.

40|$|In every hospital, the {{operating}} room is the most demanding work environment. To optimally perform his task, surgical luminaires are an important tool available to the surgeon. However, shortcomings in <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting</b> have been indicated and improvements can still be made to maximize {{the performance of the}} surgeon. A surgical luminaire should highlight the wound of the patient, even when the light is partially blocked by the hands of the surgeon and the wound is deep. However, it is not trivial to determine the light distribution of a surgical luminaire in the near field. The illuminance in the surgical site, calculated from intensity distributions, yield erroneous results, as the light source {{is considered to be a}} point source, which is only valid in the far field. To obtain correct illuminances in the near field, we obtained ray data using a near-field goniometer, which allowed to take the extent of the light source into account. This paper compares illuminances based on ray files to those experimentally obtained by a photometer. Experimental illuminances and simulated illuminances based on ray data correspond well, as our results show. Accurate illuminances can now be determined in the surgical site, by using ray data. In future work, illuminances will be calculated in more realistic scenarios as deep wounds, while the light may be partially blocked by the medical staff. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{advances}} in high-tech {{technology in the}} operating theatre, the increased number of persons involved, and the increased complexity of surgical procedures, medical errors are inflicted. To answer the main question: How to improve patient safety in the operating theatre during surgery? this thesis is split into three parts. Part A focuses on the processes concerning ‘planning, acting/ performing and recording’ surgical procedures. Currently, no surgical protocol uniformity exists and most operative notes are still dictated postoperatively. Operative notes are sometimes not written according to the guidelines for operative note writing, are subjective, and do not fully correspond to the actual events observed in the video recordings of that particular procedure. Part B focuses on {{the implementation of a}} Time Out Procedure plus Debriefing (TOPplus). Results show that operating team members hold different perceptions of communication, teamwork and situation awareness. Designing TOPplus by means of the user-centred participatory design approach, in combination with the context-specific design principles, proves advantageous for implementing the procedures and acts as a catalyst for related patient safety initiatives. Part C focuses on improving the working conditions of the operating team. During surgery problems are encountered within the sensorial, cognitive, physical, and environmental domain. Surgeons performing minimally invasive surgery experience physical discomfort in mainly neck, shoulder, and back. Although the importance of ergonomics is recognised, only few surgeons are aware of general ergonomic guidelines to improve their working conditions.

D. research project, an innovative light and ventilation concept has been developed to reduce post-operative infections. The system is currently patent-pending. When a patient undergoes surgery, {{there is still a}} chance between 1 and 4 that he or she will develop a post-operative infection. Besides pain and discomfort, these infections can lead to hospital re- admission, additional surgical procedures or even death of the patient. Also, these infections lead to increased costs for the patient and health care. One of the measures to reduce the infection rate is the ventilation system which refreshes the air in the operating room. In modern operating rooms, a ”laminar downflow” is installed. Such a laminar downflow system provides clean, cooled air, that descends on the patient from the plenum. However, this laminar flow is perturbed by the surgical luminaire, thus causing turbulent air flows. Post-operative infections may originate as airborne pathogenic particles from outside the protective zone enter the surgical site by these turbulent air flows. To reduce or even eliminate this disturbance of the laminar airflow by the <b>surgical</b> <b>lighting,</b> we propose an integrated concept of an LED-based and automated light source, mounted above a ventilation chamber. This integrated system needs to be as effective as state-of-the-art surgical luminaires. The technological know-how needed to build surgical luminaires, is not described in literature. Instead, this knowledge is part of the intellectual property of the companies that produce them. Therefore, this thesis first develops different tools that are needed to design adequate surgical lighting: both photometric and spectroscopic aspects are taken into account. Using this knowledge, an innovative and patent-pending lighting system is then proposed which will improve patient safety during surgery. status: publishe...|$|R

So the antibacterial testing was performed for the developed <b>surgical</b> gown. <b>Light</b> activate antibacterial mechanism which involves interaction with and transferring energy to oxygen {{so as to}} provide a source of an active or excited oxygen species known as singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is an activated form of the usual triplet state molecular oxygen. Upon exposure to normal light, the dyes {{used in the present}} invention generate singlet oxygen that kills microorganisms. Bacteria require less light though they are more sensitive to the singlet oxygen generated by the <b>light</b> activated dye. <b>Surgical</b> room illumination of about 2000 foot candles is more than sufficient. Test swatches of this plasma treated nonwoven were tested for microbiological kill by inoculating the swatches.|$|R
