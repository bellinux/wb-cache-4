5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath {{to do anything that}} would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of a}} UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> pushing OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send {{oil prices}} higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> <b>was</b> how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the United States {{government}} began {{to argue for}} the necessity of invading Iraq. This formally began with a speech by U.S President George W.

The verdict and sentencing were both appealed, but subsequently affirmed by Iraq's Supreme Court of Appeals. On 30 December 2006, Saddam was hanged.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to just about {{everyone}} but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history.

On 20 March, when the war effectively began, F-15Es fired AGM-130s against key communication, command and control buildings, and other key targets in Baghdad; {{a few of the}} weapons missed intended targets, possibly caused by the jamming operations of EA-6B Prowlers in the vicinity.|$|E
