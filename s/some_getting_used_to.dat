In contrast, Abbie Heppe of G4 TV found the recreation of the note tracking to have [...] "varying degrees of success", noting that while some of the guitar solos are more manageable, there were questionable sections in other songs arising from the nature of Star Power phrases when it was changed in Guitar Hero III. Gerstmann said that the difficulty of the non-lead guitar portions of the game was not as high as that of the lead guitar, primarily due to these songs' having been selected originally for being played by guitar controllers and not by a full band. Heppe suggests that some of these problems {{may be due to the}} farming out of the series to a different developer with no previous experience in the series. However, Bramwell was careful to note that Beenox Studios' effort on the game was strong, particularly with following the Guitar Hero: Metallica model, and their effort should not be dismissed due to how Activision chose to release the title.|$|E

40|$|This {{assignment}} {{focuses on}} the foot tagging, which {{is a relatively new}} phenomenon in the use of punishment. Foot tagging was introduced in Denmark in 2005, which makes it possible to reverse some prison sentences into doing the time at home, with an electronic foot tagging. Foot tagging is in general seen as a mild punishment, relative to prison, and there are many indications that foot tagging works rehabilitating. But what kind of suffering, does this sentence implie? Our analysis aims to uncover the offenders experience with foot tagging as punishment in practice. Based on interviews and other empirical data regarding. The offenders experiences, we analyze where and how, respectively, the gentle, suffering and rehabilitating elements in the foot tagging is located. For the analysis, we have made use of the theories of Michel Foucault, and Nils Christie's theory of the punitive values constant. The conclusions are in a very condensed version; that the punitive value is subjective and depends on ex. the offender's age, housing and social conditions. It consists of rehabilitating a schematization and disciplining the offender and his/hers everyday life, as <b>some</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the way...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The First World War {{was a long}} stalemated war {{in which}} {{millions}} of men fought and died. Many studies {{have looked at the}} reasons soldiers fought and stopped fighting. In this study, the perceptions that Belgian soldiers had of their enemy, Germany, are looked at. The Belgian army was stationed on {{a small part of the}} front at the coast, the last part of Belgium that is un-occupied. The war can be divided into three phases: the first phase is the invasion until the Germans were stopped, the second begins with the stalemate and the development of trench warfare on the Western Front, and the third and last phase is the pushing back of the Germans and final victory. In the first phase with the invasion and brutality of the Germans in Belgium, Belgian soldiers formed a view of Germans as barbarians, capable of anything. With the second phase the perceptions started to diverge among the men, depending on experience and surroundings of the soldiers; <b>some</b> <b>get</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> their new environment, old and new conflicts resurfaced, Germans faded into the background. On the other hand the war was still going on, violence of war was all around them, and brothers in arms were killed. In the third phase soldiers became enthusiastic again because of the prospect of being able to go home. With the ending of the war old grudges were not settled. The Peace treaty was not what was expected. A lot of memorials built at the time reflected views of Germany that very explicitly highlighted their perceived misbehavior, especially at the beginning on the war. Naturally this led to tensions between Belgium and Germany. Many Belgians never forgot what happened during the war, nor let go of their views that were formed...|$|R
