5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
25|$|They shopped their demo and {{met with}} many record {{companies}} during the summer, negotiated their potential contracts with a lawyer during autumn, and in winter finally signed with Essential Records, a division of Brentwood Music (now collectively entitled Provident Records). This was an unexpected step for the band, as Essential was the smallest company that they interviewed with, but they felt it was most like a family. In addition, Essential had <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> power from the larger Brentwood Music company which owned it, and Brentwood used a secular distributor, Silvertone Records of Zomba/Jive, {{in order to reach}} a wider audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} last {{sections}}, titled [...] "Who Do You Love Parts 1 and 2", are the most Bo Diddley-anchored sections of the song with vocals and his well-known beat. [...] The non-vocal sections have titles that play on the original, but beginning with different interrogatives: when, where, how, and which. [...] The second section features a jazz-influenced guitar solo by Gary Duncan and interplay with guitarist John Cipollina, while the third deconstructs into guitar effects and ambient audience sounds. [...] The fourth section returns to the Bo Diddley theme with a guitar solo by Cipollina, described in a Mojo magazine album review as [...] "distinctive, quivering, vibrato-heavy playing", with the band delivering a <b>solid</b> <b>backing.</b> [...] The fifth section highlights David Freiberg's bass lines and the sixth section is the coda with vocal and harmonies.|$|E

40|$|The {{solidification}} {{paths of}} Al-Zn-Mg alloys in the Al-rich corner were investigated. The thermodynamic {{data for the}} calculation are obtained by direct coupling with the CALPHAD software Thermo-Calc via its TQ 6 -interface and the COST 2 database. The influences of the initial compositions {{and the extent of}} <b>solid</b> <b>back</b> diffusion on the solidification path were numerically investigated by sample calculation of the ternary Al-Zn-Mg alloys. The calculation results of solidification paths of the selected alloys: Al- 5 Zn- 3 Mg (in wt. %), Al- 5 Zn- 10 Mg, Al- 2. 5 Zn- 15 Mg, Al- 10 Zn- 20. 5 Mg, Al- 8 Zn- 25 Mg, were: L→(L+α-Al), L→(L+α-Al) →(L+α-Al+TAU), L→(L+α-Al) →(L+α-Al+AlMg_β), L→(L+α-Al) →(L+α-Al+TAU) →(L+α-Al+TAU+AlMg_β), L→(L+α-Al) →(L+α-Al+AlMg_β) →(L+α-Al+TAU+AlMg_β), respectively. The results show that the initial compositions and the extent of <b>solid</b> <b>back</b> diffusion have a great influence on solidification path, and the amounts of eutectic phase increase with the decrease of the <b>solid</b> <b>back</b> diffusion coefficient. The equilibrium solute partition coefficients for Zn and Mg in alloys are also calculated and their influence on micro-segregation in the primary solidification of Al- 5 Zn- 10 Mg alloy is analyzed...|$|R
500|$|On 1 September 1965 Atrash was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), but acquired little de facto power {{because of the}} Military Committee's overarching control, with Atrash later remarking [...] "the officers let us do the talking although, as we later discovered, they had agreed beforehand... what the decisions would be." [...] The RCC {{played the role of}} parliament and Atrash was its speaker. In December tensions between the National Command (loyal to Aflaq and Bitar) and the Regional Command (loyal to Jadid and backed by the military) grew worse as elements of the former attempted to align with Military Committee member Muhammad Umran in an effort to split the military's support (and according to Syria expert Itamar Rabinovich, the Alawite officers' <b>solid</b> <b>backing)</b> of Jadid. However, Atrash, along with Munif al-Razzaz of Jordan and Jubran al-Majdalani and Ali al-Khalil of Lebanon, {{was a part of the}} group in the National Command that opposed confrontation with the Regional Command, citing the National Command's lack of military support and political power as well as the fundamental weakness of an alliance with Umran and Amin al-Hafiz. The latter two had been engaged in an antagonistic rivalry over leadership of the Military Committee.|$|E
2500|$|Taft had the <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> of the party's {{conservative}} wing. Former US Representative Howard Buffett of Nebraska (father of billionaire Warren Buffett) {{served as}} one of his campaign managers. With Dewey no longer an active candidate, many political pundits regarded Taft as the frontrunner. However, the race changed when Dewey and other moderates were able to convince Dwight D. Eisenhower, the most popular general of World War II, to run for the nomination. Eisenhower ran because of his fear that Taft's non-interventionist views in foreign policy, [...] especially his opposition to NATO, might benefit the Soviet Union in the Cold War.|$|E

[...] However, roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water and thousands still live in camps or similar substandard conditions. Despite all these efforts, every rainy season or hurricane has caused a temporary spike in cases and deaths. [...] Per the Haitian Health Ministry, as of August 2012, the outbreak had caused 7,490 deaths and caused 586,625 people to fall ill. [...] According to the Pan American Health Organization, as of 21 November 2013, there had been 689,448 cholera cases in Haiti, leading to 8448 deaths.|$|E

2500|$|In 1862, {{paper money}} was issued without {{the backing of}} {{precious}} metals, due to the Civil War. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the War of 1812. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase [...] "not worth a continental". This was a primary reason for the [...] "No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts" [...] clause in [...] of the United States Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its {{conservative}} wing (based in the West and South) and moderate/liberal wing, sometimes called Rockefeller Republicans (based in the Northeast). He alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch fiscal conservatism and militant anti-communism. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on {{the right wing of}} the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton, to challenge him. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> from Southern Republicans. A young [...] Birmingham lawyer, John Grenier, secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier would serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign, the number 2 position to party chairman Dean Burch of Arizona.|$|E
60|$|It may, perhaps, be {{supposed}} that the snow-walls melted under this ordeal; {{nothing of the}} sort. Their tendency to do so was checked effectually, not only by a sharp frost, but by the <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> of snow behind them; and the little that did give way {{in close proximity to}} the fire ran unobtrusively down to the earth and crept away under the snow towards the sea, for Bellew had made his camp with the fire at its lower end, so that not a drop of water could by any means reach the spot whereon he lay.|$|E

60|$|It must, however, {{be remembered}} that the British people are {{more than any other}} people in the world a {{manufacturing}} people. It is certain that our population could never have attained its present vast numbers, nor our country have achieved its position in the world, without an altogether unusual reliance upon manufacture as opposed to simple agriculture. The ordinary changes and transitions inseparable from the active life and growth of modern industry, therefore, operate here with greater relative intensity than in other countries. An industrial disturbance is more serious in Great Britain than in other countries, for it affects a far larger proportion of the people, and in their distresses the urban democracy are not sustained by the same <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> of country-folk and peasant cultivators that we see in other lands. It has, therefore, become a paramount necessity for us to make scientific provision against the fluctuations and set-backs which are inevitable in world commerce and in national industry.|$|E
60|$|Those who are possessed, {{and desire}} to see others possessed, by that {{conception}} of literary study must watch with the greatest sympathy and admiration the efforts {{of those who are}} striving so hard, and, I hope, so successfully, to bring the systematic and methodical study of our own literature, in connection with other literatures, among subjects for teaching and examination in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. I regard those efforts with the liveliest interest and sympathy. Everybody agrees that an educated man ought to have a general notion of the course of the great outward events of European history. So, too, an educated man ought to have a general notion of the course of all those inward thoughts and moods which find their expression in literature. I think that in cultivating the study of literature, as I have perhaps too laboriously endeavoured to define it, you will be cultivating the most important side of history. Knowledge of it gives stability and substance to character. It furnishes a view of the ground we stand on. It builds up a <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> of precedent and experience. It teaches us where we are. It protects us against imposture and surprise.|$|E
60|$|There is {{a valley}} {{of rocks and}} stones in every shade of red and brown, called the Valley of the Kings, where a little oil-engine coughs behind its hand all day long, {{grinding}} electricity to light the faces of dead Pharaohs a hundred feet underground. All down the valley, during the tourist season, stand char-a-bancs and donkeys and sand-carts, with here and there exhausted couples who have {{dropped out of the}} processions and glisten and fan themselves in some scrap of shade. Along the sides of the valley are the tombs of the kings neatly numbered, as it might be mining adits with concrete steps leading up to them, and iron grilles that lock of nights, and doorkeepers of the Department of Antiquities demanding the proper tickets. One enters, and from deeps below deeps hears the voices of dragomans booming through the names and titles of the illustrious and thrice-puissant dead. Rock-cut steps go down into hot, still darkness, passages-twist and are led over blind pits which, men say, the wise builders childishly hoped would be taken for the real tombs by thieves to come. Up and down these alley-ways clatter all the races of Europe with a <b>solid</b> <b>backing</b> of the United States. Their footsteps are suddenly blunted {{on the floor of a}} hall paved with immemorial dust that will never dance in any wind. They peer up at the blazoned ceilings, stoop down to the minutely decorated walls, crane and follow the sombre splendours of a cornice, draw in their breaths and climb up again to the fierce sunshine to re-dive into the next adit on their programme. What they think proper to say, they say aloud--and some of it is very interesting. What they feel you can guess from a certain haste in their movements--something between the shrinking modesty of a man under fire and the Hadn't-we-better-be-getting-on attitude of visitors to a mine. After all, it is not natural for man to go underground except for business or for the last time. He is conscious of the weight of mother-earth overhead, and when to her expectant bulk is added the whole beaked, horned, winged, and crowned hierarchy of a lost faith flaming at every turn of his eye, he naturally wishes to move away. Even the sight of a very great king indeed, sarcophagused under electric light in a hall full of most fortifying pictures, does not hold him too long.|$|E
