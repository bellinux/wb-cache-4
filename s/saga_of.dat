5|$|Leif and {{his crew}} {{travelled}} from Greenland to Norway in 999 AD. Blown off course to the Hebrides and staying {{for much of the}} summer, he arrived in Norway and became a hirdman of King Olaf Tryggvason. He also converted to Christianity and was given the mission of introducing the religion to Greenland. The <b>Saga</b> <b>of</b> Erik the Red and the <b>Saga</b> <b>of</b> the Greenlanders, both thought to have been written around 1200, contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland. The only two known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen c. 1075 and in the Book of Icelanders compiled c. 1122 by Ari the Wise. According to the <b>Saga</b> <b>of</b> Erik the Red, Leif apparently saw Vinland for the first time after being blown off course on his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland.|$|E

5|$|Norse sagas telling {{parts of}} the story of Augvald include the <b>Saga</b> <b>of</b> Olaf Tryggvason (both by Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla and by Oddr Snorrason), the <b>Saga</b> <b>of</b> Half & His Heroes and the Flateyjarbok. He also appears in the later Historia rerum Norvegicarum and other works of the Icelandic {{historian}} Thormodus Torfæus, who lived and worked in Kopervik, Karmøy. In addition, Augvald is mentioned in the Avaldsnes parish register, and in local Karmøy legends. Scholars have been very sceptical about the reliability of the legendary sagas, which were dismissed as being of little value even in the early 20th century, before the establishment of general source criticism. The legendary sagas' value as sources has not been re-evaluated in recent times.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historical}} sources, Augvald and his cow {{were taken from}} the battlefield and buried at Avaldsnes. In his <b>Saga</b> <b>of</b> Olav Tryggvason, Oddr Snorrason writes that Tryggvason excavated two mounds on Karmøy, revealing the bones of a man in one and those of a cow in the other. Local legends contradict Augvald's burial at Avaldsnes, stating instead that he was buried in Ferkingstad, {{on the south side of}} the 12th-century churchyard. A large memorial stone, still standing, was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald.|$|E

5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes.

The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.
