Here, if we analogize the updated equation in Equation  12 to the CS-based <b>sparse</b> <b>channel</b> estimation [10, 11], one can find that more accurate <b>sparse</b> <b>channel</b> approximation is adopted, and then better estimation accuracy could be obtained and vice versa. The conventional sparse penalties are ℓp-norm (0 [*]<[*]p[*]≤[*] 1) and ℓ 0 -norm, respectively. Since ℓ 0 -norm penalty on sparse signal recovery is a well-known NP-hard problem, only the ℓp-norm (0 [*]<[*]p[*]≤[*] 1)-based sparse LMS approaches have been proposed for adaptive <b>sparse</b> <b>channel</b> estimation. Compared to conventional two sparse LMS algorithms (ZA-LMS and RZA-LMS), LP-LMS can achieve a better estimation performance. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LP-LMS-based channel estimator and the optimal one. As the development of mathematics continues, a more accurate sparse approximate algorithm to ℓ 0 -norm LMS (L 0 -LMS) is proposed in [22] and analyzed in [23]. However, they never considered any application on <b>sparse</b> <b>channel</b> estimation.

Based on this separation, the proposed SMP algorithm simultaneously detects the common channel taps of dynamic <b>sparse</b> <b>channels</b> in all time slots at first, and then tracks the dynamic channel taps in each single time slot individually. Theoretical analysis of the proposed SMP algorithm provides a guarantee that the common channel taps can be successfully detected with a high probability, and the reconstruction distortion of dynamic <b>sparse</b> <b>channels</b> is linearly upper bounded by the noise power. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SMP algorithm has excellent reconstruction performance with competitive computational complexity compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating <b>sparse</b> <b>channels</b> in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. Most wireless <b>channels</b> are <b>sparse</b> in nature with large delay spread. In addition, these channels as observed by multiple antennas in a neighborhood have approximately common support. The sparsity and common support properties are attractive {{when it comes to}} the efficient estimation of large number of channels in massive MIMO systems. Moreover, to avoid pilot contamination and to achieve better spectral efficiency, it is important to use a small number of pilots. We present a novel channel estimation approach which utilizes the sparsity and common support properties to estimate <b>sparse</b> <b>channels</b> and require a small number of pilots. Two algorithms based on this approach have been developed which perform Bayesian estimates of <b>sparse</b> <b>channels</b> even when the prior is non-Gaussian or unknown. Neighboring antennas share among each other their beliefs about the locations of active channel taps to perform estimation. The coordinated approach improves channel estimates and also reduces the required number of pilots. Further improvement is achieved by the data-aided version of the algorithm. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

To exploit the channel sparsity, LMS-based adaptive <b>sparse</b> <b>channel</b> estimation methods have been proposed based on different sparse penalties, such as ℓ 1 -norm LMS or zero-attracting LMS (ZA-LMS), reweighted ZA-LMS, and ℓp-norm LMS.
