Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E

25|$|Figures such as agent Max Clifford {{have advised}} gay players {{to keep their}} {{sexuality}} a secret {{for the sake of}} their careers, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be openly gay would potentially damage their playing prospects. This would also apply abroad, where even if accepted in England a gay player might face a new barrier if he wished to play in a country less accepting of homosexuality. Coming out would undoubtedly bring a gay player abuse from the terraces, and perhaps elsewhere too; this would affect some players more than others.|$|E

The administration refused to divulge the number of raptor deaths reported to it by wind companies, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> do so would reveal trade secrets. The government also ordered federal law enforcement field agents not to pursue bird-death prosecutions against wind companies without prior approval from Washington.

500|$|Roughly a {{week before}} the {{supposed}} arrival of PlanetX in May 2003, Lieder appeared on KROQ-FM radio in Los Angeles, and advised listeners to euthanize their pets in anticipation of the event as she had done. This led the Fortean Times to conclude that she had put down her dog(s) to save them from further suffering during the Pole Shift. Later, in a 2004 interview she said that she had euthanized her dog because it was acting aggressively. After the 2003 date passed without incident, Lieder said that it was merely a [...] "white lie... to fool the establishment." [...] She refused to disclose the true date, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> do so would give those in power enough time to declare martial law and trap people in cities during the shift, leading to their deaths.|$|E

500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, {{but they were not}} entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. [...] On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would [...] "amount to judicial murder." [...] Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on [...] "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial." ...|$|E

[...] Some Israeli supporters said that Clinton never should have kissed the wife of the Palestinian leader, especially after such inflammatory remarks. The following day, Clinton denounced Suha Arafat's allegations, and said that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat had told her Suha Arafat had been referring to 'tear gas' and not 'poison gas'. The kiss became a campaign issue, especially with Jewish voters. [...] Clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident. [...] Clinton later wrote that the live Arabic-to-English translation had failed to convey the accurate nature of her remarks: [...] "Had I been aware of her hateful words, I would have denounced them on the spot." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{message was}} {{read to the}} Commons later in the morning, and the MPs decided to simply ignore it, not even bothering to reply. In {{response}} to the message, the Lords proposed eight alterations to the petition and the modification of the imprisonment clause to appease the king. When these changes were debated on 13 May, they were all rejected except for one minor change in wording. The Lords still favoured a compromise, and suggested {{the addition of a}} paragraph to the petition reading [...] "We humbly present this petition to your majesty, not only with a care of preserving our own liberties, but with due regard to leave entire that sovereign power, wherewith your majesty is trusted, for the protection, safety, and happiness of your people". By 20 May the Commons had agreed to one more minor alteration, but had not decided whether to accept the new paragraph. Coke made a speech urging them to reject all of it, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> use the phrase [...] "sovereign power" [...] would mean admitting that the King had the power to destroy any limitations the Petition might place on his power".|$|E

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content.

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
