5|$|In August 2012, a <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> {{escaped from}} the zoo and went on the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|Johann Georg Wagler {{gave the}} species its current {{binomial}} name in 1832 when he erected the new genus Eudocimus, whose only other species is the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> (E.ruber). There {{has long been}} debate on whether the two should be considered subspecies or closely related species, and the American Ornithologists' Union considers the two to be a superspecies as they are parapatric. The lack of observed hybrids was a large factor in {{the view that the}} species were separate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{park has}} a Ranger Station which open for {{visitors}} from 8am to dusk, and has potable water and restrooms. There {{is also a}} Biological Station on the site operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies. A major feature of the park is the density and variety of bird species, {{a major factor in}} the creation of the reserve, due in part to its diverse ecology, with 15 different topographical zones from evergreen forests to mangrove swamps. Birds spotted regularly in the park include great curassows, <b>scarlet</b> macaws, white <b>ibis,</b> roseate spoonbills, anhingas, jabirus, and wood storks among many others.|$|R
5|$|However, in a {{field study}} {{published}} in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has been followed by least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is {{a species}} of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south {{through most of the}} coastal New World tropics. This {{particular}} ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis.</b> The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} birds for Trinidad and Tobago are the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> and the cocrico. The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> is kept safe by {{the government}} by living in the Caroni Bird Sanctuary which was set up {{by the government}} for the protection of these birds. The Cocrico is more indigenous to the island of Tobago {{and are more likely to}} be seen in the forest.|$|E

25|$|The Caroni Swamp, {{the largest}} {{mangrove}} wetland in Trinidad and Tobago, is located just {{north and west}} of the town. The swamp is a popular tourist attraction and roosting ground for the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis,</b> national bird of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
25|$|Two other birds, in {{addition}} to the blue bird and <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> {{can be seen in the}} composition, one of which resembles a green heron.

25|$|The central {{standing}} 'foreground' {{figure is}} shown affectionately holding {{in both hands}} a blue bird (thus {{the title of the}} painting). The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with the unmistakable coloration of the rare <b>Scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> (L'Ibis rouge), a rich symbol for both exoticism and fashion. Costume designers for Parisian cabarets such as Le Lido, Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge and haute couture houses in Paris during the 1910s used the feathers of the <b>scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> in their shows and collections. The Ibis is a bird to which the ancient Egyptians paid religious worship and attributed to it a 'virgin purity'. A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a porthole {{to the right of the}} reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a sundial, perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his Nude of 1910.|$|E
25|$|The 3278 hectare {{protected}} Caroni Swamp {{has long}} formed a physical {{barrier to the}} city's expansion to the south, forcing urban growth relentlessly eastward {{at the expense of}} a traffic relieving ring road. This west coast mangrove area is the island's second largest wetland after the east coast Nariva Swamp which is almost twice as large. It has well over 160 species of birds, including the national bird, the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis.</b> It is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions with visitor facilities and regular guided boat tours.|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} in mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks with the glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in flooded fields, and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for crabs and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain. The wood stork {{is also found in}} the same habitat in Florida, but hunts larger prey and a higher percentage of fish, so there is little overlap. In the Llanos, where American white ibis coexist with the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis,</b> their diets differ, the former consuming more bugs, fish and crustaceans, while the latter eat a much higher proportion of beetles. The willet (Tringa semipalmata) has been observed trailing American white ibis and catching prey disturbed by them, and even kleptoparasitizing (stealing) from them, in J. N. [...] "Ding" [...] Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island in Florida. An isolated event of [...] predation in juvenile American white ibis has been observed, where a juvenile attacked and consumed a chick from another nest.|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis is a tactile, nonvisual forager, {{which limits}} {{its ability to}} choose {{from a wide variety}} of prey. For the most part, the American white ibis forages for food by tactile probing. It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long, downcurved bill into the {{substrate}} of the water body with its bill held at around [...] agape at the tip, and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items. Birds may also probe when standing still. Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone, as is head swinging, in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water. Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it. On land, the American white ibis locates prey by sight and pecks, and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate. The American white ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around, as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat, and other predators such as herons and egrets often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch. Along with the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis,</b> the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela. American white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior.|$|E
500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon feeds {{almost exclusively on}} medium-sized birds such as pigeons and doves, waterfowl, songbirds, and waders. Worldwide, {{it is estimated that}} between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species (up to roughly a fifth of the world's bird species) are predated somewhere by these falcons. In North America, prey has varied in size from [...] hummingbirds (Selasphorus and Archilochus ssp.) to a [...] sandhill crane (killed in Alaska by a peregrine in a stoop), although most prey taken by peregrines weigh from [...] (small passerines) to [...] (such as ducks and gulls). The {{peregrine falcon}} takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in North America, with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon, including nearly 100 shorebirds. Smaller hawks and owls are regularly predated, mainly smaller falcons such as the American kestrel, merlin and sharp-shinned hawks. In urban areas, the main component of the peregrine's diet is the rock or feral pigeon, which comprise 80% or more of the dietary intake for peregrines in some cities. Other common city birds are also taken regularly, including mourning doves, common wood pigeons, common swifts, northern flickers, common starlings, American robins, common blackbirds, and corvids (such as magpies or carrion, house, and American crows). Other than bats taken at night, the peregrine rarely hunts mammals, but will on occasion take small species such as rats, voles, hares, shrews, mice and squirrels. Coastal populations of the large subspecies pealei feed almost exclusively on seabirds. In the Brazilian mangrove swamp of Cubatão, a wintering falcon of the subspecies tundrius was observed while successfully hunting a juvenile <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis.</b> Insects and reptiles make up a small proportion of the diet, which varies greatly depending on what prey is available.|$|E

60|$|In {{this class}} the sexes when adult {{resemble}} each other, and {{differ from the}} young. This occurs with many birds of many kinds. The male robin can hardly be distinguished from the female, but the young are widely different, with their mottled dusky-olive and brown plumage. The male and female of the splendid <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> are alike, whilst the young are brown; and the scarlet colour, though common to both sexes, is apparently a sexual character, for it is not well developed in either sex under confinement; {{and a loss of}} colour often occurs with brilliant males when they are confined. With many species of herons the young differ greatly from the adults; and the summer plumage of the latter, though common to both sexes, clearly has a nuptial character. Young swans are slate-coloured, whilst the mature birds are pure white; but it would be superfluous to give additional instances. These differences between the young and the old apparently depend, as in the last two classes, on the young having retained a former or ancient state of plumage, whilst the old of both sexes have acquired a new one. When the adults are bright coloured, we may conclude from the remarks just made in relation to the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> and to many herons, and from the analogy of the species in the first class, that such colours have been acquired through sexual selection by the nearly mature males; but that, differently from what occurs in the first two classes, the transmission, though limited to the same age, has not been limited to the same sex. Consequently, the sexes when mature resemble each other and differ from the young.|$|E
60|$|CLASS III. When {{the adult}} male resembles the adult female, the young {{of both sexes}} have a {{peculiar}} first plumage of their own.—In this class both sexes when adult resemble each other, and differ from the young.

The male and female of the splendid <b>scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> are alike, whilst the young are brown; and the scarlet-colour, though common to both sexes, is apparently a sexual character, for it is not well developed with birds under confinement, {{in the same manner}} as often occurs in the case of brilliantly coloured male birds. With many species of herons the young differ greatly from the adults, and their summer plumage, though common to both sexes, clearly has a nuptial character. Young swans are slate-coloured, whilst the mature birds are pure white; but it would be superfluous to give additional instances. These differences between the young and the old apparently depend, as in the two last classes, on the young having retained a former or ancient state of plumage, which has been exchanged for a new plumage by the old of both sexes. When the adults are brightly coloured, we may conclude from the remarks just made in relation to the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis</b> and to many herons, and from the analogy of the species in the first class, that such colours have been acquired through sexual selection by the nearly mature males; but that, differently from what occurs in the two first classes, the transmission, though limited to the same age, has not been limited to the same sex.

60|$|In {{considering}} {{the question we}} are now investigating, {{it is not necessary}} to take into account the larger and more powerful birds, because these seldom depend much on concealment to secure their safety. In the raptorial birds bright colours are as a rule absent; and their structure and habits are such as not to require any special protection for the female. The larger waders are sometimes very brightly coloured in both sexes; but they are probably little subject to the attacks of enemies, since the <b>scarlet</b> <b>ibis,</b> the most conspicuous of birds, exists in immense quantities in South America. In game birds and water-fowl, however, the females are often very plainly coloured, when the males are adorned with brilliant hues; and the abnormal family of the Megapodidæ offers us the interesting fact of an identity in the colours of the sexes (which in Megacephalon and Talegalla are somewhat conspicuous), in conjunction with the habit of not sitting on the eggs at all.|$|E

The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> then gained protection and could no longer be hunted. The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> (Eudocimus ruber), travels to Venezuela every day from the Caroni Swamp.

During the evening, the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> returns to the Swamp where it roosts in the mangrove trees (destination tnt). Watching the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Ibis</b> return from feeding on the mainland of Venezuela is the main attraction for many tourists (mytobagoinfo). Their vibrant red feathers fill the sky as they return to the swamp (gotrinidadandtobago). The Scarlet Ibis’ bright red color comes from the pigments from their food.
