40|$|<b>Stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> {{depletion}} plays a {{major role}} in driving climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. To date, many climate models prescribe the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer's</b> evolution using monthly and zonally averaged ozone fields. However, the prescribed ozone underestimates Antarctic ozone depletion and lacks zonal asymmetries. In this study we investigate the impact of using interactive stratospheric chemistry instead of prescribed ozone on climate change simulations of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean. Two sets of 1960 - 2010 ensemble transient simulations are conducted with the coupled ocean version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 : one with interactive stratospheric chemistry and the other with prescribed ozone derived from the same interactive simulations. The model's climatology is evaluated using observations and reanalysis. Comparison of the 1979 - 2010 climate trends between these two simulations reveals that interactive chemistry has important effects on climate change not only in the Antarctic stratosphere, troposphere, and surface, but also in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic sea ice. Interactive chemistry causes stronger Antarctic lower stratosphere cooling and circumpolar westerly acceleration during November-December-January. It enhances stratosphere-troposphere coupling and leads to significantly larger tropospheric and surface westerly changes. The significantly stronger surface wind stress trends cause larger increases of the Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation, leading to year-round stronger ocean warming near the surface and enhanced Antarctic sea ice decrease...|$|R

[...] The evidence for photosynthesis in the rock record is varied, but primary evidence comes from around 3000 Ma, in rock records and fossil evidence of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizing prokaryotic organisms. [...] Cyanobacteria use water as a reducing agent, producing atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct, and they thereby profoundly changed the early reducing atmosphere of the earth to one in which modern aerobic organisms eventually evolved. [...] This oxygen liberated by cyanobacteria then oxidized dissolved iron in the oceans, the iron precipitated {{out of the sea}} water, and fell to the ocean floor to form sedimentary layers of oxidized iron called Banded Iron Formations (BIFs). [...] These BIFs are part of the geological record of evidence for the evolutionary history of plants by identifying when photosynthesis originated. [...] This also provides deep time constraints upon when enough oxygen could have been available in the atmosphere to produce the ultraviolet blocking <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> [...] The oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere subsequently rose, acting as a poison for anaerobic organisms, and resulting in a highly oxidizing atmosphere, and opening up niches on land for occupation by aerobic organisms.|$|E
