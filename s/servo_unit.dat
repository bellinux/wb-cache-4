50|$|On 19 December 1997, SilkAir Flight 185, {{operated}} by a Boeing 737-300 and piloted by Captain Tsu Way Ming, plunged into the Musi River in Sumatra during a routine flight from Jakarta to Singapore, killing all 104 people on board. The crash was investigated by various groups, with different results. The Indonesian NTSC, who were lead investigators, stated that {{they were unable to}} determine the cause, while the US NTSB concluded that the crash resulted from an intentional act by a pilot, most likely the captain. A civil lawsuit case against Parker Hannifin, the manufacturer of the PCU-dual <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> essential in the 737's rudder control—and also suspected in causing the crashes of United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427 under similar flight-event parameters, had provided the NTSB the initial test results of the recovered PCU-dual <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> from Flight 185 in 1997, but was later further independently investigated for litigation on behalf some families of Flight 185 passengers in a civil lawsuit against Parker Hannifin. The jury under the Superior Court in Los Angeles in 2004, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB conclusions, decided that the crash was caused by a prominent issue inherent in other 737 crashes: a defective servo valve inside the Power Control Unit (PCU) which controls the aircraft's rudder, causing a rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft's rudder controls and the families later reached an out of court settlement.|$|E

40|$|I detta examensarbete har ett problem som varit en del av ett pågående projekt på ElektaInstrument AB undersökts och en lösning har föreslagits. Problemet har varit att utveckla och modellera en servoenhet som med hög {{precision}} kanpositionera ett instrument i fem dimensioner (tre translaterande och två roterande) och som kanhålla instrumentet på sin position med hög styvhet. Problemet löstes genom att först specificera kraven på servoenheten, sedan undersöktes olikabefintliga koncept för att uppnå kraven. Det bästa konceptet, en Stewart-Gough plattform, valdesoch studerades och analyserades sedan i detalj. Analysen gjordes i två steg, det första steget var att göra beräkningar av krafter och benlängdersom en funktion av positionen för en Stewart-Gough plattform. Det andra steget var att realiseraberäkningarna och implementera dessa i kod och hårdvara för att styra fysiska motorer och fådem att bete sig som önskat enligt beräkningarna. Resultatet av första delen av analysen är ett MATLAB program som kan beräknainverskinematiken och benkrafterna för en godtycklig Stewart-Gough plattform som belastasmed en godtycklig kraftvektor och en godtycklig momentvektor. Programmet kan även itereraberäkningarna för olika lägen för Stewart-Gough plattformen och för olika belastningar ochskriva ut extremvärdena som beräknats. Den andra delen av analysen resulterade i ett LabView program för simultan styrning av sexmotorer och hårdvara för att driva sex motorer. Styrningen har testats på befintliga motorer medlyckat resultat. Resultaten av examensarbetet visar att Stewart-Gough plattformen kan uppfylla kraven som ärställda på servoenheten. Under examensarbetet har alla nödvändiga beräkningar för att kunnastyra en Stewart-Gough plattform gjorts och hårdvaran för styrning av motorer har utvecklats. Parallellt med examensarbetet har ingenjörer på Elekta Instrument AB utvecklat mekaniken tillStewart-Gough plattformen, när examensarbetet avslutas är steget till en första prototyp mycketlitet. In this Master of Science thesis {{a problem}} {{that has been a}} part of an ongoing project at ElektaInstrument has been examined and a solution has been suggested. The problem has been to develop a <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> that is able to position an instrument in fivedegrees of freedom (three translational and two rotational) with high precision and that is able tohold that instrument in its position with high stiffness. The problems were solved by specifying the requirements of the <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> and compare themwith existing concepts. The concepts were evaluated and the best concept, the Stewart-Goughplatform, was chosen and was thoroughly studied and analyzed. The analysis was conducted in two steps, the first step was to calculate the forces and the leglengths as a function of a position for a Stewart-Gough platform. The second step was to realizethe calculations and implement them in code and hardware to control physical motors and makethem behave as desired according to the calculations. The result of the first step was a MATLAB program that can calculate the inverse kinematicsand leg forces for any Stewart-Gough platform that is subjected to any force and momentumvector. The program can also iterate the calculations for a number of positions and loads for theplatform and display relevant extreme values. The result of the second step is a LabView program for simultaneous control of six motors andhardware that is able to control and drive the motors.

Second, the maximum earthquake displacement can not be larger than the table. s displacement capacity. In the present work, the recorded strong motion acceleration time series are processed in order to obtain useful data for engineering analysis. Strong motion accelerogram processing (earthquake data processing) is performed in Scilab. The objectives of strong motion data processing are corrections for the response of the strong motion instrument itself, and reduction of random noise in the recorded signals. The processing concentrates on the lowfrequency ranges of the usable signal in the records. The results obtained from comparison of the present work's outputs and some data providers' outputs are satisfactory.

Many products in industry tend to be complex, which in turn makestroubleshooting procedures trickier. A fast and efficient repair process is oftendesired, since customers want the product to be repaired as fast as possible. The purpose of a troubleshooting procedure {{is to find a}} fault in a broken product,and to choose proper repair actions in a workshop. Such a procedure can besimplified by diagnosis tools, for example software programs that make faultconclusions based on fault codes. These tools can make such conclusions withthe help of algorithms, i. e. fault tracing algorithms. Before a product release, it is hard to specify all faults and connections in the system. New unknown fault cases are likely to arise after release, and somehow thisneed {{to be taken into account}} in the troubleshooting scenario. The troubleshootingprocedure can be made more robust, if new data could be easily incorporatedin the current structure. This work seek to answer how new data can be incorporatedin trouble shooting procedures. A good and reliable fault tracing algorithm is essential in the process of findingfaults and repair actions, which is the reason behind the focus of this thesis. Thepresented problem asks how a fault can be identified from fault codes and symptoms,in order to recommend suitable repair actions. Therefore, the problem isdivided into two parts, finding the fault and recommending repair actions.

Finally, this test apparatus was used to conduct a biaxial tensile test under different pre-bending loading and a tensile test at different rates; the image of the fracture of the test-piece was acquired by a scanning electron microscope and analyzed. It was indicated that as the pre-bending force rises, the elastic deformation phase would gradually shorten and the slope of the elastic deformation phase curve would slightly rise so that a yield limit would appear ahead of time.
