5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds <b>Shopping</b> <b>Plaza</b> have been built so close {{that it is difficult}} to see the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of Gates is a two-lane highway, the portion of Chili Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that has been {{transformed}} into a major commercial destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza</b> anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects to Howard Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E

5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the First Baptist Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north {{into the center of the}} village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza</b> in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street. Once on the north side of the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single grade crossing ahead of High Street. At this point, the businesses give way to homes as the highway ascends a hill at the north end of the village and meets Whitney Road at the northern village line.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{in an effort}} to boost Downtown and upgrade the city's western entrance, Federal and state Urban Cultural Park grants were used on Mill Street, a small brick-paved street between State and Church streets. Two {{restaurants}} opened with great success but later folded during Downtown's continued decline. The project was a failure and was home to abandoned concrete kiosks, planters, and benches all disgraced by graffiti as of 2006. Another failed attempt at urban renewal was the $11 million Canal Square <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza</b> next to Proctor's Theatre in the 1980s. This was praised by then-President of the United States Ronald Reagan {{as an example of the}} good that could be done by the smart use of urban renewal money. The <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza,</b> however, failed due to suburban competition. Another proposal that never got off the ground was to level Proctor's for a shopping mall.|$|E

25|$|Magain Shalome, the Bene Israel's only synagogue in Karachi founded {{under the}} British Raj, was {{demolished}} in 1988 {{to make way}} for a <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza</b> by order of General Zia-ul-Haq shortly after the Bene Israel community in Israel petitioned for its maintenance and use as a historical or other community center. By another account, in July 1988 the synagogue was burnt and brought down by religious zealots (where today a building 'Madiha Square' stands).|$|E

However, the <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza</b> {{is connected to the}} Pompano Beach sewer system. Power {{services are}} provided to the town by Florida Power & Light, with all residential power lines being buried underground. By having no utility poles inside the village, it is relatively easy to return power to the entire village following a storm, and is also aesthetically pleasing.|$|E
25|$|In Jensen Beach, Florida, {{the main}} line of the Florida East Coast Railway running north-south bisects the two-lane {{roundabout}} at the junction of Jensen Beach Boulevard running east–west. It hosts three other roads and the service entrance to a large <b>shopping</b> <b>plaza.</b> Boom barriers line the railway crossings. The landscaped central island bisected by the tracks was originally curbed/kerbed, but 18-wheelers had trouble negotiating the roundabout, so the curbs were replaced with painted concrete strips. The roundabout {{was built in the}} early 2000s and improved traffic flow, although long freight trains often cause delays.|$|E
