30|$|Bandpass sampling, reconstruction, and {{antialiasing}} filtering in analog front ends potentially {{provide the}} best performance of <b>software</b> <b>defined</b> <b>radios.</b> However, conventional techniques used for these procedures limit reconfigurability and adaptivity of the radios, complicate integrated circuit implementation, and preclude achieving potential performance. Novel sampling and reconstruction techniques with internal filtering eliminate these drawbacks and provide many additional advantages. Several ways to overcome the challenges of practical realization and implementation of these techniques are proposed and analyzed. The impact of sampling and reconstruction with internal filtering on the analog front end architectures and capabilities of <b>software</b> <b>defined</b> <b>radios</b> is discussed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Transmitter Leakage has a {{significant}} impact on the system performance in mobile devices using zero-IF receivers and thus requires a suitable compensation. In contrast to analog approaches, digital Tx Leakage compensation approaches can easily be reconfigured and therefore are highly attractive for future mobile devices, using <b>software</b> <b>defined</b> <b>radios.</b> In this contribution we show that Tx Leakage reduces the SNR at the ADC output. However, this SNR loss is negligibly weak in presence of moderate Tx Leakage. This proves that compensating the Tx Leakage in digital domain is a suitable approach to lower the requirements on the analog transceiver front end and to facilitate the design of <b>software</b> <b>defined</b> <b>radios.</b> I...|$|R

This paper presents an analysis and mitigation of RF impairments in wideband front-ends for <b>software</b> <b>defined</b> <b>radios,</b> focussing on non-linear distortions in the receiver. We discuss the effects of non-linear distortions upon spectrum sensing in cognitive radio and analyse {{the performance of a}} typical wideband software-defined receiver. Digital signal processing techniques are used to alleviate non-linear distortions in the baseband signal. A feed-forward mitigation algorithm with an adaptive filter is implemented and applied to real measurement data. The results obtained show that distortions can be suppressed significantly and thus increasing the reliability of spectrum sensing...|$|R
