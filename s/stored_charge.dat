25|$|The {{amount of}} charge stored per unit voltage in an {{electrochemical}} capacitor {{is primarily a}} function of the electrode size. The electrostatic storage of energy in the double-layers is linear with respect to the <b>stored</b> <b>charge,</b> and correspond to the concentration of the adsorbed ions. Also, while charge in conventional capacitors is transferred via electrons, capacitance in double-layer capacitors is related to the limited moving speed of ions in the electrolyte and the resistive porous structure of the electrodes. Since no chemical changes take place within the electrode or electrolyte, charging and discharging electric double-layers in principle is unlimited. Real supercapacitors lifetimes are only limited by electrolyte evaporation effects.|$|E
25|$|A battery's {{capacity}} {{is the amount}} of electric charge it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same open-circuit voltage. Capacity is measured in units such as amp-hour (A·h). The rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at , while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A·h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at room temperature. The fraction of the <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, {{the rate at which the}} charge is delivered (current), the required terminal voltage, the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.|$|E

2500|$|Conventional {{capacitors}} (also {{known as}} electrostatic capacitors), such as ceramic capacitors and film capacitors, consist of two electrodes which {{are separated by}} a dielectric material. When charged, the energy is stored in a static electric field that permeates the dielectric between the electrodes. The total energy increases {{with the amount of}} <b>stored</b> <b>charge,</b> which in turn correlates linearly with the potential (voltage) between the plates. The maximum potential difference between the plates (the maximal voltage) is limited by the dielectric's breakdown field strength. The same static storage also applies for electrolytic capacitors in which most of the potential decreases over the anode's thin oxide layer. The somewhat resistive liquid electrolyte (cathode) accounts for a small decrease of potential for [...] "wet" [...] electrolytic capacitors, while electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolyte this voltage drop is negligible.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, Taiwanese {{engineers}} from Macronix revealed {{their intention}} to announce at the 2012 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting that they had {{figured out how to}} improve NANDflash storage read/write cycles from 10,000 to 100 million cycles using a [...] "self-healing" [...] process that used a flash chip with [...] "onboard heaters that could anneal small groups of memory cells." [...] The built-in thermal annealing was to replace the usual erase cycle with a local high temperature process that not only erased the <b>stored</b> <b>charge,</b> but also repaired the electron-induced stress in the chip, giving write cycles of at least 100 million. The result was to be a chip that could be erased and rewritten over and over, even when it should theoretically break down. As promising as Macronix’s breakthrough might have been for the mobile industry, however, there were no plans for a commercial product to be released any time in the near future.|$|E

50|$|Baker clamp is {{a generic}} {{name for a}} class of {{electronic}} circuits that reduce the storage time of a switching bipolar junction transistor (BJT) by applying a nonlinear negative feedback through various kinds of diodes. The reason for slow turn-off times of saturated BJTs is the <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> in the base. It must be removed before the transistor will turn off since the storage time is a limiting factor of using bipolar transistors and IGBTs in fast switching applications. The diode-based Baker clamps prevent the transistor from saturating and thereby accumulating a lot of <b>stored</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} was {{familiar}} in discrete-device logic circuits used a diode and a resistor, a germanium and a silicon diode, or three diodes {{in a negative}} feedback arrangement. These diode networks known as various Baker clamps reduced the voltage applied to the base as the collector approached saturation. Because the transistor went less deeply into saturation, the transistor accumulated fewer <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> carriers. Therefore, less time was required to clear <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> during transistor turn off.
