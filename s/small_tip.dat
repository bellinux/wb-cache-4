6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} of Pitsea," [...] the doctor went on, [...] "but I do know Hole Haven. When I was walking the hospital, {{three or four of}} us had a little sailing-boat, and used to go out from Saturday until Monday morning. Hole Haven was {{generally}} the limit of our excursions. It is a snug little harbor for small boats, and there is a comfortable old-fashioned little inn there, where we used to sleep. The coastguards were all sociable fellows, ready to chat with strangers and not averse to a <b>small</b> <b>tip.</b> Of course the same men will not be there now, nor would it be very safe to ask questions of them; for no doubt they are on friendly terms with the men on the barges which go up and down the creek. I might, however, learn something from them of the ways of these men, and I should think that, on giving my card to the petty officer in charge, I could safely question him. I don't suppose that he would know where this man Nibson has his headquarters. If he lives at Rochester, or Chatham, or at Limehouse, or Shadwell, he certainly would not know him; but if he lives at Pitsea he might know him. I fancy they keep a pretty sharp lookout on the barges. I know that the coastguard told me that there was still a good deal of smuggling carried on in the marshes between Leigh and Thames Haven. I fancy, from what he said, that the Leigh fishermen think it no harm to run a few pounds of tobacco or a keg of spirit from a passing ship, and, indeed, as there are so many vessels that go ashore on the sands below, and as they are generally engaged in unloading them or helping them to get off, they have considerable facilities that way. At any rate, as an old frequenter of the place and as knowing the landlord--that is to say if there has been no change there--no suspicion could fall upon me of going down there in reference to your affair. To-day is Friday. On Sunday morning, early, I will run down to Gravesend, hire a boat there, and will sail down to Hole Haven. It will be an outing for me, and a pleasant one; and at least I can be doing no harm." ...|$|E

50|$|The Ghoppia was a {{cantilever}} mid-wing monoplane. Its straight {{tapered wing}} {{was built in}} one piece for lightness around a single spar and had marked dihedral. The outer half of the wing's trailing edge carried ailerons mounted on a false spar; trailing edge airbrakes occupied the inner portion of the wingspan. These airbrakes {{turned out to be}} rather ineffective. The wing terminated in <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> bodies.|$|E
50|$|On {{the later}} models the gull wing is {{replaced}} by one with a constant 5° dihedral without altering the tip ground clearance, though the clearance with extended airbrakes is small. Otherwise the wing of the Mg 19b is unchanged. The wing of the World Gliding Championships contending Mg 19c is different, with straight tapered outer panels, <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> bodies and a section which {{is a blend of}} the laminar flow NACA 64-2015 airfoil and the older, proven Göttingen 549.|$|E

50|$|Given {{a desired}} {{magnetization}} profile, determining the RF pulse that produces {{it is generally}} nonlinear, due to the non-linearity of the Bloch equations. At low tip angles, the RF excitation waveform can be approximated by the inverse Fourier Transform of the desired frequency profile, using the excitation kspace analysis. The <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> angle approximation continues to hold well for tip angles {{on the order of}} 90 degree. However, for tip angles greater than 90 degree, a different approach must be used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wings of}} the Breguet 900 were straight-tapered, with squared off tips with <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> fences. They had marked dihedral. Forward of the single box spar [...] the wing was plywood covered, with fabric aft. Narrow ailerons {{occupied}} the outer halves of the wing trailing edge, with flaps of the same chord inboard. From the second prototype onwards the Breguet 900 had spoilers at about mid-chord just inboard of the ailerons. On the earliest aircraft these were of the DFS type but were later replaced by Schempp-Hirth parallel ruler action brakes.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "handsel" [...] {{originates}} {{from old}} Saxon word which means “to deliver into the hand”. It refers to <b>small</b> <b>tips</b> and gifts of money given as {{a token of}} good luck, particularly {{at the beginning of}} something; the modern house-warming gift would be a good example. An 1825 glossary marks Handsel Monday as an occasion [...] "when it is customary to make children and servants a present". On this day, <b>tips</b> of <b>small</b> gifts were expected by servants, {{as well as by the}} postman, the deliverers of newspapers, scavengers, and all persons who wait upon the house.|$|R
50|$|Giant conch shells {{were used}} as wind {{instruments}} by the Chavín, a pre-Incan civilization that developed in the northern Andean highlands of Peru. Lobatus galeatus shells were prepared for musical use {{through the creation of}} a mouthpiece. This was done by cutting a <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> of the spire out and polishing the resulting hole, thus producing a trumpet-like instrument. In 2001, twenty such instruments were excavated from the Chavín de Huantar archaeological site, which makes them nearly three thousand years old. This kind of playable shell is still used in the Andes, where they are known as pututu.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} class {{single seat}} sailplane {{with a wooden}} structure and largely plywood covered, the Delfin has a 15 m span (49 ft 2.5 in) shoulder mounted wing of straight tapered plan and with <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> fairings or salmons. There is 2° of dihedral. Forward of the spar the wing is wooden skinned; the first seven aircraft, the Delfin 1, use ply-foam sandwich but this was replaced with all-wood layers in the production Delfin 2. Behind the spar the covering is fabric. The Delfin 1 has metal ailerons, replaced with all-wood ones in the Delfin 2. No flaps are fitted but there are Schempp-Hirth airbrakes mounted at 60% chord.|$|E
50|$|Most {{widespread}} {{instruments are}} using liquid metal ion sources (LMIS), especially gallium ion sources. Ion sources based on elemental gold and iridium are also available. In a gallium LMIS, gallium metal {{is placed in}} contact with a tungsten needle, and heated gallium wets the tungsten and flows {{to the tip of}} the needle, where the opposing forces of surface tension and electric field form the gallium into a cusp shaped tip called a Taylor cone. The tip radius of this cone is extremely small (~2 nm). The huge electric field at this <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> (greater than 1 x 108 volts per centimeter) causes ionization and field emission of the gallium atoms.|$|E
5000|$|Today, go-go dancing {{has also}} found an outlet in mass media. Horrorpops, a Danish band, {{is known for}} {{featuring}} go-go dancers in their live performances and their music videos. The music video for [...] "Horrorbeach" [...] was dedicated entirely to the band's go-go dancers. Go-go dancers can be employed to enhance a band's performance, a DJ's music mix, or in some clubs they perform striptease as a main, solo act, {{in order for the}} go-go dancer to collect <b>small</b> <b>tips</b> per song from audience members; higher fees can be charged by go-go dancers who perform per song lap dances to individual customers.|$|R
60|$|But {{the incessant}} {{necessity}} of handing out <b>small</b> <b>tips</b> of graded amounts gets on one's nerves. It {{is necessary in}} Paris to go round with enough money of different denominations in one's pocket to start a bank--gold and paper notes for serious purchases, and with them a huge dead weight of great silver pieces, five franc bits {{as large as a}} Quaker's shoebuckle, and a jingling mass of coppers in a side pocket. These one must distribute as extras to cabmen, waiters, news-vendors, beggars, anybody and everybody in fact that one has anything to do with.|$|R

5000|$|Sculptors {{often use}} a high amount of {{detail in the}} figures, and {{painting}} may require the finest brushes, as fine as 00000 (5/0). Most painters will use a range of different brush sizes; 1, 00, and 0000 is a likely minimum set. Good quality brushes like kolinsky sable brushes that take a fine point are preferred, although hog or synthetic brushes are better for [...] "rough" [...] work: undercoating and dry brushing. An airbrush is also a commonly used tool. Airbrushing facilitates leveled painting surfaces and allows for effects like gradients and soft blended edges. Because of the detail work involved, airbrushes with a <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> diameter are considered more useful.|$|E
5000|$|Senecio rowleyanus {{receives}} its {{common name}} from specialized leaves {{which are the}} size and shape of small peas (about ¼ inch diameter).Its trailing stems can grow 2-3 feet (60-90 cm). There is a <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> on at the distal point of each leaf and a thin band of dark green tissue on the side known as a [...] "window" [...] (see below). It blooms during the summer and, like all asterids, it has a compound flower. The trumpet shaped flower forms clusters (about ½ inch diameter) of small white flowers with colorful stamens. The flower will last about a month and is said to smell like cinnamon and other spices.|$|E
50|$|Reference Point Indentation uses {{a unique}} probe {{assembly}} {{to establish a}} surface-localized reference point to accurately “feel” a material. One specific form of RPI uses a multi-probe assembly that includes a test probe contained within the sheath of an outer reference probe. In Reference Point Indentation large loads and <b>small</b> <b>tip</b> sizes are used, so the indentation area may be up to a few hundred square micrometres. Atomic force microscopy or scanning electron microscopy techniques may be utilized to image the indentation, but can be quite cumbersome and requires that the measurement site be exposed and potentially altered {{in order to make}} the measurement. Instead, an indenter with a geometry known to high precision is employed.|$|E
