5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1987, President Ronald Reagan considered appointing <b>Senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch to fill his seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, {{although it is not}} clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the Saxbe fix in a written opinion, concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy.) According to Jan Crawford Greenberg, the Justice Department had previously done the same to Senator Hatch the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger. According to Greenburg, Michael Carvin used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly say no to Hatch.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, {{a lawsuit}} was {{threatened}} {{due to the}} exclusion of teams from the non-automatic qualifying conferences in the BCS system. Following Utah's win over Alabama in the 2009 Sugar Bowl, Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff announced an inquiry into whether the BCS system violates federal anti-trust laws. In 2009, senior Utah <b>senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch announced that he was exploring the possibility of a lawsuit against the BCS as an anti-competitive trust under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. On November 27, 2009 the Fort Worth Star-Telegram ran a story that said that Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, announced that he would hold anti-trust hearings on the BCS, again based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and its provisions outlawing non-competitive trusts, beginning in May 2010. Meanwhile, various organizations, including the BCS, spent {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to lobby the federal government both in support and in opposition to a college football playoffs system.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the {{controversy}} surrounding the BCS became a topic of conversation within the United States government. In 2008 U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch (R-Utah) had {{said that he would}} hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after his Utah team failed to play in the national championship game. Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is joining to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In May 2011 the U.S. Justice Department {{sent a letter to the}} NCAA asking for a detailed explanation about why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required to do every year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences.|$|E

500|$|President Bill Clinton {{nominated}} {{her as an}} Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on June 14, 1993, to {{fill the}} seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White. Ginsburg was recommended to Clinton by then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno after a suggestion by Utah Republican <b>Senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch. At {{the time of her}} nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as a moderate. President Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the Court's diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas and as only the second female appointee. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as [...] "well qualified", its highest possible rating for a prospective justice.|$|E
500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism."

[...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E
500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican <b>Senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E

CDT advises government officials, agencies, corporations, and civil society on the policy action that will maintain the open and free nature of the Internet. CDT often works with legislators on controversial legislation. For example, CDT offered opinions on the rework of the Internet Integrity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2000 (S.2448), a computer-crime bill introduced in the 106th Congress by <b>Senators</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch, Patrick Leahy, and Chuck Schumer.|$|R

50|$|By {{a vote of}} 382 to 37, the House of Representatives {{approved}} a revised bill that would increase the minimum wage to $3.80 per hour as of April, 1990, and $4.25 per hour as of April 1, 1991. The bill would allow a lower minimum wage for employees who are less than twenty years old. The bill eliminated different minimum wages for retail and non-retail businesses. The next week, the Senate approved the bill {{by a vote of}} 89 to 8. <b>Senators</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch, Steve Symms, and Phil Gramm were unsuccessful at passing minimum-wage exemptions for small businesses and farmers using migrant or seasonal workers. President Bush signed the bill two weeks later.|$|R
25|$|Metabolife, {{makers of}} the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had {{received}} over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA. <b>Senators</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested {{that the number of}} problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action.

50|$|Also in 2004, <b>Senators</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) {{introduced}} the Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act of 2004, or the PIRATE Act. The bill {{proposed for the}} Department of Justice to partake in civil suits against file-sharers on behalf of copyright holders. The goal was to lessen the requirements needed for a criminal suit, {{as seen in the}} NET Act. The bill failed to pass in the United States House of Representatives and faced controversy for allowing the copyright holders to press their own charges in addition to the civil charges, which would enable the file-sharer to face persecution twice. Leahy and Hatch also proposed the INDUCE Act {{a few months after the}} PIRATE Act, which also failed to pass in the House.|$|R
2500|$|Funding for Title V, Section 510 abstinence-only {{education}} had expired in 2009, but was reinstated by {{a provision in}} the 2010 health care reform law by <b>Senator</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch.

Primary polls had shown a close race: a May 2008 poll showed Cannon leading Chaffetz 39% to 37% among likely voters, and June 2008 poll showed likely voters favoring Cannon by 44% to 40%. On June 24, 2008, Chaffetz defeated Cannon {{by a vote of}} 60% to 40%. It was considered an upset victory as Cannon was endorsed by George W. Bush, the state's two U.S. <b>Senators</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch and Bob Bennett, and nearly all of the state Republican establishment. Cannon also outspent Chaffetz by 6 to 1. Cannon's primary defeat spurred worry among Republican incumbents.|$|R
5000|$|Christian Voice was {{the first}} of the Christian Right groups, pre-dating the Christian Coalition, American Coalition for Traditional Values, Concerned Women for America, Moral Majority, Family Research Council, and other Christian {{political}} groups. Christian Voice has employed hundreds of political organizers, including Susan Hirschman, Chief of Staff to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Congressman Tom Hagadorn, who chaired the organization for several years, and Tim LaHaye, co-author of the Left Behind series. At one point, US <b>Senators</b> <b>Orrin</b> Hatch (Utah), Roger Jespen (Iowa) and James McClure (Idaho) all served on the organization's board of directors.

[...] Those two conclusions related to the actions of Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who was sent to Niger in 2002 to investigate allegations that the Iraqi government was attempting to purchase [...] "yellowcake" [...] uranium, presumably as part of an attempt to revive Iraq's nuclear weapons program. The two conclusions were that the plan to send Wilson to investigate the Niger allegation was suggested by Wilson's wife, a CIA employee, and that in his later public statements criticizing the Bush administration, Wilson included information he had learned from press accounts, misrepresenting it as firsthand knowledge.|$|R
