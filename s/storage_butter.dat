40|$|Physicochemical {{characteristics}} and freshness indicators of cow butter during refrigeration (2 [...] . 4 oC) and freezing (- 15 [...] . - 18 oC) storage were studied. Alteration (hydrolysis and oxidation) of food {{is responsible for}} the degradation of sensory quality, nutritional value and even the formation of toxic substances such as peroxides, which requires intimate knowledge of these processes and taking appropriate measures to avoid losses that can be registered. Research motivation was the determination of physicochemical indicators in fresh milk fat, and the moment when occur changes in organoleptic and physicochemical parametres of butter stored under refrigeration and freezing, making it unsuitable for human consumption. Changes in freshness parameters and the installation of alterative process when butter becomes improperly for consumption were studied inducing fatty acid content, acidity, peroxide index, iodine index and the presence of epyhidrinic aldehyde. The content of saturated fatty acids was higher (71. 84 %) than that of unsaturated fatty acids (27. 09 %), the main fatty acids present in butter were butyric, miristic, palmitic, oleic and stearic acids. There was an increase of titrabile acidity during <b>storage,</b> <b>butter</b> hydrolysis was install after 15 days under refrigeration and after one month under freezing conditions.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} employing starch-protein hydrolysate of amaranth flour to produce protective edible coatings on butter. Tests were run on 3 types of coating solutions. The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate of 40 -% dry matter content, 30 -% (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 -% (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin). The second and third contained an extra 2 -% (w/w) antioxidant (ascorbic acid) and the third an extra 2 -% (w/w) cross-linking agent (dialdehyde starch). Protective layers on butter were produced by coating with coat solutions.

40|$|Cold-storage defects {{of butter}} {{originate}} from the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Phospholipids {{are much more}} susceptible to oxidation than is butter fat; oxidation starts with phospholipids. By the Warburg-method oxygen absorption of butterfat and of phospholipids were measured under different conditions. With decreasing pH, oxygen consumption increased appreciably, and copper accelerated the rate of oxidation. It was observed that oxidation of the phospholipids started with the cephalin fraction. From {{a study of the}} composition of the membrane of the fat globule and its susceptibility to oxidation, further conclusions could be drawn on the influence of pH, addition of copper and other ions, addition of protein, influence of temperature and addition of anti-oxidants. Finally, studies on copper distribution in milk constituents under different conditions allowed a satisfactory explanation of a number of observations on the arisal of cold <b>storage</b> defects in <b>butter.</b> Some practical measures to prevent defects through cold storage were discussed...|$|R

50|$|In November 1903, {{a public}} meeting {{was held at}} the Gladstone Town Hall to gauge local {{interest}} in forming a co-operative dairy company and erecting a dairy factory at Gladstone. Supported by graziers and selectors alike, a provisional committee was elected, representing Mount Larcombe, Calliope, Clyde Creek, Boyne River, Gladstone, Bororen, and Miriam Vale. The committee canvassed the district for support, soliciting shares and guarantees of milk supplies. As a result, the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was registered in Brisbane in September 1904 as a joint stock company, with the registered office situated in Gladstone. The company's objective was to erect a factory at Gladstone for the manufacture and <b>storage</b> of <b>butter</b> and other dairy products. During 1904 articles of association were drawn up, and a founding committee comprising prominent local graziers and businessmen was elected. A site for the dairy factory was selected adjacent to the railway line, a couple of blocks southeast of the main Gladstone railway station, and the scheme was approved by the Meat and Dairy Board. Tenders {{for the construction of a}} dairy factory (a timber structure) at Gladstone were called in June 1905 by Bundaberg architect Frederic Herbert Faircloth, with the contract let in August to J Connors. A dispute between the contractor and the dairy company delayed completion for several months, but finally the factory commenced butter production in April 1906. In 1914, Queensland Railways constructed a dead end siding for the PCD, which was extended in 1923 by 70 feet.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Melted {{butter is}} made from dairy butter by {{rendering}} the fat phase. It has specific taste and aroma, high-calorie content and good assimilability. Defects of butter which appeared during the storage causes {{by the development of}} microbiological processes or by the chemical oxidation. On the development of these processes influence quality and composition of fresh butter, its physical structure, content of the increased amount of gas phase and content of heavy metals, storage conditions. Microbiological spoilage of butter occurs generally due to damage of plasma which is good environment for the development of microorganisms. Defects of microbiological origin include: unclean, sour, moldy, yeasty, cheesy, bitter taste. Defects of test and smell chemical origin are formed due to hydrolytic digestion of lipids. It's prevailed at long <b>storage</b> of <b>butter</b> in the conditions of freezing temperatures. It's picked out the following main processes of spoiling: souring, acidifying and sallowness. Often these processes take place simultaneously. It has been investigated melted butter with lactated additive. The latter improves the microbiological and toxicological safety, prolongs the storage condition of the products. Technological efficiency of the additives is achieved by a multilayer products formation from the inactive bound water, preventing microorganisms growth and by the barrier layer with lactate inhibiting hydrolytic reactions. Oil samples were obtained with the batch-type butter maker application, then they were melted and after that lactated additive were supplemented. It has been studied organoleptic and physico-chemical indices of the melted butter samples. The fatty-acid composition of melted butter were studied. Comparative analysis of fatty-acid composition of cow's milk fat and produced melted butter has shown their similarity. Also in the last sample there is increased weight fraction of linoleic and linolenic acids. The obtained experimental data for melted butter allow to conclude about its high quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{seeds of}} Theobroma cacao (cacao) {{are the source}} of cocoa, the raw {{material}} for the multi-billion dollar chocolate industry. Cacao`s two most important traits are its unique seed <b>storage</b> triglyceride (cocoa <b>butter)</b> and the flavor of its fermented beans (chocolate). The genome of T. cacao is being sequenced, and to expand the utility of the genome sequence to the improvement of cacao, we are evaluating Theobroma grandiflorum, the closest economically important species of Theobroma for its potential use in a comparative genomic study. T. grandiflorum differs from cacao in important agronomic traits such as flavor of the fermented beans, disease resistance to witches` broom and abscission of mature fruits. By comparing genomic sequences and analyzing viable inter-specific hybrids, we hope to identify the key genes that regulate cacao`s most important traits. We have investigated the utility in T. grandiflorum of three types of markers (microsatellite markers, single-strand conformational polymorphism markers and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) developed in cacao. Through sequencing of amplicons of 12 diverse individuals of both cacao and T. grandiflorum, we have identified new intra- and inter-specific SNPs. Two markers which had no overlap of alleles between the species were used to genotype putative inter-specific hybrid seedlings. Sequence conservation was significant and species-specific differences numerous enough to suggest that comparative genomics of T. grandiflorum and T. cacao will be useful in elucidating the genetic differences that lead to a variety of important agronomic trait differences.

Mouldiness in kernels Butter Yield (BY) and Free Fatty Acid (FFA) were evaluated as standard quality parameters. All kernels irrespective of the duration of par-boiling attained the desired 7 - 7. 5 % moisture content in 7 days when solar dried while the mat and floor took 11 and 14 days to dry, respectively. Parboiled kernels longitudinally cut, indicated very mouldy kernels from the floor dried kernels resulting in {{significantly higher levels of}} FFA in the butter compared to those from mat and solar dried kernels. The moulds isolated and identified from the parboiled kernels were Aspergillus tamari, Aspergillus wentii, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium avenaceum, Rhizopus stolonifer, Rhizoctonia and Penicillium species. Non parboiled kernels, irrespective of the drying method had no mouldy nuts but high FFA (19. 10 - 19. 99 %). Both parboiling duration and drying method significantly affected BY and FFA levels.

Technological operations are given and modes of enriched butter production are established. It is suggested to use a carrot powder additives produced by convective and cold spray drying for enrichment. The images of microstructure of aqueous solutions of selected powders are given in the article. It is established that only the suspension of the powder of cold spray drying contains particles of 20 - 80 microns large and particles of 1 - 5 microns. It is also indicated that they participate {{in the formation of}} structure between powder parts. The structure between the additive's particles (convective drying) is formed slightly. Butter enriched with carrot powder was investigated. It was established that introduction of additives improves the organoleptic properties of enriched butter and simultaneously improves the performance of the structure and consistency. It was suggested that due to the introduction of powder in butter the extra space is formed between additive and butter particles. This increases the hardness of the butter and improves its heat resistance and plasticity. This assumption is consistent and is supported by studies of additives’ microstructure. It is set that the powders obtained by different drying technologies influence differently the structures’ formation of enriched butter.
