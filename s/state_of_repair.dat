5|$|Much of {{the land}} was in the {{possession}} of large landowners and let out to tenant farmers in holdings of less than , often with buildings in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> Tenants were too poor to pay higher rents so landowners were loath to make improvements such as land drainage.|$|E
5|$|Princess Grace predeceased her husband, {{dying in}} 1982 {{as the result}} of a car accident.

5|$|The {{impacts on}} lifelines {{may also be}} inter-dependent. The {{vulnerability}} of each lifeline may depend on: the type of hazard, the spatial density of its critical linkages, the dependency on critical linkages, susceptibility to damage and speed of service restoration, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> or age, and institutional characteristics or ownership.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> and a royal survey {{carried out}} in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge {{and parts of the}} walls had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a good <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E

5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money {{restoring}} Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
50|$|Today {{a handful}} of {{buildings}} remains from the World War II-era. One aircraft hangar is still in use, a supply warehouse, the bombardier training building and the bombsight building. Taxiways, hardstands, aprons, runways and roads exist in various <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Located on Baltimore’s County Home Property, the Historical Society’s campus {{comprises}} several {{buildings of}} various ages and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> Chief <b>of</b> {{these is the}} Almshouse which houses the offices and library.

50|$|As {{is common}} in the rural {{stretches}} of eastern North Carolina, many of the houses in and around Centerville are quite old and in poor <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> and agriculture is the main use of land. Tobacco, soybeans, corn, and hay are the main crops.|$|R
5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in a constant <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, the fabric of {{the building}} remained in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> and in January 2008 it was announced once again that the building was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished in the spring of 2008. The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E

5|$|The new {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in three batches at Eastleigh, and were in service with the Southern Railway for 14years. The locomotives continued in operation with the Southern Region of British Railways until 1966. Seven examples have been preserved for use on heritage railways, and are currently in varying <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, {{approximately}} half of the original circa 3,044 cars still exist in varying <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> An active owners' club exists, and thanks to the use of standard Lincoln mechanical components, most parts required to keep them going are available. Prices range between $15,000 for a running example in poor repair to $120,000 in concours condition.|$|R
5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years Edouard Ravel {{declared}} his intention to leave {{the bulk of the}} composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|The River Slea {{rises to}} the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the banks were in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E
25|$|The Rhynie chert, by {{preserving}} {{a snapshot}} of an ecosystem in situ in high fidelity, gives {{a unique opportunity to}} observe interactions between species and kingdoms. There is evidence of parasitic behaviour by fungi on algae Palaeonitella, provoking a hypertrophic response. Herbivory is also evident, judging by boring and piercing wounds in various <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> and the mouthparts of arthropods.|$|R
50|$|Since then it {{has been}} in various <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> {{undergoing}} many expansions and remodelling (the most extensive carried out in the sixteenth century, when almost the entire monastery was rebuilt). Romanesque architecture pieces have survived until the present day (such as the church, with its Porta Speciosa), as well as parts that are even more ancient such as the notable crypt.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the vast {{majority}} of properties were owned by absentee landlords and in a dismal <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repairs.</b> Crime ran rampant, especially on Charles street, hockey stick wielding Cherry Boyz gang terrorized the neighborhood, drug dealing was all too evident and the [...] "store" [...] was a haven for both underage alcohol purchases, and other criminal activities.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} the Earls of Richmond until 1322, by when it was in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> Edward II then gave Bowes Castle to John de Scargill instead; the local tenants of the Earl of Richmond rebelled and attacked the castle. The lord of the castle was away at the time, and the attackers burnt part of a hall, drank four tuns of wine and stole armour, springalds and other goods. Conflict with Scotland led to further raids against the castle and the surrounding manor; the neighbouring fields were abandoned as a result and by 1340 the castle was in ruins and the manor worth nothing.|$|E
5|$|Without {{sufficient}} {{troops to}} attempt a landing at Batavia itself, Admiral Pellew withdrew from the harbour. Preparing his prizes for the return to Madras, he ordered all prisoners taken from the captured and burnt ships returned to shore under condition of parole. The captured William {{was found to be}} in such a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> that it was not worth keeping the corvette and Admiral Pellew ordered the ship burnt, noting in his official report that Lieutenant Owen, who as senior lieutenant would otherwise have been placed in command, should be recompensed with another command as reward for his services in the engagement. With his preparations complete, Pellew then ordered his squadron to disperse, Culloden sailing to Malacca.|$|E
5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} sewers were in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the sewers, along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E
25|$|The {{total number}} built was 251, {{production}} being shared between Swindon (53) and Crewe Works (198). The {{last of the}} class, 92220 Evening Star, was the final steam locomotive to be built by British Railways, in 1960. Withdrawals began in 1964, with the final locomotives removed from service in 1968. Several examples have survived into the preservation era in varying <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> including Evening Star.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} signs {{such as the}} one at Cahore Point in Wicklow were built too small {{initially}} and so larger signs were built over them at a later stage. A number of the signs still exist in varying <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> mostly along the west of the country and in addition some of have been renovated {{such as the one}} in Loop Head, County Clare.|$|R
