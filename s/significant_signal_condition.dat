Dysphonia (i. e., aberrant voice) may not only result in distraction during communication but also interfere with speech intelligibility leading to a communication barrier. One voice quality commonly found in dysphonia is breathiness, which {{is related to the}} presence of excessive airflow during phonation due to incomplete glottal closure. Breathiness has been associated with the prominence of the first harmonic (H 1) in the acoustic analysis of voice. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether excessiveness in the first harmonic (H 1) dominance, which has been associated with breathy voice, may result in the perception of breathiness and compromise vowel intelligibility. Methods: Participants included 10 female and 10 male normal-hearing adults, aged between 19 to 40 years. Participant’s tasks included a “breathiness rating” and a “vowel identification” task. For the “breathiness rating” task, a direct magnitude method was employed for the participant to rate a 500 -ms long vowel (/i/ and /a/) segmented from sustained vowel phonation. For the “vowel identification” task, the vowel stimuli were segmented out from running speech (“Rainbow passage”) and {{the participants were asked to}} listen to one vowel stimulus (/i/, /a/, or /o/; duration: 60 ms) at a time and indicate which vowel (i. e., /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, or /u/) they perceived the stimulus to be. The vowel stimuli included processed and unprocessed voice recordings of individuals with and without voice disorders. Voices showing the lowest, median, and highest amplitude differences between the first two harmonics (H 1 -H 2) were chosen from a voice database for female and male voices respectively. The 18 selected vowel signals (3 vowels X 3 H 1 -H 2 levels X 2 speaker genders) were processed through 12 signal manipulation conditions. The 12 signal conditions involved increasing or decreasing the H 1 amplitude of the original signals in six 2 -dB interval steps in both directions. Results: For the “breathiness rating” task, the five-way (3 vowels X 2 speaker genders X 3 H 1 -H 2 levels X 13 signal conditions X 2 listener genders) Mixed Model Analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted on the breathiness scores for normal speakers and voice patients separately showed significant findings for various main and interaction effects, such as a significant speaker gender by signal condition by vowel interaction effect on the perception of breathiness [F(12, 96) = 1. 95, p = 0. 038] for normal voice. An increase of H 1 -H 2 through signal manipulation led to an increase of perceived breathiness only when performed on the vowel /i/ produced by female normal speakers. As for the “vowel identification” task, a relationship between H 1 -H 2 increment and vowel intelligibility was found but the relationship was affected by vowel type, speaker gender, and H 1 -H 2 level. With all vowel types, speaker genders, and H 1 -H 2 levels combined, a <b>significant</b> <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> effect on the number of incorrect vowel identification was found ( 2 = 188. 585, df = 10, p < 0. 001). Generally, it appeared that an increase of H 1 -H 2 would worsen the identification of /i/ but enhance that of /o/. Conclusion: The relationship between H 1 dominance and perceived breathiness was non-linear. Factors found to disrupt the linear relationship included speaker gender, vowel type, and the extent of H 1 dominance. In addition, there was evidence that acoustic manipulation of the H 1 amplitude would affect vowel intelligibility and the relationship between vowel intelligibility and H 1 -H 2 values also vary by speaker genders and vowel types...|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were completed allowing albino rats {{to choose between}} signaled and unsignaled reward conditions.

All subjects preferred the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> over the unsignaled condition, whether exposed to response-dependent, or to response-independent delivery of rewards. Preference was controlled most effectively by presenting both the signal itself and the correlated stimulus identifying the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition.</b> The <b>signal</b> presented alone (Extinction 3) controlled preference more effectively than did the stimulus correlated with the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> (Extinction 2). The second experiment showed {{that the quality of}} the reinforcer (pellets and chocolate milk) did not affect preference for signaled reward since all subjects preferred the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> at levels comparable to those observed in Experiment 1, with food pellets.

During unsignaled conditions, no stimulus change signaled the beginning of a delay interval. During differential and nondifferential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions,</b> offset of the choice stimuli and onset of a delay stimulus signaled the beginning of a delay interval.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{continuous}} increase in the demands for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers {{in a wide range}} of applications. More and more wireless and mobile devices are equipped with built-in GNSS receivers; their users’ mobility behavior can result in challenging <b>signal</b> <b>conditions</b> that have detrimental effects on the receivers’ tracking and positioning accuracy. A major error source is the multipath signals, which are signals that are reflected off different surfaces and propagated to the receiver's antenna via different paths. Analysis of the received multipath signals indicated that their characteristics depend on the surrounding environment. This paper introduces a machine-learning pattern recognition algorithm that utilizes the aforementioned dependency to classify the multipath signals’ characteristics and identify the surrounding environment. The identified environment is utilized in a novel adaptive tracking technique that enables a GNSS receiver to change its tracking strategy to best suit the current <b>signal</b> <b>condition.</b> This will lead to a robust positioning under challenging <b>signal</b> <b>conditions.</b> The algorithm is verified using real and simulated Global Positioning System (GPS) signals with accurate multipath models...|$|R

40|$|The {{parameter}} estimation of Chirp signal model in additive noises {{when all the}} noises are independently and identically distributed (i. i. d.) has been considered. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to estimate the frequency rate of the considered model by constructing the iterative statistics with one-lag and multilag differential signals. It is observed that the estimator for the iterative algorithm is consistent and works quite well in terms of biases and mean squared errors. Moreover, the convergence rate of the estimator is improved from Op(N- 1) of the initial estimator to Op(N- 3 / 2) for one-lag differential <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> and from Op(N- 2) of the initial estimator to Op(N- 5 / 2) for multilag differential <b>signal</b> <b>condition,</b> respectively, by only three iterations.
