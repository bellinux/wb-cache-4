50|$|The AP Racing brakes are carbon ceramic discs, {{in which}} are coupled with <b>six-piston</b> <b>calipers</b> front and rear. The {{suspension}} uses a horizontally adjustable coil-over shock setup.|$|R
500|$|These {{were later}} changed to [...] wheels with widths of [...] {{in the front}} and [...] in the back. The tyres are Pirelli P-Zero with codes of 245/35ZR20 and 295/30ZR20. The brakes are carbon-ceramic with <b>six-piston</b> <b>{{calipers}}</b> {{in the front and}} four-piston calipers in the back.|$|R
50|$|The front brakes {{were also}} new. Suzuki decided {{to drop the}} <b>six-piston</b> <b>calipers.</b> The new {{radially}} mounted four-piston calipers weigh 30 grams less and grip smaller 300 mm discs that save another 300 g. Though smaller, Suzuki claimed that the new brakes provide better stopping and turn-in performance.|$|R
50|$|These {{were later}} changed to 20 in wheels with widths of 8.5 {{in in the}} front and 11 in in the back. The tyres are Pirelli P-Zero with codes of 245/35ZR20 and 295/30ZR20. The brakes are carbon-ceramic with <b>six-piston</b> <b>{{calipers}}</b> {{in the front and}} four-piston calipers in the back.|$|R

25|$|Porsche's Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, {{with very}} high {{temperature}} capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (therefore reducing the unsprung {{weight of the}} vehicle), {{a significant reduction in}} dust generation, substantially increased maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments over conventional iron discs. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. It is generally recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum <b>six-piston</b> <b>calipers</b> that are matched with the discs. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.|$|R
5000|$|The MC12 has 480-millimetre (19 in) wheels with a {{width of}} 230 millimetres (9 in) {{at the front}} and 330 millimetres (13 in) at the rear.

An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function is standard, as is four-mode electronic stability control.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Giovanni Lavaggi built a LMP1 sports prototype, {{and named}} it the Lavaggi LS1; {{the car was}} the first Le Mans Prototype to have been built and {{designed}} in Monte Carlo. The car featured a 6-litre Ford-based V8 engine (built in North Carolina by Pro-Motor Engines) mated to a 6-speed Hewland gearbox (designed by Lavaggi), and was painted in the red-and-white racing livery of Monaco. It used a carbon fibre composite monocoque chassis, and used Brembo carbon disc brakes with <b>six-piston</b> <b>calipers,</b> whilst the suspension consisted of double wishbones, push-rod actuated springs connected to Sachs dampers, and an anti-roll bar {{either end of the}} car. After a series of delays, the car made its first public appearance at the 1000 km of NÃ¼rburgring in July 2006, which was the third round of the Le Mans Series (LMS), although it did not actually race.|$|R
50|$|A new stiffer largely forged five-sided {{pentagonal}} cross-section {{frame was}} introduced {{along with an}} asymmetrical 'banana' swing-arm.Bigger Nissin <b>six-piston</b> brake <b>calipers</b> were fitted. The bike's weight went up slightly as well, finally topping the 500-pound mark that Suzuki had been flirting with for years, but the overall look of the bike remained {{essentially the same as}} previous models.1994 (WR model) saw nothing but colour changes.|$|R
25|$|The 2013 {{models have}} various {{improvements}} and differences {{compared to the}} GT500 of 2012 including new front end sheet metal along with standard HID headlamps, along with a new LED tail light assembly. The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also has no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GTâ€™s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft.

It is the only car in the world, besides Formula One cars, to have carbon-carbon rotors.|$|R
500|$|The DB9 {{has been}} adapted {{for use in}} sports car racing by Aston Martin Racing, a {{collaboration}} between Aston Martin and Prodrive. Called the DBR9, the car debuted in 2005. It retains the DB9's 5.9 L V12 engine basic parts, but the car has been extensively modified to decrease its weight {{as well as to}} improve performance. Most of the car's aluminium body panels have been replaced with carbon fibre panels, and several external features, like a front splitter and a rear wing, have been added to increase the car's downforce. Inside, the DB9's interior has mostly been scrapped to save weight. Likewise, though the suspension's layout remains the same, it has been improved to racing specifications. The brakes are upgraded to Brembo carbon-carbon disks and <b>six-piston</b> <b>calipers.</b> The transmission in the DBR9 is a Xtrac six-speed sequential manual, containing a Salisbury friction-plate limited-slip differential, and the prop shaft is also made of carbon fibre. The engine modifications allow the car to develop [...] and [...] of torque; that power, in addition to the lost weight, allows the DBR9 can go from 0 to [...] in 6.4 seconds.|$|R
