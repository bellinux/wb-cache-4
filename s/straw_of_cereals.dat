40|$|Abstract Forage {{plants are}} the basis of {{ruminant}} nutrition. Among cereal forages, maize cropped for silage making is the most widely used. Much research in genetics, physiology, and molecular biology <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> forages is thus devoted to maize, even if silage of sorghum or immature small-grain <b>cereals</b> and <b>straws</b> <b>of</b> small-grain <b>cereals</b> are also given to cattle. Cell wall digestibility is the limiting factor of forage feeding value and is, therefore, the first target for improving their feeding value. Large genetic variation for cell wall digestibility was proven from both in vivo and in vitro experiments in numerous species. Among the regular maize hybrids [excluding brown-midrib (bm) ones], the cell wall digestibility nearly doubled from 32. 9 % to 60. 1 %. Genetic variation has also been proven in cell wall digestibility of sorghum and wheat, barley or rice forage, or straw, with lower average values than in maize. Despite lignin content is well known as an important factor making cell wall indigestible, breeding for a higher digestibility of plant needs the use of specific traits estimating the plant cell wall digestibility.

40|$|Purpose. The study {{analyzed}} the possibility and {{conditions for the}} effective operation of heating systems during the transition of the heat-generating capacity to biofuels energy. The <b>straw</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crops, which are prevailing in Dnipro region, is used for this. The main purpose is scientific calculation of opportunities and cost of specific measures for such a transition. As an example it was taken the boiler-room of campus at Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport named after Academician V. Lazaryan (DNURT) that consumes natural gas. Methodology. The work analyses the legislative base of Ukraine, which promotes the using of renewable energy sources as fuel, {{as well as the}} incentive mechanisms for the development of this trend. The paper identifies opportunities of Prydniprovsk region to ensure straw supply for the boiler-room. Cost parameters of cargo transportation on the territory of Ukraine in 2016, which depend on the distance {{and the size of the}} trucks, are analysed. These indicators, as well as indicators related to its purchase, are considered together with energy potential <b>of</b> using the <b>straw</b> as fuel. Findings. With existing in Ukraine (as of 2016) the grain yielding capacity in the agriculture and cost indicators in the field of transportations, the transition of capacity share to biofuel is sufficiently profitable. The thermal power unit cost can be reduced fourfold. Originality. For the first time it is proposed to use the new integrated approaches to assess the cost of thermal power unit boiler with its transition to the use of renewable energy sources. The authors also proposed a new logistics delivery of these sources to the place of their application. From a technical and cost points of view it was determined the optimal order of capacity transfer for new renewable sources of energy in a given region depending on the structure of areas under crops and their productivity. Originality. The introduction of the proposed solutions and approaches to capacity boiler renewable energy sources can be realized with a relatively small investment and can provide significant economic benefits...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMeeting EU {{targets for}} {{renewable}} transport fuels by 2020 will necessitate a large increase in bioenergy feedstocks. Although deployment of first generation biofuels {{has been the}} major response to meeting these targets {{they are subject to}} wide debate on their sustainability leading to the development of second generation technologies which use lignocellulosic feedstocks. Second generation biofuel can be subdivided into those from dedicated bioenergy crops (DESGB), e. g. miscanthus, or those from co-products (CPSGB) such as <b>cereal</b> <b>straw.</b> Potential supply <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> as a feedstock for CPSGB's is uncertain in England due to the difficulty in obtaining data and the uncertainty in current estimates. An on-farm survey <b>of</b> 249 farms (<b>Cereal,</b> General Cropping and Mixed) in England was performed and linked with Farm Business Survey data to estimate current straw use and potential straw availability. No significant correlations between harvested grain and straw yields were found for wheat and oilseed rape and only a weak correlation was observed for barley. In England there is a potential <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> supply <b>of</b> 5. 27  Mt from arable farm types; 3. 82  Mt are currently used and 1. 45  Mt currently chopped and incorporated. If currently chopped and incorporated cereal straw from arable farm types was converted into bioethanol, this could represent 1. 5 % of the UK petrol consumption by energy equivalence. The variations in regional straw yields (t ha− 1) have a great effect on the England supply <b>of</b> <b>straw</b> and the potential amount of bioethanol that can be produced...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of various forms of fertilisers (mineral, organic, and their combinations) with graded rates of N (N 0, N 1, N 2, N 3) on yields of crops (peas, winter wheat, root and tuber crops, spring barley) and the N content in the staple product (HP) and by-product (VP); subsequently to assess the nitrogen balance (uptake and output) in the individual crops in 2009 [...] 2012. Experiments involving 9 combinations of fertilisation were established in 1996 at 13 ÚKZÚZ (Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture) stations lying in different soil and climate conditions (potato growing region - BVO, sugar-beet growing region - RVO). Yields differed according to region and crop. As a general rule the yields increased with the rates of nitrogen (various rates for the respective crop). Fertiliser application increased potato yields (BVO) much more than yields of sugar-beet (ŘVO). The application of the fertiliser to potatoes increased the yields of subsequently grown spring barley, while after the application of organic fertiliser to sugar-beet the differences in barley yields were minimal. The contents of N in the staple product and by-product usually increased with the N rate; the N contents in grain and <b>straw</b> <b>of</b> both <b>cereals</b> were higher in the ŘVO than in BVO. The total and/or average annual N balance (uptake, output) in both regions was negative in 8 out of the 9 treatments ( [...] 2 to [...] 62 kg N/ha and [...] 6 to [...] 86 kg N/ha in BVO and ŘVO, respectively). There is no doubt that the application of the fertiliser considerably improved the N balance, but a positive balance was achieved only in combination with the highest N rate in the mineral fertiliser. As the results show, it is necessary to select the adequate rate of N considering the uptake by the yields...|$|R
40|$|Soil maximum {{available}} water content (MaxAWC) {{is a key}} parameter in land surface models (LSMs). However, being difficult to measure, this parameter is usually uncertain. This study assesses the feasibility of using a 15 -year (1999 – 2013) time series of satellite-derived low-resolution observations of leaf area index (LAI) to estimate MaxAWC for rainfed croplands over France. LAI interannual variability is simulated using the CO 2 -responsive version of the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) LSM for various values of MaxAWC. Optimal value is then selected by using (1)  a simple inverse modelling technique, comparing simulated and observed LAI and (2)  a more complex method consisting in integrating observed LAI in ISBA through a land data assimilation system (LDAS) and minimising LAI analysis increments. The evaluation of the MaxAWC estimates from both methods is done using simulated annual maximum above-ground biomass (B ag) and straw cereal grain yield (GY) values from the Agreste French agricultural statistics portal, for 45 administrative units presenting a high proportion <b>of</b> <b>straw</b> <b>cereals.</b> Significant correlations (p  value [*]<[*]  0. 01) between B ag and GY are found for up to 36 and 53...|$|R

40|$|Arabinoxylans (AXs) {{are major}} {{components}} of graminaceous plant cell walls, {{including those in}} the grain and <b>straw</b> <b>of</b> economically important <b>cereals.</b> Despite some recent advances in identifying the genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes {{for a number of}} other plant cell wall polysaccharides, the genes encoding enzymes of the final stages of AX synthesis have not been identified. We have therefore adopted a novel bioinformatics approach based on estimation of differential expression of orthologous genes between taxonomic divisions of species. Over 3 million public domain cereal and dicot expressed sequence tags were mapped onto the complete sets of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes, respectively. It was assumed that genes in cereals involved in AX biosynthesis would be expressed at high levels and that their orthologs in dicotyledonous plants would be expressed at much lower levels. Considering all rice genes encoding putative glycosyl transferases (GTs) predicted to be integral membrane proteins, genes in the GT 43, GT 47, and GT 61 families emerged as much the strongest candidates. When the search was widened to all other rice or Arabidopsis genes predicted to encode integral membrane proteins, cereal genes in Pfam family PF 02458 emerged as candidates for the feruloylation of AX. Our analysis, known activities, and recent findings elsewhere are most consistent with genes in the GT 43 families encoding β- 1, 4 -xylan synthases, genes in the GT 47 family encoding xylan α- 1, 2 - or α- 1, 3 -arabinosyl transferases, and genes in the GT 61 family encoding feruloyl-AX β- 1, 2 -xylosyl transferases...|$|R
