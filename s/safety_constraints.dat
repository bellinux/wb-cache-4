To fulfill all constraints, the manipulator requires a spring balancing system that counteracts gravity in all configurations of the manipulator. This allows the use of extremely low-power DC motors (only 4. 5 W). Thanks to the torque and speed limitations of these motors the manipulator is indeed intrinsically safe, yet still capable of moving a useful payload of 1. 2 kg over a distance of 0. 8 m in 1. 5 s.

On 16 January 2004, then-NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe canceled the mission, {{as well as}} any future missions to Hubble, citing <b>safety</b> <b>constraints</b> imposed by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. During the announcement, O'Keefe stated that it was his decision alone, and not a recommendation from any other departments. The decision was widely criticized by the media, the science community, and those in NASA. Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, a member of the Senate subcommitte that oversees NASA's budget, publicly accused O'Keefe of making a decision outside the transparency process against the wishes of the science community, and stated she would work to reverse the decision. In March 2004, Representative Mark Udall introduced a bill to the House of Representatives that requested an independent panel of experts review O'Keefe's decision to cancel the servicing mission. Also in March 2004, Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director Stephen Beckwith released the results of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field survey to the entire science community, which helped show the public how important Hubble was to science. The data showed the deepest images ever taken by a telescope and revealed approximately 10,000 galaxies, some of which most likely dated back to when the universe was just five hundred million years old. With Beckwith when he released the data to the scientific community was Mikulski, who said of the results, [...] "I think it's just amazing... this is why I will continue to stand up for Hubble." ...|$|E

30|$|It may {{be noted}} that model 1 was solved without having to take the <b>safety</b> <b>constraint,</b> but the {{remaining}} models were solved by taking the <b>safety</b> <b>constraint</b> where <b>safety</b> factors were crisp, random, fuzzy, and hybrid for the respective models. After solving these five models, {{we have seen that}} the total transportation cost of model 1 is minimum compared with the other models. This is as per expectation as the nature of the four variables in safety factors for different models are different (crisp, random, fuzzy, and hybrid). Moreover, as the impreciseness for the source, demand, and conveyance capacity constraints in both models 2 and 4 are removed using credibility measure, the total satisfied demands (i.e., total transported amount) are the same, but the objective and safety values are different because of the different types of unit transportation costs (i.e., hybrid in models 1 and 5, crisp in model 2, random in model 3, and fuzzy in model 4) and safety factor (i.e., crisp in model 2, random in model 3, fuzzy in model 4, hybrid in model 5).|$|R

40|$|Optimal path {{planning}} problems for rigid and deformable (bendable) cuboid robots are considered by providing an analytic <b>safety</b> <b>constraint</b> using generalized $L_p$ norms. For regular cuboid robots, level sets of weighted $L_p$ norms generate implicit approximations of their surfaces. For bendable cuboid robots a weighted $L_p$ norm in polar coordinates implicitly approximates the surface boundary through a specified level set. Obstacle volumes, {{in the environment}} to navigate within, are presumed to be approximately described as sub-level sets of weighted $L_p$ norms. Using these approximate surface models, the optimal safe {{path planning}} problem is reformulated as a two stage optimization problem, where the <b>safety</b> <b>constraint</b> depends on a point on the robot which is closest to the obstacle in the obstacle's distance metric. A set of equality and inequality constraints are derived to replace the closest point problem, which is then defines additional analytic constraints on the original path planning problem. Combining all the analytic constraints with logical AND operations leads to a general optimal safe path planning problem. Numerically solving the problem involve conversion to a nonlinear programing problem. Simulations for rigid and bendable cuboid robot verify the proposed method. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

It is much easier for a company to deploy an algorithm that is safe, i. e., guaranteed to perform at least {{as well as a}} baseline. In this paper, we study the issue of safety in contextual linear bandits that have application in many different fields including personalized ad recommendation in online marketing. We formulate a notion of safety for this class of algorithms. We develop a safe contextual linear bandit algorithm, called conservative linear UCB (CLUCB), that simultaneously minimizes its regret and satisfies the <b>safety</b> <b>constraint,</b> i. e., maintains its performance above a fixed percentage of the performance of a baseline strategy, uniformly over time. We prove an upper-bound on the regret of CLUCB and show that it can be decomposed into two terms: 1) an upper-bound for the regret of the standard linear UCB algorithm that grows with the time horizon and 2) a constant (does not grow with the time horizon) term that accounts for the loss of being conservative in order to satisfy the <b>safety</b> <b>constraint.</b> We empirically show that our algorithm is safe and validate our theoretical analysis...|$|R

This goal can be achieved byeither using chemical reactions that cannot be conducted in largervolumina, or by running chemical reactions at parameters (temperatures,pressures, concentrations) that are inaccessible in larger volumina dueto <b>safety</b> <b>constraints.</b> For example, the detonation of thestoichiometric mixture of two volume unit of hydrogen gas andone volume unit of oxygen gas does not propagate in microchannelswith a sufficiently small diameter.
