50|$|CS1 {{stands for}} Combined System Number One. It was {{designed}} by the now merged Technigaz and GazTransport companies and consists of the best components of both MkIII and No96 systems. The primary barrier is made of invar 0.7 mm, and secondary from Triplex. The primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation</b> consists of polyurethane foam panels.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, after {{examining}} {{an example of}} an electric induction coil made by German instrument maker Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff, which produced a small two-inch (50 mm) electric spark when energized, Ritchie perceived that it could be made more efficient and produce a longer spark by redesigning and improving its <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation.</b> His own design divided the coil into sections, each properly insulated from each other. Ritchie's first induction coil produced a spark 10 inches (25 cm) in length; a later perfected model produced a bolt two feet (60 cm) or longer in length.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Technigaz, these {{tanks are}} of the {{membrane}} type. The membrane consists of stainless steel with 'waffles' to absorb the thermal contraction when the tank is cooled down. The primary barrier, made of corrugated stainless steel of about 1.2 mm thickness is the one {{in direct contact with}} the cargo liquid (or vapour in empty tank condition). This is followed by a primary insulation which in turn is covered by a secondary barrier made of a material called [...] "triplex" [...] which is basically a metal foil sandwiched between glasswool sheets and compressed together. This is again covered by a <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation</b> which in turn is supported by the ship's hull structure from the outside.|$|E
50|$|Converter {{transformers}} for LCC HVDC schemes {{are quite}} specialised {{because of the}} high levels of harmonic currents which flow through them, and because the <b>secondary</b> winding <b>insulation</b> experiences a permanent DC voltage, which affects the design of the insulating structure (valve side requires more solid insulation) inside the tank. In LCC systems, the transformer(s) also need to provide the 30° phase shift needed for harmonic cancellation.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{wireless}} data telemetry used by oil industry uses compressional acoustic waves to transmit downhole {{information from the}} bottom hole to the surface. Unfortunately, acoustic echoes and drilling vibration noises in periodic drillstring are {{a major issue in}} transmission performance. A combined acoustic echo and noise suppression method based on wave motion characteristic in drillstring is adopted to enhance an upward-going transmitted acoustic signal. The presented scheme consists of a primary acoustic echo canceller using an array of two accelerometers for dealing with the downward-going noises and a <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>insulation</b> structure for restraining the upward-going vibration noises. Furthermore, the <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>insulation</b> structure exhibits a banded and dispersive spectral structure because of periodic groove configuration. By using a finite-differential algorithm for the one-dimensional propagation of longitudinal waves, acoustic receiving characteristics of transmitted signals are simulated with additive Gaussian noise in a periodic pipe structure of limited length to investigate the effects on transmission performance optimization. The results reveal that the proposed scheme can achieve a much lower error bit ratio over a specified acoustic isolation frequency range with a 30 – 40 [*]dB reduction in the average noise level compared to traditional single-receiver scheme...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDespite recent {{advances}} in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) technology, the long-term reliability of ICD leads remains a significant problem. Lead failures constitute a major risk for patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. There is no clear consensus on treatment strategy of ICD lead failure and decision should be individualized. We report a pacing-dependent elderly male with ICD lead pacing failure <b>secondary</b> to <b>insulation</b> break resulting in recurrent syncope. We emphasize the technique of “Add-on pacing lead implantation” could be an effective and alternative to ICD lead replacement...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{parameters}} (environmental conditions, {{material and}} equipments design) affect the ageing (and consequently the lifetime) of the Electrical Insulation System (EIS) of motors supplied by static converters. In {{order to find}} a modeling of the lifetime of such materials, accelerated tests have to be considered. The problem {{is that if we}} consider all the relevant parameters, these tests become costly and take a lot of time. Consequently the topic {{of this study is to}} use a statistical method called: the ‘Design of Experiments’ (DoE) to obtain the lifetime modeling by only a ‘reasonable’ number of experiments. Only electrical and thermal parameters will be modified in this study (vibrations and thermal cycling are not taken into account). In this work, the ageing of the <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation</b> of a motor fed by an inverter is supposed to be originated from partial discharges. In this kind of machine, if a partial discharge activity begin to grow, the first insulation link of the EIS to be affected by these discharges will be the secondary one (i. e. : the impregnation varnish). Consequently, this study is focused only on this <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation.</b> The results obtained by using the DoE method show that it is possible to classify the different ageing parameters and to find their effects on the insulation lifetime. The interactions between all the parameters will also be shown by this method. Finally, a mathematical model of the insulation lifetime taking into account all the parameters and their interactions will be presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{insulation}} {{system of the}} 0. 3 -Meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (0. 3 -m TCT) at the NASA Langley Research Center is described in text, photographs, and drawings. The system is designed to operate from room temperature down to about 77. 4 K, the temperature of liquid nitrogen at 1 atmosphere. A detailed description is given of the primary insulation system which consists of glass fiber mats, a 3 -part vapor barrier, and a dry nitrogen positive-pressure purge system. Also described are several <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation</b> systems required for the test section, actuators, and tunnel supports. An appendix briefly describes the original insulation system which is considered inferior to the one presently in place. Time required for opening and closing portions of the insulation system for modification or repair to the tunnel has been reduced, typically, from a few days for the original thermal insulating system to a few hours for the present system...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{humanity}} {{is living in}} their environment instead of with their environment. Archaeology is commonly used to study the past {{but it could also}} be used to lead humanity into a future of greener building by learning from this past. This is accomplished through the study of archaeotecture and combines important principles from economic social theory. This theory states that humans living with their environment will always try to maximize resources, minimize costs, and use the least amount of effort possible. In the fifth century B. C. Greek city planners, using this thought process, designed their cities so that houses received an equal amount of sunlight and oriented all of their buildings around the sun. They, and others, also used building materials that required no <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation</b> or large amounts of energy to produce. These building materials were green, sustainable, and very efficient unlike the materials we use today. In fact, many were so green that it made finding these ancient living spaces difficult because they became part of the environment again. Our building practices have only changed in the last minute of the eleventh hour and forty to fifty percent of the population still lives in housing made from earth based materials. If humans started building and planning using the old ways I think we could reduce the amount of energy consumed by houses by at least fifty percent using the methods suggested by the ancients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The steps {{followed}} {{in the design of}} a reference resistive-capacitive divider for on-site calibration on the medium voltage grid are described. The design constraints are defined {{on the basis of the}} expected on-site conditions, rated primary and <b>secondary</b> voltage, <b>insulation</b> requirements and accuracy performances. The final set up of the divider is defined by making use of a circuital model. Both the stray parameters of the divider components and the capacitive coupling with the shield, which are estimated through finite element modelling, are included in the model. The electric field distribution between divider and shield is also estimated, taking into account the presence of the insulating medium to identify the electric field hot spots and verify the dielectric strength of the device. The variation of the divider behaviour in a frequency range from power frequency to 100 kHz is found to be within 200 ppm and 2 mrad for the ratio and phase displacement, so making feasible the extension of its use over a quite wide frequency range both as a reference or a measuring transducer...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking <b>secondary</b> <b>insulation,</b> damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.
