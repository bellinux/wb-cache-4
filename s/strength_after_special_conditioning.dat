40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} voids on the {{residual}} tensile <b>strength</b> <b>after</b> impact of CFRP laminates were {{discussed in this}} paper. Impact tests on the CFRP laminates with two porosity levels were conducted at five impact energy levels of 3 J, 6 J, 9 J, 12 J and 15 J at the room temperature. The tensile strength and the tensile modulus of non-impacted specimens decreased 0. 67 % and 0. 086 % with the porosity increasing from 0. 33 % to 0. 71 %. Compared to non-impact specimens, the residual tensile <b>strength</b> <b>after</b> impact (TAI) and tensile modulus after impact significantly decrease with increasing impact energy. The void contents had the negative effects on the residual tensile <b>strength</b> <b>after</b> impact and tensile modulus after impact of the specimens at the same impact energy...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to being the initial bomb group to enter the Korean War, the 19th Bombardment Group had an exclusive experimental weapon, a radio-guided bomb called the VB-13 Tarzon Bomb. This huge 12,000-pound bomb required <b>special</b> <b>conditioning</b> to the underside of three B-29s, {{one of which was}} lost carrying Colonel Jennings and his crew on March 29, 1951. Apparently his B-29, #1749, lost two engines in an attempt to salvo the Tarzon Bomb at a very low altitude over the ocean, resulting in a premature detonation that took their aircraft down. After a full-scale area search, no trace of the B-29 or those on board was found, and the search was suspended on April 7, 1951. He received the Legion of Merit for his work with the Tarzon bomb program.|$|R
40|$|Partitioning and {{transmutation}} (P&T) aims {{at making}} nuclear energy more sustainable {{from the viewpoint}} of the back-end of the fuel cycle by minimising the high-level waste with respect to its mass, radiotoxicity and (possibly) repository risk. P&T mainly deals with the management – i. e. transmutation and/or <b>special</b> <b>conditioning</b> and confinement – of minor actinides and fission products, but involves the closure of the fuel cycle for plutonium as a necessary first or parallel step. The conditions for a completely closed fuel cycle, the goals for transmutation, and the implications for the reactor and fuel cycle technology are overviewed and discussed, and the currently favoured transmutation strategies are compared with respect to achievable waste radiotoxicity reduction and impact on the releases of potentially troublesome actinides from a repository for vitrified high-level waste. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the power system on the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) satellite {{for the life of}} the mission and the techniques used to ensure power system health are summarized. Early in the mission high cell imbalances in one of the batteries resulted in a loading scheme which attempted to minimize the cell imbalances without causing an undervoltage condition. A short term model of the power system allowed planners to predict depth of discharge using the latest available data. Due to expected orbital shifts the solar arrays experience extended periods of no eclipse. This has required <b>special</b> <b>conditioning</b> schemes to keep the batteries healthy when the eclipses return. Analysis of the SME data indicates long term health of the SME power system as long as the conditioning scheme is continued...|$|R

5000|$|From 2003 through 2008 patents {{were filed}} {{for a system}} using Sommerfeld's {{original}} bare (uncoated) wire, but employing a launcher similar to that developed by Goubau. It was promoted under the name [...] "E-Line" [...] through 2009. Thus the resulting wave velocity is not reduced by a dielectric coating or <b>special</b> <b>conditioning</b> of the conductor as prescribed as necessary for non-radiation by Goubau for G-Line. This line is claimed to be completely non-radiating, propagating energy {{by way of a}} previously unrecognized transverse-magnetic (TM) wave. The intended application in this case is particularly for creating high information rate channels using existing power lines for communications purposes. This has been proposed for transmission of frequencies from below 50 MHz to above 20 GHz using pre-existing single or multistrand overhead power conductors.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} thermal {{exposure}} on the room temperature tensile strength and microstructure of a developmental 50 micron CVD SiC fiber have been studied. The fibers were heat treated between 600 and 2000 C in 0. 1 MPa argon and air environments {{for up to}} 100 hr.
