5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They {{had been left behind}} by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through the <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back, and the wound was not serious.|$|E

Immediately he hears the 'ava title called and {{is aware of the}} status of the individual named, the tautua'ava, if the chief to be served is the holder of an important chief title, raises the cup above his head and advances towards the chief.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{antidote}} currently available for ricin poisoning, vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain A. This vaccination is effective for several months due to the body's production of antibodies to the foreign protein. In 1978 Bulgarian defector Vladimir Kostov survived a ricin attack {{similar to the one}} on Georgi Markov, probably due to his body's production of antibodies. When a ricin-laced pellet was removed from the <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back it was found that some of the original wax coating was still attached. For this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet, producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning.|$|E

25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on the <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber {{for the first time in}} this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Percy Jackson {{learns that}} Kronos' forces are {{preparing}} to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides {{that it is time}} for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking to defeat Kronos, like Achilles did, Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (the <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back). Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster Typhon as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. Typhon reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, but Luke dies. The gods reward Percy and his friends, and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer, but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the Oracle and recites the next Great Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple, and ominous clouds looming over Rachel's next Great Prophecy.|$|E

2500|$|Workman put an {{advertisement}} {{in a local}} newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It {{was a bit of}} a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: [...] "Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Workman {{fired at}} Schultz twice. One bullet struck him {{slightly}} below his heart, and ricocheted through his abdomen before exiting the <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back. Schultz collapsed onto the floor, and Workman joined Weiss {{in the back}} room of the restaurant. Both men then fired several times at Schultz's gang members: Otto Berman, Schultz's accountant; Abe Landau, Schultz's chief henchman; and Schultz's bodyguard, Bernard [...] "Lulu" [...] Rosencrantz. Berman collapsed immediately after being shot. Landau's carotid artery was severed by a bullet passing through his neck, while Rosencrantz was hit repeatedly at point blank range with 00 lead buckshot. Nevertheless, both men rose to their feet and returned fire, driving the assassins out of the restaurant. Weiss jumped into the getaway car and ordered the driver to abandon Workman. Landau chased Workman out of the bar and emptied his pistol at him, though he missed. Workman fled on foot, and Landau finally collapsed onto a nearby trash can.|$|E
