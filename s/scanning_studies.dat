50|$|In {{discussing}} this question further, Gray looked at synaesthesia, where he described modalities as becoming mixed, as when numbers or sounds are experienced with colour. Experimentation {{in recent years}} has demonstrated that synaesthesia is most likely the consequence of abnormal projections into the V4 colour region of the visual cortex {{from other parts of the}} brain. Brain <b>scanning</b> <b>studies</b> have shown that when words are spoken, in addition to the normal activity in the auditory cortex, the V4 colour vision area in the visual cortex became active, in a way which does not occur in normal subjects. There was no related activation in V1 or V2, the earlier stages of the visual pathway. The conclusion drawn from a whole series of experiments was that the 'word-type' of synaesthete has an abnormal projection from the auditory cortex into the visual cortex causing the V4 colour area to produce consciousness of colour. However, there is no evidence that this colour sensation has any function.|$|E

40|$|P-selectin is a {{leukocyte}} adhesion receptor expressed on activated {{vascular endothelium}} and platelets that mediates leukocyte rolling and attachment. Since P-selectin is critically involved in inflammation, we utilized phage display libraries to identify P-selectin specific peptides which might interfere with its pro-inflammatory function. Isolated phage contained a highly conserved amino acid motif. Synthetic peptides showed calcium dependent binding to P-selectin, with high selectivity over E- and L-selectin. The peptides completely antagonized adhesion of monocyte derived HL 60 cells to P-selectin, and increased their rolling velocities in flow chamber experiments.

This paper examines recent research from brain-damaged patients and neuroimaging studies that bears on the distinction between explicit and implicit forms of memory. Explicit memory refers to conscious recollection of previous experiences, whereas implicit memory refers to the non-conscious effects of past experiences on subsequent performance and behaviour. Converging evidence suggests that an implicit form of memory known as priming is associated with changes in posterior cortical regions {{that are involved in}} perceptual processing; some of the same regions may contribute to explicit memory. The hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex also play important roles in explicit memory.

40|$|AbstractHere we {{investigated}} the binding of Dengue virus envelope glycoprotein domain III (DIII) by two broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), 4 E 11 and 4 E 5 A. There are four serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV- 1 to - 4), whose DIII sequences vary {{by up to}} 49 %. We used combinatorial alanine scanning mutagenesis, a phage display approach, to map functional epitopes (those residues that contribute most significantly to the energetics of antibody–antigen interaction) on these four serotypes. Our results showed that 4 E 11, which binds strongly to DENV- 1, - 2, and - 3, and moderately to DENV- 4, recognized a common conserved core functional epitope involving DIII residues K 310, L/I 387, L 389, and W 391. There were also unique recognition features for each serotype, suggesting that 4 E 11 has flexible recognition requirements.

The second WW {{domain of}} CA 150 is a three-stranded beta-sheet that folds in vitro in microseconds and forms amyloid fibers under physiological conditions.

The distribution of critical residues identified by the alanine scanning and NMR spectroscopy, along with the electron microscopy data, revealed the protofilament repeat unit: a 26 -residue non-native beta-hairpin. The structure we report has similarities to the hairpin formed by the A(beta) ((1 - 40)) protofilament, yet also contains closely packed side-chains in a `steric zipper` arrangement found in the cross-beta spine formed from small peptides from the Sup 35 prion protein.

Traditional views in such disciplines as philosophy, religion, law, psychology and economics have differed over the role and usefulness of intuition and emotion in judging blameworthiness.

Recently, a consensus view has emerged, which recognizes important roles for emotion and intuition and which suggests that normative judgment is a distributed process in the brain. Testing this approach through lesion and <b>scanning</b> <b>studies</b> has linked a set of brain regions to such judgment, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus.

This was attributed to the high levels of porosity and the presence of micro-cracks within the coatings, resulting in attack of the substrate directly by the saline environment and possible galvanic coupling effects between the substrate and the coating.

In light of recent studies that implicate PSA's enzymatic activity in the initiation and/or progression of prostate cancer, we performed a molecular modeling study of substrate binding at the catalytic site of PSA wherein a PSA-selective substrate (HSSKLQ) was docked in an acyl-enzyme conformation to a three-dimensional homology model of PSA.
