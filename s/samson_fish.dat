40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes three Renaissance texts vis-a-vis {{critiques of}} the theories that enable some readings of those three texts. The Introduction to the dissertation offers a critique of Stephen Greenblatt's "cultural poetics" through a close reading of a passage from his Renaissance Self-Fashioning. His "cultural poetics" is instigated as much by his anxiety about the text as by his concern with cultural patterns. The opening chapter deals {{with the problem of}} the narrative voice in the first episode of The Faerie Queene. Patricia Parker resolves the problem of reading this episode by treating the narrator's reading of the landscape as a vantage point above and beyond the text. This chapter, however, explores {{the way in which the}} text resists his reading and the way in which his reading becomes a kind of self-defense mechanism, betraying his anxiety about, and his self-estrangement from, the landscape. The next chapter takes up the question of male selfhood and its relation to female sexuality in Othello. While Marguerite Waller divests the play of its multiple perspective by installing Othello as a reference point and by taking Iago's malice as the answer to Othello's treatment of Desdemona, this chapter treats Othello's selfhood as an object of inquiry and analyzes the tension between his selfhood and Desdemona's sexuality. The last chapter opens with a critique of Stanley Fish's theory about the reading experience of <b>Samson</b> Agonistes. <b>Fish</b> postulates that the play encourages certain responses from the reader only to frustrate him. But this postulation betrays the critic's self-alienation from the text. While his desire for closure leads him to trivialize the reading experience of the play, this chapter proposes a mode of close reading that explores both the way language conveys a complex attitude toward every issue Fish tries to resolve and the way language generates psychological, ethical, and ontological ambiguities which persist throughout the play...|$|R

40|$|Wild {{yellowtail}} kingfish (Seriola lalandi Valenciennes, 1833) and <b>Samson</b> <b>fish</b> (S. hippos Günther, 1876) were tagged with nylon-headed, single-barbed dart tags between December 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006 in Spencer Gulf and offshore {{from the west}} coast of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Two-hundred and forty-one S. lalandi and 73 S. hippos were tagged. Twenty-four S. lalandi were recaptured and the maximum distance between capture points was 130 km and the maximum time at liberty was 442 days. Two S. hippos were recaptured, of which one was at liberty for a maximum of 378 days. Both S. hippos were recaptured at the original capture site. Recapture results indicate that large S. lalandi remain in, or return to, northern Spencer Gulf. This region may be important for aggregations of large, reproductively mature S. lalandi. One large S. lalandi tagged at Port Augusta was recaptured near Fitzgerald Bay, indicating that wild fish may move past S. lalandi sea-cage farms in this region. This course of movement may provide opportunities for disease and parasite interactions between wild and farmed fish. An additional outcome of this research was the residual impact that it has had on sustainable fishing practices in South Australia with increased recreational fisher participation in the tag and release of S. lalandi and S. hippos.

40|$|Physoclistous {{fish are}} unable to rapidly ascend through the water column without {{significant}} risk of barotrauma via swim bladder hyperextension or rupture. Here, {{we report on the}} discovery of a highly specialised anatomical structure which permits some physoclistous fish species, the <b>samson</b> <b>fish</b> Seriola hippos and silver trevally Pseudocaranx georgianus, to vent swim bladder gas during ascent. Dissections of injected casts and X-ray imaging revealed the swim bladder ‘vent’ to consist of a membranous opening in the roof of the swim bladder which led to a flattened tube that bifurcated around the vertebral column and exited via a small, oval-shaped hole in the pharyngo-cleithral membrane underneath each operculum. Identification of these distinctive holes revealed that venting had occurred on ascent in 96 % of in S. hippos captured from depth. Decompression from simulated 30 m water depth in an experimental hyperbaric chamber revealed that venting in P. georgianus commenced when predicted swim bladder volume was approximately double that of its initial volume and ceased when the fish were again near neutrally buoyant. A homologous structure was identified in S. lalandi and S. dumerili. This structure represents an important step {{in the evolution of the}} teleost swim bladder which circumvents the normal physoclistous restriction on rapid ascents by eliminating, or minimising, barotrauma. Ecological benefits of this ability include an improved ability to capture prey, escape predators and perform ‘spawning rushes’. The increased resilience to barotrauma provided by the swim bladder ‘vent’ may also reduce the levels of post-release discard mortality for deep-water species which possess the structure...|$|E

40|$|This thesis had two {{overriding}} aims. The {{first was}} {{to describe the}} biology of <b>Samson</b> <b>Fish</b> Seriola hippos and therefore extend the {{knowledge and understanding of}} the genus Seriola. The second was to uses these data to develop strategies to better manage the fishery and, if appropriate, develop catch-and-release protocols for the S. hippos sportfishery. Trends exhibited by marginal increment analysis in the opaque zones of sectioned S. hippos otoliths, together with an otolith of a recaptured calcein injected fish, demonstrated that these opaque zones represent annual features. Thus, as with some other members of the genus, the number of opaque zones in sectioned otoliths of S. hippos are appropriate for determining age and growth parameters of this species. Seriola hippos displayed similar growth trajectories to other members of the genus. Early growth in S. hippos is rapid with this species reaching minimum legal length for retention (MML) of 600 mm TL within the second year of life. After the first 5 years of life growth rates of each sex differ, with females growing faster and reaching a larger size at age than males. Thus, by 10, 15 and 20 years of age, the predicted fork lengths (and weights) for females were 1088 (17 kg), 1221 (24 kg) and 1311 mm (30 kg), respectively, compared with 1035 (15 kg), 1124 (19 kg) and 1167 mm (21 kg), respectively for males. Despite these differences, female and male S. hippos attained similar maximum age, i. e. 29 (1470 mm FL) and 28 years (1280 mm FL), respectively. The maximum age determined for S. hippos is greater than that recorded for any other Seriola spp. The largest female and male S. hippos recorded during this study were encountered during the tagging component and had fork lengths of 1600 mm and 1380 mm, respectively. Seriola hippos has a protracted spawning period, ca four months, which starts in late spring and continues through summer into early autumn during which time many individuals engage in large spawning aggregations on the lower west coast of Australia.

40|$|Techniques of single- and {{multi-beam}} active acoustics and {{the passive}} recording of fish vocalisations {{were employed to}} evaluate the benefits and limitations of each technique as a method for assessing and monitoring fish aggregations. Five species, <b>Samson</b> <b>fish</b> (Seriola hippos), mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus), West Australian dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum), Bight redfish (Centroberyx gerrardi) and pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) were investigated {{on the basis of}} their abundance, ecological importance and differing behaviour. The primary focus was on S. hippos, a large nonvocal schooling fish, and A. japonicus, a large vocal fish, with each species forming aggregations for spawning purposes. Simrad EQ 60 single-beam echosounder assessments of mid-water, S. hippos aggregations at seven sites west of Rottnest Island illustrated the relative biomass increase, stabilisation and decrease between the months of October and March each year from October 2004 to March 2007. Surveys highlighted the preferred sites for spawning, spatial extents of each aggregation, as well as a decline in aggregation stability at full moon and end of season periods. Regular Department of Fisheries surveys displayed the relative ease with which single-beam techniques could be deployed, used and data analysed to monitor large, comparatively stable, deep (> 50 m) aggregations of large swimbladdered fish. Acquired acoustic data illustrated the limitations of single-beam surveys conducted on a mobile school of fish. RESON 8125 and 7125 multi-beam sonar (MBS) surveys of S. hippos at Rottnest Island locations, some conducted simultaneously with the Simrad EQ 60 single-beam, illustrated the improved spatial resolution of midwater targets achievable with MBS systems. The identification of individual S. hippos targets in MBS data facilitated the confirmation of S. hippos undetected by single-beam transects, due to relative sampling volumes. The MBS surveys showed evidence of possible fishing effects on S. hippos aggregations with school structure varying after a two hour period of fishing and video tows. Relative decline in aggregation stability towards the end of the season and possible avoidance behaviour from approaching vessels was observed as successive MBS transects, over a short space of time, recorded school movement around the wreck above which S. hippos aggregations sit. P. auratus spawning in the Cockburn Sound, Fremantle illustrated the limitations of single-beam acoustics to monitor aggregations of mobile fish in shallow water, due to vessel avoidance behaviour. Similar sampling issues were observed in MBS surveys despite the inherent geometric advantages of the wide acoustic swath and increased sample volume. It was anticipated that adjusting the MBS mounting position, such that nadir beams were orientated laterally athwartships (rather then vertically downwards), increased the lateral distance at which the fish could be observed, thus reducing vessel avoidance implications. However, due to time constraints and equipment availability, remounting the MBS was not possible at the time of survey and the effects of MBS orientation could not be verified. Single-beam and passive acoustic surveys of G. hebraicum illustrated the complexity of acoustic investigation of comparatively sedentary, demersal fish which often spawn in small groups. Discrimination of individuals using single-beam techniques was often restricted by the fish proximity to the seafloor and the footprint of the single-beam. Single-beam species identification of small groups of fish is impractical without simultaneous visual confirmation, due to the stochastic nature of fish reflectance. However, single-beam acoustics could provide information on G. hebraicum spawning related essential fish habitat using seafloor classification. While biological assessment of G. hebraicum otoliths, swimbladder and related muscular structure imply a soniferous species, as yet no vocal behaviour of any of the Glaucosomatidae has been reported, despite attempts here to detect vocalisations. Thus the characteristics of this species presented the greatest limitations for study using active or passive acoustic techniques. Passive acoustic techniques were shown to be ideally suited for monitoring the low density, benthic aggregations of A. japonicus in the Swan River. Spawning related vocalisations of A. japonicus were recorded in situ and in aquaria (Mosman Bay, Swan River and TAFE, Fremantle aquaculture centre respectively) each spawning season between October and May for four spawning seasons. A. japonicus calls, produced by the contraction of bi-lateral paired sonic muscles around the posterior two thirds of a heavily damped swimbladder, were classified into three categories relating to differing spawning functions. Category 1 calls (‘Bup’) of 2 - 4 swimbladder pulses were believed to function to gather males together in temporary broadcasting territories and to announce readiness to spawn. Category 2 calls comprised 11 - 32 pulses in a single audible tone (‘Baarp’), which could also be broken into two or more parts (‘Ba-Baarp’) with a believed function as a call of attraction, predominantly from males to females. The third Category comprised calls produced in quick succession at increasing call rate to a point of cessation. Series of Category 3 calls (‘Thup’) were recorded only at times associated with spawning, in fewer numbers than other call categories and consisted of between 1 and 4 pulses. Pulse repetition and spectral peak frequencies of Category 3 calls were notably higher than those of Category 1 and 2, both in situ and in aquaria, despite the similar number of pulses. For example, in situ pulse repetition frequencies of up to 114 Hz for Category 3 calls compared with approximately 59 Hz for other categories. It is suggested that the increased pulse repetition frequencies of Category 3 calls require greater, unsustainable levels of energy (corroborated by the decreasing pulse rate as these calls progress) and such calls are therefore reserved for specific, uncommon events, possibly episodes of courtship. Ground truth in aquaria calls exhibited similar call structure to those recorded in situ, however, pulse repetition rates and occurrence were significantly lower (respective pulse repetition frequencies of 41. 74 and 58. 68 Hz for captive and in situ Category 2 calls). Season-long monitoring of sound production in Mosman Bay determined spawning commencement was correlated with a daytime water temperature threshold at, or above 18. 5 °C, occurring between October and November. Generalized Additive Models showed sound pressure levels (SPLs) and, by proxy spawning throughout the season, were correlated with temperature, salinity, sunset and tidal effects with decreasing order of effect. Increases in short-term sound production were observed on a semi-lunar basis, occurring at the new and full moons. Local chorus level maxima were found to occur on a 3. 97 day basis (s. d. = 1. 8), similar to that found from egg collection in aquaria and previous in situ SPLs in local studies of A. japonicus. Comparisons between Mosman Bay tidal related afternoon/evening activity and nocturnal behaviour of alternative populations in captivity suggest that A. japonicus exhibits adaptive vocal behaviour, and by proxy spawning activities, dependent on environmental variables. Individual A. japonicus were localised during spawning within and close to an array of hydrophones by using vocalisation arrival-time differences, surface reflection and comparative energy level techniques to analyse vocalisations. Several individual A. japonicus were followed for periods ranging from seconds to several minutes as they called repetitively. Monitoring individual movement and separation distances between calling fish confirmed low mobility over long periods, indicative of lekking behaviour. The determination of call source levels employed calls of known range using data from the localisation study. Mean squared pressure source levels and 95 % confidence limits of the three call categories were measured as: 163 (147. 7, 178. 6), 172 (168. 4, 176. 0) and 157 (154. 0, 160. 3) dB re 1 μPa for Categories 1, 2 and 3, respectively. During periods of low density calling in the 2006 - 7 spawning season, techniques of call counting produced absolute abundance estimates for A. japonicus present within the hydrophone detection range of approximately 500 m, observing a maximum of 15 calling individuals. Assuming a 1. 3 : 1 sex ratio this implies a detectable spawning population of 26 fish within approximately 100, 000 m[superscript] 2 (range restricted across stream by depth) equivalent to approximately 3, 850 m[superscript] 2 per fish (assuming a random distribution of callers and recipients). However, during high density ‘continuous chorus’ calling the maximum number of callers able to be discerned using call counting techniques was exceeded. The application of call counting techniques and call contributions to overall SPLs to estimate biomass during ‘chorus’ calling, where calls merge together, requires further investigation. Recorded chorus levels were not a simple function of animals calling within the receiver proximity, but were strongly influenced by source-receiver range. A preliminary model to estimate minimum numbers of callers within derived range boundaries has been laid out. Recording of A. japonicus vocalisations illustrated the developing capabilities of passive acoustics to monitor soniferous fish species. A suggested set of protocols has been laid out to standardise the reporting of fish calls together with supplementary data relating environmental variables to their subsequent effects on the acoustic characteristics of the call. Standardisation of reporting will facilitate future spatial and temporal comparison of inter- and intra-species sound production. This study has illustrated that the features of each acoustic technique endear them to particular species-specific characteristics. For example, although S. hippos did not vocalise they formed midwater aggregations of large fish (107 cm mean fork length) and were thus amenable to active acoustic monitoring. In contrast, A. japonicus form low density, benthic aggregations and hence are not suited to study by active acoustics, but vocalised profusely rendering them suitable for passive acoustic monitoring. In many cases a combination of techniques both acoustic and non-acoustic is required to monitor the particular species, in order to ground truth the data...|$|E
