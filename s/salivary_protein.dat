Sand fly salivary gland transcriptomic approach has contributed significantly to the identification and characterization of many of these <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> from important Leishmania vectors; however, sand fly vectors in some regions of the world are still neglected, as Bichromomyia olmeca (formerly known as Lutzomyia olmeca olmeca), a proven vector of Leishmania mexicana in Mexico and Central America.

40|$|Abstract Background Males of {{the cattle}} tick Rhipicephalus microplus produce <b>salivary</b> immunoglobulin-binding <b>proteins</b> and allotypic {{variations}} in IgG are associated with tick loads in bovines. These findings indicate that antibody responses may be essential to control tick infestations. Infestation loads with cattle ticks are heritable: some breeds carry high loads of reproductively successful ticks, in others, few ticks feed and they reproduce inefficiently. Different patterns of humoral immunity against tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> may explain these phenotypes. Methods We describe the profiles of humoral responses against tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> elicited during repeated artificial infestations of bovines of a tick-resistant (Nelore) and a tick-susceptible (Holstein) breed. We measured serum levels of total IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgE immunoglobulins and of IgG 1 and IgG 2 antibodies specific for tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins.</b> With liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry we identified tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> that were differentially recognized by serum antibodies from tick-resistant and tick-susceptible bovines in immunoblots of tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Results Baseline levels of total IgG 1 and IgG 2 were significantly higher in tick-susceptible Holsteins compared with resistant Nelores. Significant increases in levels of total IgG 1, but not of IgG 2 accompanied successive infestations in both breeds. Resistant Nelores presented with {{significantly higher levels of}} salivary-specific antibodies before and at the first challenge with tick larvae; however, by the third challenge, tick-susceptible Holsteins presented with significantly higher levels of IgG 1 and IgG 2 tick salivary protein-specific antibodies. Importantly, sera from tick-resistant Nelores reacted with 39 tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> in immunoblots of <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> separated in two dimensions by electrophoresis versus only 21 spots reacting with sera from tick-susceptible Holsteins. Conclusions Levels of tick saliva-specific antibodies were not directly correlated with infestation phenotypes. However, in spite of receiving apparently lower amounts of tick saliva, tick-resistant bovines recognized more tick <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins.</b> These reactive <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> are putatively involved in several functions of parasitism and blood-feeding.

Phentolamine and haloperidol reduced the amphetamine-inhibitory effect on the reflex-evoked fluid response, whereas propranolol had no effect on the fluid response. The xerogenic effect of amphetamine is mainly exerted by central mechanisms involving α-adrenoceptors, while, indirectly, amphetamine causes secretion of protein by inducing the release of noradrenaline from glandular nerve terminals...|$|E
40|$|Red wine {{astringency}} {{has been}} associated with interactions of tannins with salivary proteins. Tannins are active protein precipitants. Not much evidence exists demonstrating contribution of other wine components to astringency. We aimed to investigate an eventual role of ethanol both in astringency and salivary protein-enological tannin interactions. A trained sensory panel scored perceived astringency. Salivary protein-tannin interactions were assessed by observing both tannin-dependent changes in <b>salivary</b> <b>protein</b> diffusion on cellulose membranes and tannin-induced <b>salivary</b> <b>protein</b> precipitation. Proanthocyanidins and gallotannins in aqueous and hydroalcoholic solutions were assayed. A biphasic mode of diffusion on cellulose membranes displayed by salivary proteins was unaffected after dilution with water or enological concentrations of ethanol. At those concentrations ethanol was not astringent. In aqueous solution, tannins provoked both restriction of <b>salivary</b> <b>protein</b> diffusion, protein precipitation, and astringency. Those effects were exacerbated by 13 % ethanol. In summary, enological concentrations of ethanol exacerbate astringency and salivary protein-tannin interactions.

40|$|Clinical aspects and {{biochemical}} {{properties in}} the saliva of 21 patients prior to and following radiotherapy for head and neck cancer were evaluated (experimental group) and {{compared with the same}} properties in a control group of 21 subjects free of cancer. Salivary flow was evaluated by measuring the time necessary, in seconds, for the output of 2 ml of stimulated saliva; and the buffering capacity changes were determined using a simple colorimetric method. Total <b>salivary</b> <b>protein</b> concentration was determined by the Bradford 4 method. Amylase activity was measured by reducing sugars released from a soluble starch substrate, quantified by the dinitrosalicylic method. The electrophoretic profile was evaluated in polyacrylamid gel (12 % SDS-PAGE) using samples of 5 mg of <b>salivary</b> <b>protein.</b> A statistically significant reduction (p < 0. 01) of the salivary flow was observed, (162. 47 s ± 28. 30 before and 568. 71 s ± 79. 75 after irradiation), as well as a reduction in the salivary buffering capacity (pH 5. 45 ± 0. 14 before and pH 4. 40 ± 0. 15 after irradiation). No statistically significant alteration was observed in total <b>salivary</b> <b>protein</b> concentration. A statistically significant reduction (p < 0. 01) of salivary a-amylase activity (856. 6 ng/mg ± 88. 0 before and 567. 0 ng/mg ± 120. 6 after irradiation) was observed. Electrophoretic profile differences in <b>salivary</b> <b>protein</b> bands were also observed after radiotherapy, mainly in the range of molecular weight of 72, 000 to 55, 000 Daltons. Clinically, patients presenting xerostomia induced by radiotherapy presented an increase in oral tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|Background: Leishmania parasites are {{transmitted}} {{in the presence}} of sand fly saliva. Together with the parasite, the sand fly injects biologically active salivary components that favorably change the environment at the feeding site. Exposure to bites or to <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> results in immunity specific to these components. Mice immunized with Phlebotomus papatasi salivary gland homogenate (SGH) or pre-exposed to uninfected bites were protected against Leishmania major infection delivered by needle inoculation with SGH or by infected sand fly bites. Immunization with individual <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> of two sand fly species protected mice from L. major infection. Here, we analyze the immune response to distinct <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> from P. papatasi that produced contrasting outcomes of L. major infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: DNA immunization with distinct DTH-inducing <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> from P. papatasi modulates L. major infection. PpSP 15 -immunized mice (PpSP 15 -mice) show lasting protection while PpSP 44 -immunized mice (PpSP 44 -mice) aggravate the infection, suggesting that immunization with these distinct molecules alters the course of anti-Leishmania immunity. Two weeks post-infection, 31. 5 % of CD 4 + T cells produced IFN-c in PpSP 15 -mice compared to 7. 1 % in PpSP 44 -mice. Moreover, IL- 4 -producing cells were 3 -fold higher in PpSP 44 -mice. At an earlier time point of two hours after challenge with SGH and L. major, the expression profile of PpSP 15 -mice showed over 3 -fold higher IFN-c and IL- 12 -Rb 2 and 20 -fold lower IL- 4 expression relative to PpSP 44 -mice, suggesting that <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> differentially prime anti...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Phlebotomus papatasi sand flies {{are among}} the primary vectors of Leishmania major parasites from Morocco to the Indian subcontinent and from {{southern}} Europe to central and eastern Africa. Antibody-based immunity to sand fly <b>salivary</b> gland <b>proteins</b> in human populations remains a complex contextual problem that is not yet fully understood. We profiled the immunoreactivities of plasma antibodies to sand fly salivary gland sonicates (SGSs) from 229 human blood donors residing in different regions of sand fly endemicity throughout Jordan and Egypt as well as 69 US military personnel, who were differentially exposed to P. papatasi bites and L. major infections in Iraq. Compared with plasma from control region donors, antibodies were significantly immunoreactive to five <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> (12, 26, 30, 38, and 44 kDa) among Jordanian and Egyptian donors, with immunoglobulin G 4 being the dominant anti-SGS isotype. US personnel were significantly immunoreactive to only two <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins</b> (38 and 14 kDa). Using k-means clustering, donors were segregated into four clusters distinguished by unique immunoreactivity profiles to varying combinations of the significantly immunogenic <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins.</b> SGS-induced cellular proliferation was diminished among donor...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{expression of}} a dominantly inherited human <b>salivary</b> acidic <b>protein</b> (Pa) has been described in acid-urea starch and in Tris-borate acrylamide gel systems. Estimates of the Pa+ allelic frequencies in American Caucasians, American blacks, and Orientals are. 21,. 14, and. 42, respectively. The genetic and biochemical similarities to another series of proline-rich <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins,</b> Pr, and {{to a pair of}} similarly staining <b>salivary</b> <b>proteins,</b> Db (double band), are evaluated. It is concluded that either one locus or two (or three) tightly linked loci are viable explanations for this polymorphic system(s). It is suggested that the three factors, Pa, Pr, and Db, be treated as separate loci to allow clarification of their genetic relationships...|$|R
