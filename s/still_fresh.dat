5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was <b>still</b> <b>fresh.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leigh's family {{opposed the}} fictionalisation of her murder, though {{protests against the}} film were {{abandoned}} after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. Blackrock was filmed {{over a period of}} two weeks at locations including Stockton, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were <b>still</b> <b>fresh.</b> While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell Lavender, {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's asking price for his rights was $1,000, but they received no offers. Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in Lavender, the pitcher's success against the Giants <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in Lavender, but he stressed that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so that he could be near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well for an independent team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's {{decision to go to}} war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was <b>still</b> <b>fresh.</b> The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced by the arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E
5|$|On September3, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued gale {{warnings}} and hurricane watches for areas between Lake Charles, Louisiana and {{the mouth of}} the Mississippi. Later that day, they were extended westward to Palacios, Texas and eventually, warnings for areas east of Morgan City, Louisiana were canceled. Due to the unexpected loop taken by Delia, gale warnings were extended as far south as Baffin Bay, Texas. By September6, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings associated with the storm. Around this time, the National Weather Service issued flood warnings, and warned residents about the possibility of tornadoes forming with the weakening tropical cyclone. In Cameron, Louisiana, an estimated 6,000 residents were evacuated with memories of Hurricane Audrey, a storm that killed 575 in the city, <b>still</b> <b>fresh.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{destruction}} wrought by Cyclone Laurence in 2009 <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> in their minds, residents, business owners, and farmers worked hurriedly to prepare their properties and livestock for Lua's onslaught. Horizon Power temporarily redirected power {{supply in the}} towns of Marble Bar and Nullagine from solar power stations to diesel generator stations. Evacuation shelters were opened to refugees of the storm with no safe living arrangements starting 16 March. About 110 individuals sought shelter at one such location in Nullagine. As the storm moved inland, flood warnings were posted throughout the Kimberley and the Pilbara, where officials closed public access to Karijini National Park. The impending cyclone forced {{the closure of the}} Great Northern and North West Coast highways, while flights to and from several airports were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Ecuadorian Air Force (FAE) was frantically {{getting up}} to {{operational}} status its fleet of subsonic and supersonic jet aircraft, and adapting existing airfields in southeastern Ecuador to function as forward-deployment bases. For the Ecuadorian military, especially the Army and Air Force, {{the memories of the}} conflict of 1981 and its embarrassing outcome were <b>still</b> <b>fresh,</b> the lessons learned, and every measure was taken to avoid a similar outcome if and when the threat of war became a reality.|$|E
25|$|Many {{stories were}} either elaborated, {{misrepresented}} or completely fabricated by journalists {{to enhance their}} dramatic effect. Theodore Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy at this time, {{wanted to use the}} conflict both to help heal the wounds <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> from the American Civil War, and to increase the strength of the US Navy, while simultaneously establishing America as a presence on the world stage. Roosevelt put pressure on the United States Congress to {{come to the aid of}} the Cuban people. He emphasized Cuban weakness and femininity to justify America's military intervention.|$|E
25|$|When Jimmy Carter {{entered the}} Democratic Party Presidential {{primaries}} in 1976, he at first {{was considered to}} have little chance against nationally better-known politicians. However, the Watergate scandal was <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> in the voters' minds, and so his position as an outsider distant from Washington, D.C. became an asset. He ran an effective campaign, did well in debates, and won his party's nomination and then the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote. The centerpiece of his campaign platform was government reorganization. Carter was the first candidate from the Deep South to be elected president since Antebellum.|$|E

25|$|As the Communists {{drew near}} to {{a victory in}} early 1949, there were fears that Hong Kong {{was going to be}} invaded by the Communists. The British Government was {{determined}} to keep Hong Kong as a capitalist outpost within a communist sphere of influence, though the memories of the Berlin Blockade and the perceived antagonism of communist governments was <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> in their mind. The garrison was reinforced and plans of emergency evacuation to Australia were made. However, the People's Liberation Army were ordered to stop advancing at the Shenzhen-Hong Kong border and Hong Kong remained a British colony.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2007 {{at around}} 7:00a.m., {{a chunk of}} {{concrete}} {{about the size of}} a loaf of bread fell from the Kipling Avenue bridge onto the Gardiner Expressway. It missed cars and caused no damage, bouncing harmlessly away despite the morning rush hour traffic. City crews were quickly sent to close off lanes of traffic to begin an inspection of the structure, which is a late 1960s post-tensioned design built by the province while it was still part of the QEW. This incident raised fears about safety of the highway, particularly with memories of the then-recent overpass collapse in Laval, Quebec, <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> in the minds of motorists and media.|$|E
25|$|The 1868 {{earthquake}} occurred {{well before}} the East Bay region was extensively urbanized. The following year, in 1869, the William Meek Estate {{became one of the}} first developments in the area, built on 3,000 acres (12km²) in what became known as the Cherryland district of Eden Township. Recent renovations of the Meek Mansion have revealed that with the 1868 earthquake <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> in minds of residents of the time, some unusual diagonal bracing was built into the original construction. Although its magnitude was less than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the intensity of shaking experienced in the Hayward area may have been greater than in 1906 due to the proximity of the Hayward Fault.|$|E

25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
25|$|When Smith was young, his family's wealth {{permitted}} him {{to travel}} abroad. At age 25, he attended The Great Exhibition in London, where he {{marveled at the}} examples of architecture and culture from around the world. Upon his return home, {{he was asked to}} raise funds for a new organization, the Young Men's Christian Association. With the memory of his trip <b>still</b> <b>fresh,</b> he planned a world bazaar, which was staged at the Tremont Temple. Facades of famous buildings around the world were constructed and staffed by well-known local residents who dressed in authentic costumes and sold items imported for the event. The function was spectacularly successful, and the YMCA of Boston was the first chapter of the organization in the United States. Smith was elected their first president in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Queen Juliana faced another crisis {{among her}} Protestant {{citizens}} in 1963, when her second daughter Irene secretly converted to Roman Catholicism and, without government approval, on 29 April 1964 married Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon, Duke of Parma, a claimant to the Spanish throne {{and also a}} leader in Spain's Carlist party. With memories of the Dutch struggle for independence from Roman Catholic Spain and fascist German oppression <b>still</b> <b>fresh</b> {{in the minds of}} the Dutch people, the events leading to the marriage were played out in all the newspapers and a storm of hostility erupted against the monarchy for allowing it to happen—a matter so serious that the queen's abdication became a real possibility. She survived, however, thanks to the underlying devotion she had earned over the years.|$|E
