40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the usefulness of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>celluloses</b> (CMC) in promoting self-degradation of 200 °C-heated sodium silicate-activated slag/Class C fly ash cementitious material after contact with water. CMC emitted two major volatile compounds, CO 2 and acetic acid, creating a porous structure in cement. CMC also reacted with NaOH from sodium silicate to form three water-insensitive solid reaction products, disodium glycolate salt, sodium glucosidic salt, and sodium bicarbonate. Other water-sensitive solid reaction products, such as sodium polysilicate and sodium carbonate, were derived from hydrolysates of sodium silicate. Dissolution of these products upon contact with water generated heat that promoted cement’s self-degradation. Thus, CMC of high molecular weight rendered two important features to the water-catalyzed self-degradation of heated cement: One was the high heat energy generated in exothermic reactions in cement; {{the other was the}} introduction of extensive porosity into cement...|$|R

Clear separations of samples having different average DS values were achieved for both sample series, allowing determination of the DS distributions of the samples. A slight molar mass influence on the eluent composition at elution was observed. From the DS distributions the DS standard deviations were calculated and taken as a measure for the extent of chemical heterogeneity of the single samples. While no noticeable dependence of the chemical heterogeneity on average DS was observed for Avicels, the heterogeneity decreases with increasing average DS for BWLs...|$|R

This method allows the simultaneous determination of the chemical composition (DS) and the molar mass distribution within the individual samples. Moreover information was obtained on the dependence of the elution volume in gradient chromatography on molar mass. As expected, evidence for a stronger influence of molar mass on gradient elution volume was found for the low molecular mass NaCMC as compared to the high molecular mass BWL samples. Finally the applicability of the method for the simultaneous separation of blends heterogeneous with respect to chemical composition (DS) and molar mass was demonstrated. Such blends cannot be efficiently separated by either SEC or gradient chromatography alone, nor by simply combining the results of both methods. Only the complete two-dimensional chromatogram can reveal the complexity of such blends, since it reveals the correlations between molar mass and chemical composition...|$|R

First, maltooligosaccharide primer-grafted NaCMCs were prepared by a chemical reaction using two kinds of NaCMCs with different degrees of polymerization (DPs) from Avicel and cotton sources. Then, phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic polymerization of α-d-glucose 1 -phosphate from the nonreducing ends of the primer chains on the products was conducted to produce the prescribed amylose-grafted NaCMCs. The films were obtained by drying aqueous alkaline solutions of the amylose-grafted NaCMCs. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the film fabricated from the material with the higher DP from the cotton source showed a clear, self-assembled, highly condensed tangle of nanofibers. The SEM image of the material with the lower DP from the Avicel source, on the other hand, showed an unclear nanofiber morphology. These {{results indicate that the}} DPs of the main chains in the materials strongly affected the hierarchically self-assembled nanofiber formation. The SEM images of the films after washing out the alkali, furthermore, showed that the fibers partially merged with each other at the interfacial area owing to the double helix formation between the amylose-grafted chains. The mechanical properties of the films under tensile mode also depended on the self-assembled morphologies of the amylose-grafted NaCMCs from the different sources...|$|R

The application of vaporizable NH 4 OAc allows future use of the eluent system in two-dimensional separations employing evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD). The losses of samples during filtration and during the chromatographic experiment were determined. The scaling exponent as of the relation s 21 / 2 ~Mas was approx. 0. 61, showing that NaCMCs exhibit an expanded coil conformation in solution. No systematic dependencies of a s on DS were observed. The dependences of molar mass on SEC-elution volume for samples of different DS can be well described by a comm on calibration curve, which is of advantage, as it allows the determination of molar masses of unknown samples by using the same calibration curve, irrespective of the DS of the NaCMC sample. Since no commercial NaCMC standards are available, correction factors were determined allowing converting a pullulan based calibration curve into a NaCMC calibration using the broad calibration approach.

Color mixtures of oxide compounds of blue, green, olive and brown with the unit cell spinel structure were used as pigments. The sodium salt of sulfosuccinic acid monoester, oxyethylenated nonylphenol and ethoxylated derivatives of lauryl alcohol, fatty alcohol and fatty amine were used as surfactants. The concentrators used were: poly(vinyl alco-hol), the <b>sodium</b> salt of <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> as well as a water-based polyurethane oligomer. The highest disper-sion efficiency was found for dispersed systems in which surfactant and concentrator were incorporated in the for-mula. The one containing the <b>sodium</b> salt of <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> or polyurethane oligomer with ethoxylated satu-rated fatty alcohol or fatty amine was found to be the most efficient. It was discovered that a higher dispersion effi-ciency corresponds to pigments with larger specific sur-face. The efficiency is also found to improve when the concentrator is an acrylic polymer or copolymer made up of two acrylic species. In this case, the concentrator interaction with the surfactant is more effective if the value of its boundary viscosity number is higher.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy, safety, and benefits of hysteroscopic surgery in the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) or intrauterine lesions causing uterine bleeding. Methods: This study prospectively enrolled 100 patients who underwent operative hysteroscopy in tertiary referral university center because of uterine bleeding due to endometrial polyps or uterine submucosal leiomyomas diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonogram. Indications for the operative hys teroscopies included abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), ultrasound findings indicative of intrauterine lesions, and DUB. After operative hysteroscopic management, we inserted anti-adhesive solution, <b>sodium</b> hyaluronate and <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> into the uterine cavity. Results: Operative hysteroscopy was a successful procedure in 100 of 100 cases (100 %) but it needed to be repeated in three cases with large uterine submucosal leiomyoma and after two endometrial polypectomy. Mean duration of the procedure was 23. 2 minutes (range 5 - 67) and postoperative hospital stay was 7 hours (range 3 - 48). Most common indication was DUB (39 %), submucosal leiomyoma was 21 %, and endometrial polyp was 17 %. There were five cases with postoperative uterine bleeding and none with fluid overload syndrome.

Because anti-adhesive barriers {{have been shown to}} disturb healing of bowel anastomoses, the effect of ultrapure alginate gel on the repair of colon anastomoses was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 102 male Wistar rats, a 0. 5 -cm segment was resected from the descending colon and continuity was restored by an inverted single-layer end-to-end anastomosis. Animals were randomized into a control, an alginate gel, and a <b>sodium</b> hyaluronate <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> film group, each n = 34. Half of each group was sacrificed at day 3 and 7 postoperatively. Anastomotic strength was assessed by measuring both bursting pressure and breaking strength. Hydroxyproline content was measured and histologic analysis was performed. The incidence of adhesion and abscess formation was scored at sacrifice. RESULTS: No difference in either anastomotic-bursting pressure or breaking strength was found between experimental groups and the controls at any time point. Both the incidence of adhesion formation (35 % versus 71 %, P = 0. 007) and the adhesion score (0. 38 versus 0. 79, P = 0. 009) were significantly lower in the alginate gel group than in the controls.

30|$|The {{chemicals}} used for cleaning of stained marble are commonly applied in a poultice {{and a wide}} range of poultice material has been tested and applied in stone conservation. Clay materials, such as bentonite, attapulgite and sepiolite, are widely used either alone or in combination with cellulose fibres [4, 10, 34]. Other methods use cellulose fibres alone [35, 36], MC (methyl <b>cellulose)</b> [37], CMC (<b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose)</b> [38], cotton pads [10, 38], and gels like glycerine [10], agar [39], agarose [40], or xanthan gum [3]. One of the newer materials used for poultices is the synthetic magnesium silicate clay Laponite® RD [41 – 44]. When dispersed in water, Laponite produces a colourless thixotropic gel that is easy to apply on specific areas and on vertical surfaces. The high purity of Laponite and thereby the absence of natural iron impurities means that discolouration of the marble surface from the poultices itself is avoided. In this study, Laponite® RD is mixed with cellulose fibres (Arbocel® BC 1000) with dimensions of 700  ×  20  μm (lenght and thickness) in order to increase the porosity, the absorbing properties and the water retention of the poultice. In addition to this, a small amount of <b>sodium</b> CMC (<b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> <b>sodium</b> salt) was also added. This resulted in better mechanical properties, increasing both the adherence and the cohesion of the poultice, making it easy to apply and remove in large pieces without crumbling. Another advantage of this poultice composition was its shrinkage properties: when drying it shrank practically only in the direction of thickness, leaving the area dimension intact. Hence a uniform cleaning from the centre {{to the edge of the}} poultice was obtained.|$|R

One unit of FPase or CMCase activity forms 1  μmol of reducing sugar per minute during the hydrolysis reaction, which was quantified by the 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid method with glucose {{as a standard}} (Miller 1959). One unit of pNPCase or pNPGase activity {{was defined as the}} amount of the enzyme needed to produce 1  μmol of p-nitrophenol per minute during the hydrolysis reaction. Xylanase I and xylanase II activities were measured by xylan degradation at pH 3.7 and 5.0, respectively, as described by Stricker et al. (2008). One unit of xylanase activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme needed to generate 1  μmol of xylose reducing sugar equivalents per minute under the defined assay conditions. Protein concentration was determined by means of the Modified Lowry Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China).|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to make a formulation which can be easily taken by the consumer. Therefore, it was decided to make a health drink, keeping in view the varied need of different consumers. Garden cress (Lepidium sativum) belongs to family Cruciferae and is grown in India, North America and parts of Europe. The edible whole seed is known to have health promoting properties hence, it was assumed that these seeds can serve as raw material for functional foods, sharing its peppery, tangy flavor and aroma. Since, it is rich in proteins, carbohydrates and certain essential minerals like calcium, iron and phosphorous along with crude dietary fiber (7. 6 %) it can be used as health drink with milk as its base. An attempt has been made by adding 5 % sugar (w/v) in skimmed milk with 1 % fat and different quantity of washed, boiled and powdered seeds of garden cress along with <b>sodium</b> salt of <b>Carboxymethyl</b> <b>Cellulose</b> (CMC) as suspending agent. The drink that was found most suitable, with an overall consumer acceptability of 8. 75 was that containing 3 % of the seed powder...|$|R
