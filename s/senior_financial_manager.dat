40|$|Commitment has {{a crucial}} {{role to play in}} {{underpinning}} long-term business relationships, and as such, is well established in the related academic literature. Limited research does, however, exist pertaining to the specific relationships between SMEs and their banks. This paper presents and assesses commitment relationship framework that seeks to evaluate such relationships. Various validated scale-sets from the existing studies are combined here to assess commitment, advocacy and repurchase intention. Data were collected from 199 SMEs via interviews with owners or <b>senior</b> (<b>financial)</b> <b>managers.</b> Their assessment involved exploratory factor analysis to determine underlying data structure, with internal reliability assessment of the identified factors. Commitment is established around two components; affective and calculative, whilst advocacy and repurchase intention converge into a single behavioural intentions factor. The two-dimensional presentation of commitment and behavioural intentions are also distinct. Originality lies in the validation of commitment and behavioural intention constructs within this specific business arena and geographical location, as well as showcasing research that involves engagement with smaller organisations rather than their larger counterparts in the consideration of bank performance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study {{seeks to}} examine {{practices}} in, and rationales for, internal audit outsourcing in New Zealand (NZ) companies. The {{purpose is to}} assess whether practice and preference conform to expectations where small-to-medium businesses dominate. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>managers</b> of all 165 NZ Stock Exchange listed companies are surveyed. Questions are drawn from the strategic management and auditing literature. Relationships between size, international association and industry are tested or revealed from descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses. Comparisons to overseas studies, where possible, are drawn. Findings – Of 63 usable responses (38. 2 per cent response rate), a comparatively low 57 per cent carry out some form of internal audit and a further 27 per cent claim interest in doing so. International companies {{are more likely to}} engage in internal audit, and preliminary findings point to less interest within consumer and equity/trust industries. As to outsourcers, 65 per cent (11) only began doing so recently, Big 4 accounting firms are a major source, access to quality is an important reason and most 82 per cent (14 of 17) are aware of independence issues. Conclusions analyse legislative incentive patterns found and suggest further research. Originality/value – Recent scandals and legislation in the USA, UK and Australia highlight the importance of the internal audit function to industry. This study looks at practices in and rationales for internal audit outsourcing found within the NZ corporate sector. enterprises, Globalization, Internal auditing, New Zealand, Outsourcing, Small to medium-sized...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, online {{financial}} {{products have}} become increasingly popular among Chinese consumers, thereby, arousing the interest of <b>senior</b> Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>managers,</b> the four main Chinese state-owned banks, and researchers in the field. An example of this trend is Yuebao. Alipay, a Chinese third-party payment platform, and Tianhong Asset Management jointly launched an innovative product involving payment and investment named Yuebao on June 13, 2013. By the end of June, Yuebao had 2.5 million users and the transaction scale had reached RMB 6.6 billion. In early September, its transaction scale was close to RMB five billion. Pushed by the explosive growth of Yuebao users, Tianhong Asset Management’s fund was shown {{to be the largest}} public fund in China based on the most users. Yuebao’s success stimulated more fund practitioners to participate in online finance and generated numerous online financial products similar to Yuebao. The emergence of these products has expanded the boundaries of financial services. Online finance has unveiled a new world for personal finance that has led to more fierce competition among traditional financial institutions.|$|R

A number of marketing areas are identified and assessed on their scope for improvement, {{the ease with which}} they can be changed and also on the sensitivity of the performance of the organisation to an improvement in the area. The perspective is that of <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> services marketing <b>managers.</b> The managers picked out pricing policy as one factor deserving to be given the highest priority. Improvements here are possible and, in addition, will show up in better company performance. Two other factors considered to be worth priority attention are the customer interface and marketing influence, although both are thought to be more difficult to change than pricing policy. Improvements in the new product development strategy area, whilst likely to produce significant improvements in company performance, were the hardest of all to achieve. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: If you ask {{most people}} how they measure the {{performance}} of companies, with a meaningful smile will tell you it is very clear “When you make more money”. Somehow it is true: profitability, gross sales revenue, investment return and others are fundamental". End line {{is a type of}} results that companies should reach it to survive. Unfortunately, if senior management only focuses on the financial health of the organization, unfavorable outcome occurs. One of these ways of financial measuring are delayed indices. This means that how more or less numbers depend on different events that may have occurred months or years. This is the question that is proposed in this study whether the balanced scorecard implementation effect on financial performance transparency. In this study 24 companies are considered. Data collection was done through the distribution of questionnaires among 192 people of <b>senior,</b> middle and <b>financial</b> <b>managers</b> of food industry companies, which have been accepted in Tehran Stock Exchange. By presence and continuous following, only 120 questionnaires were collected. Operational variables in this study include: perspective, company values, transparency of financial performance in implementation of company’s performance evaluation with the balanced scorecard. Their testing was done with statistical techniques. Findings indicated that implementation of balanced scorecard in spite of the organization's prospective can have an influence on both company value and the transparency of financial performance...|$|R

The results of this study showed that researchers need to examine the differences of males and females in general when examining the differences between male and female primary family <b>financial</b> <b>managers.</b> Of the 20 variables employed in the discriminant analyses in this study, only the money attitude of power/spending differentiated between male and female primary family <b>financial</b> <b>managers</b> and not between males and females in general. However, the money attitude of power/spending did not differentiate among females or among males between the primary family <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> and the other adult in the family. None of the paths to primary family <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> in the structural equations model were significant. These results suggest there is need for further research to determine the intergender differences between male and female primary family <b>financial</b> <b>managers</b> and the intragender differences between the primary family <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> and the other adult in the family.

40|$|Capital {{budgeting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important strategic decisions that face <b>financial</b> <b>managers.</b> It is the process where the firm identifies, analyzes, and selects long-term projects. One popular technique to evaluate whether the project should be undertaken is the net present value method. A key ingredient of net present value is an accurately estimated weighted-average-cost-of-capital that is used to discount the future cash flows. The most difficult component of the weighted-average-cost-of-capital to calculate is the cost of equity. One approach to estimate the cost of equity is the Capital Asset Pricing Model approach where the <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> estimates the firm’s beta. A time-series regression is often used to estimate the beta and requires the <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> to select both a return interval and an estimation period. This study examines the return interval and estimation period the <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> should select when estimating beta. The results show that the <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> should select the daily return interval and an estimation period of three years or less...|$|R

5000|$|After {{moving back}} to New York City, {{manufacturing}} plants and offices were at 127 and 129 William Street. At the William Street factory, they made thirty-three different inks {{as well as other}} products. The steel pen ink was still being made from the original formula at least through the early 1900s. In 1856 a son, George W. Davids, was admitted as a partner, and the company became known as Thaddeus Davids and Company. The company continued to grow and prosper under Thaddeus and his sons. But in 1883, he was ruined again, this time by his son George, a <b>senior</b> partner and <b>financial</b> <b>manager</b> of the company. George, unbeknown to his father, had incurred debts far more than the assets of the company using the company as collateral. When these debts became known and due in early 1883, the company couldn’t pay them. In April of that year, the New York Times reported the apparent suicide of George W. Davids in a New York City hotel from an overdose of laudanum. [...] Thaddeus, being the honorable man he was known to be, sold everything he owned, including his New Rochelle properties, to pay off creditors. The company went into a receivership with another son and junior partner, David, at the helm. It was reorganized as a stock company, and the business continued. Thaddeus suffered a stroke soon after this from which he never fully recovered. The last decade of his life was spent suffering from gout and the effects of the stroke.|$|R
