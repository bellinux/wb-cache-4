50|$|Independently bottled whisky is {{sometimes}} bottled at cask strength, {{which means it}} is not diluted from the strength {{that comes out of}} the barrel. This often results in a more full-flavoured whisky, because lowering the strength by dilution also dilutes the flavour. Independent Bottlers may also not chill filter the whisky, a process which involves removing fatty acids, proteins and esters to give the whisky a clearer appearance. Chill filtering can affect flavour, however, because these compounds account {{for a lot of the}} taste (the esters, for example, have a fruit-like aroma). One further measure often not taken when independently bottling whisky is the addition of <b>spirit</b> <b>caramel</b> for colouring.|$|E
50|$|Brown {{spirits are}} diluted with demineralized {{water and then}} aged in oak barrels for three to eight years {{depending}} on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The brown spirits are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes Chinese herb spirits, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white <b>spirits,</b> sugar, <b>caramel,</b> and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.|$|R
50|$|A common {{characteristic}} of many IMFLs, distinct from spirits {{elsewhere in the}} world, is that irrespective of the final product the starting ingredient is a neutral spirit distilled from molasses, a byproduct of the sugar industry. This neutral spirit at 96% alcohol by volume is first reduced to 42.8% using demineralized water, whereupon flavors and other <b>spirits</b> are added. <b>Caramel</b> is added at this stage to impart colour to the spirit. Most commonly, grain or malt-based whisky, which may include imported Irish or Scotch whisky is blended with the spirit. The same applies to other IMFL spirits, like rum or vodka. However, some recent entrants distill spirits per traditional methods even when manufacturing in India.|$|R
50|$|Yumeiro Pâtissière:Fourteen-year-old Ichigo Amano is {{clumsy and}} doesn't have any talent except for eating sweets (specifically cakes). When she stumbles upon a Sweets Festival, she meets Henri-sensei who {{acknowledges}} her ability of taste and invites her {{to transfer to}} St. Marie Academy to become a pâtissière. Ichigo has trouble adjusting initially, but {{with the help of}} the 3 Sweets Princes (Makoto Kashino, Satsuki Hanabusa, and Sennosuke Andou) and the Sweets <b>Spirits</b> (Vanilla, Chocolate, <b>Caramel,</b> and Cafe), she gains the confidence and skill to work towards becoming a pâtissière. Throughout the entire anime is Amano and the Sweet Princes trying to win the Grand Prix,which allowed them to go to Paris. Throughout the competition, Amano has a lot of character change and she grows little by little. She realizes many things and her skills are improving rapidly.|$|R
