30|$|Fentanyl is a {{synthetic}} opioid used widely to supplement general anesthesia. Fentanyl is administered in general anesthesia upon prediction of its concentration with a simulator. The <b>Shafer</b> <b>model</b> is used worldwide [1]. This predictive model is applied for {{various types of}} surgical procedure. Recently, interest has focused on which other factors {{may be responsible for}} alterations in pharmacokinetics with the objective of reducing variability and increasing accuracy. Kazama and colleagues, using a pseudo-steady-state model of propofol, found that compensated hemorrhage increased the propofol concentration by 20 %; however, if uncompensated shock was induced, the propofol concentration increased by 375 % [2]. Using a non-steady-state model, Egan and colleagues found that hemorrhagic shock reduced central clearance as well as the central volumes of fentanyl [3] and remifentanil, resulting in a higher fentanyl concentration in animals suffering from shock. Other factors, such as age [4, 5], sex [6, 7], cardiac output [8, 9], and obesity [10], were also investigated.|$|E
40|$|The Dempster Shafer {{theory of}} {{evidence}} concerns the elicitation and manipulation of degrees of belief rendered by multiple sources {{of evidence to}} {{a common set of}} propositions. Information indexing and retrieval applications use a variety of quantitative means - both probabilistic and quasi-probabilistic - to represent and manipulate relevance numbers and index vectors. Recently, several proposals were made to use the Dempster <b>Shafer</b> <b>model</b> as a relevance calculus in such applications. The paper provides a critical review of these proposals, pointing at several theoretical caveats and suggesting ways to resolve them. The methodology is based on expounding a canonical indexing model whose relevance measures and combination mechanisms are shown to be isomorphic to Shafer 's belief functions and to Dempster's rule, respectively. Hence, the paper has two objectives: (i) to describe and resolve some caveats in the way the Dempster Shafer theory is applied to information indexing and retrieval, and (ii) to provide an intuitive interpretation of the Dempster Shafer theory, as it unfolds in the simple context of a canonical indexing model. ...|$|E
40|$|Background : The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is {{frequently}} employed as measure {{of depression in}} studies of obesity. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the factorial structure of the BDI in obese patients prior to bariatric surgery. Methods : Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the current published factor analyses of the BDI. Three published models were initially analysed with two additional modified models subsequently included. A sample of 285 patients presenting for Lap-Band® surgery was used. Results : The published bariatric model by Munoz et al. was not an adequate fit to the data. The general model by Shafer et al. was a good fit to the data but had substantial limitations. The weight loss item did not significantly load on any factor in either model. A modified <b>Shafer</b> <b>model</b> and a proposed model were tested, and both were found to be a good fit to the data with minimal differences between the two. A proposed model, in which two items, weight loss and appetite, were omitted, was suggested to be the better model with good reliability. Conclusions : The previously published factor analysis in bariatric candidates by Munoz et al. was a poor fit to the data, and use of this factor structure should be seriously reconsidered within the obese population. The hypothesised model was the best fit to the data. The findings of the study suggest that the existing published models are not adequate for investigating depression in obese patients seeking surgery...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even paradoxical or high conflicting {{sources of information}} has always been and still remains of primal importance {{for the development of}} reliable information fusion systems. In this short survey paper, we present the theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, known as DSmT (Dezert-Smarandache Theory) in literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and potentially highly conflicting sources of information. DSmT is a new paradigm shift for information fusion and recent publications have shown the interest and the potential ability of DSmT to solve fusion problems where Dempster’s rule used in Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides counter-intuitive results or fails to provide useful result at all. This paper is focused on the foundations of DSmT and on its main rules of combination (classic, hybrid and Proportional Conflict Redistribution rules). <b>Shafer’s</b> <b>model</b> on which is based DST appears as a particular and specific case of DSm hybrid model which can be easily handled by DSmT as well.

40|$|Information {{retrieval}} model {{focuses on}} the problem of retrieving documents relevant to a user’s information need represented as a query. One of the major difficulty of information retrieval is to find the relevance of documents with respect to the user query or information need. The choice of similarity measure is decisive for improving search effectiveness of a IR model. Different similarity measures have been proposed to find most relevant documents with the given query. Vector space model is a popular model and is widely used for information retrieval. The judgment of the relevance between a query and a document is evaluated using cosine similarity between them. However, vector space model does not give reasonable results in terms of precision and recall value. Information retrieval model using Dempster-Shafer theory also known as evidence theory is used in this paper. In this model, each query-document pair is taken as a piece of evidence for the relevance between a document and a query. The evidence is combined using Dempster’s rule of combination and the belief committed to the relevance is obtained which then ranked accordingly. To validate the feasibility of this approach, evidences for sample document collection i. e. TREC- 9 filtering track i. e. OSHUMED dataset are considered and the results are compared with traditional VSM model in terms of precision and recall measures. It is found that Dempster <b>Shafer</b> <b>Model’s</b> performance is better than VSM for information retrieval...|$|R

40|$|The {{reflectance}} of a {{wide variety}} of materials (plastics, plant leaves, glazed ceramics, human skin, fruits and vegetables, paper, leather, etc.) can be described as a linear combination of specular and diffuse components, and for many applications we can benefit from separating an image in this way. Figures 2 and 3, for example, depict photo-editing and e-cosmetic applications in which visual effects are simulated by independently processing separated diffuse and specular image layers. Similarly, specular/diffuse separation plays an important role for image-based modeling applications in which diffuse (specular-free) texture maps are sought. Separation of the two reflectance components in a single image is an ill-posed problem. In the past its solution has required the manual identification of highlight regions, the use of special acquisition systems (e. g., polarizing filters), or restrictive assumptions about the scene (e. g., untextured surfaces). Recently, we have introduced a method for specular/diffuse separation that overcomes many of these limitations [Mallick et al. 2006], and in this sketch, we build on this work, showing how it can be used for dichromatic editing — processing and recombining the two reflectance components for various visual effects. We present results on high-quality images and videos acquired in the laboratory in addition to images taken from the Internet. Results on the latter demonstrate robustness to low dynamic range, JPEG artifacts, and lack of knowledge of illuminant color. Similar to most existing techniques for specular/diffuse separation, our approach is based on exploiting color differences between specular and diffuse reflections as described by <b>Shafer’s</b> dichromatic <b>model.</b> According to this model, the color of the specular component at each surface point is the same as that of the illuminant (S), while the color of the diffuse component depends on the reflectance of the surface and can change from point to point...|$|R
30|$|Geusebroek et al. [3] {{investigated}} the differential photometric invariance. Van de Weijer et al. [4] introduced the photometric quasi-invariants which were {{a set of}} photometric invariant derivatives with better noise and stability characteristics. Combining the photometric quasi-invariants with derivative-based feature detectors led to features which could identify shadow corners and object corners [5]. Stokman and Gevers [7] proposed a method for edge classification from spectral images. Their method aimed at detecting edges and assigning one {{of the types of}} shadow, highlight, and material edge. However, most of those methods were constructed based on the standard dichromatic reflection <b>model</b> by <b>Shafer</b> [9]. This <b>model</b> assumes that an object surface is composed of inhomogeneous dielectric material, and reflected light from the surface is decomposed into two additive components of body (diffuse) reflection and interface (specular) reflection. This decomposition results in the classification of physics events, such as shadows and highlights. However, the model-based method is valid for such limited materials as plastics and paints [10 – 12]. It should be noted that there are metallic objects in real-world scenes, which cannot be described by the standard dichromatic reflection model.|$|R

A most classic example is about the penguin Tweety. This paper will successively present: {{the origin of the}} miss-management of the Tweety example; two types of default; the correct solution for both types based on the transferable belief model (our interpretation of the Dempster-Shafer <b>model</b> (<b>Shafer</b> 1976, Smets 1988)); Except when explicitly stated, all belief functions used in this paper are simple support functions, i. e. belief functions for which only one proposition (the focus) of the frame of discernment receives a positive basic belief mass with the remaining mass being given to the tautology. Each belief function will be described by its focus and the weight of the focus (e. g. m(A) =. 9). Computation of the basic belief masses are always performed by vacuously extending each belief function to the product space built from all variables involved, combining them on that space by Dempster's rule of combination, and projecting the result to the space corresponding to each individual variable.

40|$|This work {{is based}} on <b>Shafer's</b> Dichromatic Reflection <b>Model</b> as applied to color image formation. The color spaces RGB, XYZ, CIELAB, CIELUV, rgb, l 1 l 2 l 3, and the new h 1 h 2 h 3 color space are {{discussed}} from this perspective. Two color similarity measures are studied: the Euclidean distance and the vector angle. The work in this thesis is motivated from a practical point of view by several shortcomings of current methods. The first problem is the inability of all known methods to properly segment objects from the background without interference from object shadows and highlights. The second shortcoming is the non-examination of the vector angle as a distance measure {{that is capable of}} directly evaluating hue similarity without considering intensity especially in RGB. Finally, there is inadequate research on the combination of hue- and intensity-based similarity measures to improve color similarity calculations given the advantages of each color distance measure. These distance measures were used for two image understanding tasks: edge detection, and one strategy for color image segmentation, namely color clustering. Edge detection algorithms using Euclidean distance and vector angle similarity measures as well as their combinations were examined. The list of algorithms is comprised of the modified Roberts operator, the Sobel operator, the Canny operator, the vector gradient operator, and the 3 x 3 difference vector operator. Pratt's Figure of Merit is used for a quantitative comparison of edge detection results. Color clustering was examined using the k-means (based on the Euclidean distance) and Mixture of Principal Components (based on the vector angle) algorithms. A new quantitative image segmentation evaluation procedure is introduced to assess the performance of both algorithms. Quantitative and qualitative results on many color images (artificial, staged scenes and natural scene images) indicate good edge detection performance using a vector version of the Sobel operator on the h 1 h 2 h 3 color space. The results using combined hue- and intensity-based difference measures show a slight improvement qualitatively and over using each measure independently in RGB. Quantitative and qualitative results for image segmentation on the same set of images suggest that the best image segmentation results are obtained using the Mixture of Principal Components algorithm on the RGB, XYZ and rgb color spaces. Finally, poor color clustering results in the h 1 h 2 h 3 color space suggest that some assumptions in deriving a simplified version of the Dichromatic Reflectance Model might have been violated...|$|R
