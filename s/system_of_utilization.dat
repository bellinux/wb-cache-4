At the same time, the Minimum Spanning Tree Model based on Kruskal's algorithm helps to find the new method of optimal path in using waste-heat.

40|$|Abstract Background There are few {{reports on}} the effects of {{extensive}} decentralization of mental health services. We investigated the total patterns <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> in a local-bed model and a central-bed model. Methods In a time-trend case-registry design, 7635 single treatment episodes, from the specialist and municipality services in 2003 - 2006, were linked to 2975 individual patients over all administrative levels. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> were analyzed by univariate comparisons and multivariate regressions. Results Total treated prevalence was consistently higher for the central-bed system. Outpatient utilization increased markedly, in the central-bed <b>system.</b> <b>Utilization</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric beds decreased, only in the central-bed <b>system.</b> <b>Utilization</b> <b>of</b> highly supported municipality units increased in both <b>systems.</b> Total <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> all types of services, showed an additive pattern in the local-bed system and a substitutional pattern in the central-bed system. Only severe diagnoses predicted inpatient admission in the central-bed system, whereas also anxiety-disorders and outpatient consultations predicted inpatient admission in the local-bed <b>system.</b> Characteristics <b>of</b> the inpatient populations changed markedly over time, in the local-bed system. Conclusions Geographical availability is not important as a filter in patients' pathway to inpatient care, and the association between distance to hospital and <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric beds may be an historical artefact. Under a public health-insurance system, local psychiatric personnel as gatekeepers for inpatient care may be of greater importance than the availability of local psychiatric beds. Specialist psychiatric beds and highly supported municipality units for people with mental health problems do not work together in terms <b>of</b> <b>utilization.</b> Outpatient and day-hospital services may be filters in the pathway to inpatient care, however this depends on the structure of the whole service-system. Local integration of psychiatric services may bring about additive, rather than substitutional patterns <b>of</b> total <b>utilization.</b> A large proportion of decentralized psychiatric beds may hinder the development of various local psychiatric services, with negative consequences for overall treated prevalence. </p...|$|R
