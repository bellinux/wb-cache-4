40|$|A 448 -year teak {{chronology}} from northwestern Thailand is used {{to assess}} past changes in {{the strength of the}} summer monsoon. The chronology is based on 30 living trees that extend from 1604 to 2005, and a 47 -stump chronology that spans from 1558 to 1903. We used methods of cross dating and chronology building that address problems specifically found in teak. The result is a robust chronology with strong signal strength back to 1600 ad, and with variability retained at the multi-decadal scale. Variability in annual growth in teak from this area is dependent on rainfall and soil moisture availability at both {{the beginning and end of}} the monsoon season as confirmed by comparisons with temperature, rainfall and PDSI data. These correlation analyses confirm that our record is a proxy for summer monsoon strength and/or duration, and highlight the importance of soil moisture availability in the <b>seasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition.</b> The chronology reveals two prominent periods of decadal-scale drought in the early and mid 1700 s that correspond to persistently warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific as derived from Galapagos Island coral records. Speleothem data from central India also indicate protracted periods of drought for the 1700 s. While these broad-scale eighteenth-century persistent droughts may be related to protracted El Niño-like conditions in the tropical Pacific, regional climate forcing over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific sectors appears to be a strong contributor as well. Spectral analyses reveal power in the ENSO range of variability from 2. 2 to 4 years, and at the multi-decadal scale at 48. 5 years...|$|E

40|$|Interannual {{variability}} of seasonal rainfall in the Brazilian Amazon basin is examined in context of its rela-tionship to sea surface {{temperatures in the}} tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Linear correlations reveal strong relationships, but rainfall patterns are of regional scale. Areas of rainfall exhibiting strong relationships with SST are confined to the equatorial region of the Brazilian Amazon. The best relationships are found either during the <b>season</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> between wet and dry regimes, or entirely within the dry season. It is hypothesized, and results are shown in support, that during the transition seasons, an important contributor to the SST control on seasonal totals is its influence on the timing on the rainy season onset or end. That influence appears to be stronger than the SST influence on the rainy season rain rate. 1...|$|R

Following a shaky start to the <b>season</b> the arrival <b>of</b> Bryan Hughes in October transformed the club's fortunes. A run of 6 wins in 7 games over the Christmas period saw the club briefly enter the play-offs. However, following the sale of club captain Andrew Procter to Preston North End in the January 2012 transfer window, the third-longest serving management team of John Coleman and Jimmy Bell departed for Rochdale. Former Burnley and club favourite Paul Cook was brought in as manager, along with the promotion of Leam Richardson from caretaker manager to full-time assistant. Only 3 wins in the final 17 games <b>of</b> the <b>season</b> was a pretty poor finish the season. However, this meant the club achieved a solid mid-table finish in 14th position. In terms of the domestic cups Stanley exited both the League Cup and FA Cup at the 1st round stages, losing to Scunthorpe United and Notts County respectively.

His first season was seen by many as a disaster, as the Bucs stumbled to a 1-11 record, with the lone win being over West Virginia State. The season included blowout losses to The Citadel, Gardner Webb, VMI, James Madison and Coastal Carolina. However, Coach Mills used the 2003 season to break-in a freshman quarterback named Colin Drafts.

The 2011 autumn in Oltenia (southwestern Romania) was atypical, due of the deficitary precipitation regime and an abrupt thermal variation. September was dominated by high temperatures (4 days whit critical values of THI) and a poor regime of precipitations. Summum rainfall in October was achieved in October 8 and 9, when over Oltenia a cold front due of a Mediterannean Low origin passed. The last autumn month was characterized by temperatures bellow the climatological averages and also {{by the lack of}} precipitations, although in November Oltenia is characterized by the appearance of a secondary maximum rainfall due to increased of the cyclonic activity in the Mediterranean basin.
