5|$|Although the Wehrmacht's {{offensive}} {{had been}} stopped, German intelligence estimated that <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> {{had no more}} reserves left and thus {{would be unable to}} stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.|$|E

The last defenders {{in the area of}} the bunker complex, French SS volunteers of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) remained until the early morning. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00 and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker, with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.|$|E
5|$|At 07:20 Moscow time on 19 November, <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> on the {{northern}} flank of the Axis forces at Stalingrad began their offensive; forces in the south began on 20 November. Although Romanian units were able to repel the first attacks, {{by the end of}} 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions. German mobile reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet mechanized spearheads, while the Sixth Army did not react quickly enough nor decisively enough to disengage German armored forces in Stalingrad and reorient them to defeat the impending threat. By late 22 November <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> linked up at the town of Kalach, encircling some 290,000 men east of the Don River. Instead of attempting {{to break out of the}} encirclement, German leader Adolf Hitler decided to keep Axis forces in Stalingrad and resupply them by air.

5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking.

5|$|On 19 May, Paulus, {{on orders}} from Bock, began a general {{offensive}} {{from the area}} of Merefa {{in the north of}} the bulge in an attempt to encircle the remaining <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> in the Izium salient. Only then did Stalin authorize Zhukov to stop the offensive and fend off German flanking forces. However, it was already too late. Quickly, the Germans achieved considerable success against Soviet defensive positions. The 20 May saw more of the same, with the German forces closing in from the rear. More German divisions were committed to the battle that day, shattering several Soviet counterparts, allowing the Germans to press forward. The Luftwaffe also intensified operations over the Donets River to prevent <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> escaping. Ju 87s from StG 77 destroyed five of the main bridges and damaged four more while Ju 88 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) inflicted heavy losses on retreating motorised and armoured columns.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E

Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed Totenkopf to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> around Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was to strengthen its front line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopfs attack from the northwest. Das Reich was to consolidate and strengthen its front line and prepare for an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps.|$|E
5|$|Operation Iskra was a {{strategic}} {{victory for the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces.</b> From a military perspective, the operation eliminated {{the possibility of the}} capture of the city and a German–Finnish link up, as the Leningrad Front was now very well supplied, reinforced and able to co-operate more closely with the Volkhov Front. For the civilian population, the operation meant that more food was able to reach the city, as well as improved conditions and the possibility of evacuating more civilians from the city. Breaking the blockade also had a significant strategic effect, although it was overshadowed by the surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad only a few days later. Notably, the first Tiger tank captured by the Soviets was taken during this battle. It was undamaged and evacuated by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>forces</b> for evaluation.|$|E
