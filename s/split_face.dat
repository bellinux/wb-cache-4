40|$|A {{group of}} mouse aristaless-related genes has {{been implicated in}} {{functions}} {{in the development of}} the craniofacial skeleton. We have generated an Alx 3 mutant allele in which the lacZ coding sequence is inserted in-frame in the Alx 3 gene and the sequences encoding the conserved protein domains are deleted. Mice homozygous for this null allele are indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Compound mutants of Alx 3 and Alx 4, however, show severe craniofacial abnormalities that are absent in Alx 4 single mutants. Alx 3 /Alx 4 double mutant newborn mice have cleft nasal regions. Most facial bones and many other neural crest derived skull elements are malformed, truncated or even absent. The craniofacial defects in Alx 3 /Alx 4 double mutant embryos become anatomically manifest around embryonic day 10. 5, when the nasal processes appear to be abnormally positioned. This most probably leads to a failure of the medial nasal processes to fuse in the facial midline and subsequently to the <b>split</b> <b>face</b> phenotype.

Potential side effects include acneiform eruption, herpes simplex virus outbreak, erythema, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Objective: To investigate and compare {{the changes in the}} skin of Asian patients after two different fractional photothermolysis systems (FPS) on a <b>split</b> <b>face.</b> Methods: A half-split face study was performed with 10, 600 nm carbon dioxide FPS on the left and 1, 550 nm erbium-doped FPS {{on the right side of}} the face. Only one session of laser irradiation and several biophysical measurements were done. Results: Although both FPS proved to be effective in treating acne scar and wrinkle patients, a slightly higher satisfaction rating was seen with the 10, 600 nm FPS treatment. Both types of FPS showed a significant increase in transepidermal water loss which decreased gradually after treatment and returned to pre-treatment level after 1 week. A decreased reviscometer score was sustained for a longer period in wrinkle areas treated with 10, 600 nm FPS.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A precise {{temporal}} and spatial regulation of gene expression is necessary to achieve neural tube closure. Med 12, a subunit of the mediator complex, can bind transcription factors and modulate expression of their target genes. Med 12 is essential during early mouse development and is important for neural tube closure. METHODS: We have made use of a mouse line carrying a conditional null allele of the X-linked Med 12 gene to generate heterozygous female embryos that express Med 12 in a mosaic fashion thus allowing {{the study of the}} role of Med 12 during neural tube closure. RESULTS: Mosaic expression of Med 12 causes a wide variety of embryonic phenotypes. Some embryos were unable to complete turning and were found with arrested development at embryonic day (ED) 9. 5. Others were able to pass ED 12. 5 and displayed defects in neural tube closure. These defects included exencephaly, spina bifida, craniorachischisis, <b>split</b> <b>face,</b> and curly tail. Histologic and skeletal analyses of these mutant females show that the neural plate is unable to elevate and is completely flat in the regions of the body axis where neural tube closure fails. CONCLUSIONS: We report examples of all known neural tube defects implying Med 12 in the full process of neural tube closure along the complete body axis. Our work points to Med 12 being an essential coregulator of transcription factors controlling neural tube closure...|$|E
30|$|The present case {{revealed}} complete dedifferentiation of {{the tumor}} in the esophagus in the largest examined <b>split</b> <b>face</b> of the resected specimen, although the metastatic tumor cells showed differentiation that suggested the possible origin of SCC in a lymph node. The primary round cell undifferentiated carcinoma tissue was exclusively vimentin positive with partially rhabdoid features mimicking rhabdoid carcinoma. The MRT showed loss of the SMARCB 1 gene. The SMARCB 1 immunohistochemical analysis is a very sensitive tool for diagnosing MRT and some carcinomas with rhabdoid features [13, 20]. Most MRTs are characterized {{by the loss of}} SMARCB 1; however, carcinomas with rhabdoid features do not always involve the loss of SMARCB 1. Agaimy et al. [13] reviewed 39 cases of carcinomas of the digestive tract with rhabdoid features, and death occurred in these patients regardless of the expression status of SMARCB 1 or {{the presence or absence of}} an epithelial component. The mechanisms responsible for this morphological and biological aggressive shift in SMARCB 1 expression remain unknown. However, Agaimy et al. showed heterogeneous subgroups among carcinomas with rhabdoid features in the digestive tract. The tumor in the present case mimicked rhabdoid carcinoma with its rhabdoid features and showed a positive expression of SMARCB 1. The round cell carcinoma component also did not show neuroendocrine differentiation, although the squamous cell components in the lymph node showed small foci of neuroendocrine differentiation. Neuroendocrine granules are frequently positive in SCC [21], and the present case could not be regarded as neuroendocrine carcinoma. Lymphocytic infiltration was not marked as reported in lymphoepithelial carcinoma [7, 8, 16, 17], and the negativity for EBER and LMP- 1 ruled out EBV-related lymphoepithelial carcinoma. Furthermore, CD 34 expression, which has not been reported in gastrointestinal carcinomas, was positive, which might suggest true dedifferentiation since it has been reported that CD 34 is a general marker of progenitor cells [22]. Undifferentiated round cell carcinomas that do not show specific features have not been well described, with a few exceptions [23].|$|E

These factors may determine treatment effectiveness, safety, and longevity; however, this requires confirmation in the clinic. Methods: To compare the efficacy, safety, and longevity of two distinct HA-based dermal fillers in the correction of severe nasolabial folds (NLFs), a 24 mg/mL smooth gel (Juvederm ULTRA PLUS&trade; [JUP]) and a 20 mg/mL particulate gel (Perlane&reg; [PER]) were injected {{in a total of}} 80 normal, healthy subjects using a <b>split</b> <b>face</b> design and were followed for 12 months in this prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Results: Both fillers achieved a clinically relevant NLF correction (one point or more improvement, based on a validated NLF severity scale). However, JUP displayed greater longevity, with this correction maintained in a significantly larger percentage of NLFs after 6 months (physician&# 39;s evaluation) or 9 months (subject&# 39;s evaluation) and thereafter {{for the remainder of the}} study (70 % vs 45 %; P = 0. 0002 and 62. 5 % vs 46. 3 %; P = 0. 01 at month 12, based on physician and subject assessments, respectively). At month 12, 71. 4 % of the subjects nominated a preference for the NLF injected with JUP (P &lt; 0. 0001). Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: These results suggest that different physicochemical properties of HA-based fillers, associated with distinct manufacturing technologies, may influence treatment longevity in the correction of volume deficits. This may relate to a differential resistance to hyaluronidase and/or free radical degradation as previously documented in vitro.

40|$|With an ever-growing topical anti-wrinkle {{market the}} {{cosmetic}} industry {{has focused on}} developing novel formulations. Despite the availability of methodology, demonstrations of anti-wrinkle efficacy {{are few and far}} between. This has been a growing area for technological advancement but the justification for extrapolation between in vitro studies and the mechanisms in vivo is limited. The aim of this research was to determine the in vitro penetration and then the in vivo efficacy of some common anti-wrinkle ingredients. Niacinamide, genistein and palmitoyl tripeptide- 5 were investigated. The flux for niacinamide from propylene glycol across human skin in vitro was found to be 3. 773 ± 0. 5138 μg/cm 2 /hr. Genistein was found to have an average flux of 0. 03625 ± 0. 00544 μg/cm 2 /hr from propylene glycol across human skin in vitro. Using an assay for the tripeptide capable of quantifiably detecting 6. 581 μg/ml, no detectable uptake or penetration into or through human skin in vitro was recorded. Two in vivo <b>split</b> <b>face</b> clinical studies, involving 20 participants in each, were undertaken. The studies assessed whether a cream containing niacinamide and a cream containing palmitoyl tripeptide- 5 reduced the appearance, size and number of mild to moderate facial wrinkles compared to either skin left untreated or skin treated with a control (the product excluding niacinamide or palmitoyl tripeptide- 5). At the conclusion of the study, the product containing niacinamide showed a significant reduction in the size (28. 99 ± 9. 09 %) and number of facial wrinkles (8. 50 ± 2. 80 %) compared to the control product and a significant reduction in the size (34. 55 ± 11. 49 %) and visible appearance of facial wrinkles compared to untreated skin. The product containing palmitoyl tripeptide- 5 showed significant improvement in the visible appearance of facial wrinkles in vivo compared to the control treated skin and a significant reduction in the size (24. 78 ± 10. 21 %) of facial wrinkles compared to untreated skin {{at the conclusion of the}} study. The niacinamide clinical study results, with support from the niacinamide finite permeation study results of the formulation used in vivo, suggest it is possible that niacinamide is penetrating the stratum corneum, reaching its site of action, and causing its anti-wrinkle effects. Based on the poor skin permeation of palmitoyl tripeptide- 5 it is highly likely the visible improvement in wrinkle appearance was caused by superficial surface effects rather than the claimed collagen regeneration mechanism...|$|E

Lowest course of western part of superstructure also preserved. ** The subterranean space consists of an antechamber (W: 1. 75 m, L: 6. 55 m) and a main room (6. 60 m square). The antechamber is a N-S oriented barrel vaulted space; the original entrance to the tomb was via a staircase that entered the antechamber through a doorway {{at the south end of}} the west wall, 0. 65 m wide. Above the springing of the vault on the east wall are three evenly spaced squared conical air vents (0. 34 m square, D: 0. 74 + m). ** The main room is made up of three parallel N-S vaulted spaces (W: 1. 70 m, 1. 95 m, and 1. 60 m; L. 6. 60 m) joined down the center by a fourth E-W vault (W: 1. 95, L: 6. 60 m); the intersections are groin vaults. The walls between the three parallel vaults are 0. 60 - 0. 65 m thick, while the wall with the antechamber is 0. 75 - 0. 80 m thick. The arched doorway between the two spaces is 0. 75 m wide and is visibly off center to the south; an air vent is centered under the vault above the door (H: 0. 38 m, W: 0. 40 m, D: 1. 25 + m). Square piers (L: 0. 95 m) project into the four corners of the main room, probably an aspect of the foundations for a monumental superstructure. ** The walls are built from mortared petit appareil masonry with well-cut voussoirs for the arch between the two spaces. The average blocks in the corner piers (L: 50 - 64, H: 15 - 22, D: 20 - 30) are half again larger than those in the walls. The few blocks with a <b>split</b> <b>face</b> are picked for the application of plaster. Throughout, the mortar beds are scored at a sharp downward angle. The wall construction continues in a similar fashion halfway up the height of the vault, while the upper half of the vault is formed by a mortared rubble mass, poured in place. Put log holes (0. 23 m square and 0. 22 x 0. 27 m) are seen near the apex of the vaults at the north end of the antechamber and the north end of the central vault. ** At the north end of the antechamber, a single built burial space is visible (L: 1. 77 m, W: 0. 95 m). The cover slab would have rested on the closing wall to the south and in a groove (H: 0. 17 - 0. 19 m, D: 0. 03 - 0. 04 m) built into the east and west walls about 1. 70 m below the apex of the vault. This groove is also found along the slide walls of the main room wherever it has been cleared to that depth. ** Above ground, the lowest courses of the north, west, and south walls are preserved and form a u-shape facing east. The outer face is petit appareil masonry (8. 40 m by 7. 60 m) and the interior face is ashlar (6. 0 m x 3. 40), and the whole is located above the square main room.
