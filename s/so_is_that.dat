The mushrooms grow in clusters, and fruit in the summer and autumn. The host mushroom is sometimes malformed and assumes an irregular appearance. In an early publication, Charles Bagge Plowright commented [...] "Berkeley's figure ... is rather misleading. <b>So</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> given by Knapp under the name Agaricus surrectus ..., inasmuchas they show the Agaric (A.nebularis), upon which it is parasitic, in a very robust condition. In my specimen the host (A.nebularis) was quite sodden and collapsed so as to be practically unrecognisable unless one had known what species to expect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arbitration is {{particularly}} popular {{as a means}} of dispute resolution in the commercial sphere (for a summary of the various arenas in which arbitration is usually chosen, see the specific article on [...] "arbitration"). [...] One of the reasons for doing <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in international trade, it is often easier to enforce an arbitration award in a foreign country than it is to enforce a judgment of the court.|$|E

Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months, and perhaps a year; now, the 14-week run is the norm." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although other {{ingredients}} such as polycyclic synthetic musks, {{have been reported}} to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays, these reports have been reviewed by various authorities. For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks Galaxolide (HHCB) these reviews includes those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, the EU's Priority Substances Review, the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk and more recently also the US EPA. The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcome exists for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN) as well for instance on its safe us in cosmetics by the EU.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the closed}} form solution, just presented, the {{compressed}} waveform has the standard sinc function response, because a rectangular shape was assumed for the amplitude of the pulse spectrum. [...] In practice, {{the spectrum of}} a linear chirp has a rectangular profile only when the time-bandwidth product of a pulse is large, i.e. when T×B exceeds 100, say. [...] When the product is small, the spectral profile of the chirp pulse is seriously degraded by Fresnel ripples as shown in Chirp spectrum and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the matched filter. [...] To investigate fully the consequences of these ripples it is [...] advisable to consider each situation individually, either [...] by evaluating convolution integrals, or more conveniently, by means of FFTs.|$|E
2500|$|About climate change, Jensen said in December 2008 that [...] "we can {{see that}} climate changes are {{happening}}, {{but they have been}} happening {{for as long as the}} world has existed. The question is whether they are man-made or not, or whether they are dangerous or not. Just some 30 years ago, all these scientists said that the world was getting colder, and now they have changed their mind and say that the world is getting warmer. <b>So</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> what's happening, or isn't it?" [...] Regardless, she is largely supportive of expanding and researching into renewable energy production. In January 2010 she attacked the IPCC, accusing the report from the panel of being based on fraudulent data. She referred to the erroneous statement of Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035, ice melting predictions by Al Gore and Jonas Gahr Støre, questions of statistical sampling, and emails from climate scientists at the Climatic Research Unit.|$|E

2500|$|Chase scholar Robert Stockman's 1985 book [...] Baha'i Faith in America: Origins 1892–1900 {{acknowledged}} Chase {{had served}} in the Civil War (and as a teenager) though not that his service was with black Americans. Neither did volume two in the series.: [...] An excerpt from a forthcoming book by Stockman was published in 1987 in the Baha'i News. It noted Chase was 6' 2" [...] and some 260lbs late in life, had suffered medical trouble some 20 years including a surgery in 1911 and held correspondence between Chase and Bosch. It also included a tribute by Stockman for Chase. It noted Chase was [...] "exceptionally even-tempered and mild-mannered…scrupulously avoided arguing…. His capacity to love anyone, especially those who disagreed with him, is especially demonstrated in his words and actions.… He is perhaps the only person before 1912 who had a thorough understanding of the Bahá'í concept of consultation.… was the prime mover behind many of the (local council)'s activities." [...] Yet none of these refer to his Civil War service being with African Americans. In 1989 Bob Quigley, a Bahá'í television producer who had worked closely with Hand of the Cause William Sears from the 1960s was buried in a grave very near to Chase'. <b>So</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Kazem Kazemzadeh, the first trustee of the Huququ'llah in the West, the father of Firuz Kazemzadeh.|$|E
2500|$|Many Disney {{characters}} can {{be found}} throughout the park, greeting visitors, interacting with children, and posing for photos. Some characters have specific areas where they are scheduled to appear, but {{can be found}} wandering as well. Some of the rarest are characters like Rabbit (from Winnie-the-Pooh), Max, Mushu, and Agent P. Periodically through recent decades (and most recently during the summers of 2005 and 2006), Mickey Mouse would climb the Matterhorn attraction {{several times a day}} with the support of Minnie, Goofy, and other performers. Other mountain climbers could also be seen on the Matterhorn from time to time. As of March 2007, Mickey and his [...] "toon" [...] friends no longer climb the Matterhorn but the climbing program continues. Every evening at dusk, there is a military-style flag retreat to lower the U.S. Flag by a ceremonial detail of Disneyland's Security staff. The ceremony is usually held between 4:00 and 5:00pm, depending on the entertainment being offered on Main Street, U.S.A., to prevent conflicts with crowds and music. Disney does report the time the Flag Retreat is scheduled on its Times Guide, offered at the entrance turnstiles and other locations. The Disneyland Band, which {{has been part of the}} park since its opening, plays the role of the Town Band on Main Street, U.S.A. It also breaks out into smaller groups like the Main Street Strawhatters, the Hook and Ladder Co., and the Pearly Band in Fantasyland. However, on March 31, 2015, the Disneyland Resort notified the band members of an [...] "end of run". The reason for doing <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they would start a new higher energy band. The veteran band members were invited to audition for the new Disneyland band, and were told that even if they did not make the new band or audition, they would still play in small groups around the park. This sparked some controversy with supporters of the traditional band.|$|E

6000|$|But if {{scientific}} method, {{operating in}} the region of history, of philology, of archæology, {{in the course of the}} last thirty or forty years, has become thus formidable to the theological dogmatist, what may not be said about scientific method working in the province of physical science? For, if it be true that the Canonical Scriptures have innumerable points of contact with civil history, it is no less true that they have almost as many with natural history; and their accuracy is put to the test as severely by the latter as by the former. The origin of the present state of the heavens and the earth is a problem which lies strictly within the province of physical science; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the origin of man among living things; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the physical changes which the earth has undergone since the origin of man; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the origin of the various races and nations of men, with all their varieties of language and physical conformation. Whether the earth moves round the sun or the contrary; whether the bodily and mental diseases of men and animals are caused by evil spirits or not; whether there is such an agency as witchcraft or not--all these are purely scientific questions; and to all of them the canonical Scriptures profess to give true answers. And though nothing is more common than the assumption that these books come into conflict only with the speculative part of modern physical science, no assumption can have less foundation. {512} ...|$|E
60|$|To trace out {{scientific}} {{evolution from}} its deepest roots would, of course, involve a complete {{analysis of the}} mind.

We must, therefore, begin somewhere abruptly; and the most appropriate stage to take for our point of departure will be the adult mind of the savage.|$|E
