40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. A {{hydrochloric}} acid solution laboratory test {{was developed to}} assess the resistance of concrete used {{in the manufacture of}} pipes to sulphuric acid environments encountered in sewers. A {{hydrochloric acid}} solution (pH of 1, 00) simulates the attack on concrete sewer pipes at the average daily sewage level region and in <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> sulphuric acid environments (pH of less than 1, 00) commonly encountered in South African sewers. Calcium sulphate, which precipitates in a sulphuric acid solution and masks further attack, is eliminated simulating the constant dissolution of the precipitate at the average daily sewage level region and loosely attached precipitate in the <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> sewer environments. A straightforward procedure is used to determine the acid resistance of dolomite aggregate concrete used in the manufacture of sewer pipes for exposure to sulphuric acid sewer environments. Acid resistance and neutralisation capacity of the concrete are measured as functions of mass loss and hydrogen ion consumption with time (over a period of approximately 96 hours or less). A procedure to determine the acid resistance of siliceous aggregate concrete requires a longer test period (approximately 200 hours or more). A concrete containing calcium aluminate cement and a synthetic alag™ aggregate made from the calcium aluminate cement clinker gave the best resistance to the hydrochloric acid solution (pH of 1, 00) and a <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> biologically-induced sulphuric acid environment (pH of less than 1, 00). A similar concrete containing dolomite aggregate gave poorer resistance to the respective solutions. A dolomite aggregate concrete containing calcium aluminate cement gave better resistance in the biologically-induced sulphuric acid environment than a similar concrete containing ordinary portland cement but both concretes were of similar resistance in the hydrochloric acid solution. A poor quality dolomite stone (low strength and high porosity), which fractures during pipe manufacture gave poorer resistance in the hydrochloric solution than a concrete containing a sound dolomite stone but better resistance in the biologically-induced sulphuric acid environment. Concrete containing siliceous aggregate gave the poorest resistance to both the acidic environments.

Various process parameters were tested {{to evaluate their}} effects on the coating properties, which were also compared to those of HVOF-sprayed NiCrBSi and Stellite- 6 coatings. The Fe alloy coatings are composed of flattened splats, originating from molten droplets and consisting of a super-saturated solid solution, together with rounded particles, coming from partially unmolten material and containing V- and Fe-based carbide precipitates. All process parameters, apart from “extreme” settings with excess comburent in the flame, produce dense coatings, indicating that the feedstock powder is quite easily processable by HVOF. These coatings, with a microhardness of 650 - 750 HV 0. 3, exhibit wear rates of ≈ 2  ×  10 − 6  mm 3 /(Nm) in ball-on-disk tests against sintered Al 2 O 3 spheres.

The corrosion potentials shifted in the noble direction, and the value of the AC impedance also exhibited a higher value with increasing cover thickness. Furthermore, the polarization resistance increased with increasing cover thickness, which means that the oxide film that is deposited on the surface of a steel bar surrounded by alkali environment exhibits better corrosion resistance because the water, chloride ions and dissolved oxygen have difficulty penerating {{to the surface of the}} steel bar with increasing cover thickness.

To estimate {{the potential for the}} application of PVD-coatings (physical vapour deposition) different coating systems for steel sheet as well as for hot-dip or elect ro-galvanized steel sheet were designed, The samples were produced on a laboratory scale using PVD processes with very high deposition rates (in the order of 1 mum s(- 1)) as well as high-power plasma processes for the pre-treatment. The relationship between the composition, microstructure and properties of the coating systems, in particular concerning corrosion protection, abrasion during forming, phosphating and paint adhesion, were studied.

40|$|Electrokinetic Nanoparticle (EN) {{treatment}} {{was used as}} a rapid repair measure to mitigate chloride induced corrosion of reinforced concrete in the field. EN treatment uses an electric field to transport positively charged nanoparticles to the reinforcement through the concrete capillary pores. Cylindrical reinforced concrete specimens were batched with 4. 5 wt % salt content (based on cement mass). Three distinct electrokinetic treatments were conducted using high current density (up to 5 A/m 2) to form a chloride penetration barrier that was established in 5 days, as opposed to the traditional 6 - 8 weeks, generally required for electrochemical chloride extraction (ECE). These treatments included basic EN treatment, EN with additional calcium treatment, and basic ECE treatment. Field exposures were conducted at the NASA Beachside Corrosion Test Site, Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. The specimens were subjected to sea water immersion at the test site as a posttreatment exposure. Following a 30 -day post-treatment exposure period, the specimens were subjected to indirect tensile testing to evaluate treatment impact. The EN treated specimens exhibited 60 % and 30 % increases in tensile strength as compared to the untreated controls and ECE treated specimens respectively. The surfaces of the reinforcement bars of the control specimens were 67 % covered by corrosion products. In contrast, the EN treated specimens exhibited corrosion coverage of only 4 %. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a dense concrete microstructure adjacent to the bars of the treated specimens as compared to the control and ECE specimens. Energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analysis of the polished EN treated specimens showed a reduction in chloride content by a factor of 20 adjacent to the bars.

40|$|Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) are {{increasingly}} being considered as structural materials for advanced power generation equipment. Broadly speaking the two classes of materials are oxide-based CMCs and non-oxide based CMCs. The non-oxide CMCs are primarily silicon-based. Under conditions prevalent in the gas turbine hot section the water vapor formed in the combustion of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons reacts with the surface-SiO 2 to form volatile products. Progressive surface recession of the SiC-SiC CMC component, strength loss {{as a result of}} wall thinning and chemical changes in the component occur, which leads to the loss of structural integrity and mechanical strength and becomes life limiting to the equipment in service. The solutions pursued to improve the life of SiC-SiC CMCs include the incorporation of an external barrier coating to provide surface protection to the CMC substrate. The coating system has become known as an Environmental Barrier Coating (EBC). The relevant early coatings work was focused on coatings for corrosion protection of silicon-based monolithic ceramics operating under <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> conditions. The development of EBCs for gas turbine hot section components was built on the early work for silicon-based monolithics. The first generation EBC is a three-layer coating, which in its simplest configuration consists of a silicon (Si) base coat applied on top of the CMC, a barium-strontium-aluminosilicate (BSAS) surface coat resistant to water vapor attack, and a mullite-based intermediate coating layer between the Si base coat and BSAS top coat. This system can be represented as Si-Mullite-BSAS. While this baseline EBC presented a significant improvement over the uncoated SiC-SiC CMC, for the very long durations of 3 - 4 years or more expected for industrial operation further improvements in coating durability are desirable. Also, for very demanding applications with higher component temperatures but shorter service lives more rugged EBCs will be necessary. A second generation of EBCs incorporates rare earth silicates which have extremely favorable resistance against environmental attack and a higher temperature capability. Performance data for this class of EBCs is more limited and especially field data are not as extensive as for the first generation EBCs. Extensive laboratory, rig and engine testing, including testing of EBC coated SiC-SiC CMCs in actual field applications is in progress. The development of next generation EBCs with even higher temperature capability than the second generation EBC is also underway. This paper will discuss the current status of EBC technology and future direction based on literature survey...|$|E
40|$|External {{coatings}} {{used for}} corrosion protection {{often have to}} perform under <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> environments. One major concern regarding coating performance is the negative effect of soluble salts on the steel substrate {{at the time of}} coating application, particularly for marine maintenance coating applications. These salts impact the ability of the applied coating systems to protect the steel in several ways including osmotic coating blistering, promotion of under-film metallic corrosion and coating disbondment. This paper focuses on removal of soluble salts contamination by commercially available decontamination processes in relation to external coating systems. We directly compare the effectiveness of four cleaning methods with the performance of ten coating systems. The methodology of surface contamination and preparation of test panels is discussed. After cleaning, sample evaluation for chloride ion contamination levels was carried out using Field method (commercial chloride ion test kit for surfaces) and Ion Chromatography method. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and elemental surface mapping analysis were carried out. Laboratory testing of coating systems included Adhesion, Porosity, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and cyclic UV/Salt Fog exposure. The performance of the ten coatings on all the substrates was good, but there were differences in gloss retention and on the degree of checking of the different coatings. The only significant difference in performance of the coatings compared to the method used for cleaning the substrate was higher undercreep observed for most of the coatings applied to the ultra-high pressure water jetted system. This shows the importance of substrate preparation due to the sensitivity of the coatings to even low levels of salt. Two coatings did not show increased undercreep and these may be more applicable for offshore maintenance applications where dry abrasive blasting is sometimes not used. The chemical treatment cleaning method used prior to coating application did not show any significant positive or negative effect on the performance of the applied coatings. The fact that the only differences in performance for the coatings applied to the differently prepared substrates was seen for undercreep suggests that the difference may be exacerbated for immersion situations. A follow up study to this one will examine the performance of internal coatings using immersion tests, and {{it will be interesting to}} see if these show increased effect on coating performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of driving motors and rollers which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to guide the steel strip through the molten metal bath. The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the molten metal bath. This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of molten metal bath hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser cladding. ORNL worked with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale sleeve and bushing dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|E
40|$|E-glass {{has been}} widely used as a {{reinforcing}} material for years, especially as a plastic reinforcer {{in the production of}} GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic). Failure of GRP materials under stress came in to the picture quite recently. Since then studies have been conducted in an attempt to understand the causes and the underlying behaviour. Except for the last section of the research (analysis using a kinetic approach) where glass fibre was cut out to weigh approximately 1. 0 g, standard sized specimens were soaked in the required acid solutions of desired concentrations for varying temperatures and time frames. Wherever tensile strength retention was measured, LLOYD instrument was employed. Leaching of the cations were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES and also know and ICP-AES). The scope of this project can be divided in to four sections; first section involved investigating the effects of malonic acid. The study of malonic acid was narrowed to investigating the trend in strength retention. A rapid strength loss was observed initially followed by a much steady decline in the strength. However the continuation of the loss of strength was unmistakable throughout the time period of exposure. Furthermore, temperature can be observed as a facilitating factor in this degradation reaction. Secondly the corrosive effect of glyoxylic acid on E-glass fibre was studied. This was explored at two different temperatures for two specific time frames using various concentrations of the acid of interest. The influence of this acid on the glass fibre was found out in terms of strength retention and loss of cations from the glass matrix. The mildness of this acid was accentuated by the fact that 70 % or more of the strength was retained at all the conditions employed. A minima in strength retention was observed at 2 M acid concentration similar to the trends observed in the past (Betz and Jones 2003 and Jones and Chandler 1986). Leaching of cations reflected this trend. The large strength retention could be related to the fewer amounts of Ca and K leached from the glass matrix (Kumosa and Qui, 1997). Similar to malonic acid, an unusually large amount of B was leached out that could be due to the favourable orientation of the anion with the trivalent ions during the complex formation. Yet again temperature was found to enhance the degradation process. Next the extent of passivation (if any) showed by malonic acid was investigated using E-glass fibre pre-treated in 5 M malonic acid and post treated in known corrosive acids hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid. Passivation of malonic acid was put to test through examination of strength retention of the fibres under these conditions. This segment was carried out as an extension of a finding (a behaviour synonymous to passivation) shown by malonic that surfaced the previous year by the present researcher. Increasing the pre-treatment time showed a great improvement in the retained strength for all the post-treatment acid mediums. Furthermore, while Jones and Betz (2004) featured 20 - 40 % strength retention within a short time frame in 3 M HCl, the immense amount of strength retention (60 - 70 %) preceding pre-treatment should definitely be noted. Similarly strength retention of about 80 % was observed when post-treated with the <b>severely</b> <b>corrosive</b> oxalic acid. Hence its is clear that passivation can be induced through prolonged pre-treatment in 5 M malonic acid that could inhibit the attack of corrosive acid at least {{for a period of time}}. The last fragment of the study focussed on understanding and working out the mechanism behind the reactions between the E-glass fibre and acid medium in terms of kinetics. The acids utilized were 1. 5 M malonic acid and 3 M glyoxylic acid and the assessments were made through the analysis of the weight changes brought about by the acid medium at various temperatures and time frames. In addition leaching patterns of cations were evaluated as this could contribute in achieving the objective. Maximum weight loss reached 4 % in glyoxylic acid while that for malonic acid exceeded 20 %. The general trend was that the glass fibres lost weight in both acids for a period of time followed by an evident weight gain. Furthermore the weight loss results fit the first order rate law. While the leaching of cations reflects the weight loss for the shorter time frames, steady loss of ions was visible even for the longer time frames where the weight has increased. The weight gain could be explained in terms of binding of anions to certain cations on the glass surface, accounting for the hindrance in the loss of cations at the longer time frames as well. About 50 % of weight loss was associated to Ca while 20 % was to Al, leaving 6 % to B where as the rest of the ions had shown almost insignificant contribution to the weight loss...|$|E
