25|$|Due to {{this lack}} of large game, the Taíno people became very <b>skilled</b> <b>fishermen.</b> One {{technique}} was to hook a remora, {{also known as a}} suckerfish, to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch. Another method used by the Taínos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous senna shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in. This poison did not affect the edibility of the fish. Taíno youth, mostly young boys, also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters and within the mangroves.|$|E

50|$|Attenborough {{explores the}} {{influence}} of the first Mediterranean civilizations, placing the symbolism of the bull at the centre of his narrative. Cave paintings in France and Spain and Egyptian hieroglyphs both reveal cultures that revered the wild bull for its fertility and strength. The Ancient Egyptians deified many animals, including the living bull-god Apis, and accorded it the same ceremonial burial as their Pharaohs. Attenborough describes the ritual from the Temple of Apis in Memphis. At Saqqara, more than 4 million mummified sacred ibises were brought as offerings by devotees. Crop cultivation began in the Nile Delta, but the Minoans were the first to harvest olives, using oxen-powered mills to crush them. They were also <b>skilled</b> <b>fishermen,</b> whose traditional methods for catching octopus and tunny are still practised by modern North Africans. Attenborough explains how Cretan men pitted themselves against bulls in specially built arenas. The Romans were passionate hunters, using wild animals ransacked from their Empire for entertainment, but they also held the bull in special regard. The statue of Artemis, salvaged from the Temple of Ephesus, is adorned with bulls' testes. Of more than 600 Roman cities along the North African coast, Leptis Magna was the greatest. Its wealth was built on trading livestock and produce harvested from the surrounding fertile lands; figs, olives and grain. But in deforesting the land the Romans precipitated their own demise. Although humans had enslaved and subdued the bull, Attenborough concludes that they had yet to learn the value of the natural world.|$|E
5000|$|The name of {{the tribe}} shows what the {{occupation}} of the tribe was: trading. The word teke means 'to buy'. The economy of the Teke is mainly based on farming maize, millet and tobacco, but the Teke are also hunters, <b>skilled</b> <b>fishermen</b> and traders. The Teke lived in an area across Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon. The mfumu {{was the head of}} the family and his prestige grew as family members increased. The Teke sometimes chose blacksmiths as chiefs. The blacksmiths were important in the community and this occupation was passed down from father to son. In terms of life of the Teke, the village chief was chosen as religious leader, he was the most important tribal member and he would keep all the potions and spiritual bones that would be used in traditional ceremonies to speak to the spirits and rule safety over his people. [...] Teke masks are mainly used in traditional dancing ceremonies such as wedding, funeral and initiation ceremonies of young men entering adult hood. The mask is also used as a social and political identifier of social structure within a tribe or family. The Teke or Kidumu people are well known for their Teke masks, which are round flat disk-like wooden masks that have abstract patterns and geometric motifs with horizontal lines that are painted in earthly colors, mainly dark blue, blacks, browns and clays. The traditional Teke masks all have triangle shaped noses. The masks have narrow eye slits to enable the masker to see without being seen. They have holes pierced along the edge for the attachment of a woven raffia dress with feathers and fibers. The mask is held in place with a bite bar at the back that the wearer holds in his teeth. The dress would add to the mask's costume and conceal the wearer. The masks originate from the upper Ogowe region.|$|E

It is located 30 miles south of Oregon inlet and 20 miles north of Hatteras inlet (USGS 2008). Avon and all villages on Hatteras Island are bounded by Cape Hatteras National Recreational Seashore. 3 Map 1. Location of Avon, NC (US Census Bureau 2000) Historical/Background Avon’s {{original}} name was Kinnakeet; a Native American name. In 1883 the post office arrived in the town and assigned the name Avon because it is easier to pronounce. This small fishing village on the Outer Banks is home to the Little Kinnakeet Lifesaving Station, which is used to help aid crews in the dangerous waters. Little Kinnakeet was one of ten life saving stations. 4 Many people from the area still refer to themselves as Kinnakeeters. Kinakeeters were <b>skilled</b> <b>fishermen</b> and shipbuilders (Outerbeaches. com). There were vast maritime forests before 1888.

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{reports on}} an {{economic}} experiment {{conducted to examine}} the nature of rent dissipation in limited entry fisheries with aggregate quotas, and factors affecting fishermen's political support for changing to individual quota management. The experimental subjects are fishermen who participate {{in a series of}} fishing seasons. The experiment assumes that (a) managers limit aggregate harvests each season to a total quota; (b) individual fishermen's shares of the total catch are positively related to their share of total fishing expenditures; (c) individual fishermen's shares of the total catch are positively related to their assigned fishing skill, and (d) rents are dissipated to the extent that total expenditures exceed the minimum necessary to catch the total quota. Total quotas and fish prices which together determine the catch value vary between seasons. After only a few seasons, subjects dissipate almost all potential rents by increasing expenditures to try to increase their shares of the rents. Increases in prices lead to increased rent dissipation; lower prices lead to reduced rent dissipation. Heterogeneity of fishing skill reduces the extent of rent dissipation, as fishing becomes relatively less profitable for less skilled participants. More skilled participants capture significant rents. After gaining experience with a fishery without individual quotas, subjects vote on whether to switch to individual quota (IQ) management. Subjects are more likely to vote for individual quotas the higher their quota allocations. Heterogeneity of fishing skill, by increasing the heterogeneity of catches and the rents captured by <b>skilled</b> <b>fishermen</b> without IQs, reduces the likelihood that IQ allocations based on historical catches will be supported by a majority of fishermen. Implementation of IQs quickly reduces rent dissipation to almost zero...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of harvest cooperatives has recently generated considerable interest among fishermen and regulators {{as an alternative}} to other rights-based systems such as individual transferable quotas. Many consider the promotion of self-governance to be essential to more sustainable, equitable and efficient management of commercial fisheries. This dissertation examines the incentives created by the allocation of collective fishing rights as a mechanism for inducing the creation of cooperatives (or sectors). A theoretical model of the fishery characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions for the {{formation of}} sectors when harvesters have incomplete information on how to organize collective fishing but instead must learn by doing. The equilibria of the dynamic sector-formation game played by the heterogeneous fishermen shows that sectors may fail to form if permit holders are unfamiliar with cooperative harvesting. Conversely, when sectors do organize, the least <b>skilled</b> <b>fishermen</b> join first and the scope of their cooperation, as given by the number of tasks they choose to coordinate, increases progressively over time until the uncertainty is fully resolved. Profitability, in turn, benefits from enhanced cooperation. 	I test the predictions of the model using a panel data set from the hook gear segment in the New England Multispecies Fishery to estimate a stochastic output distance function and a technical inefficiency model. The simultaneous estimation of both equations allows the full characterization of the underlying multi-output technology and the assessment of key determinants of technical efficiency such as vessel characteristics, congestion conditions and cooperation. The results show that the least efficient vessels were the first to join the Georges Bank Cod Hook sector in 2004, and present evidence of earlier cooperation among these vessels (i. e. previous to the institutionalization of the group as a sector), hence suggesting familiarity with collective harvesting when joining the sector. Additionally, the resulst demonstrate that technical efficiency was higher for sector vessels than common pool boats during the sector years and increased during this period...|$|E
