5|$|A <b>supportive</b> {{environment}} and family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and <b>supportive</b> environment.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the <b>supportive</b> conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the <b>supportive</b> conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the <b>supportive</b> conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These <b>supportive</b> conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E
5|$|Consumption of A. ocreata is {{a medical}} {{emergency}} that requires hospitalization. There are four main categories of therapy for poisoning: preliminary medical care, <b>supportive</b> measures, specific treatments, and liver transplantation.|$|E

5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation generally resolves {{when the}} underlying causes are treated, but <b>supportive</b> measures are often required. For instance, if the platelet count drops significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.|$|E
5|$|Drew-Ashlyn, a 22-year-old trans {{woman from}} Wakefield, {{has been living}} as a woman {{for more than four}} years. Her family are <b>supportive,</b> but before the show she had never met another trans person—let alone trans people near her own age.|$|E

5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; <b>supportive</b> relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} anti-Zionist, Stern's views {{changed in}} the 1940s, and by 1942 he was strongly supported Jewish nationalism. When an Oakland branch of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism formed in 1944, Stern opposed its creation, even though many members, including its president, were leading members of Temple Sinai. By 1948, however, the congregation had also become <b>supportive</b> of Zionism.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Jackson Houston (1854–1941) was a United States Senator. A {{graduate}} of West Point, {{he served in}} Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders during the Spanish–American War. He was a proponent of prohibition and <b>supportive</b> of suffrage for women. His first wife was Carrie Glenn Purnell; after her death, he remarried to Elizabeth Hart Good.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are <b>supportive</b> of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special <b>supportive</b> {{clothing}} and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and <b>supportive</b> {{of the black}} nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
5|$|By 10 November 2014, total {{comments}} by viewers posted below the video on YouTube numbered in the hundreds. The majority of comments were <b>supportive.</b> Visitors {{to the site}} wrote favourably of Capaldi's actions to record the video for the child. A few observed that Capaldi's version of the Doctor character is sinister and serious, and contrasted this with the actor's depiction of the character as warm and effusive in his recording.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (<b>supportive</b> of mountain formation) and extension (<b>supportive</b> of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|Doane {{was born}} to Ken and Vickie Doane in Southbridge, Massachusetts. His parents were <b>supportive</b> of his {{decision}} in becoming a professional wrestler. He has an older brother named Mike. Doane attended Bay Path Regional Vocational Technical High School in Charlton, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Ellen has {{her friends}} over {{to come out}} to them. Before they arrive, she comes out to her gay {{neighbor}} Peter. When everyone else arrives, Ellen balks at telling them but Peter outs her. Ellen confirms that it's true and her friends are all <b>supportive</b> of her, although her friend Paige is hesitant.|$|E
5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, <b>supportive</b> psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has {{found no evidence}} that this is effective. <b>Supportive</b> psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminists' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or <b>supportive</b> of prostitution and sex work.|$|E
5|$|Goriot, <b>supportive</b> of Rastignac's {{interest}} in his daughter and furious with her husband's tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs him {{that she has been}} selling off her husband's family jewelry to pay her lover's debts, the old man is overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology {{is known}} today {{primarily}} from Greek literature and representations on visual media {{dating from the}} Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward. In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually <b>supportive</b> and sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, {{the existence of this}} corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.|$|E
5|$|Harpole {{has also}} {{received}} media attention for his comments on refugees in Amarillo, which receives more refugees {{per capita than}} any other Texas city. He has expressed concern for the city's ability to accommodate the relatively large number, but has asserted that Amarillo is <b>supportive</b> and accepting of refugees.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves <b>supportive</b> care and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other <b>supportive</b> care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|Imelda was {{expected}} to be sophisticated, elegant, and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a <b>supportive</b> wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain him more supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, a {{candidate}} for a Roman fort was identified by aerial photography at Easter Galcantray, south west of Cawdor. The site was excavated between 1984 and 1988 and several features were identified which are <b>supportive</b> of this classification. Roman pottery similar to that found at Inchtuthill Roman fort has been discovered. If confirmed, {{it would be one}} of the most northerly known Roman forts in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while <b>supportive</b> of ACA's objectives, voiced concern {{through the}} United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate {{covering}} contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated the First Amendment right to {{free exercise of religion}} and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns.|$|E
5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. <b>Supportive</b> criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, however, many Christian evangelists {{and church}} {{organizations}} {{took a more}} <b>supportive</b> role. For example, televangelist Jim Bakker expressed {{public support for the}} group Stryper, watching them perform and becoming personal friends with the band's members. Many new bands began to arise, eventually drawing the attention of record labels that specialized in Christian music.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reaction}} {{within the}} Communist Bloc was mixed. Hungary's János Kádár was highly <b>supportive</b> of Dubček's appointment in January, but Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which they feared might weaken {{the position of}} the Communist Bloc during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If <b>supportive</b> treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.|$|E
