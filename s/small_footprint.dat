5|$|As part of Microsoft's {{unification}} strategies, Windows {{products that}} are based on Windows 10's common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as Windows 10 Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for embedded systems, along with Windows 10 IoT Core, which is designed specifically for use in <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> low-cost devices and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar to Windows Embedded.|$|E

25|$|With {{the ability}} to deeply embed Informix in {{gateways}} and routers, timeseries support, <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> and low administration requirements, Informix is also targeted at Internet-of-Things solutions, {{where many of the}} data-handling requirements can be handled with gateways that embed Informix and connect sensors and devices to the internet.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to nuclear}} power, {{hydroelectricity}} construction requires altering {{large areas of}} the environment while a nuclear power station has a <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure. The creation of Garrison Dam, for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Secure Digital {{includes}} four card families available {{in three different}} sizes. The four families are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the High-Capacity (SDHC), the eXtended-Capacity (SDXC), and the SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage. The three form factors are the original size, the mini size, and the micro size. Electrically passive adapters allow a smaller card to fit and function in a device built for a larger card. The SD card's <b>small</b> <b>footprint</b> is an ideal storage medium for smaller, thinner and more portable electronic devices.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{has decided}} to lean heavily on CIA in general and SAD {{specifically}} {{in their efforts to}} withdraw from Afghanistan as it did in Iraq. There are plans being considered to have several US Military special operations elements assigned to CIA after the withdrawal. If so, there would be still a chance to rebuild and assist and coordinate (with Afghan ANSF commandos) and continue to keep a <b>small</b> <b>footprint</b> while allowing free elections and pushing back the Taliban/AQ forces that have failed but continue to attempt their taking back parts of the country, as they have had between 2015 through 2016.|$|E
25|$|Cities are {{typically}} hubs {{for education and}} the arts, supporting universities, museums, temples, and other cultural institutions. They feature impressive displays of architecture ranging from small to enormous and ornate to brutal; skyscrapers, providing thousands of offices or homes within a <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> and visible from miles away, have become iconic urban features. Cultural elites tend to live in cities, bound together by shared cultural capital, and themselves playing some role in governance. By virtue of their status as centers of culture and literacy, cities {{can be described as}} the locus of civilization, world history, and social change.|$|E
25|$|The V-fold belt {{is similar}} to the belt filter press with the main {{difference}} being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.|$|E

25|$|With India's Home Minister, Gulzari Lal Nanda, Hills had co-founded the Institute of Psychic and Spiritual Research in New Delhi. A devout Gandhian, Nanda feared social {{upheaval}} {{and possible}} communal violence if poor and hungry villagers started migrating to India's cities so {{he threw his}} support behind Hills' plan for developing rural economies via <b>small</b> <b>footprint</b> aquaculture that could help villages become sustainable. A detailed plan for a pilot project in the Rann of Kutch {{was approved by the}} Indian government. However, the initiative became mired in bureaucracy when Nehru died in 1964. Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the chlorella algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to political jockeying as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death at the 1966 India-Pakistan peace conference in Tashkent, the project lost its key sponsor.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and then a little debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously. [...] <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> fast startup, and clean interface." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{all-in-one}} {{desktop computer}} integrates the system's internal components {{into the same}} case as the display, thus occupying a <b>smaller</b> <b>footprint</b> (with fewer cables) than desktops that incorporate a tower.|$|R
50|$|However, it {{occupies}} a much <b>smaller</b> <b>footprint</b> {{compared to other}} airports in the United States. As a result, recently, numerous plans have been proposed to either add another airport in the area, or relocate it entirely.|$|R
2500|$|... {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>footprint</b> – {{the high}} intensity of bubble-particle contact means that very low residence times are {{required in the}} Cell (residence time in the downcomer is 5–10 seconds and the separation tank volume is small compared with alternative technologies). This means that the total volume of the Cell {{is lower than the}} alternatives.|$|E
2500|$|The theory {{behind the}} Winkeltürme {{was that the}} curved walls would deflect any bomb hitting the tower, {{directing}} it down towards the base. [...] The towers had a <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> which was probably a greater protection. [...] A US bomb did hit one tower in Bremen in October 1944; the bomb exploded through the roof, killing five people inside.|$|E
2500|$|The {{containment}} of IRIS is spherical {{and set to}} be approximately 22–27 meters across. [...] This is compared to 58 meters high and 40 meters in diameter for a typical 600 MW PWR. [...] Additionally, {{two thirds of the}} containment will be underground, giving it a lower profile, in addition to its already very <b>small</b> <b>footprint.</b> [...] While the containment will be smaller than typical plants, it will also be rated for a higher maximum pressure, increasing costs.|$|E

50|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} even more development. Traditionally the machines' cutting tables were horizontal, but now {{vertical}} CNC plasma cutting machines are available, providing for a <b>smaller</b> <b>footprint,</b> increased flexibility, optimum safety and faster operation.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]pdi {{footprint}} {{is typically}} 100 to 1000 times <b>smaller</b> than the <b>footprint</b> normally found in structured data files or database systems, and is rendered without any loss of detail.

2500|$|Due to its simple design, TFTP can {{be easily}} {{implemented}} by <b>small</b> <b>footprint</b> code. It is therefore the protocol of choice for {{the initial stages of}} any network booting strategy like BOOTP, PXE, BSDP, etc., [...] when targeting from highly resourced computers to very low resourced Single-board computers (SBC) and System on a Chip (SoC). It is also used to transfer firmware images and configuration files to network appliances like routers, firewalls, IP phones, etc. Today, TFTP is virtually unused for Internet transfers.|$|E
2500|$|The cost of {{building}} and operating an MBR is often higher than conventional methods of sewage treatment. Membrane filters can be blinded with grease or abraded by suspended grit and lack a clarifier's flexibility to pass peak flows. [...] The technology has become increasingly popular for reliably pretreated waste streams and has gained wider acceptance where infiltration and inflow have been controlled, however, and the life-cycle costs have been steadily decreasing. The <b>small</b> <b>footprint</b> of MBR systems, and the high quality effluent produced, make them particularly useful for water reuse applications.|$|E
2500|$|Autzen {{is known}} for its crowd noise. [...] Due to the stadium's {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>footprint,</b> the fans are very close to the action, and the field is sunken. [...] These factors contribute to the loudness of the stadium even though it is smaller than other 'noise comparable' stadiums. [...] According to many in the Pac-12, it was actually even louder prior to the most recent expansion because the noise reverberated {{all the way up the}} stadium and bounced back down to the field—the so-called [...] "Autzen bounce." [...] Oregon officials say that any future expansions will trap more noise.|$|E
