50|$|Passage of a clot (thrombus) from a <b>{{systemic}}</b> <b>vein</b> to {{a systemic}} artery. When clots in systemic veins break off (embolize), they travel {{first to the}} right side of the heart and, normally, then to the lungs where they lodge, causing pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, when there is a hole at the septum, either upper chambers of the heart (an atrial septal defect) or lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defects), a clot can cross from the right to the left side of the heart, then pass into the systemic arteries as a paradoxical embolism.

40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} frequency and risk factors for developing thrombus in a <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> such as the infrarenal inferior vena cava or the iliac vein, in which a balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) catheter was indwelled. Materials and Methods: Forty-nine patients who underwent B-RTO for gastric varices were included in this study. The B-RTO procedure was performed from the right femoral vein, and the B-RTO catheter was retained overnight in all patients. Pre- and post-procedural CT scans were retrospectively compared in order to evaluate the development of thrombus in the <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> in which the catheter was indwelled. Additionally, several variables were analyzed to assess risk factors for thrombus in a <b>systemic</b> <b>vein.</b> Results: In all 49 patients (100 %), B-RTO was technically successful, and in 46 patients (94 %), complete thrombosis of the gastric varices was achieved. In 6 patients (12 %), thrombus developed in the infrarenal inferior vena cava or the right common-external iliac vein. All thrombi lay longitudinally {{on the right side}} of the inferior vena cava or the right iliac vein. One of the aforementioned 6 patients required anticoagulation therapy. No symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism were observed. Prothrombin time-international normalized ratio and the addition of 5 % ethanolamine oleate iopamidol, on the second day, were related to the development of thrombus.

40|$|Nitric oxide {{may be an}} endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} {{factor in}} systemic arteries and pulmonary veins. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor of <b>systemic</b> <b>veins</b> has not been characterized. Experiments were designed {{to determine whether the}} endothelium-derived relaxing factor of <b>systemic</b> <b>veins</b> shared chemical properties and mechanisms of action with nitric oxide. Rings of the canine femoral vein with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers for the measurement of isometric force. In rings without endothelium, relaxations to nitric oxide were augmented by superoxide dismutase plus catalase and were inhibited by hemoglobin, methylene blue, and LY 83583. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and A 23187 were not augmented by superoxide dismutase plus catalase but were inhibited by hemoglobin and only moderately reduced by either methylene blue or LY 83583. Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were not inhibited by methylene blue and LY 83583. Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were inhibited by ouabain and K+-free solution; those to nitric oxide were not. These results indicate that although the endothelium-derived relaxing factor released from canine <b>systemic</b> <b>veins</b> shares some chemical properties with nitric oxide, the mechanism by which relaxations are induced by the two differ.

40|$|Purpose : Regional therapy {{of primary}} or metastatic liver cancer with low hepatic {{extraction}} ratio {{drugs such as}} doxorubicin is constrained by development of systemic toxicity. To {{examine the effect of}} augmentation of hepatic drug extraction, a swine model of hepatic artery infusion (HAI) with minimally invasive hepatic venous isolation and hepatic venous drug extraction (HVDE) was developed to study the comparative pharmacokinetic profiles of regional and systemically administered doxorubicin. Methods : Doxorubicin 0. 5 – 9 [*]mg/kg was administered to 31 pigs over 90 [*]min either by HAI with simultaneous HVDE or by standard <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> infusion. Systemic artery and hepatic vein plasma samples were collected periodically (0 to 240 [*]min) for determination of doxorubicin concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic profiles were modeled with PCNONLIN 4. 2. Result s: Concentration-time data were best described in all pigs by a two-compartment open model of elimination. Independent of the route of administration, AUC and C max values increased with dose. Mean systemic AUC and C max values were consistently lower with regional administration, with statistically significant decreases at the 0. 5 and 3 [*]mg/kg doses, whereas there was no relationship between hepatic vein parameters and route of administration. There was a linear relationship between mean systemic AUC values and dose in pigs receiving doxorubicin via HAI with HVDE, whereas mean systemic AUC values increased exponentially at doses of 5 [*]mg/kg or above with <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> administration. Conclusions : Administration of doxorubicin by HAI with simultaneous HVDE signifiantly decreases systemic exposure in comparison with standard <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> drug infusion, and may protect against nonlinear increases in exposure at higher doses...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{the anatomy of}} congenital portosystemic shunts involving the left colic vein in dogs and cats. METHODS Retrospective review of a consecutive series of dogs and cats managed for congenital portosystemic shunts. For inclusion a shunt involving the left colic vein with recorded intraoperative mesenteric portovenography or computed tomography angiography along with direct gross surgical observations {{at the time of}} surgery was required. RESULTS Six dogs and three cats met the inclusion criteria. All cases had a shunt which involved a distended left colic vein. The final communication with a <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> was variable; in seven cases (five dogs, two cats) it was via the caudal vena cava, in one cat it was via the common iliac vein and in the remaining dog it was via the internal iliac vein. In addition, two cats showed caudal vena cava duplication. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The morphology of this shunt type appeared to be a result of an abnormal communication between either the left colic vein or the cranial rectal vein and a pelvic <b>systemic</b> <b>vein</b> (caudal vena cava, common iliac vein or internal iliac vein). This information may help with surgical planning in cases undergoing shunt closure surgery...|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} of totally anomalous systemic venous connection {{is limited to}} case reports. In this review, we seek to clarify anatomic, physiologic, and hemodynamic aspects of this extremely rare anomaly. We also present findings of two patients in whom connection of all the <b>systemic</b> <b>veins</b> was anomalous. In the first patient, with usual atrial arrangement, all <b>systemic</b> <b>veins,</b> including the coronary sinus, were connected anomalously to the morphologically left atrium. Limited left-to-right shunt across an atrial septal defect provided {{the only source of}} blood flow to the lungs. The diagnosis was established by saline contrast echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Extreme hypoplasia of the right ventricle precluded corrective surgery, so we performed a bidirectional Glenn operation, along with atrial septectomy. The second patient had isomerism of the left atrial appendages, which creates problems in the definition in anatomic terms since the connection of the <b>systemic</b> <b>veins</b> can never be normal anatomically when both atriums possess a morphologically left appendage. Our patient, nonetheless, had all the <b>systemic</b> and pulmonary <b>veins,</b> connected to the left-sided atrial chamber which then connected to the left ventricle, thus producing hemodynamics of totally anomalous systemic venous connection. We propose an algorithm for evaluation of this hemodynamic combination and discuss management options. We also intend to clarify the potential differences between connection and drainage, with particular attention to the arrangement of atrial appendages. Even though the hemodynamics may be comparable, in anatomic terms, both systemic and pulmonary venoatrial connection will always be anomalous with isomeric atrial appendages...|$|R
