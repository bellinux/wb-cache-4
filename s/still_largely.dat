5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} work {{depicting}} Elgar is Ken Russell's 1962 BBC television film Elgar, made when the composer was <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> out of fashion. This hour-long film contradicted {{the view of}} Elgar as a jingoistic and bombastic composer, and evoked the more pastoral and melancholy side of his character and music.|$|E
5|$|Smyth, Kemp, and Cushing's {{field work}} in the Adirondacks yielded {{detailed}} geologic maps of the challenging region.

Beldie recounts that, under communism, the destitute Domnica Bogdan worked as a hygienist at Bucharest Central Hospital.|$|E
5|$|A Roman {{colonnade}} {{was built}} in the third century, probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Giurgiu and Călărași {{were split}} from Ialomița {{and the former}} county of Ilfov, while in 1997, Ilfov County, which had been a {{dependency}} of the municipality of Bucharest for nearly two decades, was reinstated. The county borders set in 1968 are <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> in place today, but the functions of different authorities have changed due to administrative reforms in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> rural. This has been the case as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> governed by age-old social customs. Many ways in which family relations were conducted during the Han were already stipulated in the ancient Confucian canon, especially in the Book of Rites. This became accepted as the mainstream guide to ethics and custom. In terms of private commercial contracts, they usually entailed information on the goods transferred, the amount paid, {{the names of the}} buyer and seller, the date of transfer and the signatures of witnesses.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{was largely}} forested in this period; {{widespread}} forest clearance {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E
5|$|Buford {{appears in}} {{historical}} records {{beginning in the}} early 19th century. The area that is now Buford was originally part of Cherokee territory. Despite the treaty in 1817 that ceded the territory to the United States and Gwinnett County's legislative establishment in 1818, the area was <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> inhabited by the Cherokee until the 1830s. The first non-Native Americans moved to the Buford area in the late 1820s or early 1830s, although the Buford area was not largely settled by them until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for new developments, and Worcester proved no exception. By {{the end of the century}} the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few tracts of wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E

5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} area around the Bastille {{developed}} further. Early modern Paris continued to grow, {{and by the end of}} the century it had around 250,000 inhabitants and was one of the most populous cities in Europe, though <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> contained within its old city walls – open countryside remained beyond the Bastille. The Arsenal, a large military-industrial complex tasked with the production of cannons and other weapons for the royal armies, was established to the south of the Bastille by Francis I, and substantially expanded under Charles IX. An arms depot was later built above the Porte Saint-Antoine, all making the Bastille part of a major military centre.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm wrote {{well over}} 100 works, {{including}} 35 orchestral works, 7 concertante works (including a violin concerto and two piano concertos), 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus, 54 piano works, 3 organ works, 43 songs, 8 choral part-songs, 7 ballets, and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns. He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> unknown at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the Transcendental Études of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty.|$|E

5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E
5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in human cells that lack the α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|The Amorite Mari {{maintained}} the older {{aspects of the}} economy, which was <b>still</b> <b>largely</b> based on irrigated agriculture along the Euphrates valley. The city kept its trading role and was a center for merchants from Babylonia and other kingdoms, it received goods {{from the south and}} east through riverboats and distributed them north, north west and west. The main merchandises handled by Mari were metals and tin imported from the Iranian Plateau and then exported west as far as Crete. Other goods included copper from Cyprus, silver from Anatolia, woods from Lebanon, gold from Egypt, olive oil, wine, and textiles in addition to precious stones from modern Afghanistan.|$|E
