In this paper, research the {{properties of}} municipal solid waste apply the indoor test and consulting literatures. The {{results showed that the}} density of Chongqing municipal solid waste is 430 3 /mkg ~ 610 3 /mkg, the average is 470 3 /mkg. The water content value of municipal solid waste in China is higher than foreign countries. The specific gravity of municipal solid waste in Chongqing is between 1. 70 ~ 2. 56. The porosity ratio of municipal solid waste in Chongqing between 1. 0 ~ 4. 0. The permeability order of magnitude is approximately scm / 10 3 −. The properties of municipal solid waste includes density, water content, specific gravity and porosity ratio, these parameters will be used frequently when calculation and analysis [1]. And these parameters related to landfill capacity calculation, stability evaluation, leachate and landfill gas collection system design. Compare to the test of soil engineering properties, the properties test of municipal solid waste is difficult. The reasons are that (1) At different time and area, the municipal solid waste content will present great difference. For example, if the region use coal for heating, the ash content will higher than other regions. (2) Due to the composition uniformity and fifferent bury time, the organic matter degradation is different, so it is difficult to obtain representative samples. (3) The traditional soil sampling and test methods have rules to follow, in contrary, the municipal solid waste sampling and methods haven’t accepted method. Constitute analysis of municipal solid waste According to the producing source, the municipla solid waste can be divided into residential house refuse and <b>street</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>waste.</b> The residential house refuse includes the organic matter, plastic and paper.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine <b>street</b> <b>cleaning</b> and <b>waste</b> {{collection}} services in Spanish municipalities {{with a population}} exceeding 50 000. The purpose is to identify factors that influence the efficiency of these services. Three input variables (staff, vehicles and containers) and four outputs variables (tonnage, collection points, collection point density and kilometres of surface area wash-ing) are analyzed using an analytical model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology. These variables, along with non-controllable input variable (Tourist Index), were chosen because they were shown, based on a Tobit regression analysis, to have a statistically significant impact on municipality behaviour. The results obtained show that scale inefficiency was lower than pure technical efficiency, the latter is linked to service management. It was observed that the street-cleaning activity was performed more inefficiently than that of waste collection. Furthermore, it was detected that municipalities can reduce the resources used in rendering this service by 8 %. Finally, an estimation using the Mann–Whitney test allows us to conclude {{that there is no}} difference between the inefficiencies observed in municipalities managed directly by town councils and those which have been transferred to private companies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} the deeply entrenched stereotypical image which depicts early modern urban dwellers throwing rubbish and effluent {{directly out of}} their windows and doors into the streets below almost as is this was a normal and widely permissible waste disposal practice. This ‘chamber pot in the window’ myth has become almost synonymous with the early modern period itself in the current, popular, historical imagination, especially in relation to urban settlements. But the majority of urban inhabitants and their local governors alike valued clean outdoor public spaces. They had {{a vested interest in}} keeping the areas in which they lived and worked clean and they invested substantial time and energy into upholding their collective standards of acceptable cleanliness in the neighbourhoods, wards, towns and cities of which they were so proud. The small minority of householders who flouted sanitation bylaws by disposing of their waste problematically and by creating insanitary nuisances in public spaces encountered substantial resistance from their neighbours. Contemporaries were not afraid to approach the courts to complain about less fastidious neighbours, whose inadequate waste disposal arrangements and noxious trades threatened to undermine their daily life quality. While the contents of chamber pots were thrown from some early modern urban windows, this was by no means a normal, common or widespread practice, at least before 1700. The main task of this thesis is not to establish how clean early modern urban streets actually were, but rather to explore cultural attitudes towards outdoor salubrity and waste, both among local governors and urban inhabitants. The thesis focuses on Edinburgh and York in a comparative framework, shedding light on the complex relationship between how governors organised <b>street</b> <b>cleaning,</b> managed <b>waste</b> disposal and regulated the cleanliness of the outdoor environment, top-down, and how typical urban inhabitants self-regulated their neighbourhoods, bottom-up. The ways in which the respective cities' waste disposal and sanitation systems and processes were undermined, adapted and improved over time, as inner Edinburgh’s population swelled while York’s remained relatively stagnant, are also analysed. While focusing on Edinburgh and York, the thesis also discusses the challenge of pre-modern urban waste disposal, in the context of both necessary urban agriculture and rudimentary technology, in a much broader context and with reference to several smaller towns in Scotland and northern England. The relationship between neighbourhood, urban and national politics is a recurring theme in the thesis and the relevant sub-topics of the urban-rural manure trade and Sir John Harrington’s water closet invention of 1596 are also analysed. The thesis is split into five chapters. The first is an introduction to the topic, to the cities of Edinburgh and York, to the existing historiography, to the modern-day misconceptions surrounding the topic and to the methodology. The second chapter explains the character of the environmental challenge in early modern urban Britain. The third chapter explains the legal, governmental and administrative context of environmental regulation in Edinburgh and York, respectively. The fourth chapter compares the management and provision of <b>street</b> <b>cleaning</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal in Edinburgh and York while the fifth compares how insanitary nuisances were regulated in the two cities. The conclusion relates the two case studies to the rest of early modern Britain, comparing them to several smaller urban settlements in lowland Scotland and northern England, as well as highlighting just how differently, and sometimes just how similarly, this area of urban government was managed in different urban settlements...|$|R

This paper will examine the limitations of <b>street</b> <b>cleaning,</b> and describe how it can be more effective. <b>Street</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{plays an important role in}} most public works departments as an aesthetic and safety control measure. <b>Street</b> <b>cleaning</b> is also important to reduce massive dirt and debris buildups present in the spring in the northern regions.

The process requires that street parking be temporarily removed from the stock of available parking spaces, which affects parking and travel decisions. When streets are cleaned as frequently as once or twice a week, as in dense urban com-munities such as New York City, Chicago, or San Francisco, it can become a hassle to residents and a contentious local issue.
