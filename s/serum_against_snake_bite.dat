Today, almost anyone of us would feel uncomfortable without an {{additional}} GPS, a mobile phone with Internet access, a medicine chest with at least aspirin, an antibiotic as well as a <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> <b>snake</b> <b>bite,</b> and a lot more to master the same situation as the backwoods contemporary of George Washington. Only a short time in the span of human history has passed since the glorious days of trapper life, and no one would seriously doubt that complexity of life has increased enormously since then. This essay is an attempt to combine messages from three sources: (i) a book on scientific innovation, society, and the future written by Helga Nowotny [1], (ii) an article on a model for the evolution of technology by Brian Arthur and Wolfgang Polak [2], and (iii) François Jacob’s concept evolution and tinkering [3] that has been recently revisited, for example, by Denis Duboule and Adam Wilkins [4]. Apart from a marvelous collection of many interesting details, Nowotny’s book draws an ambiguous image of the future that, with a little modification, could be cast into the following sentences: Scientists and science as a whole are driven by curi-osity, which is seen as an insatiable driving force leading to innovation.

In the 19 th century #Rauwolfia$ disappeared from the pharmacopoeias. The newly established "scientific medicine" started to clean its materia medica from "absurd" and "magical" elements. Victim to these activities was the #Rauwolfia$ as well. Its usefulness was not recognised due to the pathophysiological ignorance about hypertonia and ventricular tachycardia, today the most important indications for #Rauwolfia$-alcaloides.

40|$|Snake venom 5 ′-nucleotidase (5 ′NUC) plays a very {{important}} role in envenomation strategies; however, apart from its modulation of hemostatic functions, its other pharmacological effects are not yet well characterized. Several studies have used specific inhibitors of enzyme toxins as a biochemical or pharmacological tool to characterize or establish its mechanism of action. We report {{here for the first time}} vanillin mandelic acid (VMA), an analog of vanillin, to potentially, selectively, and specifically inhibit venom 5 ′NUC activity among other enzymes present in venoms. VMA is much more potent in inhibiting 5 ′NUC activity than vanillyl acid (VA). The experimental results obtained are in good agreement with the in silico molecular docking interaction data. Both VA and VMA are competitive inhibitors as evident by the inhibition-relieving effect upon increasing the substrate concentration. VMA also dose-dependently inhibited the anticoagulant effect in Naja naja venom. In this study, we report novel non-nucleoside specific inhibitors of snake venom 5 ′NUC and experimentally demonstrate their involvement in the anticoagulant activity of N. naja venom. Hence, we hypothesize that VMA can be used as a molecular tool to evaluate the role of 5 ′NUC in snake envenomation and to develop prototypes and lead compounds with potential therapeutic applications <b>against</b> <b>snake</b> <b>bites...</b>|$|R

Traditional medicines have been in use since time memorial and they offer better options as a source of new lead compounds as compared to synthetic designs and libraries. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity of TLC isolated phytocompounds from Zanthoxylum humile roots. Disc diffusion method was employed to determine antibacterial activity while micro-plate serial dilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentration of crude fractions. Anti-inflammatory activity was ascertained by the nitrite assay. The present study results reveals that Zanthoxylum humile roots consist of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity can be explained in terms of alkaloids, saponins, tannins and flavonoids present in the extracts. Zanthoxylum humile roots TLC isolates revealed significantly greater antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity as compared to standard drugs cotrimoxazole and indomethacin. Results of the present study authenticate the use of Zanthoxylum humile roots in primary health care needs. Presence of phytocompounds such as flavonoids, saponins, tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids and steroids supports its use as medication for diarrhea, hypertension, diabetes, coughs and flu and as antivenins <b>against</b> <b>snake</b> <b>bites.</b> The presence of various bioactive compounds makes Zanthoxylum humile a promising plant as a source of new therapeutics that may be the answer to the current microbial resistance...|$|R

The ethanolic extract of Crescentia cujete fruit at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg were screened for the antivenom activity by in-vivo and in-vitro neutralizing capacity of lethality and neutralization of haemorrhagic lesion. The fruit extract at dose levels of 200 and 400 mg/kg effectively inhibited Vipera russelli venom induced in-vitro lethality with 83. 33 % and 100 % survival rate against 2 LD 50 respectively. The survival rate remains 50 % and 83. 33 % with 200 and 400 mg/kg doses respectively against 3 LD 50. Whereas dose of 400 mg/kg significantly inhibit venom induced in-vivo lethality with 66 % and 50 % survival rate against 2 LD 50 and 3 LD 50 respectively. Haemorrhagic lesion was neutralizing at both dose levels with highly significant at 200 mg/kg dose.

Scientifically, using the secondary metabolites of plants to neutralize venom enzymes has an extra benefit of being based on traditional knowledge; also, the use of such metabolites for the treatment of patients with <b>snake</b> <b>bites</b> is cheaper and the treatment can be started sooner. Methods: All the available information on various secondary metabolites exhibiting venom neutralizing ability were collected via electronic search (using Google books, Pubmed, SciFinder, Scirus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) and articles of peer-reviewed journals. Results: Recent interest in different plant has focused on isolating and identifying of different phytoconstituents that exhibit Phospholipase A 2 activity and other venom enzyme neutralizing ability.

40|$|Background: <b>Snake</b> <b>bite</b> is a {{neglected}} {{public health problem}} {{in the world and}} one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in many areas, particularly in the rural tropics. It also poses substantial economic burdens on the <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> victims due to treatment related expenditure and loss of productivity. An accurate estimate of the risk of <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> is largely unknown for most countries in the developing world, especially South-East Asia. Methodology/Principal Findings: We undertook a national epidemiological survey to determine the annual incidence density of <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> among the rural Bangladeshi population. Information on frequency of <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> and individuals' length of stay in selected households over the preceding twelve months was rigorously collected from the respondents through an interviewer administered questionnaire. Point estimates and confidence intervals of the incidence density of <b>snake</b> <b>bite,</b> weighted and adjusted for the multi-stage cluster sampling design, were obtained. Out of 18, 857 study participants, over one year a total of 98 <b>snake</b> <b>bites,</b> including one death were reported in rural Bangladesh. The estimated incidence density of <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> is 623. 4 / 100, 000 person years (95 % C I 513. 4 - 789. 2 / 100, 000 person years). Biting occurs mostly when individuals are at work. The majority of the victims (71 %) receive <b>snake</b> <b>bites</b> to their lower extremities. Eighty-six percent of the victims received some form of management within two hours of <b>snake</b> <b>bite,</b> although only three percent of the victims went directly to either a medical doctor or a hospital. Conclusions/Significance: Incidence density of <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> in rural Bangladesh is substantially higher than previously estimated. This is likely due to better ascertainment of the incidence through a population based survey. Poor access to health services increases <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> related morbidity and mortality; therefore, effective public health actions are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Envenomation with {{poisonous}} snakes {{is associated}} with considerable morbidity and mortality. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of assessing anti-snake venom (ASV) use, early adverse reactions to ASV, premedication and clinical outcomes in <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> patients. Association of various risk factors (age, gender, dose of ASV, time gap between <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> and ASV administration, use of mechanical ventilation and type of <b>snake</b> <b>bite)</b> with mortality was also assessed. Settings and Design: This retrospective study was conducted at two Tertiary Care Teaching Hospitals. Subjects and Methods: The medical records of 176 patients of <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> with documented use of ASV were retrospectively analyzed to retrieve relevant data. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics was used to express results about ASV use, early adverse reactions to ASV, premedication and clinical outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to find out significant risk factors associated with mortality. Results: The main indication for ASV was vasculotoxic <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> (75 %) followed by neurotoxic <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> (16 %). Mean dose of ASV was 18. 63 ± 14. 52 vials. Prophylactic premedication with corticosteroids alone or in combination with antihistaminic was used in more than 70 % patients. Early adverse reactions to ASV were seen in 4 % patients. Neurotoxic <b>snake</b> <b>bite</b> was a significant risk factor associated with mortality in multivariate analysis.
