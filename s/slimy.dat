5|$|The spores are 8–12 by 6.5–9µm, broadly {{ellipsoid}} to ellipsoid, ornamented with warts and ridges that do {{not form}} a , prominences up to 0.8µm high, hyaline, and amyloid. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis—with the hyphae embedded in a <b>slimy</b> or gelatinized layer.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the <b>Slimy</b> Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is <b>slimy</b> when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E

Banev dislikes the mayor, a patron of local fascist thugs, and also the military who guard the <b>slimies.</b> Golem mentions that the genetic disease of <b>slimies</b> represents the future of humanity, a new genetic type of people, intellectually and morally superior to ordinary people.|$|R
50|$|Leiognathidae, the ponyfishes, {{slipmouths}} or <b>slimys</b> / <b>slimies,</b> are a {{small family}} of fishes in the order Perciformes. They inhabit marine and brackish waters in the Indian and West Pacific Oceans. They {{can be used in}} the preparation of bagoong.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic. Field guides typically recommended to remove the <b>slimy</b> cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. The mushrooms are common in the diet of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park.|$|E
5|$|Together with H.pustulatus, H.persoonii, H.mesotephrus and H.latitabundus, H.olivaceoalbus {{form the}} section Olivaceoumbrini within the genus Hygrophorus. The fungi {{of this section}} have greasy to <b>slimy</b> caps and stems. Their caps are darkish brown grey, olive or orange, and their stems are ed or {{somewhat}} distinctly ringed.|$|E
5|$|While growing, Azotobacter {{produces}} flat, <b>slimy,</b> paste-like colonies with {{a diameter}} of 5–10mm, which may form films in liquid nutrient media. The colonies can be dark-brown, green, or other colors, or may be colorless, depending on the species. The growth is favored at a temperature of 20–30°C.|$|E

5|$|H.olivaceoalbus shows {{similarities}} between other closely related fungi {{of the genus}} Hygrophorus, {{some of which have}} only minor differences in physical features. Examples include H.pustulatus, H.inocybiformis, H.tephroleucus or H.morrisii. In the field, H.olivaceoalbus is distinguished by a combination of features including the double velum, the dark streaks on the <b>slimy</b> cap, the ing of the stem, and growth under pines, as well as by microscopic characteristics. There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi.|$|E
5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but {{his lines}} are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, <b>slimy</b> sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius lignyotellus and L.lignyotus {{are similar}} to L.fallax, {{and they are all}} {{associated}} with Picea and Abies; examination of microscopic features cannot be used to distinguish between them. L.lignyotus is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk cap with a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and <b>slimy</b> cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E

5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is <b>slimy</b> to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{records of}} the place-name Sleaford are found in a charter of 852 as Slioford and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as Sliowaford. In the Domesday Book (1086), it is recorded as Eslaforde {{and in the early}} 13th century as Sliforde. In the 13th century Book of Fees the name appears as Lafford. The name is formed from the Old English words sliow and ford, which together mean 'ford over a muddy or <b>slimy</b> river'.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7.5–9 by 6.5–7.5µm, with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. Their surfaces are ornamented with warts and short ridges {{that do not}} form a reticulum (a network of raised net-like ridges on the surface), with ridges up to 1.0µm high. The spores are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid—they absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 42 by 9µm. The cap cuticle is a modified ixotrichoderm, meaning that the hyphae are embedded in a <b>slimy</b> or gelatinous layer.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a <b>slimy</b> purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a <b>slimy</b> acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises <b>slimy,</b> algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the five development {{stages of the}} rope human parasite. Rope parasites have been discovered {{as a result of}} cleansing enemas. Parasite adult stages live in human gastro-intestinal tract and are anaerobic. They move inside the body by releasing gas bubbles utilizing jet propulsion. Rope parasites look like a rope, and can be over a meter long. It takes tens of years for them to fully develop into mature species (fifth stage). The fourth stage looks similar, but the parasite is shorter and has softer <b>slimier</b> body. The third stage looks like branched jellyfish. The second stage is viscous snot, or mucus with visible gas bubbles that act as suction cups. The first stage is <b>slimier</b> mucus with fewer bubbles, which can reside almost anywhere in the body. Antihelminthic methods are also mentioned in the paper...|$|R

After that the number of militant in kafr Takharem reached 50 men, as a <b>slimier</b> movement to recruit in neighboring villages began to reach the total of 400 militants.|$|R
5|$|Lactarius blennius has a {{flattened}} convex cap that is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very <b>slimy</b> when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very <b>slimy,</b> and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the whole depth of the gills. The milk is white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E
5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a <b>slimy,</b> dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1853. The type collection {{was made by}} American botanist Henry William Ravenel in South Carolina. Joseph Ammirati and Howard Bigelow considered Cortinarius heliotropicus, described by Charles Horton Peck 1914, {{to be the same}} species as C.iodes after examining the holotype specimens of both. According to the nomenclatural databases MycoBank and Index Fungorum, however, Cortinarius iodes does not have any synonyms. If they are indeed the same species, the name C.iodes has priority. C.iodes is classified in the subgenus Myxacium, along with other Cortinarius species that have a <b>slimy</b> cap and stem.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} component of Ferengi cooking appears to be insects and other small invertebrates. Some, such as tube grubs and gree worms, are nearly always served alive (like the Klingon dish gagh), while others are served jellied or in a juice form. Unlike how humans are repulsed {{at the idea of}} eating Klingon gagh (live [...] "serpentine worms"), Quark has been observed eating gagh on several occasions, though commenting that he thinks it tastes bland and boring. Popular beverages include Eelwasser and Slug-O-Cola ("The <b>slimiest</b> drink in the galaxy"). The cuisine of the Ferengi has achieved little acceptance among other cultures, with a few notable exceptions. Ferengi invented the alcohol substitute synthehol, and the alcoholic drink [...] "black hole" [...] is popular among some non-Ferengi.|$|R
