The derivation explicitly shows that the Eulerian and Lagrangian <b>strain</b> <b>tensors</b> are two-point tensors, each a function of both the spatial and material coordinates. The Eulerian strain is a two-point tensor that transforms as a second rank tensor under transformation of spatial coordinates and transforms as a scalar under transformation of the material coordinates. The Lagrangian strain is a two-point tensor that transforms as scalar under transformation of spatial coordinates and transforms as a second rank tensor under transformation of the material coordinates. These transformation properties are needed when transforming the <b>strain</b> <b>tensors</b> from one frame of reference to another moving frame. 1 I. BACKGROUN...|$|R

2500|$|The {{basic stress}} {{analysis}} {{problem can be}} formulated by Euler's equations of motion for continuous bodies (which are consequences of Newton's laws for conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum) and the Euler-Cauchy stress principle, together with the appropriate constitutive equations.

2500|$|Whereas the Cauchy {{stress tensor}} [...] relates {{stresses}} {{in the current}} configuration, the deformation gradient and strain tensors are described by relating the motion to the reference configuration; thus not all tensors describing {{the state of the}} material are in either the reference or current configuration. Describing the stress, strain and deformation either in the reference or current configuration would make it easier to define constitutive models (for example, the Cauchy Stress tensor is variant to a pure rotation, while the deformation <b>strain</b> <b>tensor</b> is invariant; thus creating problems in defining a constitutive model that relates a varying tensor, in terms of an invariant one during pure rotation; as by definition constitutive models have to be invariant to pure rotations).

40|$|Local and nonlocal {{contributions}} to the total <b>strain</b> rate <b>tensor</b> {{at any point in}} a flow are formulated from an expansion of the vorticity field in a local spherical neighborhood of radius R centered on x.
