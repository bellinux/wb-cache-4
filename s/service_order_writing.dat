5000|$|On July 9, 2014, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department {{said that}} they believe the Cocos Fire was {{intentionally}} set by a 13-year-old juvenile. She had a hearing set in February 2015, and the trial was held in March 2015. On March 24, the then 14-year-old minor {{was found guilty of}} multiple counts of arson and one misdemeanor count of unlawfully allowing a fire to escape one's control. The judge concluded that she [...] "intentionally and maliciously" [...] set a fire in her Washingtonia Avenue backyard in San Marcos, and a blown ember from that Washingtonia Fire started the Cocos Fire. On May 27, the teenager was sentenced to 400 hours of community <b>service,</b> <b>ordered</b> to <b>write</b> letters to all the victims, and pay at least $40,000 in restitution. Additionally the teen was ordered to enroll in a rehabilitation program known as Breaking Cycles 365, the goal of which is to prevent juveniles from becoming repeat offenders.|$|R
50|$|His {{interest}} in Alaska Natives {{brought him into}} close contact with the American Museum of Natural History, which purchased his first two collections of Alaska Native artifacts in the 1890s. Emmons had an exchange of items with the Museum {{for the next three}} decades. (In 1902, the Field Museum of Natural History purchased a large and varied collection of more than 1,900 Tlingit objects.) F. W. Putnam, curator of the American Natural History Museum, asked for his help on a report in 1896 and repeated the request to the Navy the following year. So Emmons was officially detached from active <b>service</b> and <b>ordered</b> to <b>write</b> the Ethnological Report on the Native Tribes of Southeast Alaska, elaborated from the museum collections. He became a regular contributor to The American Museum Journal (forerunner of Natural History journal) and other scholarly periodicals.|$|R
2500|$|This raid, {{known as}} Operation Archery, {{took place over}} the course of 26–28 December 1941 and {{consisted}} of a diversionary raid on the Lofoten Islands, followed by an attack on the port of Vaagso and the island of Maaloy by a combined naval and commando force. The Commandos, drawn mainly from No. 3 Commando as well as elements from No. 2, 4 and 6, with Durnford-Slater in tactical command of the raiders ashore around Vaagso, reporting directly to Brigadier Joseph (Charles) Haydon who had overall operational command of the ground forces for the operation. The raid proved to be a success, and for his part Durnford-Slater later received the Distinguished <b>Service</b> <b>Order.</b> The recommendation, <b>written</b> by Haydon, credits Durnford-Slater's [...] "personal courage, complete coolness & quick grasp of the situation" [...] with inspiring the confidence of the men and ensuring all objectives were achieved. [...] It further describes how, when the attack was in danger of stalling, after the leading troops [...] "lost five out of six officers, & nearly 40% of their effective [...] " [...] he took personal command to restore the situation, and under heavy fire had both his orderlies wounded beside him.|$|R

On 7 December it relieved a British battalion {{in the quiet}} [...] "nursery" [...] sector of the Western Front around Armentières. Morshead was mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Distinguished <b>Service</b> <b>Order.</b> His citation, <b>written</b> by his division commander, Major General John Monash, read: This officer has displayed conspicuous ability in administration and organisation of his battalion, which has attained a high standard of fighting efficiency. His energetic attention to the training of his officers and men prior to embarkation {{was responsible for the}} smoothness and despatch with which his battalion relieved a British battalion in the line a few days after arriving at the front. Since the battalion has taken its place in the line it has proved itself to be an efficient fighting unit due to this officer's personality and marked capacity for command. He organised and controlled two raids on the enemy's trenches and carried them out successfully. His courage and strong personality has created an excellent spirit in all ranks of the battalion. This officer previously served at Gallipoli.|$|R

40|$|Western {{scholars}} consider community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> as {{the best}} alternative to rehabilitate offenders. However, Muslim jurists never debated the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> {{as a form of}} punishment in the Islamic judicial system. Accordingly, this article seeks to analyze the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> in the context of Islamic law by making a comparison between the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> as debated by Western scholars with the concept of ta`zir punishment by their Muslim counterpart. This aspect is analysed as an alternative concept of punishment, the discretionary power of judges, theory, or concept of the fundamental goals of punishment and penance. The research discovers that there are many similarities between the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> with the concept of punishment in Islamic ta`zir. This research is significant as it potrays that the implementation of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> practised today is a sentence that is consistent with Islamic law...|$|R

40|$|Physician-operated {{order entry}} systems can bring great {{benefits}} to an institution. Such systems {{can improve the}} consistency, accuracy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of orders. When building or selecting order entry for an institution, consideration {{must be given to}} the many different scenarios in which <b>orders</b> are <b>written</b> and communicated. Transfer, post-op, pre-admission and discharge orders have different communication requirements from standard inpatient <b>orders.</b> In certain <b>services,</b> <b>orders</b> from a very limited set (such as warfarin <b>orders)</b> must be <b>written</b> frequently for a large number of patients. Intensive-care patients, chemotherapy patients, and others have particular requirements for ordering. A computerized order entry system should respond to these requirements in order to promote correct and efficient ordering. We present a number of these issues, their specific requirements, and the approach we have taken to ensure that the system both supports and enhances workflow...|$|R
