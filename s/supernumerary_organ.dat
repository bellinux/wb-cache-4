40|$|Arabidopsis era 1 was {{identified}} as an abscisic acid–hypersensitive mutant caused by disruptions or deletions of the gene for the � subunit (AtFTB) of farnesyltransferase (FTase). The heterodimeric enzyme catalyzes the covalent attachment of the 15 -carbon farnesyl diphosphate to the C terminus of regulatory proteins and is essential for growth in yeast. The first disruption of FTB in a multicellular context revealed several developmental and growth regulatory processes that require the function of FTase. The lack of FTase activity in the Arabidopsis era 1 - 2 FTB deletion mutant resulted in enlarged meristems and <b>organs,</b> <b>supernumerary</b> <b>organs</b> in floral whorls, arrested development of axillary meristems, late flowering, and homeotic transformations of flowers. Complementation of era 1 - 2 with LeFTB, the tomato gene for the � subunit of FTase, restored a normal phenotype and confirmed that the lesion is in AtFTB alone. The effect of this lesion on control of meristem size and on developmental processes suggests the involvement of regulatory proteins that require farnesylation for their function. At least three distinct processes that require the function of FTase were identified: regulation of cellular differentiation in the meristems, meristem maintenance, and regulation of flower development. Together, these results {{provide a basis for}} future studies on the involvement of FTase in specific developmental processes and for structure–function analysis of FTase in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Neurons and glial cells {{depend on}} similar {{developmental}} pathways and often originate from common precursors; however, the differentiation {{of one or}} the other cell type depends on the activation of cell-specific pathways. In Drosophila, the differentiation of glial cells depends on a transcription factor, Glide/Gcm. This glial-promoting factor is both necessary and sufficient to induce the central and peripheral glial fates {{at the expense of the}} neuronal fate. In a screen for mutations affecting the adult peripheral nervous system, we have found a dominant mutation inducing <b>supernumerary</b> sensory <b>organs.</b> Surprisingly, this mutation is allelic to glide/gcm and induces precocious glide/gcm expression, which, in turn, activates the proneural genes. As a consequence, sensory organs are induced. Thus, temporal misregulation of the Glide/Gcm glial-promoting factor reveals a novel potential for this cell fate determinant. At the molecular level, this implies unpredicted features of the glide/gcm pathway. These findings also emphasize the requirement for both spatial and temporal glide/gcm regulation to achieve proper cell specification within the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{isolated}} a novel {{class of}} gain-of-function mutations at theBearded(Brd) locus which specifically affect {{the development of}} adult sensory organs inDrosophila. TheseBrdalleles cause bristle multiplication and bristle loss phenotypes resembling those described for the neurogenic genesNotch(N) andDelta(Dl). We have found that <b>supernumerary</b> sensory <b>organ</b> precursor (SOP) cells develop in the proneural clusters ofBrdmutant imaginal discs; like normal SOPs, these are dependent on {{the function of the}} proneural genesachaeteandscute,and express elevated levels of ac protein. At cuticular positions exhibiting theBrdbristle loss phenotype, we have found that the progeny of the multiplied SOPs develop aberrantly, in that neurons and thecogen (sheath) cells appear but not trichogen (shaft) and tormogen (socket) cells. This appears to represent a transformation of the pIIa secondary precursor cell within the SOP lineage to a pIIb secondary precursor cell fate. These results suggest thatBrdgain-of-function alleles interfere withNotchpathway-dependent cell–cell interactions at two distinct stages of adult sensory organ development. We have also identified enhancers and suppressors of theBrddominant phenotypes; these include both previously characterized mutations and alleles of apparently novel loci. Finally, we have found thatBrdnull mutants are viable and exhibit no mutant phenotypes, suggesting thatBrdmay be a component of an overlapping function...|$|R
40|$|The BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BCP) {{family is}} a poorly {{characterized}} plant transcription factor family of GAGA BINDING PROTEINS. In Arabidopsis, there are seven members (BPC 1 – 7) that are broadly expressed, and they can potentially bind more than 3000 Arabidopsis GAGA-repeat-containing genes. To date, BPCs {{are known to be}} direct regulators of the INNER NO OUTER (INO), SEEDSTICK (STK), and LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC 2) genes. Because of the high functional redundancy, neither single knockout nor double bpc mutant combinations cause aberrant phenotypes. The bpc 1 - 2 bpc 2 bpc 3 triple mutant shows several pleiotropic developmental defects, including enlargement of the inflorescence meristem and flowers with <b>supernumerary</b> floral <b>organs.</b> Here, we demonstrated through expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that this phenotype is probably due to deregulation of the expres-sion of the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and BREVIPEDICELLUS/KNAT 1 (BP) genes, which are both direct targets of BPCs. Moreover, we assigned a role to BPCs in the fine regulation of the cytokinin content in the meristem, as both ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE 7 (IPT 7) and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (ARR 7) genes were shown to be overexpressed in the bpc 1 - 2 bpc 2 bpc 3 triple mutant...|$|R
40|$|Higher plants {{maintain}} {{continuous development}} throughout their life by closely regulating {{the process of}} cell differentiation (Clark, 2001; Sablowski, 2007). In plants, the balance between undifferentiated and differentiated cell fate is managed within a stem cell niche termed the meristem. Cell differentiation in the meristem is in part controlled by genetic mechanisms. For example, mutations in CLAVATA (CLV) genes {{increase the number of}} undifferentiated cells within shoot and floral meristems leading to <b>supernumerary</b> <b>organs</b> (Clark, 2001). In contrast, mutations in genes of the homeodomain transcription factors WUSCHEL (WUS) and SHOOT-MERISTEMLESS (STM) lead to the absence of the shoot or floral meristem or its early termination through differentiation (Laux et al., 1996; Long et al., 1996). Cell differentiation in the meristem is also controlled by hormonal cues, which interfaces with gene function. For example, cytokinin treatment leads to phenotypes resembling clv mutants (Lindsay et al., 2006). Furthermore, exogenous cytokinin treatment has been shown to rescue the stm mutant phenotype and WUS protein has been shown to repress transcription of genes that act in the negative feedback pathway of cytokinin signaling (Leibfried et al., 2005; Yanai et al., 2005). The plant hormone auxin also plays a role in regulating differentiation. Auxin is thought to stimulate the initiation, development and differentiation of cells specified into organs (Teale et al., 2006). Disruption of auxin transport leads to a reduction in organ initiation and differentiation (Okada et al., 1991). In this thesis we investigate spatially regulated signaling and action of auxin and cytokinin which regulate patterning of gene expression and cell differentiation. To this end, we employed two model systems of shoot meristem initiation and development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana: shoot and floral meristem development and de novo shoot meristem initiation from tissue culture. Based on characterization of hormone signaling and patterning of gene expression during de novo shoot meristem initiation from tissue culture we propose a novel Turing-like model by which auxin and cytokinin interact to regulate patterning of cell differentiation. In this model, the activity of auxin, the activator of cell differentiation, is regulated by cytokinin, an inhibitor of cell differentiation. Computational models of these interactions lead to self organizing patterning of hormone response and cell differentiation as observed in experiments. In our second investigation, we show that cytokinin signaling regulates the spatial patterning of the homeodomain transcription factor WUS within the shoot meristem. We demonstrate that WUS misregulation after cytokinin treatment is mediated by both CLAVATA-dependent and independent mechanisms leading to multiple feedback loops. We reveal the presence of a cytokinin perception and signaling gradient within the shoot meristem, which spatially influences size and position of the WUS domain. Finally, we have begun to identify the molecular components required for cytokinin activation of WUS expression. Of the three characterized cytokinin receptors, only Arabidopsis Histidine Kinase 2 (AHK 2) is required for WUS induction in the presence of cytokinin. In contrast, the AHK 3 receptor is required for negative feedback on cytokinin signaling and thus WUS. These data reveal an unappreciated specificity in cytokinin signaling in regulating downstream targets which may be important for eliciting different cell behaviors depending on the threshold of signaling and the ratio of the three cytokinin receptors within a given cell. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{prenylation}} is {{a common}} post-translational modification in metazoans, protozoans, fungi, and plants. This modification, which mediates protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions, {{is characterized by the}} covalent attachment of a fifteen-carbon farnesyl or twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine residue of a carboxyl terminal CaaX motif. In Arabidopsis, era 1 mutants lacking protein farnesyltransferase exhibit enlarged meristems, <b>supernumerary</b> floral <b>organs,</b> an enhanced response to abscisic acid (ABA), and drought tolerance. In contrast, ggb mutants lacking protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 exhibit subtle changes in ABA and auxin responsiveness, but develop normally. Results We have expressed recombinant Arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 (PGGT 1) in E. coli and characterized purified enzymes with respect to kinetic constants and substrate specificities. Our results indicate that, whereas PFT exhibits little specificity for the terminal amino acid of the CaaX motif, PGGT 1 exclusively prenylates CaaX proteins with a leucine in the terminal position. Moreover, we found that different substrates exhibit similar K m but different k cat values in the presence of PFT and PGGT 1, indicating that substrate specificities are determined primarily by reactivity rather than binding affinity. Conclusions The data presented here potentially explain the relatively strong phenotype of era 1 mutants and weak phenotype of ggb mutants. Specifically, the substrate specificities of PFT and PGGT 1 suggest that PFT can compensate for loss of PGGT 1 in ggb mutants more effectively than PGGT 1 can compensate for loss of PFT in era 1 mutants. Moreover, our results indicate that PFT and PGGT 1 substrate specificities are primarily due to differences in catalysis, rather than differences in substrate binding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{large-scale}} {{clonal propagation}} of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is being stalled by {{the occurrence of}} the mantled somaclonal variation. Indeed, this abnormality which presents a homeotic-like conversion of male floral organs into carpelloid structures, hampers oil production since the <b>supernumerary</b> female <b>organs</b> are either sterile or produce fruits with poor oil yields. Scope In the last 15 years, the prevailing {{point of view on}} the origin of the mantled floral phenotype has evolved from a random mutation event triggered by in vitro culture to a hormone-dependent dysfunction of gene regulation processes. In this review, we retrace the history of the research on the mantled variation {{in the light of the}} parallel advances made in the understanding of plant development regulation in model systems and more specifically in the role of epigenetic mechanisms. An overview of the current state of oil palm genomic and transcriptomic resources, which are key to any comparison with model organisms, is given. We show that, while displaying original characteristics, the mantled phenotype of oil palm is morphologically, and possibly molecularly, related to MADS-box genes mutants described in model plants. We also discuss the occurrence of comparable floral phenotypes in other palm species. Conclusions Beyond its primary interest in the search for discriminating markers against an economically crippling phenotype, the study of the mantled abnormality also provides a unique opportunity to investigate the regulation of reproductive development in a perennial tropical palm. On the basis of recent results, we propose that future efforts should concentrate on the epigenetic regulation targeting MADS-box genes and transposable elements of oil palm, since both types of sequences are most likely to be involved in the mantled variant phenotype.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{is divided}} into an introduction and three different chapters. Its general organization is intended to facilitate future publications, and therefore Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are hereby reported in journal-like style and should lay the basis for independent papers to be submitted to international peer-reviewed journals as first author. On the contrary, {{the aim of this}} introduction is to focus and resume the work performed during my Ph. D. Thesis and discussed below. It starts with a description of the originally planned research project (partly covered by Chapter 1), analyzes technical problems that forced me to deviate from it, and introduces the subsequent Chapters 2 and 3. Finally, Chapter 4 resumes papers and short communications published or in press (first page only, due to copyright) during this Ph. D. programme. One of the unsolved problems in evolutionary biology is which mutations generate evolutionarily relevant phenotypic variation. Understanding what kinds of molecular changes they entail, and what are the phenotypic magnitudes and frequencies of origin, may provide important insights into evolutionary processes (adaptive evolution, balancing selection, deleterious variation and genetic drift) that influence phenotypic variation within and among population and eventually lead to speciation processes. The marine tunicate Ciona intestinalis sp. A constitutes an excellent organism for linking genomics and developmental biology. A growing interest in population biology of C. intestinalis, prompted by the paucity of laboratory lines and the ease of sampling, has recently undermined extreme levels of heterozygosity and high rates of recessive mutations (13 - 20 % wild individuals are heterozygote carriers of recessive mutations in developmental genes). When brought to homozygosity, these naturally occurring mutations often carry phenotypes that are similar to hypothesized evolutionary transitions among ascidian families and orders, such as reduction or absence of the tadpole larval tail (e. g. genus Molgula), proximal exhalent siphon (e. g. genus Ascidia) and absence of, or <b>supernumerary,</b> larval sensory <b>organs</b> (e. g. genus Pycnoclavella). So far, results obtained in forward genetics of ascidians were mostly obtained from casual and random samplings, with no efforts in developing specific methods, such as for culturing and cryopreservation, and yet poor knowledge of several species-specific traits in the field on the other side, such as taxonomic status, demographic and reproductive dynamics. Therefore, these gaps need to be filled for optimal project design. The original aim of the present Ph. D. project was to investigate the developmental processes and genetic configurations of specific phylomimicking mutations occurring within natural populations of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis sp. A by carrying out a naturally occurring mutation study. However, due to problems of technical and biological nature, I extended it as described below. The first step was successfully achieved, and is partially explained in Chapter 1. This discusses the state-of-the-art of forward genetics in tunicates and review findings of research on naturally occurring mutants. In addition, it first reports the development and establishment of a comprehensive protocol for the study of genetic polymorphism in wild populations of Ciona intestinalis sp. A that includes newly developed procedures for sperm cryopreservation, culturing and screening, as well as the possibility of identifying subtle mutations by means of a multiple whole mount in situ hybridization with an automated system. I also show that the ecology and biology of natural populations at species-specific level holds traits that are relevant to correct project organization and conduction. Altogether, the effort hereby conduced lays the foundations for the identification of naturally occurring mutations in ascidian taxa, and may constitute an additional value when considering new marine model species for forward genetics purposes. However, after an initial survey of heterozygote carriers of developmental genes and the molecular characterization of the identified mutant larvae by ISH (in situ hybridization) and FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), unexpected cryobanking problems resulted in the loss of the mutants cryopreserved. This, together with field disappearance of the species, forced me to deviate from the project. Therefore, since I had originally planned to acquire knowledge at gene and species level, I have spent the remaining part of my PhD working on two conceptually linked projects. One is concerned with an evolutionary developmental study of a specific gene in chordate evolution (Chapter 2). This chapter therefore consists of an EVO-DEVO study analyzing the Magoh (Mago Nashi) gene. In particular, starting by unpublished ISH and IHC data available in the laboratory on the tunicate species Ciona intestinalis sp. A, I re-organized previous data, performed an in situ hybridization study in the phylogenetically related species Branchiostoma lanceolatum (Pallas, 1774) and analyzed sequence conservation, gene duplication and synteny in Chordates. Here I show that, despite its long history, Magoh has become part of a conserved syntenic group only in vertebrates. Genetic and genomic analyses indicate that Magoh appears to have duplicated in the mammalian lineage. Whole mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrate that, similar to all other bilaterians, Magoh is regionally expressed in mesodermal and endodermal progenitor cells and tissues of the amphioxus B. lanceolatum and the tunicate C. intestinalis sp. A embryos. Further, ascidian Magoh protein undergoes early subcellular restriction and perinuclear localization in the fertilized egg, like in insects. Most importantly, Magoh is expressed in the brain of cephalochordate and ascidian larvae, where the protein accumulates in neurogenic and axonal structures. Thus, these data suggest that Magoh recruitment in neural cells is an innovation already present in the last common ancestor of Chordates. Finally, I performed a multidisciplinary study concerning the identity of the molluscan gastropod Bursa scrobilator (Linné, 1758) by using independent (molecular and morphological) species concepts (Chapter 3). This species forms established populations in the Atlantic Ocean (mainly in the Azores and Canarians), but is only known from the Mediterranean area from single isolated specimens, therefore being heralded as one of the rarest inhabitants of the Mediterranean molluscan fauna. I explored the taxonomic identity and the intraspecific variability of the species by using a combination of morphological, anatomical and molecular analyses on specimens from the entire distributional range, as to test a possible speciation pattern in the Mediterranean Sea. No difference was observed when analyzing protoconch, teleoconch and anatomy. Conversely, radulae are highly variable in shape both between and within individuals. Sequence analysis of COI and 16 S shows the absence of significant differentiation among sites of occurrence, as expected for a species with teleplanic larvae. In addition, the broad dispersal potential in the investigated family, as well as the absence of a genetic structure, would suggest that B. scrobilator does not constitute a resident species of the Mediterranean fauna, but that its Mediterranean presence may be consistent with a repetitive natural dispersal of single veliger through the Gibraltar Strait, therefore calling for a numerical re-assessment of resident Mediterranean biodiversity by molecular means...|$|R
