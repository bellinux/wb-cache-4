25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel <b>spray</b> <b>pump</b> at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases. The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.|$|E

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{model of the}} containment building sumps for the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant was constructed at a scale of 1 : 2. 26. Decay heat removal pumps and reactor building <b>spray</b> <b>pumps</b> withdraw water from the sumps after a postulated {{loss of coolant accident}} for re-injection into the core and building. To assure acceptable operation of the pumps, the model was tested {{for a wide range of}} possible approach flow distribu tions, grating and coarse screen blockage schemes, and fine screen blockage schemes. The tests were designed to assure that no air en training vortices were formed, head. losses across the screens and in the inlet were acceptable, and swirl in the pump suction pipes was accept able. No coherent swirl or vortex activity was noted on the water surface during the testing which included various water levels and prototype velocity tests. Test results indicated that the maximum swirl angle in the suction inlet was 11 degrees, while average swirl angle was about 3 degrees. Loss measurements indicated an average inlet loss of 0. 5 ft, including screen losses for the worst case of 50 percent blockage. TABLE OF CONTENT...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the flooding, units 1, 2 and 4 were at full power, while unit 3 {{was shut}} down for refuelling. Starting from 7:30 pm all four units lost their 225 kV power supplies, while units 2 and 4 also lost their 400 kV power supplies. The {{isolator}} circuits that should have allowed units 2 and 4 to supply themselves with electricity also failed, causing these two reactors to automatically shut down, and diesel backup generators started up, maintaining power to plants 2 and 4 until the 400 kV supply was restored at around 10:20 pm. In the pumping room for unit 1, one set of the two pairs of pumps in the Essential Service Water System failed due to flooding; had both sets failed then the safety of plant would have been endangered. In both units 1 and 2, flooding in the fuel rooms put the low-head safety injection pumps and the containment <b>spray</b> <b>pumps,</b> part of the Emergency Core Cooling System (a back-up system in case of coolant loss) out of use.

30|$|During the outbreak, the {{quarantine}} was not executed properly as pastoralists could still move their animals from one village to another {{to search for}} pastures. Also farmers were still selling animals to nearby country (Kenya) via unauthorized routes. The movement of animals from Tanzania to Kenya either for search of good pasture or for sale has been reported (Diallo et al. 2000) to facilitate further {{spread of the disease}} to unaffected areas during the 2006 – 07 RVF outbreak. It was observed that good pastures were found in the low land areas where mosquitoes were also found in large numbers and facilitated the disease transmission. However, the short difference in time of occurrence of disease in different regions of Tanzania is an indication that, those foci of outbreaks were caused by other factors other than animal movement as it was also highlighted by (FAO 2000). The results also indicated that few farmers used dipping tanks and the majority used <b>spray</b> <b>pumps</b> to control vector borne diseases. Since some of the farmers owned large number of animals, {{it was not possible to}} effectively spray all of them. According to (Peter et al. 2005) and (Davies and Martin 2006) effective use of dipping tanks also reduces the magnitude of mosquito borne diseases like RFV.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is {{a common}} chronic disease of the upper airways and has {{considerable}} impact on quality of life. Topical delivery of drugs to the paranasal sinuses is challenging, therefore the rate of surgery is high. This study investigates the delivery efficiency of a pulsating aerosol in comparison to a nasal <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> to the sinuses and the nose in healthy volunteers and in CRS patients before and after sinus surgery. METHODS: (99 m) Tc-DTPA pulsating aerosols were applied in eleven CRSsNP patients without nasal polyps before and after sinus surgery. In addition, pulsating aerosols were studied in comparison to nasal <b>pump</b> <b>sprays</b> in eleven healthy volunteers. Total nasal and frontal, maxillary and sphenoidal sinus aerosol deposition and lung penetration were assessed by anterior and lateral planar gamma camera imaging. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers nasal <b>pump</b> <b>sprays</b> resulted in 100 % nasal, non-significant sinus and lung deposition, while pulsating aerosols resulted 61. 3 +/- 8. 6 % nasal deposition and 38. 7 % exit the other nostril. 9. 7 +/- 2. 0 % of the nasal dose penetrated into maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses. In CRS patients, total nasal deposition was 56. 7 +/- 13. 3 % and 46. 7 +/- 12. 7 % before and after sinus surgery, respectively (p< 0. 01). Accordingly, maxillary and sphenoidal sinus deposition was 4. 8 +/- 2. 2 % and 8. 2 +/- 3. 8 % of the nasal dose (p< 0. 01). Neither in healthy volunteers nor in CRS patients there was significant dose in the frontal sinuses. CONCLUSION: In contrast to nasal <b>pump</b> <b>sprays,</b> pulsating aerosols can deliver significant doses into posterior nasal spaces and paranasal sinuses, providing alternative therapy options before and after sinus surgery. Patients with chronic lung diseases based on clearance dysfunction may also benefit from pulsating aerosols, since these diseases also manifest in the upper airways...|$|R
40|$|To {{minimize}} the total energy consumption of a cooling tower-assisted heat pump (CTAHP) system in cooling mode, a model-based control strategy with hybrid optimization algorithm {{for the system}} is presented in this paper. An existing experimental device, which mainly contains a closed wet cooling tower with counter flow construction, a condenser water loop and a water-to-water heat pump unit, is selected as the study object. Theoretical and empirical models of the related components and their interactions are developed. The four variables, viz. desired cooling load, ambient wet-bulb temperature, temperature and flow rate of chilled water at the inlet of evaporator, are set to independent variables. The system power consumption can be minimized by optimizing input powers of cooling tower fan, <b>spray</b> water <b>pump,</b> condenser water pump and compressor. The optimal input power of <b>spray</b> water <b>pump</b> is determined experimentally. Implemented on MATLAB, a hybrid optimization algorithm, which combines the Limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm with the greedy diffusion search (GDS) algorithm, is incorporated to solve the minimization problem of energy consumption and predict the system’s optimal set-points under quasi-steady-state conditions. The integrated simulation tool is validated against experimental data. The results obtained demonstrate the proposed operation strategy is reliable, and can save energy by 20. 8 % as compared to an uncontrolled system under certain testing conditions...|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Nasal delivery is the logical choice for topical treatment of local diseases {{in the nose}} and paranasal sinuses such as allergic and non-allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. The nose is also considered an attractive route for needle-free vaccination and for systemic drug delivery, especially when rapid absorption and effect are desired. In addition, nasal delivery may help address issues related to poor bioavail-ability, slow absorption, drug degradation, and adverse events in the gastrointestinal tract and avoids the first-pass metabolism in the liver. However, when considering nasal delivery devices and mechanisms, {{it is important to}} keep in mind that the prime purpose of the nasal airway is to protect the delicate lungs from hazardous exposures, not to serve as a delivery route for drugs and vaccines. The narrow nasal valve and the complex convoluted nasal geometry with its dynamic cyclic physiological changes provide efficient fil-tration and conditioning of the inspired air, enhance olfac-tion, and optimize gas exchange and fluid retention during exhalation. However, the potential hurdles these functional features impose on efficient nasal drug delivery are often ignored. With this background, the advantages and limita-tions of existing and emerging nasal delivery devices and dispersion technologies are reviewed with focus on their clinical performance. The role and limitations of the in vitro testing in the FDA guidance for nasal <b>spray</b> <b>pumps</b> and pressurized aerosols (pressurized metered-dose inhalers) with local action are discussed. Moreover, the predictive value and clinical utility of nasal cast studies and computer simulations of nasal airflow and deposition with computer fluid dynamics software are briefly discussed.
