5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Ontario, Canada, with Toronto and its {{surrounding}} suburbs being a <b>stand-in</b> for Raccoon City. It was originally feared that production would be shut down due to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|About 40 {{years after}} the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in {{the reign of the}} fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the <b>stand-in</b> Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this {{familiar}} predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him {{to take control of the}} island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the Allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's <b>stand-in,</b> general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. Bertram had thus succeeded in all its objectives. Announcing the victory at El Alamein in the House of Commons, Winston Churchill praised the camouflage operation.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Osborn retires his costumed persona {{and uses}} a <b>stand-in</b> {{so as not to}} be {{suspected}} of being the Green Goblin. This fifth Green Goblin kidnaps Norman's grandson and clashes with a wanted and injured Spider-Man. Norman also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley and initiates a hostile takeover of the latter's corporate empire, in retaliation for raiding the Goblin's arsenal and identity.|$|E
5|$|Rain {{prevented}} {{play after}} 3pm {{on the second}} day. No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197, with the four Australian bowlers, Lindwall, Miller, Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets. The Australians' 215/3 {{was based on an}} aggressive 84 from Miller, with five sixes and seven fours, and a partnership of 126 with <b>stand-in</b> Hassett, who was 71 not out when the rain came. The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's <b>stand-in,</b> general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using <b>stand-in</b> actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E
5|$|At Paramount, {{the crew}} filmed all the scenes {{that would take}} place on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a <b>stand-in</b> set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E

5|$|Despite this form, his Test {{campaign}} started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He {{then broke}} {{down with a}} back injury in a match against Kent and looked unlikely to play. With Benaud already sidelined with a shoulder injury, Australia looked severely weakened without their two main bowlers. Despite again complaining about frailties of his body, Davidson vowed to play and produce a special performance for friend and <b>stand-in</b> captain Neil Harvey in the Second Test at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|During a gig with a <b>stand-in</b> drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been {{drumming}} in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E
5|$|Fey's {{performance}} on the show was inspired by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and later used Louis-Dreyfus to play the <b>stand-in</b> for the character of Liz Lemon in flashback scenes during the live episode of the fifth season. After receiving 13 Emmy Award nominations and two wins for the final season, 30 Rock ended its critically acclaimed run with 112 Emmy award nominations.

5|$|Filming in Cleveland {{began on}} May 17 and was {{scheduled}} to last until mid-June with locations scheduled on the West Shoreway, the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant in Cuyahoga Heights and the Lakeview Cemetery Dam. Cleveland was chosen as a <b>stand-in</b> for Washington, D.C, with the city's East 6th Street doubling as 7th and D Streets in Southwest D.C. Other locations in Cleveland included the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Cleveland Public Library, Cleveland State University, the Cleveland Arcade, Tower City Center, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Western Reserve Historical Society. Interior shots were also filmed inside private homes and the Pilgrim Congregational Church in Tremont. Filming in Cleveland concluded on June 27, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{disappointed}} by the new contract offered to him by Tamworth, Smith agreed on 25 May 2010 to join fellow Conference Premier team Mansfield Town on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green on 14 August 2010, {{the opening day of}} 2010–11, and his first goal came from a close range header as Mansfield beat Eastbourne Borough 4–0 at home on 25 September. He was Mansfield's <b>stand-in</b> captain for a 1–1 away draw with Gateshead on 2 October 2010. However, after Mansfield signed defenders Rhys Day and Simon Grand, Smith became surplus to requirements and was made available on loan.|$|E
5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted {{better than}} in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and <b>stand-in</b> gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, with nobody taking more than four.|$|E
