40|$|Purpose – Artificial {{neural network}} (ANN) {{has been used}} for risk {{analysis}} in various applications such as engineering, financial and facilities management. However, use of a single network has become less accurate when the problem is complex with a large number of variables to be considered. Ensemble neural network (ENN) architecture has proposed to overcome these difficulties of solving a complex problem. ENN consists of many small “expert networks” that learn small parts of the complex problem, which are established by decomposing it into its <b>sub</b> <b>levels.</b> This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – ENN model was developed to analyze risks in maintainability of buildings which is known as a complex problem with a large number of risk variables. The model comprised four expert networks to represent building components of roof, façade, internal areas and basement. The accuracy of the model was tested using two error terms such as network error and generalization error. Findings – The results showed that ENN performed well in solving complex problems by decomposing the problem into its <b>sub</b> <b>levels.</b> Originality/value – The application of ensemble network would create a new concept of analyzing complex risk analysis problems. The study also provides a useful tool for designers, clients, facilities managers/maintenance managers and users to analyze maintainability risks of buildings at early stages...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} {{that take place}} in the excited states of a trivalent Thulium (Tm) ion in an Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG) crystal, being relevant to the use of this system for laser applications, have been the object of several studies. We have reexamined this system focusing our attention on the dynamics of Tm following its excitation in the H- 3 (<b>sub</b> 4) <b>level.</b> Under these conditions the system relaxes through a cross-relaxation process. H- 3 (sub 4) yields F- 3 (sub 4), H- 3 (sub 6) yields F- 3 (sub 4), whose rate depends upon both the concentration of the Tm ion and the temperature of the crystal. The excitation spectrum obtained by monitoring the 1. 8 micron emission of Tm (due to the F- 3 (sub 4) yields H- 3 (sub 6) transition) indicates an increase in the contribution to this emission from the H- 3 (<b>sub</b> 4) <b>level</b> relative to the H- 3 (<b>sub</b> 5) <b>level</b> as the Tm concentration increases; this shows the increased role played by the H- 3 (<b>sub</b> 4) <b>level</b> in pumping the infrared emission. Correspondingly, the duration of the luminescence originating in the H- 3 (<b>sub</b> 4) <b>level</b> is shortened as the concentration of Tm increases. The concentration quenching of this lifetime can be fit to a model which assumes that the cross-relaxation is due to a dipole-dipole interaction; from this fit, the intrinsic Tm lifetime in the absence of cross relaxation can be derived. We have used this lifetime to calculate the rate of the cross-relaxation process. We have evaluated this rate {{as a function of the}} temperature and found it to be fastest at 77 K. We have also calculated the microscopic interaction parameters for the cross-relaxation process by using two independent experimental features: (1) the time evolution of the emission from the H- 3 (sub 4) level; and (2) the spectral overlap between the H- 3 (sub 4) yields F- 3 (sub 4) emission and the H- 3 (sub 6) yields F- 3 (sub 4) absorption. We have also considered the migration of excitation among the Tm ions in the F- 3 (<b>sub</b> 4) <b>level</b> and calculated the relevant microparameter by the use of the relevant spectral overlap. The data are consistent with the model in which the Tm ions, once excited into the H- 3 (<b>sub</b> 4) <b>level</b> decay by cross-relaxation to the F- 3 (sub 4), and then transfer rapidly their energy to other Tm ions...|$|R
