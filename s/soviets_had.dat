5|$|Von Neumann's {{assessment}} that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, was soon proven correct in the Sputnik crisis.|$|E
5|$|According to {{his student}} and biographer, Mark Kac, Steinhaus {{told him that}} the happiest day of his life were the twenty four hours between the time that the Germans left {{occupied}} Poland and the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> not yet arrived ("They had left, and they had not yet come").|$|E
5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden {{noticed that}} the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> changed their style, playing defence to protect the lead, rather than pressing. However, the {{strategy}} back-fired on the Soviets. The change in tactics gave the Canadians more chances to score and Cournoyer scored to even it up.|$|E
50|$|A {{major change}} from Red Alert 2 is the Soviet air force: in {{addition}} to Kirovs, the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> access to MiG (Mikoyan and Gurevich) fighters and versatile attack helicopters. In lieu of nuclear bombs, the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> developed the Vacuum Imploder, a warhead which sucks humans, vehicles and damaged buildings into a dense hole before exploding.|$|R
50|$|December 15: The {{head of the}} Moscow Okhrana was assassinated. The Moscow <b>Soviet</b> <b>had</b> {{its last}} meeting. Presnia was shelled.|$|R

5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there {{when he learned that}} the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though {{this was the first time}} the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> been officially given {{information}} about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, {{which called}} for the Kursk {{offensive}} operation, codenamed Zitadelle ("Citadel"), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter. The directive was drafted by Kurt Zeitzler, the OKH Chief of Staff. For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> a chance to prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own. Some military historians have described the operation using the term blitzkrieg (lightning war); other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.|$|E
50|$|The novel closes {{with the}} signing of the new arms {{reduction}} treaty, which the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> graciously amended to include space-based weapons.|$|R
50|$|There is {{compelling}} {{evidence that the}} <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> sponsored a number of revolutionary and separatist-irredentist groups, especially in El Salvador, where they directly delivered arms.|$|R

5|$|On 31 October, Molotov {{announced}} the Soviet demands in public, during a {{session of the}} Supreme Soviet. The Finns made two counteroffers—the first on 23 October and the second on 3 November. In both offers Finland would cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union, which was {{far less than the}} <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> demanded. The Finnish delegation returned home on November 13, taking for granted that the negotiations would continue in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 {{that had}} {{disappeared}} on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent. The drone had self-destructed over Siberia and the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> recovered the wreckage. The Tupolev design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy, named the Voron (Raven), but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for {{the first}} time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968. Shortly before, the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> sent an {{unmanned}} spacecraft around the Moon. On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.|$|E
50|$|The {{novel is}} set in a future a few decades ahead of the 1960s, when it was written. The USA is still {{competing}} with the <b>Soviet</b> Union. Both <b>have</b> functioning bases on the Moon, and the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> gained the lead in sending an expedition to Mars.|$|R
50|$|It {{follows from}} Vassiliev's {{notation}} that by mid-May 1937 the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> already ascertained {{the identity of}} Lore's actual source at the State's Division of Communications and Records.|$|R
50|$|On August 24 at 3:30AM an Italian mounted {{exploring}} patrol, sent to recon s.h.213,5, {{made contact}} with the enemy. The <b>Soviets,</b> <b>having</b> lost the element of surprise, opened fire on the entire line.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} renamed Weser, but work was ceased in June 1943, before the {{conversion}} was completed. The unfinished vessel was {{then transferred to}} Königsberg, where she remained {{for the rest of}} the war. On 29 January 1945, the ship was scuttled before the advancing Soviet Red Army could seize her. The Soviet Navy nevertheless considered using the wreck for parts to complete the cruiser , a sister-ship of Seydlitz the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> purchased unfinished before the outbreak of war. This was not carried out, however, and the ship was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of Zeppelin {{involved}} a delay until 21 May, {{on the basis}} that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> asked for them to be synchronised with their own invasion plans. This ran from 21 April until 9 May, when a major revision to the plans (stage four) was introduced. The Twelfth Army and Polish forces would land in Albania and Croatia, bypassing Greece due to mutiny within Allied Greek forces in Africa, with an invasion set in June. A major invasion of Southern France was also added, codenamed Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E
5000|$|Xavery Czernicki - Rear Admiral, {{he shared}} common lot of Polish {{officers}} detained by the <b>Soviets.</b> <b>Having</b> crossed thresholds of Ostaszków, Starobielsk, Kozielsk Soviet camp, he was eventually {{murdered in the}} Katyń massacre.|$|R
50|$|Although Lukashenko and the Supreme <b>Soviet</b> <b>had</b> {{signed the}} {{agreement}} that the <b>Soviet</b> would <b>have</b> the final {{decision on whether to}} adopt the constitutional amendments, Lukashenko broke the agreement. After the constitution was promulgated a new House of Representatives was assembled, with only Lukashenko loyalists admitted. Around sixty members of the Supreme Soviet who rejected the new constitution continued to work in the Soviet, which was recognised as the legitimate parliament by the international community.|$|R
50|$|In online {{play and}} {{computer}} skirmish, both Allied and <b>Soviet</b> forces <b>have</b> {{access to the}} nuclear Missile Silo, which is not available to either side in single-player mode, although it {{is present in the}} Allied campaign. In online play and computer skirmishes, the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> access to two of the Allied side's infantry: the Rocket Soldier (for anti-air and anti-tank fighting) and Tanya, a commando capable of easily killing infantry and destroying structures.|$|R
5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's main attack was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. Though they had been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|Baliszewski and Tadeusz Kisielewski {{are among}} those who point out the {{opportunity}} the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> at Gibraltar. At {{about the same time}} that Sikorski's plane was left unguarded at the Gibraltar airfield, a Soviet plane was parked nearby; it carried Soviet ambassador Ivan Maisky, giving the Soviets an officially confirmed presence {{at the site of the}} accident. The head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's counterintelligence for the Iberian Peninsula from 1941 to 1944 was Kim Philby, the Soviet double agent who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since the 1940s. Before 1941, Philby had served as an instructor with the Special Operations Executive, an organization specializing in sabotage and diversion behind enemy lines.|$|E
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. The <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E
50|$|Since 1975 {{more than}} 500,000 refugees, {{large numbers of}} whom were Jews, evangelical Christians, and Catholics from the former <b>Soviet</b> Union, <b>have</b> been resettled in the United States.

5|$|The Red Army {{allocated}} {{an estimated}} 1,100,000 personnel, 804 tanks, 13,400 artillery pieces and over 1,000 aircraft {{for the upcoming}} offensive. Across the Third Romanian Army, the Soviets placed the redeployed 5th Tank Army, {{as well as the}} 21st and 65th Armies, in order to penetrate and overrun the German flanks. The German southern flank was targeted by the Stalingrad Front's 51st and 57th Armies, led by the 13th and 4th Mechanized Corps; these would punch through the Fourth Romanian Army, in order to link up with the 5th Tank Army near the town of Kalach. In total, the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> amassed 11 armies and various independent tank brigades and corps.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering {{experts from the}} United States spent {{a period of time}} in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
