5000|$|A power {{inverter}} device which produces a multiple step sinusoidal AC waveform {{is referred to}} as a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter.</b> To more clearly distinguish the inverters with outputs of much less distortion than the modified sine wave (three step) inverter designs, the manufacturers often use the phrase pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter.</b> Almost all consumer grade inverters that are sold as a [...] "pure sine wave inverter" [...] do not produce a smooth sine wave output at all, just a less choppy output than the square wave (two step) and modified sine wave (three step) inverters. However, this is not critical for most electronics as they deal with the output quite well.|$|E
50|$|A common {{modified}} <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> topology {{found in}} consumer power inverters is as follows:An onboard microcontroller rapidly switches {{on and off}} power MOSFETs at high frequency like ~50 kHz. The MOSFETs directly pull from a low voltage DC source (such as a battery). This signal then goes through step-up transformers (generally many smaller transformers are placed in parallel to reduce the overall size of the inverter) to produce a higher voltage signal. The output of the step-up transformers then gets filtered by capacitors to produce a high voltage DC supply. Finally, this DC supply is pulsed with additional power MOSFETs by the microcontroller to produce the final modified sine wave signal.|$|E

CD-ROM IncludedIn this thesis a transformer less voltage source <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> is proposed. A previously developed tri-state boost converter is utilized for the stepping up operation. By using this topology the dynamic response of the inverter is increased, by avoiding the right hand plane zero in the converter’s small-signal control-to-output transfer function when operating in the continuous conduction mode. The reference voltage for the tri-state boost converter is determined from the measured output voltage of the <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter,</b> and the calculated instantaneous value of the sine wave. The inverter with the tri-state boost converter and the inverter with a classical boost converter with voltage mode control and current mode control are compared for the dynamic response and efficiency. The analytical work of the design has been verified using a simulation. Furthermore, the boost converter is implemented in hardware to verify the boost inverter calculations. The current mode control and the tri-state logic hardware implementation is ongoing, and it is presented as future work. Finally, two user selectable modes are proposed for the inverter optimized for dynamic performance or efficiency.

50|$|Where power {{inverter}} devices substitute for standard line power, a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> output is desirable because many electrical products are engineered to work best with a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> AC power source. The standard electric utility provides a <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> typically with minor imperfections but sometimes with significant distortion. <b>Sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverters</b> {{with more than}} three steps in the wave output are more complex and have significantly higher cost than a modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> with only three steps, or square wave (one step) types of the same power handling. Switch-mode power supply (SMPS) devices, such as personal computers or DVD players, function on quality modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> power.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} thesis is to generate AC signal of varying amplitude and frequency from a constant DC source. The device {{which is used}} to obtain this kind of action is known as inverter. At present, the inverter is classified into three ways i. e. square wave inverter, modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> or quasi <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> and pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter.</b> The first two classifications of inverter have seldom used and have very limited applications. Nowadays, the pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> is more demanding because of the requirement of high efficiency and reliability. On the contrary, it is more complex to implement. The main focus of this thesis is the implementation of space vector-pulse-width-modulation (SVPWM) {{which is one of the}} algorithm of different pulse-width-modulation techniques. It is applicable for three phase voltage-source- inverter for controlling induction and synchronous machine. In this technique, the reference vector of varying amplitude and direction continually revolve around the hexagon with a fixed sampling frequency generating a gate pulses for the 12 power switches used in neutral-point-converter. The space-vector-pulse-width-modulation is advantageous over carrier based pulse-width-modulation. The properties which are used to analyze the performance of different pulse width modulation methods are total harmonic distortion (THD) and the amplitude of fundamental component. Better utilization of DC bus voltage makes the space-vector-pulse-width-modulation better than the carrier based pulse-width-modulation. This thesis explains the concept, theory and implementation of three level space-vector pulse-width modulation using MATLAB/Simulink environment. It also incorporates the waveform of 7 -segment, 9 segment and 13 -segment switching pattern to avoid the problem of harmonics. The concept of DC-neutral-point-potential control has also been developed. To support the theory, gating signal pattern has been drawn and some mathematical calculations have been performed. To get the clear picture of voltage measurement at each output stage, the derivation of line-to-line voltages and line-to- neutral voltages are also taken into account along with the calculation of duty cycle of switches...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 67 - 68). A power inverter or inverter is an electrical power converter that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The converted AC can be at any required voltage and frequency with appropriate transformer, switching and control system. In under developed countries, the ever increasing reliance on electrical and electronic devices which utilize AC power highlights the problem associated with the unexpected or sudden loss of power due to electrical load shedding. Therefore, {{there is a need}} of inexpensive and reliable pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> to backup sophisticated electronic devices like medical devices and as well as for household appliances like fan, television, tube-lights etc. It has been noted that today’s pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> produces total harmonic distortion (THD) of about 3 % [1]. It is due to this THD, the lifetime of other electrical devices like fan, tube-light etc. decreases significantly [2]. This thesis aims to compare and analyze the total harmonic distortion, efficiency and cost effectiveness of different inverters from different renowned companies and finally to propose a design of a pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>inverter</b> with less total harmonic distortion and with greater efficiency than usual. Thus, it will have less effect on the lifetime of any electrical devices such as fan, tube lights etc. Labiba MuhammadNavid AnjumNusrat Khan BintuB. Electrical and Communication Engineerin...|$|E

The unending usage of non-renewable energy sources will {{bring an end to}} the limited resources in near future. In order to preserve the resources, several alternative renewable sources have been in use these days. The power generated from the renewable sources, like solar energy, produces is a DC power which can be stored in batteries. This DC power needs to be converted to AC power as most of the appliances used in our daily life are dependent on AC power. To overcome this obstacle, DC-AC Inverter took birth. Inverter s can be categorized into three groups: Square wave, modified sine wave and pure sine wave.
