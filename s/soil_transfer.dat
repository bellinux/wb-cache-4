Location: La Crau area, southeast France (Provence). Methods: After {{the rehabilitation of}} a 357 -ha herbaceous, sheep-grazed range-land suitable for threatened steppe birds in a formerly abandoned industrial orchard in the last French Mediterranean steppe (La Crau area), four experimental treatments were applied, with or without topsoil removal. Topsoil was removed on a 5000 -m² area and the four treatments (control, nurse species seeding, hay transfer and <b>soil</b> <b>transfer)</b> were applied within this area where top-soil was removed and within the area where topsoil was not removed. Three years later, soil chemistry, soil seed bank, vegetation cover and height, plant species richness, composition and diversity were compared. Results: Removing topsoil partly restored soil conditions and significantly reduced the non-target seed bank. Moreover, species richness and similarity to the reference steppe was significantly increased with topsoil removal.

However, small-scale expositional differences in bare soils and their impacts on soil microbial communities {{have so far}} been largely neglected. Here we studied the changes of microbial communities in three deglaciated unvegetated sites along a soil moisture and temperature gradient near a glacier terminus. In order to elucidate the driving forces for these changes, fine granite sediment was reciprocally transferred and regularly sampled during 16 months to determine microbial activities and the bacterial and fungal community structures and compositions using T-RFLP profiling and sequence analysis. Microbial activities only responded to <b>soil</b> <b>transfer</b> from the warmer and drier site to the colder and moister site, whereas the bacterial and fungal community structures responded to transfer in both directions. Bacterial phylotypes found to react to <b>soil</b> <b>transfer</b> were mainly the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria. The common fungal phylogenetic groups Pezizomycetes and mitosporic Ascomycetes also reacted to <b>soil</b> <b>transfer.</b> It seemed that the soil moisture was the limiting factor for the microbial activities.

However, this method is recent, and results achieved {{in the short term}} (months to years) may not provide a sound indication of long-term vegetation reestablishment. In the plain of La Crau in southeastern France, many dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970 s- 1980 s and are nearly all now abandoned. Various topsoil transfers were performed when operations ceased, for various rehabilitation purposes (aesthetic, security, agricultural, etc.) and now provide the opportunity to test their efficacy in the 30 -year long-term. We used an ecological analysis of plant communities and soil carried out in 2015 to compare the reference ecosystem (the steppe of La Crau, positive control) with un-rehabilitated quarry pits (negative control) and with four different rehabilitation treatments: (1) <b>soil</b> <b>transfer</b> (40 cm) with no contact with the water table; (2) <b>soil</b> <b>transfer</b> (40 cm) in contact with the water table; (3) more than 40 cm of <b>soil</b> <b>transfer</b> and (4) anthropogenic material deposits (spoils) unrelated to the characteristics of the reference soil. Our results show that the treatment most favorable to restoration of the species richness, diversity and composition of the steppe vegetation is transferring soil with fine particles (clay, silt) (treatment 1), at least 40 cm thick and without contact with groundwater. However, even after thirty years, and the re-establishment of traditional sheep grazing, full restoration of the reference steppe is far from being achieved. The other treatments lead to the emergence of hybrid or novel ecosystems, such as temporary ponds, riparian woodlands or matorrals with new variables and common variables to the historical ecosystem.

A soil seed bank germination experiment was conducted over a period of 13 weeks.

40|$|International audienceEcological {{restoration}} {{has been}} identified as one of the possible ways to replace biodiversity loss. While ecological engineering methods can successfully restore some ecosystem attributes, restoration is generally incomplete, mainly due to lack of target species propagule dispersal, unsuitable abiotic conditions and negative biotic interactions, especially after intensive cultivation. How best to restore reference ecosystems is therefore a vital research objective, not only on a small experimental scale but also on a large scale. This study aimed to determine which ecological engineering techniques are the most suitable for large-scale restoration of a low-productive species-rich ecosystem after intensive cultivation. Experiments were carried out at La Crau in southern France, within a 357 ha land rehabilitation project whose aim was to recreate a herbaceous sheep-grazed habitat. We investigated: (i) covering species seeding, (ii) topsoil removal, (iii) hay transfer, and (iv) <b>soil</b> <b>transfer</b> as methods to restore a steppe plant community in this rehabilitated area, using the last remaining French Mediterranean steppe as a reference ecosystem. Species-richness, diversity and composition of vascular plant communities were monitored over three years. The rehabilitation made it possible to recover a large area dominated by grasses but with vegetation {{different from that of the}} steppe. Hay transfer was successful in transferring some target species, but the number of target species did not significantly increase by the end of the third year. Covering species seeding seemed to provide a suitable area for target species colonization, but probable competition with grasses needs to be monitored. The greatest similarity in richness, diversity, and composition with the reference ecosystem was obtained with topsoil removal and <b>soil</b> <b>transfer,</b> which made it possible to recover the species-richness and, to some extent, the composition of the steppe.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{calculations}} of building heat loss via the ground, the coupling with <b>soil</b> moisture <b>transfer</b> is generally ignored, an important hypothesis {{which will be}} falsified in this paper. Results from coupled simulations – coupled soil heat and moisture transfer equations and complete surface heat and moisture balances – are compared to results from linear simulations.

Surface temperature, the driving force for heat loss via the ground, is identified as a first important source for these deviations: it is shown that while the averages of the surface temperature are almost equal in coupled and linear calculations, the amplitude in the coupled simulation is considerably higher. A further study reveals that variation of the thermal properties with moisture content also contributes partially to the observed differences.

40|$|Summary Established trees {{influence}} {{the growth and}} physi-ology of seedlings by altering above- and belowground condi-tions; however, tree influences on seedling physiology via belowground interactions are not well understood. We used <b>soil</b> <b>transfers</b> to an open field to examine the belowground in-fluences of a Quercus ellipsoidalis E. J. Hill dominated forest on Q. ellipsoidalis seedling mycorrhizal infection, nutrient up-take, growth and photosynthesis over three years. After two years, seedlings planted with large quantities of forest soil (HF treatment) had greater leaf mass and foliar N concentrations than seedlings receiving smaller quantities of forest soil (LF) and control treatments. Mycorrhizal infection was greater in the HF treatment after one year compared with the LF and con-trol treatments, with a positive correlation of foliar N and mycorrhizal infection in Year 2. There were marked effects of treatments on seedling spring phenology with HF seedlings breaking bud up to 17 days earlier than seedlings in the other treatments. The HF seedlings also had more rapid leaf expan-sion and larger leaves, {{and an increase in}} net photosynthetic rates. These results highlight complex linkages between above- and belowground physiology: forest soil had substan-tial effects on seedling physiology, including traits such as phenology that have previously been considered to be under aboveground control. Belowground influences of trees on conspecific seedlings may {{play a critical role in}} early seedling establishment...|$|R
