40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} rectangular elastomeric isolation bearings with bidirectional fiber reinforcing elements is analytically investigated. In {{contrast to the}} steelreinforced isolator, which is usually assumed to be rigid both in extension and in flexure, the fiber-reinforced isolator {{is assumed to be}} flexible in extension and with no <b>stiffness</b> <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> The solution for infinitely long rectangular isolators with in plane isotropic fiber reinforcing (Kelly 1999) and an original hypothesis on the displacement field are used to find displacements and stress fields. The compression modulus and the bending modulus are finally evaluated. The obtained results are then compared with the results obtained via a different approach by Tsai and Kelly 2002 for rectangular isolators with isotropic fiber reinforcing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) and compression molding manufacturing processes {{were used to}} fabricate composite wind turbine blades by stacking pieces of glass-fiber fabric, expandable polystyrene (EPS) foam and inserting parts in an interior pressure mold. The blade preform is a composite foam-filled sandwich structure, where the interior is an EPS foam layer while the exterior is coated with a main fiber layer, root reinforcing fiber layer and the parts are inserted. The inserted parts that were investigated were the I-beam, LED, conductor, root connection joint and repair patch. The reinforcing fiber layer was designed to provide maximum bending <b>stiffness</b> <b>in</b> the <b>flexure</b> to resist the stress concentration of the composite wind turbine blade. This research will {{also be used to}} develop adhesive bonding repair techniques for life extension of the damaged components in a wind turbine blade.

40|$|The {{in-service}} {{performance of}} reinforced concrete beams can be severely affected through cor-rosion {{of the steel}} reinforcement when it becomes subjected to harsh corrosive environments containing chlo-rides and carbon dioxide. In such instances, corrosion is {{likely to occur in}} the steel reinforcement, with the expansive nature of the corrosion products likely to induce cracking and spalling of the concrete. A loss of structural integrity (stiffness) will occur and this can severely influence the serviceability of the member. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the relationship between degree of corrosion and loss of <b>stiffness</b> <b>in</b> corrosion damaged under-reinforced concrete beams. Beams (100 mm x 150 mm cross section) were subjected to accelerated corrosion in the laboratory and subsequently tested <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> to failure.

40|$|The stress–strain {{characteristic}} of concrete developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> {{is one of}} the essential parameters for the ultimate flexural strength design of reinforced concrete (RC) members. Currently, the stress–strain curve of concrete developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> is obtained by scaling down the uniaxial stress–strain curve. In current RC design codes, it is represented by an equivalent rectangular concrete stress block depending solely on the concrete strength. By comparing the theoretical strength evaluated for the stress block with the measured strength, the authors found that current codes underestimate the actual flexural strength of RC beams and columns by 9 % and 19 %, respectively. Since the underestimation is different for beams and columns, which are subjected to different strain gradients at ultimate, it is suggested that the maximum concrete stresses developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> should depend also on strain gradient. The effects of strain gradient on the concrete stress developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> were investigated <b>in</b> this work by testing RC columns under concentric and eccentric axial loads or horizontal loads. The concrete stress–strain curves of the eccentrically/horizontally loaded specimens were derived by modifying those of concentrically loaded counterparts based on axial force and moment equilibriums. The results indicate that the maximum concrete stress developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> depends significantly on strain gradient. Formulas were developed to correlate the maximum and equivalent concrete stresses developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> to the strain gradient. Their applicability was verified by comparing the results with measured flexural strengths of RC beams and columns. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The main {{variable}} in the experimental research with masonry wallettes tested <b>in</b> <b>flexure,</b> was the angle between bending axis and bed joints. Two types of widely used masonry in the Netherlands were applied: • fired clay bricks with normal joints and • calcium-silicate elements with thin layer joint. Main goal of the tests was the collection of data consistent with micro tensile and shear tests carried out earlier [1, 2]. The data {{will be used to}} verify a model for masonry <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> that is currently being developed [3]. For the fired clay masonry four different angles and for the calcium silicate masonry three different angels were used. The strength and behaviour in these directions is compared and related with tensile bond tests. Comparison of the results of specimens with clay brick and calcium-silicate masonry bent horizontally and vertically has shown that the decrease <b>in</b> <b>stiffness</b> visible <b>in</b> the m-K diagram of the specimen bent horizontally, was caused by cracking of the head joints. This type of behaviour found in specimens bent in other directions, may also arise from (micro) -cracking due to complex stress combinations in the joints. The flexural strength in the horizontal direction could be related to the flexural strength of the units...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study to investigate the behaviour of structurally damaged full-scale reinforced concrete beams retrofitted with CFRP laminates in shear or <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> The main variables considered were the internal reinforcement ratio, position of retrofitting and the length of CFRP. The experimental results, generally, indicate that beams retrofitted <b>in</b> shear and <b>flexure</b> by using CFRP laminates are structurally efficient and are restored to stiffness and strength values nearly equal to or greater than those of the control beams. It was found that the efficiency of the strengthening technique by CFRP <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> varied depending on the length. The main failure mode in the experimental work was plate debonding in retrofitted beams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{intrinsic}} {{advantages of}} strengthening the steel-based structures {{by the use}} of fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) material have not yet been fully exploited. In this paper, a succinct overview of recent studies made to enhance the strength of steel beams using FRP laminates is presented. The results presented and dis-cussed in this paper were obtained by closely studying the behaviour of steel beams strengthened with carbon FRP material. An attempt is made to succinctly sum-marise the findings for two different types of strengthening of the steel beams using carbon FRP laminates. The first type of beams focuses on enhancing the strength of steel <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> while the second focuses on increasing the shear strength of the beams. Three beams were designed so as to cause them to fail <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> Of the beams studied, two were strengthened using carbon FRP strips attached to the tension flange. One of the beams was tested to facilitate comparison of their behaviour to the two beams which are strengthened <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> Three other beams were designed such that they failed predominantly in shear. Of these three, two were strengthened with carbon FRP strips attached to the webs while the third beam was used as a control beam for the purpose of drawing comparisons. Pre-liminary results revealed a noticeable increase in the strength for both the flexure strengthened beams and the beams strengthened in shear. The observed increase in shear strength of the beams was 26 % while the increase in strength for the beams tested <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> was 15 %. This study convincingly shows that it is possi-ble to strengthen steel beams using carbon FRP laminates <b>in</b> both <b>flexure</b> and <b>in</b> shear...|$|R

40|$|Shear {{deformation}} {{and higher}} order theories of plates in bending are (generally) based on plate element equilibrium equations derived either through variational principles or other methods.

These coupled problems with reference to vertical deflection of plate <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> result <b>in</b> artificial deflection due to torsion and increased deflection of faces of the plate due to extension.

40|$|With the {{increase}} in usage of engineering ceramics, a new industrial standard is {{required in order to}} evaluate its properties and to perform a fair and just trade. The thesis investigates the faults and omissions of existing work and judges today's requirements thereby constructing a framework with which today's and future standards <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> testing can be based. The draft standard presented in this thesis covers the three major testing methods for determining the biaxial flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of engineering ceramics. The ring-on-ring, ball-on-ring, and 4 -Ball test fixtures were all adopted as standard, since it is known that each of these systems is suited for a particular application and each has different advantages and disadvantages. The three major biaxial test methods prescribed in this draft standard have been devised so that more consistent and accurate test results can be obtained. However, the uncertainty of measurement <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> testing always exists and needs to be estimated. The estimation of uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> testing <b>in</b> this study is based on the methodology provided in the ISO Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. The results of the estimation showed that the uncertainty in measurement for the biaxial flexure test standard proposed in this thesis is very low compared to the inherent variability of the strength of ceramic materials. It was also found that the applied load, thickness of the disc plate, and random effects are the three major components contributing to the overall uncertainty. The total uncertainty of measurement <b>in</b> biaxial <b>flexure</b> testing can be significantly minimised by the reduction of the uncertainty contributed from these components, especially from random effects...|$|R
