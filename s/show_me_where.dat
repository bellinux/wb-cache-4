500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!" ...|$|E

We walked into Jon Avnet’s office that first day and he said, ‘What {{do you want for}} the production?’ and we said $3million. We could have done a version of this film for $3million.

500|$|Since [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] {{was not a}} {{song that}} McCartney's bandmates enjoyed recording, the motive behind Harrison's {{appropriation}} of the title has invited speculation. Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – [...] "We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / But can you <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> you are?" [...] – serves {{as an example of}} Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for [...] "clues". Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.|$|E

500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the single {{is set in}} compound time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show me where your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous. Kesha herself has been frank about this straightforward interpretation of the lyrics. The lyrics have been interpreted as {{a shot at the}} way men objectify women by speaking about them the way that they do in the music industry. [...] " [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH felt that the line [...] "I don't really care where you live at, just turn around boy, let me hit that. Don't be a little bitch with your chit-chat; just <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> your dick's at" [...] was a way of belittling her male peers. Fraser McAlpine of BBC noted that it was cultural progress that a woman can now [...] "sing a song as dirty [...] as her male peers".|$|E

In Friedman's interview, he mentioned that [...] "Our view of the Middle East is deeply colored by Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and they all have their own interest. 15 of the 19 hijackers on 911 were from Saudi Arabia, none from Iran! Iranians had a spontaneous demonstration to support Americans on 911." [...] He added, [...] "What strikes you most about Iran (vs. Saudi Arabia) is that Iran has real politics... A country of 85 million people, a great civilization, many educated men and women, if they want to get a bomb WILL get it. They have demonstrated they could do it under the most severe sanctions... <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> Iranians have acted reckless [...] These are survivors." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] Aynesworth persisted, [...] "the fact remains. If you date our {{acquaintance}} {{from this}} afternoon, I do not.

60|$|Vanished utterly, you understand. I {{rushed to}} the spot, and gazed down into the black abyss. Had he hurled himself over? I had almost {{made up my mind}} that he had done so, when a gentle sound rising and falling came out of the {{darkness}} beneath me. It was his breathing once more, and it <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> he must be. He was hiding in the tool-house.|$|R

60|$|Our driver gave me {{a lecture}} by the way on Californian trees--a thing I was much in need of, having fallen among {{painters}} who {{know the name of}} nothing, and Mexicans who know the name of nothing in English.

60|$|Why {{the lions}} ran in that {{particular}} direction {{was clear to me}} when I saw the trail. It was a runway, smooth and hard packed.

60|$|But I {{very soon}} {{realized}} how impossible it was. In that black, velvety darkness one lost all one's bearings in an instant. Before I {{had made a}} dozen paces, I was utterly bewildered as to my whereabouts. The rippling of the stream, which was the one sound audible, <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> it lay, but the moment that I left its bank I was utterly lost. The idea of finding my way back in absolute darkness through that limestone labyrinth was clearly an impossible one.|$|R
