50|$|The {{paranasal}} sinuses are joined to {{the nasal cavity}} via small orifices called ostia. These become blocked easily by allergic inflammation, or by swelling in the nasal lining that occurs with a cold. If this happens, normal drainage of mucus within the sinuses is disrupted, and sinusitis may occur. Because the maxillary posterior teeth {{are close to the}} maxillary sinus, this can also cause clinical problems if any disease processes are present, such as an infection in any of these teeth. These clinical problems can include <b>secondary</b> <b>sinusitis,</b> the inflammation of the sinuses from another source such as an infection of the adjacent teeth.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To report meningoencephalitis as a {{complication}} after {{paranasal sinus}} surgery in 5 horses. STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Adult horses (n[*]=[*] 5). METHODS Medical records (2005 - 2010) of 5 horses that developed neurologic signs after sinus surgery were reviewed to identify potential risk factors, cause(s), or common pathways for infection. RESULTS Underlying diseases were primary (n[*]=[*] 1) and <b>secondary</b> <b>sinusitis</b> (4) because of apical dental infection (1), sinus cyst (2), or masses in the ethmoturbinate region (2). Horses were treated by conventional surgical approaches and aftercare including repeated sinus lavage. Four horses had undulating pyrexia postoperatively despite antimicrobial therapy. All horses developed neurologic signs, eventually unresponsive to treatment. Suppurative meningoencephalitis was diagnosed macro- and/or microscopically on necropsy in all horses. CONCLUSION Meningitis {{is a rare}} but fatal complication after sinus surgery in horses...|$|E
40|$|Diseases of {{paranasal}} sinuses and nasal passages in horses {{can be a}} diagnostic challenge because of the complex anatomy {{of the head and}} limitations of many diagnostic modalities. Our hypothesis was that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging would provide excellent anatomical detail and soft tissue resolution, and would be accurate in the diagnosis of diseases of the {{paranasal sinuses}} and nasal passages in horses. Fourteen horses were imaged. Inclusion criteria were lesions located to the sinuses or nasal passages that underwent MR imaging and subsequent surgical intervention and/or histopathologic examination. A low field, 0. 3 tesla open magnet was used. Sequences in the standard protocol were fast spin echo T 2 sagittal and transverse, spin echo T 1 transverse, short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) dorsal, gradient echo 3 D T 1 MPR dorsal (plain and contrast enhanced), spin echo T 1 fatsat (contrast enhanced). Mean scan time to complete the examination was 53 min (range 39 - 99 min). Lesions identified were primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>sinusitis</b> (six horses), paranasal sinus cyst (four horses), progressive ethmoid hematoma (two horses), and neoplasia (two horses). The most useful sequences were fast spin echo T 2 transverse and sagittal, STIR dorsal and FE 3 D MPR (survey and contrast enhanced). Fluid accumulation, mucosal thickening, presence of encapsulated contents, bone deformation, and thickening were common findings observed in MR imaging. In selected horses, magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool in diagnosing lesions of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAmong the {{complications}} of sinusitis, those that involve the orbital region are the most frequent. AimThe objective {{of this paper is}} to show an incidence of orbital cellulites (OC) <b>secondary</b> to acute <b>sinusitis</b> in children. Study design: retrospective. MethodsAfter board approval, the charts of all pediatric patients diagnosed with orbital complications <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis,</b> seen at the Pediatric and at the ENT clinics of the HPEV, between 1985 and 2004, were evaluated. The data was analyzed considering gender, age, clinical presentation, period of hospitalization, image study, and treatment. Resultsfrom 1985 to 2004, 25 patients were diagnosed with OC <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis,</b> presenting an incidence of 6 %. Males predominated, the median age was 6. 5 years, and the maxillary was the most frequently involved sinus. Twenty-four patients presented mild periorbital swallowing. All 25 patients presented X-Ray alterations. One patient with proptosis had a subperiosteal abcess seen on the CT-scan. The average time of hospitalization was 4 days. All 25 patients received IV antibiotics, 2 required surgery. ConclusionThe incidence of orbital complications <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis</b> is low, and although the majority of cases are early diagnosed and respond well to medication treatment, a surgical intervention may be required...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the incidence, presentations and different treatment outcomes of orbital complications <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis.</b> Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review {{of patients with}} orbital complications <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis</b> seen at Ain-Shams University Hospitals (Department of OtoRhinoLaryngology, Cairo, Egypt) {{over a period of}} three years. Data obtained from the charts included clinical presentations, contrast enhanced computed tomography data, type of treatment, surgical approaches used and their outcomes. Results: Thirty-five patients (35) presented to Ain Shams University Hospital over the three year period with orbital complication <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis.</b> Medical treatment was successful in 15 patients; surgical drainage was done in 19 cases (13 cases were done endoscopically and 6 were drained externally) including orbital exenteration and Caldwell Luc procedure which were done in the same patient (fungal infection). One case developed coma and passed away the same day of presentation despite aggressive management and neurological consultation. Conclusion: Orbital complications of sinusitis have a good prognosis when detected early and managed appropriately. The key point here should be increasing physician awareness towards this problem as well as encouraging early referral to specialized centers for the proper management of these cases...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Rhinosinusitis {{remains a}} common {{clinical}} disease encountered in ENT practice. The clinical subtypes include acute, subacute, recurrent acute and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis most commonly is of viral aetiology superadded by bacteria. Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is commonly a mixed bacterial infection. Even though, the complications are less common when primary treatment is neglected, {{the potential of}} developing intraorbital suppuration, life-threatening intracranial complications will result in high morbidity and mortality. Incidence of such complications remains high among the populations of poor socioeconomic status, overcrowding and those living in areas of industrial pollution. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the incidence, clinical presentations, CT scan findings and different treatment outcomes of orbital complications <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis</b> in patients from slum areas of industrial belt of Hyderabad. The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence, clinical presentations and various treatment modalities and their outcomes of orbital complications <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted at Government ENT Hospital, Koti, Hyderabad, reviewing the patients with orbital complications over a period of 3 years. All the clinical data collected from the case sheets included the clinical presentation, plain and contrast-enhanced CT scan findings, type of treatment adopted, surgical approaches in their management and the final outcome of such patients were analysed. RESULTS 134 patients presented in the Regional ENT Hospital with orbital complications secondary to rhinosinusitis. Medical treatment was initially successful in 59 (44. 02...|$|R
40|$|Intracranial {{complications}} of sinusitis, including meningitis,are uncommon in childhood. Among pediatric patients admitted {{for treatment of}} sinusitis, 3. 2 % {{were found to have}} an intracranial complication. 1 Conversely, among pediatric patients with intracranial infections, only 2. 4 % had infections <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis.</b> 2 Infection of the sphenoid sinuses, however, merits particular concern. These thin-walled sinuses develop late in childhood, and their deep location places them adjacent to the dura mater and other critical structures.

40|$|Complications of {{sinusitis}} in children, such as intracranial abscess formation, are uncommon and {{are often}} clinically unremarkable incomparison to similardisease processes in adults. Between 1983 and 1991, 443 children were admitted to Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC, for treatment of sinusitis. Fourteen of these children presented with intracranial extension of the infection and abscess formation. A retrospective review of these patients revealed {{that the risk of}} developing an intracranial abscess <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis</b> was 3 %. The management of these patients included surgical drainage of the infected sinuses and intracranial surgical exploration. Cranialization and exenteration of the frontal sinus proved to beeffective single-stage procedures. While not indicated in all patients, these procedures eliminated the sinus as a source of continued or potential infection and obviated the need for a second obliterative procedure. Combined antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage should be the management protocol.

40|$|Objective. We {{report a}} rare and unusual case of {{bronchial}} carcinoma presenting with symptoms of complications of sinonasal disease. Case Report. A 66 -year-old lady was referred with a 1 -week history of progressive ocular pain, chemosis, and visual disturbance. Computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses revealed frontal and ethmoidal sinus opacification with orbital involvement consistent with a diagnosis of orbital cellulitis <b>secondary</b> to <b>sinusitis.</b> Surgical exploration revealed that the sinuses and right orbit were filled with soft tissue and subsequent histopathological examination of the biopsies indicating metastases from an adenosquamous bronchial carcinoma.

40|$|A 17 -year-old Paint gelding was {{presented}} with an 11 month history of unlateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. The patient had been treated 7 months earlier with maxillary check tooth repulsion of teeth 109 and 110 based on radiographic diagnosis of apical infections of those teeth. The nasal discharge persisted following that surgery until presentation to Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital. Upon presentation, sedated oral exam revealed a deep defect in the space created by repulsion of tooth 110. A dental probe could be passed several centimeters through this defect into the maxillary sinus. Radiographs revealed soft tissue opacification throughout the rostral maxillary and ventral conchal sinus. <b>Sinusitis</b> <b>secondary</b> to an extraction-related oromaxillary fistula was diagnosed.

40|$|Objective: The {{clinical}} presentation of sphenoid sinusitis {{can be highly}} variable. Rarely, sphenoid sinusitis may present with cranial nerve complications due to the proximity of these structures to the sphenoid sinus. Method: A case series from Rabin Medical Center and all cases of cranial nerves palsies <b>secondary</b> to sphenoid <b>sinusitis</b> that {{have been reported in}} the literature were reviewed. Results: Seventeen patients were identified. The abducent nerve was the most common cranial nerve affected (76 %), followed by the oculomotor nerve (18 %). One patient had combined oculomotor, trochlear and abducent palsies. The most common pathology was isolated purulent sphenoid sinusitis in 64 % followed by allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) in 18 %, and fungal infection in 18 %. 94 % had an acute presentation. The majority (85 %) received a combined intravenous antibiotics and surgical treatment. The remainder received conservative treatment alone. Complete recovery of cranial nerve palsy was noted in 82 % during follow up. Conclusion: Sphenoid sinusitis presenting as diplopia and headaches is rare. A neoplastic process must be ruled out and early surgical intervention with intravenous antimicrobial therapy carry an excellent outcome with complete resolution of symptoms.

40|$|Background: Perennial {{allergic}} rhinitis is chronic and persistent, {{may lead to}} a constellation of <b>secondary</b> complaints including <b>sinusitis,</b> mouth-breathing, and some symptoms resembling a permanent cold, and often requires constant medical intervention. Well-tolerated nasal corticosteroids, alone or in combination with antihistamines, {{have been found to be}} very effective in treating this condition. Objective: To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of mometasone furoate aqueous suspension, a new once daily nasal spray, to placebo vehicle and to beclomethasone dipropionate, administered twice daily, in patients with perennial {{allergic rhinitis}}. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, parallel group study, in 427 patients age 12 years and older at 24 centers in Canada and Europe. Patients allergic to at least one perennial allergen, confirmed by medical history, skin testing, and adequate symptomatology were eligible to receive one of the following regimens for 3 months: mometasone furoate, 200 mu g once daily; beclomethasone dipropionate, 200 mu g twice daily (400 mu g total dose); or placebo vehicle control. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in total AM plus PM diary nasal symptom score over the first 15 days of treatment. Results: Three hundred eighty-seven patients were valid for efficacy. For the primary efficacy variable, mometasone furoate was significantly (P less than or equal to. 01) more effective than placebo and was indistinguishable from beclomethasone dipropionate. Similar trends were seen among individual symptoms, physician symptom evaluations, and therapeutic response. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis. All treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions: Mometasone furoate nasal spray adequately controls symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis, offers the advantage of once daily treatment, and is well tolerated...|$|R
