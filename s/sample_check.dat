40|$|This study {{looks into}} the factors that explain foreign direct {{investment}} in Brazil by country of origin of investment. Based on a sample of more than 100 countries that invested and have not yet invested in Brazil, multiple estimation techniques, such as the Tobit, Heckit and Probit, are used to isolate the effect of country risk on outward foreign direct investment. In {{sharp contrast to the}} findings of previous studies on the effect of home country risk on foreign investment in the United States, the findings in this paper reveal that less risky countries invest more in Brazil. These results are controlled for size of the home country, distance, trade intensity and previous investments abroad. A simple out of <b>sample</b> <b>check</b> shows that the model correctly predicts probability of investing for a large number of countries. The existing literature does not document these results.

Objective: Post survey check of National Family Health Survey carried out in 1992 - 93. Study design: Multistage sampling method with 5 percent sample of original NFHS sample. Setting: Study covered 5 percent sample of original NFHS sample. Subjects: Five percent household sample (1093 members) of original NFHS sample was studied and compared with NFHS data. Method: Information from five percent house-holds of NFHS in which either there likely to be no change was likely to be only in one direction such as age group, sex-ratio, literacy, family planning knowledge and adoption etc. were collected in a predesigned questionnaire and compared with NFHS data. Results: The demographic characteristics were similar to those of NFHS. TFR and number of children ever borne were also found to be same.

40|$|Little, if any, {{has been}} {{published}} on the robustness of the Fama & French multi-factor model in emerging and little markets, such as the Tunisian Stocks’ market. This paper extends the existing literature and provides an out-of <b>sample</b> <b>check</b> {{on the performance of}} size and BE/ME factors proposed by Fama & French (1993). It firstly investigates the relation of stock returns with size and BE/ME ratio for equities listed in the Tunisian Stocks ‘market during the period July 1998 -June 2004. The evidence we find support the presence of size and BE/ME effects in the Tunisian stocks’ market. We find that the mimic portfolio for size (SMB) and the mimic portfolio for BE/ME generate positive returns, which is consistent with a risk-based explanation for size and BE/ME effect. The second {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the explanatory power of the three-factor model of Fama & French (1993) in the Tunisian stocks ‘market. We estimate a one factor model (CAPM) and the three-factor model of Fama & French (1993). The results give evidence on the additional explanatory power of SMB and HML factors of Fama & French, relative to the market factor, for cross-section of stock returns in the Tunisian Stocks’ market. Findings of this paper have implications for investors in the Tunisian stock market exchange. We suggest that investors must tilt their portfolios in favor of characteristics such as firm's BE/ME and size. Note that by tilting portfolios in favor of these characteristics investors are exposed to additional sources of risk...|$|E
40|$|Context: The {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) {{is the most}} common malignancy between men and women. CRC has considerable morbidity and mortality, with more than 1000, 000 new cases and 500, 000 annual deaths. Regional lymph nodes are most common sites of metastasis from colon cancer. Lymph node involvement is an essential factor in enabling the accurate evaluation of prognosis in CRC patients. Aims: In this study, we focused on the frequency of CRC and involved lymph nodes and adequacy of lymph node dissection in patients who referred to the Oncology and Radiotherapy Department of Golestan Hospital in Ahvaz City located in South-West Iran. Setting and Design: We conducted a retrospective study among patients receiving surgical treatment for CRC in the Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy of Golestan Hospital in Ahvaz City located in South-West Iran between 2001 and 2010. Methods and Materials: All patients who underwent resection for CRC by open or laparoscopic approaches were included in the study. Data were collected from patients' medical records. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Results: A total of 585 cases with CRC aged from 16 to 89 years with mean age of 53 -year-old were studied. Average number of dissected nodes was 8 lymph nodes, and lymph nodes were not found in pathology specimen of 61 cases (10. 4). In 199 patients (34. 01), number of dissected lymph nodes was 12 or more and in 386 patients (65. 98), number of dissected lymph nodes was < 12. Conclusion: This study revealed a large amount of patients that had been under over treatment with radiotherapy and the following inability. Lack of removal of sufficient tissue by the surgeon during surgery or an inadequate <b>sample</b> <b>check</b> by a pathologist might lead to an inability to correct staging of the disease as well as the inability to determine the treatment program of the patients and over treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. © 2016 Indian Journal of Medical and Paediatric Oncology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow...|$|E
