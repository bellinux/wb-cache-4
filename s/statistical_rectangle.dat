40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{trends in}} beam and otter trawling {{effort in the}} North Sea from 1977 to 1995. Data are presented as total hours fishing by English, German, Norwegian, Scottish and Welsh vessels for the period 1977 - 1995, and by Danish, Dutch, English, German, Norwegian, Scottish and Welsh vessels for the period 1990 - 1995. Analyses of temporal trends indicated that total international trawling effort in the entire North Sea has increased slowly since 1977 {{and that it is}} currently (1995) 2. 25 million h yr- 1 of which 55 % is due to beam trawling. Spatial analyses indicate that the proportion of beam trawling effort increases from north to south. Plots of annual fishing effort by ICES <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangle</b> (211 boxes of 0. 5 °latitude x 1 °longitude) indicate that the majority of fishing effort in the North Sea are concentrated in a very few rectangles. Thus mean annual total fishing effort (1990 - 1995) was less than 2000 h in 29 % of rectangles and less than 10 000 h in 66 % of rectangles. Total effort exceeded 40 000 h in 4 % of rectangles. The results indicate that assessments of the average area swept by trawls in the North Sea give a poor indication of the direct impacts of trawling on the biota. Some areas are intensively fished but many others are not. Our dataset is likely to underestimate trawling effort in the southern North Sea (ICES Area IVc) because data for Belgian and French vessels were not available. However, the absence of French and Belgian data would not significantly alter total trawling effort estimates from the central (IVb) and northern (IVa) North Sea...|$|E

Gives {{terms of}} reference, lists the six {{participants}} {{from the three}} nations represented at the meeting (Ireland, Norway and Russia). Background for the Study Group was the observed large number of post-smolts taken together with large catches of mackerel in Norwegian research surveys in the Norwegian Sea (div. during June-August {{since the start of}} dedicated salmon surveys in 1995. These observations gave rise to an apprehension that the large commercial fisheries for mackerel in these areas might heavily intercept the post-smolt cohorts mowing northwards during the summer months. Russian observers on board commercial mackerel trawlers did, however, detect only negligible amounts of post-smolts in the catches screened, resulting in a large discrepancy in the estimates of post-smolts taken if the observed ratios were used when scaling up with the total catch in these areas (from 60 to > 1 million post-smolts taken). Based on quarterly catch data, the overlap between post-smolts and the fisheries in the Norwegian Sea was seemingly high, but the absence of disaggregated data (per week and <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangle)</b> impeded an assessment of the true overlap of post-smolts. When the Working Group on North Atlantic Salmon (WGNAS) in 2003 received indications that also the herring fisheries occurring in August in northerly areas of ICES areas might intercept adult salmon, the necessity to pool data from pelagic Working Groups and WGNAS in order to progress on these issues became apparent. Section 2. An overview of the marine distribution of salmon in the North East Atlantic is given. Some areas of denser distribution of post-smolts have been identified (1995 – 1997) in mid- June on the shelf areas west of UK-Scotland (IVa) and in the strong surface currents in the Faroe-Shetland Channel (VIa west). Another high-density migration area of post-smolt cohorts has been identified west and north of the Vøring Plateau in the Norwegian Sea (IIa). Distribution charts for post-smolts broken into weeks 16 – 20, 21 – 26, 27 – 31 and 32 – 36 illustrate the northward progression of post-smolt cohorts predominantly of Irish and UK origin (assessed from smolt ages read from scales and tagged fish), but it also shows areas where the knowledge basis is weak due to lesser number of cruises performed (Figure 2. 2. 2). I t is also pointed out that due to deficient knowledge of the distribution of pre-adults and adult fish, it is difficult to evaluate the degree of overlap salmon distribution and major fisheries occurring in the Norwegian Sea and the transition areas for homing salmon. Section 3. Describes the major pelagic fisheries in the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea and areas west and south of UK and Ireland. Disaggregated data for landings to the UK and Germany enabled a closer study of mackerel and herring fisheries in the western (VIa) and northern North Sea areas (IVa) per week and <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangle.</b> Possible areas of interception were detected, but due to lack of information on salmon distribution, an assessment of the impact on salmon could not be performed. In addition the catches are rather small at the time when the salmon are thought to move through these areas. For the other nations no disaggregated data were provided, and the Study Group used quarterly catch records from ICES working group reports. Due to lack of data, a complete overview of boats and gear types used could not be made. Section 4. The Study Group received some information on whether salmon have been detected in the screening of catches performed by various countries and this is summarized in Table 4. 2. 1. Some methods of screening catches for bycatches are described in more detail. Information of salmon registered from logbooks from catches landed in the Netherlands was provided to the Study Group. A large proportion of these “salmon” may be sea trout due to lack of proper headings to enable discrimination between different salmonid species. The bycatches are small but consistently occurring, and the largest bycatches have been reported from various types of trawl fisheries. Also in Iceland adult salmon have been observed in various trawl fisheries. These records indicate that bycatches of adult salmon may be more frequently occurring than previously thought. An EU regulation launched in 1998 rendered landing of salmon from non-static gear illegal and after that the Dutch recorded bycatches have gone down from more than 1000 kg to less than 20 kg annually. The Study Group evaluated the advantages and constraints of different on board and land based screening methods and concluded that observer based screening on board following different protocols for different species is the most effective way of screening. Screening discards from filleting factories should also be explored as a source of information. Section 5. The Study Group explored analytical methods to allow catch rates of salmon in research surveys to be extrapolated to catch rates in commercial fisheries. Comparing research results form surveys and observer based screening on board, the Group considered that the best method of estimating bycatches of salmon would be derived from direct observation on board commercial pelagic fishing vessels performed according to agreed protocols. These estimates would be based on consistent gear types and fishing methods and would not require any assumptions about the transferability of research catches. A range of estimates of potential post-smolt bycatch based on the data available at the meeting were developed (Table 5. 1) as illustration of the likely ranges of values obtained by applying different methods to the mackerel fishery in the Norwegian Sea. The purpose was to assess the performance of the various methods. There are obvious risks of over- or underestimations depending on which sources used for scaling up with commercial catch. These need to be discussed further when more adequate data sets are available. Section 6. The Study Group was presented with a method for estimating the progress in time and space of post-smolts cohorts in the Norwegian Sea, the “smolt passage model”. Based on data from research surveys on the north – south extension of the post-smolt cohorts, the minimum time the main concentration of post-smolts migration through a fishing area can be estimated at different anticipated migration speeds (1 – 2 body lengths s- 1), and the time of overlap between fisheries and post-smolts can be assessed. The model is based on a rather limited set of data today, and needs further refinement when more data become available, but the group considers it a useful tool assessing and minimizing the risk of post-smolts being intercepted by the commercial fishery in the area of passage. Section 7. A set of ten recommendations for following up is given. These pertain to continuation of screening research and commercial catches for salmon, on board observer based screening of commercial catches and establishment of protocols for screening of salmon bycatches in catches of different species, screening of discards at filleting factories, development of methods of estimating of salmon post-smolt bycatches primarily via observer screening programmes on commercial fishing vessels. The application of a range of bycatch estimates to known data on salmon abundance and survival trends in the stocks in question is recommended to determine whether crude levels of potential bycatch can account for recent changes in abundance or survival at sea. Under a range of bycatch rate scenarios the scale and nature of any tagging programme that would be required to yield reliable estimates of bycatch should be determined. It is not considered appropriate to reconvene the SGBYSAL until disaggregated catch data for the mackerel fishery in the Norwegian Sea and for other fisheries and areas where such data are lacking become available...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor {{fisheries}} management purposes, {{it is essential}} to take into account spatial and seasonal haracteristics of fishing activities to allowa reliable assessment of fishing impact on resource. This paper presents a novel technique for describing spatial and temporal patterns in fishing effort. The spatial and seasonal fishing activity patterns of the French trawler fleet in the Celtic Sea during the period 1991 - 1998 were analysed by modelling fishing effort (fishing time) with generalised linear models. The linear model for fishing effort included fixed effects for both spatial (<b>statistical</b> <b>rectangles)</b> and temporal units (months). In addition, spatial correlations in any given monthwere modelled by an exponentially decreasing function. Temporal correlations were included using the previous month's fishing effort for a given spatial unit as predictor. A method based on cluster analysis of estimated model coefficients of spatial or temporal fixed effects is proposed for identifying groups of similar spatial and temporal units. A contiguity constraint is imposed in the clustering algorithm, ensuring that only neighbouring spatial units or consecutive temporal units are grouped. The cluster analysis identified 22 spatial and 9 temporal groups. Winter and spring months stood out as being more variable than the remaining months. Spatial groups were of varying size, and generally larger offshore. The proposed method is generic and could for example be used to analyse temporal and spatial patterns in catch or catch rate dat...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) are {{generally}} {{considered as one}} of the most important tools, among the many regulations, designed to preserve marine resources as well as enhance fisheries. In the southern Bay of Biscay, local French fishermen requested creation of a restricted area to help settle disputes between the various métiers operating there. This restricted area, which lies mainly in French waters, covers part of a deep submarine canyon off the French and Spanish coasts, known to have a large population of mature hake. This study aims to better understand the effects of a restricted area upon French fleets operating there, particularly upon three main métiers-longliners, gillnetters and trawlers. The study area includes three ICES <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangles.</b> The data, based upon reported landings and auctions sales for the period 1985 - 2008, were analyzed using multivariate analysis. The fishing activity is more important in one rectangle which includes the restricted area. Bottom longliners and gillnetters, operate mainly in this one while trawlers are less dependent. The first métier concentrates particularly on hake and the second has targeted other species and has become less dependent on hake. Trawlers target a wider range of species. Over the past ten years, the restricted area has contributed to maintain the fleets operating here. The border with Spain adds other constraints over the issue of access to regional fisheries and makes management a little more complicated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. How do {{fishermen}} choose {{where to}} fish? A logistic random utility model (RUM) of fisher location choice by beam trawlers {{in the southwest}} of England was used to help answer this question. The RUM was parameterised {{using data from the}} EU vessel monitoring system, the UK logbook Fishing Activity database and the UK Fishing Vessel Register from 2005 to 2008. Individual vessel location choices and model variables were aggregated to ICES <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangles</b> (approximately 30 nautical miles square) by month. The model outputs show that vessels in southwest England made location choices (in 2005 - 2007) based on recent economic returns (value of catch per hour fished) in the month prior and in the previous year in the same month. Vessel skippers also made decisions based on the economic returns of the entire fleet; and tended to choose locations that yielded higher economic returns to the fleet compared to other available locations. This suggests a transfer of knowledge on what others in the fleet are catching and where. Beam trawlers also appeared to be risk-averse, preferring to fish locations closer to their homeport, and at locations with less variance in the value of catch per unit effort at a location, even if the economic returns could be high elsewhere. Vessels also preferred to fish in deeper water, particularly the larger vessels of the fleet. To evaluate the models predictive ability, we compared 2008 location choices with predicted choices using the 2005 - 2007 model coefficients. The model correctly predicted vessels not fishing in a rectangle in 97...|$|R
40|$|It becomes in many cases, routine, {{to collect}} {{acoustic}} data during bottom trawl surveys, both during and between trawls providing “on station” and “underway” acoustic data. Still, {{the combination of}} trawl and acoustic data is not operational and could represent a cost-effective way of improvement: bottom trawl survey use samples taken from very small areas (say 2 n. mi.) as representative of much larger areas (the <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangles)</b> while an acoustic transect from one trawling station to the next one, covers a 20 - 30 n. mi. strip. This study uses 3 different surveys (Norwegian acoustic and bottom trawl survey for cod and haddock in 2000; IBTS (France) in 2002; Northern Irish bottom trawl survey in 2000) where “on station” data are integrated over the trawling sections while “underway” data are regularly integrated over 1, 0. 5 or 0. 1 n. mi. The objective of this exploratory data analysis is to evaluate the consistency between “underway” and “on station” acoustic data. Experimental means and variances of NASC values are first presented. Acoustic observations being autocorrelated, we analysed the consistency between acoustic data using geostatistical tools. The spatial structures (i. e. variograms) of the ‘underway’ acoustic data indicate that fish assemblages are autocorrelated in space. If the variograms of “underway” and of “on station” data indicate the same large distance structures, the “underway” acoustic data provide the opportunity to observe short scale structures that are smaller than the interstations distances. These structures appears as nugget effect on “on station”variograms and may explain why very few structure are observed sometimes “on station”...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the abundance, {{distribution}} and growth of bluemouth in Scottish waters are described. The observations are all based on an ecologically important time-series database of trawl surveys conducted annually between 1925 and 2004 by Fisheries Research Services, Aberdeen. We examine the period 1985 - 2004 in detail. Bluemouth abundance has increased {{over the last decade}} both along the continental shelf west of Scotland and in the North Sea. In 1991 bluemouth appeared in the northern North Sea as a distinct cohort, with total lengths ranging between 6 and 8 cm. 1991 was a year of exceptional Atlantic inflow into the North Sea, and {{it is likely that the}} bluemouth used this water mass as a highway, entering from the north and west as small individuals. The fish from 1991 grew steadily and formed a distinct length mode that we track here until its disappearance in 2002. In the first few years following this influx, bluemouth were recorded all around the northern North Sea, but since 1997 numbers have declined and its distribution has shrunk into one of two International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) <b>statistical</b> <b>rectangles</b> (39 F 1 and 40 F 2) which are positioned in the central part of the North Sea.
