40|$|The {{profitability}} of pig production may be {{expressed as a}} function of reproductivity and productivity. The optimal selection pressure on reproductivity relative to productivity depends on the response to selection and the economic value of the response. Reproductive performance is primarily a function of the dam and involves age at first oestrus, conception rate, litter size and the interval between weaning and oestrus. An increase in the litter size would improve the reproductive performance. Mean litter size has been rather constant in most countries over the last decades. This means that there has been no response to selection or no selection pressure on litter size. It could also imply a relatively deterioration in the environment or negative effects of selection for production characteristics. It has not been established whether selection for litter size is worthwhile. The heritability of the trait, possible selection differential and the economic value of litter size are important components determining the response to selection. Of these, heritability seems to be the major limiting factor. Estimates of this factor have been consistently low (~ 0. 10). A negative correlation between direct genetic and maternal effect might reduce the effective heritability or response to selection. A dam may influence her offspring through the environment she provides as well as through the genes transmitted to the offspring. This environmental effect of the dam on her offspring is referred to as maternal influence. The present study was focussed on the effect of the post-natal maternal conditions on the fertility of the daughter. Maternal influences are partly due {{to the size of the}} litter in which a gilt is raised. Gilts raised in small compared with large litters might produce larger litters. This maternal influence affects h 2 estimated by daughter-dam regression but not h 2 estimated by paternal half sib analysis. It is not clear how important the maternal influence on litter size is. Systematic differences in h 2 estimated by daughter-dam or paternal half sib analysis, have not been found. A negative effect of being raised in large litters on the size of the first litter from gilts raised in large litters was reported (table 2. 6). So maternal effects might counterbalance the response to selection for litter size. The experiments were performed to estimate the effect of standardization level (litter size during the suckling period) on the development of the gilt, age at puberty, size of the first litter and number of corpora lutea after first oestrus of the weaned primiparous sow. The effect of maternal influences on the response to selection was studied by simulation. Three generations of Dutch Landrace gilts were reared. The first generation (192 gilts) was purchased and the litters produced were standardized at 8 piglets within 24 hours of birth. Litters produced by the gilts of generation two were standardized at 6 (low level) or 12 piglets (high level). Thus the effect of the standardization level on production and reproduction traits was measured in gilts of generation three. Gilts were inseminated at a fixed age of approximately 255 days. Growth of litters from birth to weaning at five weeks of age, expressed per piglet, at the high standardization level was 24 % lower than those at the low level. From weaning to 56 days of age the difference was 8 %. This resulted in a weight at 56 days of 15. 8 and 18. 7 kg for gilts raised at the high and low levels respectively. Milk energy intake was ca. 26 % lower for piglets raised in large compared with small litters. The intake of milk and creep feed (ME) from 21 days to weaning was reduced by ca. 19 % (table 5. 1). Relations between intake of milk and creep feed, and growth were stronger at the high than at the low standardization level. Milk production is a limiting factor for growth especially in large litters. The significant weight difference between both standardization level groups at 56 and 74 days of age had disappeared at insemination. At a fixed weight (~ 100 kg) high standardization level gilts deposited more backfat than those standardized at the low level. At the high standardization level 20 % of the gilts that produced a litter did so as a result of insemination at the first oestrus while at the low level this per centage was 49. This result was obtained although the age at first oestrus and conception rate were not affected by the standardization level, and gilts were inseminated at a fixed age. From a total of 111 high and low standardization level gilts which produced a litter, 96 were halothane negative. The estimate of standardization level effect on litter size obtained from halothane negative gilts, after correction for oestrus number at insemination, was - 0. 48 piglets (high-low; table 5. 5). The realized difference in standardization level was 5. 4 piglets which resulted in an estimate of the "m-value", defined by Falconer (1965), of - 0. 09. The coefficient m is the partial regression coefficient of daughters' phenotypic value on mothers' phenotypic value for litter size in the absence of genetic variation among the mothers. This m value can be split into a pre- and a post-natal component m 1 and m 2 (m = m 1 + m 2 ). Uterus weight was higher in low compared with high standardization level sows. The former also tended to have longer uterus horns. A tendency to a higher number of corpora lutea in low than in high standardization level gilts was observed in sows in which oestrus after weaning of the first litter was induced. Results obtained suggest that a low standardization level positively affects weaning weight and development of the uterus. This, in combination with a larger pool of primordial follicles might explain the positive effect on litter size. From a simulation study and derived formulae it was concluded that daughter- dam regression coefficients (trait: first litter size) are seriously biased by pre-and post-natal maternal effects while granddaughter-granddam estimates are biased to a much smaller extent (fig. 5. 5). <b>Standardization</b> <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> will eliminate the post-natal maternal effect as determined by litter size during the suckling period. Maternal influences affect the response to selection in two ways. Firstly the relation between additive genetic value and phenotypic value will be changed. A value of - 0. 1 or - 0. 2 for m reduced the regression coefficient by 5 and 11 % respectively. Secondly, maternal effects result in an important permanent negative effect on litter size as, in a selection programme for litter size, the next generation of gilts will be born and raised in large litters. Selection of boars only from the largest litters does not result in a permanent negative effect. The reduction of the regression coefficient of additive genetic value to phenotypic value by maternal effects can be eliminated by correction of the data. For this purpose accurate estimates of m 1 and m 2 are needed. It is doubtful whether this correction is worthwhile as the effect on the regression coefficient and thus on the response to selection is small. <b>Standardization</b> <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> will be more efficient as it also removes the permanent negative effect on litter size as far as is determined by post- natal maternal effects. It cannot be concluded from a negative daughter-dam correlation for number born that selection of replacement gilts born and raised in large litters would not bring about desirable genetic changes in litter size. The value of the regression coefficient of additive to phenotypic value is of significance. Over a range of plausible values for m this regression coefficient, and thus genetic change, decreased by 5 to 10 % due to maternal effects. So the genetic implications of maternal effects on litter size are limited. Selection will result in an additive genetic response. The permanent negative environmental effect on litter size, if replacement gilts are born and raised in large litters, does reduce the phenotypic value. To a large extent, <b>standardization</b> <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> will remove this, from an economic point of view, unfavourable effect. The response to several generations of selection for litter size might be zero because of this permanent negative environmental effect and/or the limited size of the experiment. Selection for fertility is possible but is not always evident because too few animals have been used. Large scale experiments or lines in which litters are standardized are needed to improve litter size or overall reproductive performance by selection. Points of interest for the future are - assessing the economically important components of overall reproductive performance - achieving accurate estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations and heritabilities involved - combining the sources of information in an index and - assessing an optimal selection scheme. It may be postulated that the rather constant mean litter size over the last decades is probably caused by a low realized selection pressure. A higher selection pressure in combination with more efficient methods (larger scale experiments, <b>standardization</b> <b>of</b> <b>litters,</b> accurate data collection, combining sources of information) practized over a period of 10 years or more will result in a response to selection which is of economic interest...|$|E
