5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> attacker.|$|E
5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle to do <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is {{one of more than}} 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E

5|$|Not only is {{the park}} historic, but <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mostly {{residential}} surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed {{by some of the}} most famous architects of the late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

Initial sessions for So consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes, although these grew to include a number of percussionists.|$|E
5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E

When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
5|$|The {{record for}} most games played for the club is held by Bob Morton, who made 562 {{appearances}} between 1946 and 1964. Gordon Turner scored 276 goals during his Luton Town career, and is the club's record goalscorer. Mal Donaghy made 58 appearances for Northern Ireland and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Luton Town player who has gained the most caps while with the club. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is the £850,000 paid to Odense Boldklub for Lars Elstrup in 1989, and the highest fees received are the £3,000,000 paid by West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City for Curtis Davies and Rowan Vine in 2005 and 2007 respectively. The highest attendance recorded at Kenilworth Road was 30,069 for the visit of Blackpool in 1959. One Football League record is held by a Luton Town player—the 10 goals scored by forward Joe Payne in 1936 against Bristol Rovers is the most scored in any Football League match by a single player.|$|E
