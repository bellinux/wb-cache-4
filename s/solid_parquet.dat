50|$|Wood {{flooring}} {{can also}} be installed utilizing the glue-down method. This is an especially popular method for <b>solid</b> <b>parquet</b> flooring installations on concrete sub-floors. Additionally, engineered wood flooring may use the glue-down method as well. A layer of mastic is placed onto the sub-floor using a trowel {{similar to those used}} in laying ceramic tile. The wood pieces are then laid on top of the glue and hammered into place using a rubber mallet and a protected 2x4 to create a level floor. Often the parquet floor will require sanding and re-finishing after the glue-down installation method due to the small size pieces.|$|E
