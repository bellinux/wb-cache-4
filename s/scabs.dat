5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or <b>scabs).</b> By day 16–20 <b>scabs</b> had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the recall of the state militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and <b>scabs,</b> increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E
40|$|Ascospores {{produced}} on <b>scabbed</b> {{leaves in the}} leaf litter are {{the main source of}} <b>scab</b> primary inoculum, causing <b>scab</b> infections in apple orchards. The purpose of this experiment, carried out during two years in a commercial organic orchard, was to assess the combined effect of removing leaves from the alleys and ploughing in leaves within the row on <b>scab</b> primary inoculum and therefore on <b>scab</b> epidemics. <b>Scab</b> lesions were monitored on leaves and fruits by assessing <b>scab</b> incidence and <b>scab</b> severity. In 2003, <b>scab</b> severity was monitored at different distances from the unremoved leaf area, in order to estimate ascospore spreading. At fruit harvest, during two years with low (2003) and high (2004) levels of <b>scab</b> development, the leaf litter ploughing in / removal method reduced fruit <b>scab</b> incidence by 82 % and 54 % respectively, and fruit <b>scab</b> severity by 74 % and 68 %. Measures of ascospore spreading indicated that the spreading was not important beyond 20 m from the area where leaves were not removed...|$|R
40|$|A single foliar spray with 2. 5 mM glycinebetaine (GB) {{was applied}} on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cvs. Matilda, Sabina and Saturna grown in a sand bed infested with Streptomyces scabies (Thaxter) Waksman & Henrici at tuber initiation. A period of drought was {{maintained}} after GB treatment to enhance <b>scab</b> infection. Logit models {{were used to}} compare <b>scab</b> incidence in all harvested tubers (n = 622) {{and the type of}} <b>scab</b> in the symptomatic tubers (n = 382), whereas the tuber surface areas covered with <b>scab</b> lesions were compared using ANOVA. A 10 g increase in tuber weight increased the odds of <b>scab</b> incidence by 11. 3 %. <b>Scab</b> incidence was lowest in Sabina and highest in Matilda. Raised <b>scab</b> and superficial <b>scab</b> were common in all cultivars, but pitted <b>scab</b> developed only in a few tubers of Sabina and Matilda. Among the scabby tubers, the incidence of raised <b>scab</b> was highest in Sabina and lowest in Saturna. The mean surface area covered with <b>scab</b> was 32. 8 % in Matilda, 11. 7 % in Saturna and 7. 5 % in Sabina. Treatment with GB slightly reduced the severity of <b>scab</b> symptoms, as shown by the reduction in the proportion of tubers with raised <b>scab</b> among the scabby tubers (odds 0. 60). No effect on the incidence of <b>scab</b> or the tuber area covered with <b>scab</b> lesions was detected following GB treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Potato common <b>scab</b> (Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.) Waksman & Henrici) {{is a major}} {{disease of}} potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), due to the unmarketability of {{affected}} tubers. For identification {{of the most common}} scab-tolerant material, and for developing molecular markers for common <b>scab</b> tolerance, more information is needed on the genetic basis of common <b>scab</b> tolerance. Phenotyping common <b>scab</b> susceptibility is difficult be-cause of the large variability in disease symptoms among tubers from a single plant, ranging from no common <b>scab</b> to severe pits. Two years of field data were collected for <b>scab</b> reaction on a segregating tetraploid population (MSL 603, 160 individuals). Continuous variation in common <b>scab</b> susceptibility phenotype was observed among the progeny, with a normal distribution suggesting common <b>scab</b> diseas...|$|R
5|$|Amanita regalis, {{commonly}} known as the royal fly agaric or the king of Sweden Amanita, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family. Common in Scandinavian countries, it is also found in eastern and northern Europe. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska. The fruit bodies of the fungus somewhat resemble the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), and it was formerly regarded as a variety of this species. A.regalis differs from it in being larger, with a liver-brown cap bearing numerous <b>scabs,</b> and in having a stem which is yellow-ochre at the base, with patches or rings of patches. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains muscimol, the same psychoactive compound found in A.muscaria.|$|E
5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or <b>scabs.</b> However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after <b>scabs</b> have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E
5000|$|Almond <b>scab</b> {{was first}} {{documented}} in almond orchards in the 1950s. However {{it did not}} become a major disease until sprinkler irrigation became popular in the 1980s. By the early 1990s almond <b>scab</b> could be found throughout California almond orchards. <b>Scab</b> infects leaves, fruit, and twigs in almonds causing dark spots to form. <b>Scab</b> lesions look greasy and oily. The major concern with almond <b>scab</b> is partial or complete defoliation of the tree. [...] As with leaf blight use of captan and ziram {{has been shown to}} reduce total incidence of almond <b>scab</b> infection.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Prima' was {{originally}} very resistant to apple <b>scab</b> due {{to having the}} Vf gene. However <b>scab</b> has since evolved around that resistance, and 'Prima' apples are now heavily affected by apple <b>scab</b> in regions where the new apple <b>scab</b> has spread to.

5|$|Smallpox is not notably {{infectious}} in the prodromal {{period and}} viral shedding is usually delayed until {{the appearance of}} the rash, which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent {{during the first week of}} the rash, when most of the skin lesions are intact. Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when <b>scabs</b> form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.|$|E
25|$|Method of storing the material. Wrap the <b>scabs</b> {{carefully}} in paper {{and put them}} into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the <b>scabs</b> dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scab</b> (Venturia inaequalis) is the {{principal}} disease endangering both integrated and organic apple production. <b>Scab</b> pressure tends to build up {{over the years and}} organic farmers rely mainly on copper and sulphur treatments for control. The use of Cu in crop protection received scrutiny in recent years as this metal tends to accumulate in soil and substrates. A number of alternative organic control substances have been proposed, with variable success in <b>scab</b> control. We investigated the effect of these alternative organic <b>scab</b> control measures on several apple varieties with low <b>scab</b> susceptibility. The choice of <b>scab</b> treatments had important effects on the mineral composition of leaves and fruits.

60|$|But {{there is}} more to the {{question}} than has yet been discussed. The labor <b>scab</b> is no more detestable to his brother laborers than is the capitalist <b>scab</b> to his brother capitalists. A capitalist may get most for least in dealing with his laborers, and in so far be a non-scab; but at the same time, in his dealings with his fellow-capitalists, he may give most for least and be the very worst kind of <b>scab.</b> The most heinous crime an employer of labor can commit is to <b>scab</b> on his fellow-employers of labor. Just as the individual laborers have organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the <b>scab</b> laborer, so have the employers organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the <b>scab</b> employer. The employers' federations, associations, and trusts are nothing more nor less than unions. They are organized to destroy <b>scabbing</b> amongst themselves and to encourage <b>scabbing</b> amongst others. For this reason they pool interests, determine prices, and present an unbroken and aggressive front to the labor group.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>SCAB</b> 1 {{is a novel}} plant-specific actin-bundling protein. Results: <b>SCAB</b> 1 {{consists}} of an actin-binding domain, two coiled-coil dimerization domains, and a fused immunoglobulin and pleckstrin homology domain with an atypical binding site for inositol phosphates. Conclusion: <b>SCAB</b> 1 is a dimeric actin cross-linker and may be regulated by inositol signaling. Significance: This work provides a structural framework to understand the function of <b>SCAB</b> 1. <b>SCAB</b> 1 is a novel plant-specific actin-binding protein that binds, bundles, and stabilizes actin filaments and regulates stomatal movement. Here, we dissected the structure and function of <b>SCAB</b> 1 by structural and biochemical approaches. We show that <b>SCAB</b> 1 is composed of an actin-binding domain, two coiled-coil (CC) domains, and a fused immunoglobulin and pleckstrin homology (Ig-PH) domain. We determined crystal structures for the CC 1 and Ig-PH domains at 1. 9 and 1. 7 Å resolution, respectively. The CC 1 domain adopts an antiparallel helical hairpin that further dimerizes into a four-helix bundle...|$|R

50|$|The {{primary cause}} of peach <b>scab,</b> Cladosporium carpophilum, can be found {{primarily}} in the Southern portion of the U.S. but still poses a threat in the Midwest. Peach <b>scab</b> affects stony fruits such as peaches, nectarines, and apricots. Like most fungal diseases, peach <b>scab</b> thrives in warm and moist conditions. As a fungus, adequate shade {{plays an important role}} in growth—particularly in areas lacking good sanitation. Poor pruning of branches/foliage can result in disease breakouts of peach <b>scab.</b> A combination of wet weather from late spring as well as poor sanitation can result in outbreaks later in the season.
