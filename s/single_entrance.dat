5|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|Kirkcaldy Galleries {{is home to}} the town's {{museum and}} art gallery and central library. The {{building}} opened in 1925 under its former name of Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery and was extended to provide a main library in 1928. In 2011, the building was closed to allow a £2.4million renovation which was completed in June 2013. The work resulted in the integration of the facilities within the building through a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> and reception desk. The building also adopted its present name.|$|E
5|$|Rainier Beach station {{consists}} of a single, at-grade island platform in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South {{on the south side}} of South Henderson Street. The station has a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> at Henderson, accessible via two crosswalks. A small plaza on the northeast corner of the intersection has seating, 20 bicycle lockers, a bus stop, and public art. Rainier Beach station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Built for the {{protection}} of a small stupa, the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings. The lower platform is entered through a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> facing the north, while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points. The upper platform, surrounded by a brick wall, contains the stupa. Four Buddha statues are seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here, presumably to support a wooden roof. The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings. Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage, such as its sandakada pahanas, are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features. Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof, this theory is disputed by others.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E

5|$|Ants of this genus {{prefer to}} inhabit grasslands, forests, heath, urban areas and {{woodland}}. Nests {{are found in}} Callitris forest, dry marri forest, Eucalyptus woodland and forests, mallee scrub, in paddocks, riparian woodland, and wet and dry sclerophyll forests. They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally. The nest gradually expands as the colony grows larger. Nests {{can be found in}} debris, decaying tree stumps, rotten logs, rocks, sand, and soil, and under stones. While most species nest underground, M. mjobergi is an arboreal nesting species found on epiphytic ferns of the genus Platycerium. Two types of nests have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound. Some species construct dome-shaped mounds containing a <b>single</b> <b>entrance,</b> but some nests have numerous holes that are constantly used and can extend several metres underground. Sometimes, these mounds can be 0.5 m (20in) high. Workers decorate these nests with a variety of items, including charcoal, leaves, plant fragments, pebbles, and twigs. Some ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat quickly, providing the nest with solar energy traps.|$|E
25|$|Knook Castle is {{the site}} of an Iron Age univallate hillfort on Knook Down, near the village of Knook in Wiltshire, England, but within the civil parish of Upton Lovell. It has also been {{interpreted}} as a defensive cattle enclosure associated with nearby Romano-British settlements. It is roughly rectangular in plan with a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> on the south/southeast side, but with a later break in the wall on the western side.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{structure}} {{still standing}} is the log cabin, built ca. 1890. It is a ten by fifteen foot rectangle, {{the exterior of}} the building is covered with finished planks, fitted at the corners. The <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> faces south, away from the Milligan ditch. Its wood-shingled roof is side-gabled with a medium pitch. There is a fireplace on its east side, with a small window on the corresponding west end of the building.|$|E

50|$|F. cunicularia has habitat {{ranging from}} open to {{relatively}} cluttered to visually rich. In Finland, Albrecht {{found that all}} nests were small, with <b>single</b> <b>entrances</b> in dry, hot environments with low vegetation. They nest under stones or in small earth mounds. Nests are usually separate, containing one queen. F. cunicularia, unlike most other Formica fusca-group species, can form noticeable hillocks over its nests, {{and in addition to}} these produces rufibarbis-like runs in the vicinity of its nest.|$|R
25|$|The next {{buildings}} were all {{built in the}} 1940s. These include the other two sheds. The wooden shed is about ten by fifteen feet, with a gable roof of medium pitch, sheathed in corrugated metal. Its exterior walls are covered in shiplap wood siding. Its <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> is off centered on the southern side, and has two small windows. Next to this wooden shed is a small corrugated metal shed. Its walls and roof are of corrugated metal, with the roof being shed-style sloping towards the ditch.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Syria and the Jazira includes the widest {{variety of forms}} in the medieval Islamic world, being influenced by the surviving {{architecture of}} Late Antiquity, contemporary Christian buildings, and Islamic architecture from the east. There are some muqarnas domes of the Iraqi type, but most domes are slightly pointed hemispheres on either muqarnas pendentives or double zones of squinches and made of masonry, rather than brick and plaster. The domes cover single bay structures or are {{just a part of}} larger constructions. Syrian mausoleums consist of a square stone chamber with a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> and a mihrab and a brick lobed dome with two rows of squinches. The dome at the Silvan Mosque, 13.5 meters wide and built from 1152-1157, has an unusual design similar to the dome added to the Friday Mosque of Isfahan in 1086-1087: once surrounded by roofless aisles on three sides, it may have been meant to be an independent structure. The congregational mosque at Kızıltepe, with its well integrated dome of about 10 meters, is the masterpiece of Artuqid architecture.|$|E
25|$|As {{is common}} at {{domestic}} matches in England, opposing supporters were segregated. Nottingham Forest supporters were allocated the South Stands and Spion Kop {{on the east}} end, with a combined capacity of 29,800, reached by 60 turnstiles spaced along {{two sides of the}} ground. Liverpool supporters were allocated the North and West ends (Leppings Lane), holding 24,256 fans, reached by 23 turnstiles from a narrow concourse. Turnstiles numbered 1 to 10, 10 in all, provided access to 9,700 seats in the North Stand; a further 6 turnstiles (numbered 11 to 16) provided access to 4,456 seats in the upper tier of the West Stand. Finally, 7 turnstiles (lettered A to G) provided access to 10,100 standing places in the lower tier of the West Stand. Although Liverpool had more supporters, Nottingham Forest was allocated the larger area, to avoid the approach routes of rival fans crossing. As a result of the stadium layout and segregation policy, turnstiles that would normally have been used to enter the North Stand from the east were off-limits and all Liverpool supporters had to converge on a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> at Leppings Lane. On match day, radio and television advised fans without tickets not to attend. Rather than establishing crowd safety as the priority, clubs, local authorities and the police viewed their roles and responsibilities through the 'lens of hooliganism'.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{crime has}} been a problem for the South Acton estate and it has {{attracted}} a reputation as a dangerous estate, with high levels of drug use and dealing, and other associated anti-social behaviour. The high levels of crime stem from a combination of poor design on parts of the estate that bear some of the features Alice Coleman identified in Utopia on Trial of <b>single</b> <b>entrances</b> with multiple users, as well as complex deck access. It is also a result of a residualised social housing policy that has polarised entrants to social housing into the lowest income categories.|$|R

A <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> fee of one shilling (or {{a ticket for}} the summer season, costing 10s6d) was charged for entrance into the grounds, which included the gardens, the athletic grounds, the ballroom and the theatre. An additional charge of sixpence was levied on those who wished {{to go to the}} top of the tower. There was a menagerie within the building, containing Nubian lions, Russian wolves (which had eight cubs in 1914), bears in a bear pit, monkeys, elephants, stags, leopards and other animals. There was also an aviary above the ballroom. The Tower Building also contained a shooting gallery and a billiard saloon with five tables.|$|E

500|$|University Street {{station was}} {{designed}} in a high-tech motif {{to complement the}} modernist architecture found in 1980s-era office buildings in the adjacent Financial District; architectural elements were used to create the desired atmosphere in the station, including linear stainless steel light fixtures over the platforms, glass railings on the mezzanines, and colorful granite to highlight platform benches and information signs. The station has two side platforms located below two mezzanines at {{the north and south}} ends of the station box: the north mezzanine is accessible through the parking garage of the Cobb Building at 3rd Avenue and Seneca Street as well as the west side of Benaroya Hall at 2nd Avenue and University Street, connected through a level walkway underneath the venue; the south mezzanine is accessible from a <b>single</b> <b>entrance</b> located in 1201 Third Avenue near 3rd Avenue and Seneca Street.

500|$|Most {{of these}} ants nest in soil, but some prefer {{to live under}} rocks, rotten wood, {{and in some cases}} in sandy beaches and footpaths. Certain species will avoid nesting in sandy soil. Nests will vary in appearance; most species live in small mounds with a <b>single</b> <b>entrance,</b> while other species create large mounds covered in pebbles with {{multiple}} entrances. [...] Some colonies are known to create [...] "super-nests": workers construct many nests connected through established paths, extending up to [...] in length. In one extreme case, a single colony was found to occupy over 10 hectares of land with 85 individual nests and 1,500 entrance holes. While meat ants are never aggressive to their nest mates, they will be aggressive to those who live in different nests within the same colony. Nests may be above or below ground, with some species such as I. conifer alternating between the two; during winter, nests will be constructed above in twigs, with the ants moving back underground during the warmer months. Underground nests are located near areas where food sources are present. Colonies will relocate their nests to areas where there are reasonable levels of sunlight during winter.|$|E
