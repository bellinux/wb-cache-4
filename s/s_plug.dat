The fire appears to have {{originated}} at the wall connection where the Tesla charging equipment was plugged in. Shortly afterwards, Tesla updated the Model S firmware to reduce charging current when power fluctuations were detected and replaced wall adapters with a new unit containing a thermal fuse.|$|R
50|$|The 106th Cavalry Group {{arrived in}} France {{under the command}} of Colonel Vennard Wilson, a Regular Army officer. They were first {{committed}} to combat on 2 July 1944 with the VIII Corps. Its first mission was to assist in the reduction of German forces previously isolated during the VIII Corps advance in the Normandy Peninsula. The next mission was an offensive screening mission, which led from Normandy south through St. James, Isigny, La Haye-du-Puits, Manche, Basse-Normandie, Coutance, and Avaranches, to Rennes. With the quick advance, gaps appeared between VIII and XV Corps, and General George <b>S.</b> Patton <b>plugged</b> the gap between Louvigne and Rennes with the 106th Cavalry Group.|$|R
50|$|In Italy, CEI 23-50 is the {{dominant}} standard and it includes also Schuko sockets (P 30 = CEE 7/3) and <b>plugs</b> (<b>S</b> 30 = CEE 7/4, S 31 = CEE 7/7, S 32 = CEE 7/17). Appliances are commonly sold with Schuko-type plugs (as well as Europlugs), while Italian-type plugs have become rare today and almost only power strips, cable reels and adaptors are sold with them. Some sockets (P 30 and P 40) accept both types, the remainder accepting one or the other. Schuko sockets are most commonly used for larger-rated appliances such as washing machines, and are particularly common in South Tyrol, with its cultural, economic and tourist connections with Austria.|$|R
50|$|The D-sub {{series of}} {{connectors}} {{was introduced by}} Cannon in 1952. Cannon's part-numbering system uses D as the prefix for the whole series, followed by one of A, B, C, D, or E denoting the shell size, followed {{by the number of}} pins or sockets, followed by either P (plug or pins) or S (socket) denoting the gender of the part. Each shell size usually (see below for exceptions) corresponds to a certain number of pins or sockets: A with 15, B with 25, C with 37, D with 50, and E with 9. For example, DB-25 denotes a D-sub with a 25-position shell size and a 25-position contact configuration. The contacts in each row of these connectors are spaced 326/3000 of an inch apart, or approximately 0.1087 in, and the rows are spaced 0.112 in apart; the pins in the two rows are offset by half the distance between adjacent contacts in a row. This spacing is called normal density. The suffixes M and F (for male and female) are sometimes used instead of the original P and <b>S</b> for <b>plug</b> and socket.|$|R
40|$|Experimental studies {{document}} that increased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) blood levels inhibit NOS significantly, reducing NO generation. ADMA measurement often needs sample cleanup by SPE prior to chromatography and precolumn derivatization that cannot be easily employed in a routine clinical setting. We {{set up a}} new reliable CE method to measure ADMA, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and arginine without sample extraction or precolumn derivatization in order to examine their concentrations in human plasma. Sample was concentrated prior to CE injection and analytes were monitored by UV detection. CE analysis was performed in an uncoated fused-silica capillary, 75 μm id and 60. 2 cm length (50 cm to the detection window), injecting 1 <b>s</b> water <b>plug</b> (0. 5 psi) followed by 10 s of the sample (0. 5 psi). Separation was carried out in a 50 mmol/L Tris-phosphate run buffer at pH 2. 30, 15 °C and 15 kV (75 μA) at normal polarity. Recovery of plasma ADMA was 101 - 104 % and inter-day CV was less than 3 %. Assay performance was evaluated measuring the levels of arginine and its dimethyl derivatives in 77 subjects. Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman test for methods comparison suggest that the data obtained by our method and by a reference CE-LIF assay are similar...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} {{conditions}} required to form nanoliter-sized droplets (plugs) of viscous aqueous reagents in flows of immiscible carrier fluid within microfluidic channels. For both non-viscous (viscosity of 2. 0 mPa s) and viscous (viscosity of 18 mPa <b>s)</b> aqueous solutions, <b>plugs</b> formed reliably in {{a flow of}} water-immiscible carrier fluid for Capillary number less than 0. 01, although plugs were able to form at higher Capillary numbers at lower ratios of the aqueous phase flow rate to the flow rate of the carrier fluid (in all the experiments performed, the Reynolds number was less than 1). The paper also shows that combining viscous and non-viscous reagents can enhance mixing in droplets moving through straight microchannels by providing a nearly ideal initial distribution of reagents within each droplet. The study should facilitate {{the use of this}} droplet-based microfluidic platform for investigation of protein crystallization, kinetics, and assays...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{investigation}} of isovaleraldehyde (ISOV) photocatalytic oxidation {{was conducted at}} initial concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mg/m 3 and different relative humidities (5 - 90 % RH) in order to characterize the process performances close to indoor air conditions. Experiments were carried out in two different reactors: cylinder and flat-plate photoreactor (planar reactor) at different air gap (20 - 60 mm) and gas residence times (0. 67 - 5. 0 <b>s).</b> A <b>plug</b> flow reactor system was developed in order to perform kinetic studies of (i) isovaleraldehyde removal, (ii) selectivity of CO 2, (iii) byproducts formation and removal. It appears that ISOV removal efficiencies increased with lower inlet concentrations, lower air gap and higher gas residence times. In small amounts, the presence of water vapor has a promoting effect on the degradation due {{to the formation of}} OH* radicals. Evaluating different kinetic models by least squares analysis, it was shown that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) model could give a good correlation with the experimental results. Thus, the effect of ISOV gas-phase concentration, air gap and light intensity on chemical conversion rates is discussed. A kinetic model based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) approach and taking into account the mass transfer step was developed. This allows us to determine L-H constants regardless of the transfer aspect. This last is estimated by semi-empirical correlation. The separation between the mass transfer and the chemical reaction steps is obtained. The effect of UV light intensity is also considered...|$|R

40|$|Angiogenesis is {{a crucial}} step in the growth and {{metastasis}} of cancers. Curcumin inhibits tumor initiation and growth. We analyzed the effect of curcumin on endothelial cell migration, attachment, and tube formation on Matrigel. Curcumin {{had no effect on}} endothelial cell migration or attachment to either plastic or Matrigel. Curcumin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tube formation when the cells were treated before plating or at the time of plating on Matrigel. Curcumin treatment also caused the preformed tubes to break down. Curcumin inhibited angiogenesis in a <b>s.</b> c. Matrigel <b>plug</b> model in mice. The role of metalloproteinases {{has been shown to be}} important in angiogenesis; therefore, zymography was performed to determine whether curcumin affected protease activity. Zymographs of curcumin-treated culture supernatants showed a decrease in the gelatinolytic activities of secreted 53 - and 72 -kDa metalloproteinases. Western and Northern analysis showed a dose-dependent decrease in the protein expression and transcript of 72 kDa, indicating that curcumin may be exerting its inhibitory effect at both the transcriptional and posttranscnptional level. These findings suggest that curcumin acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor by modulating protease activity during endothelial morphogenesis. Curcumin could be developed as an antiangiogenic drug...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Angiogenesis is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation as well as tube formation. These processes are stimulated {{by a variety of}} growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGFinduced cytoskeletal reorganization plays {{a crucial role in the}} angiogenic processes. In the present study, we evaluated the role of calpain in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMEC) were incubated with VEGF (10 – 60 ng/ml) for 2 – 24 h, after which we measured calpain activities, protein contents of the calpain subunits and of calpastatin, endothelial monolayer wound repair, tube formation, and actin cytoskeleton changes. Incubation of PMEC with VEGF resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in calpain activity and protein content of calpain- 2. VEGF did not change the protein contents of calpain- 1 and the small subunit or of calpastatin. Incubation of PMEC with a VEGF receptor blocker prevented the VEGF-induced increase in calpain activity. Inhibition of calpain activity by siRNA directed against calpain- 2 and by overexpression of calpastatin prevented VEGF-induced increases in actin stress fibers in endothelial cells and angiogenesis. Overexpression of calpastatin also inhibits vessel formation in subcutaneous (<b>s.</b> c.) matrigel <b>plugs</b> in mice. These results indicate that calpain mediates VEGFinduced angiogenic effects by modulating actin cytoskeleta...|$|R
40|$|The cytokine/extracellular {{matrix protein}} osteopontin (OPN/Eta- 1) is an {{important}} component of cellular immunity and inflammation. It also acts as a survival, cell-adhesive, and chemotactic factor for endothelial cells. Here, subtractive suppression hybridization showed that serum-deprived murine aortic endothelial (MAE) cells transfected with the angiogenic fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF 2) overexpress OPN compared with parental cells. This was confirmed by Northern blotting and Western blot analysis of the conditioned media in different clones of endothelial cells overexpressing FGF 2 and in endothelial cells treated with the recombinant growth factor. In vivo, FGF 2 caused OPN expression in newly formed endothelium of the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and of murine <b>s.</b> c. Matrigel <b>plug</b> implants. Recombinant OPN (rOPN), the fusion protein GST-OPN, and the deletion mutant GST-DeltaRGD-OPN were angiogenic in the CAM assay. Angiogenesis was also triggered by OPN-transfected MAE cells grafted onto the CAM. OPN-driven neovascularization was independent from endothelial alpha(v) beta(3) integrin engagement and was always paralleled by the appearance of a massive mononuclear cell infiltrate. Accordingly, rOPN, GST-OPN, GST-DeltaRGD-OPN, and the conditioned medium of OPN-overexpressing MAE cells were chemotactic for isolated human monocytes. Also, rOPN triggered a proangiogenic phenotype in human monocytes by inducing the expression of the angiogenic cytokines TNF-alpha and IL- 8. OPN-mediated recruitment of proangiogenic monocytes may represent a mechanism of amplification of FGF 2 -induced neovascularization during inflammation, wound healing, and tumor growth...|$|R
40|$|Fibroblast growth factor- 8 b (FGF 8 b) exerts nonredundant autocrine/paracrine {{functions}} in steroid hormone-regulated tumors. Previous observations {{had shown that}} the soluble pattern recognition receptor long pentraxin- 3 (PTX 3) is a natural selective antagonist for a restricted number of FGF family members, inhibiting FGF 2 but not FGF 1 and FGF 4 activity. Here, we assessed the capacity of PTX 3 to antagonize FGF 8 b and to inhibit the vascularization and growth of steroid hormone-regulated tumors. Surface plasmon resonance analysis shows that PTX 3 binds FGF 8 b with high affinity (K d = 30 - 90 nmol/L). As a consequence, PTX 3 prevents the binding of FGF 8 b to its receptors, inhibits FGF 8 b-driven ERK 1 / 2 activation, cell proliferation, and chemotaxis in endothelial cells, and suppresses FGF 8 b-induced neovascularization in vivo. Also, PTX 3 inhibits dihydrotestosterone (DHT) - and FGF 8 b-driven proliferation of androgen-regulated Shionogi 115 (S 115) mouse breast tumor cells. Furthermore, DHT-treated, PTX 3 overexpressing hPTX 3 -S 115 cell transfectants show a reduced proliferation rate in vitro and a limited angiogenic activity in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane and murine <b>s.</b> c. Matrigel <b>plug</b> assays. Accordingly, hPTX 3 -S 115 cells show a dramatic decrease of their tumorigenic activity when grafted in immunodeficient male mice. These results identify PTX 3 as a novel FGF 8 b antagonist endowed with antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activity with possible implications for the therapy of hormonal tumor...|$|R
40|$|The {{preignition}} {{characteristics of}} the R- 2800 cylinder, as effected by fuel consumption, engine operating variables, and spark plug type and condition, were evaluated. The effects on preignition-limited performance of various percentages of aromatics (benzene, toluene, cumene, xylene) in a base fuel of triptane were investigated. Two paraffins (triptane and S + 6. 0 ml TEL/gal) and two refinery blends (28 -R and 33 -R) were preignition rated. The effect {{of changes in the}} following engine operating variables on preignition limit was determined: inlet-air temperature, rear spark plug gasket temperature, engine speed, spark advance, tappet clearance, and oil consumption. Preignition limits of the R- 2800 cylinder using Champion C 34 S and C 35 S and AC-LS 86, LS 87, and LS 88 spark plugs were established and the effect of spark plug deterioration was investigated. No definite trends in preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure were indicated for aromatics as a class when increased percentages of different aromatics were added to a base fuel of triptane. Three types of fuel (aromatics, paraffins, and refinery blends) showed a preignition range for this cylinder from 65 to 104 percent when based on the performance of S plus 6. 0 ml TEL per gallon as 100 percent. The R- 2800 cylinder is therefore relatively insensitive to fuel composition when compared to a CFR F- 4 engine, which had a pre-ignition range from 72 to 100 percent for the same fuels. Six engine operating variables were investigated with the following results: preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure decreased, with increases in engine speed, rear spark plug gasket temperature, inlet-air temperature, and spark advance beyond 20 F B. T. C. and was unaffected by rate of oil consumption or by tappet clearance. Spark plugs were rated over a range of preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure from 200 to 390 pounds per square inch at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 07 in the following order of increased resistance to preignition: AC-LS 97, AC-LS 88, Champion C 358, AC-LS 86, and Champion C 34 <b>S.</b> Spark <b>plug</b> deterioration in the form of cracks in the porcelain had been broken away from the center electrode and were retained in the spark plug cavity, the preignition limit was decreased as much as 57 percent.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. As {{a result}} of Federal Department of Transportation {{initiatives}} for native roadside planting mandates, many states are increasing native plant utilization on roadsides. Although efforts to use native Hawaiian plants were initiated {{as early as the}} mid 1990 s, it was not until 2006 that studies for developing species-specific roadside establishment protocols were conducted (Baldos, DeFrank and Sakamoto 2010). Many native Hawaiian plants such as Myoporum, Dodonaea, Vitex, Sida, Scaevola, and Sapindus have a broad range of elevation adaptation. Thus they can be grown in coastal, inland, and upland Hawaiian conditions (Bornhorst 1994). Native species {{with a wide range of}} location adaptability represent roadside re-vegetation candidates with a high potential for successful establishment and long term persistence. The native grass Sporobolus virginicus (Akiaki grass), has been planted on Maui along the Mokulele highway corridor. In this project <b>S.</b> virginicus transplanted <b>plugs</b> took an unusual 3 years to establish because of the lack of information on roadside establishment and difficulties in weed control and irrigation (Baldos et al. 2010). The cost of establishing S. virginicus was estimated at $ 142, 600 per hectare compared to traditional Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) which costs only $ 87, 700 (Baldos et al. 2010). The Mokulele planting exemplifies the need for well developed roadside native planting establishment protocols, which incorporate techniques for large scale plantings and weed control. In this thesis, herbicides will be characterized for safety and effectiveness during the establishment of native Hawaiian species identified as candidates for road-side plantings...|$|R
40|$|White mold {{caused by}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum attacks a wide host range of broad-leafed plants which {{includes}} potatoes. Current control {{is limited to}} the use of chemicals, but biological control has emerged as an eco-friendly alternative. For the study, 19 bacterial strains and 18 fungal strains obtained from soil samples taken from a potato field naturally infested with the pathogen S. sclerotiorum were tested for the effects on S. sclerotiorum mycelium growth and sclerotia viability in vitro. A total of eight bacterial strains and six fungal strains proved to be effective in the inhibition of S. sclerotiorum mycelium growth on PDA plate using a dual culture technique. These antagonistic microbes were six Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilis, Bacillus marisflavi, Fusarium solani, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium chlamydosporum, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus insuetus and Penicillium citrinum. There was a significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the interaction between S. sclerotiorum mycelium growth and the time after inoculation with a <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum mycelium <b>plug</b> for both bacterial and fungal soil isolates. An additional sclerotia viability test was carried out using four of the eight antagonistic bacteria, and six of the antagonistic fungi. The results showed that two Bacillus species, namely B. pumilis and B. marisflavi can effectively reduce sclerotia viability. The other two bacteria (both B. subtilis), recorded low percentage reduction in sclerotia viability. As for the six antagonistic fungi, the viability test proved to be less effective in determining sclerotia viability. However, the result of this study supports the use of bio-control agents, not only because they are environmentally friendly, but because they are also an effective way of controlling the plant pathogen, S. sclerotioru...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{morphological}} bonding of the F 2000 Restorative System (3 M Dental Product) to enamel and dentin. For this purpose, high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) in conjunction with a tensile bond strength analysis was used to correlate the morphological findings to the bonding potential. Scotchbond 1 (SB 1) adhesive system was utilized as a control. Materials and methods: Teeth were prepared in vivo and prepared as: (1) F 2000 PA for 15 s, (2) F 2000 PA for 30 s, (3) 35 % phosphoric acid for 15 s and SB 1 and (4) 35 % phosphoric acid for 30 s and SB 1. All teeth were then restored with the F 2000 compomer restorative material, extracted, sectioned and analyzed by means of a field emission in-lens SEM (FEISEM). The conditioning/etching patterns of the two adhesive systems were also evaluated in vitro on dentin disks in order to show high resolution details of every single step of the bonding procedure. Results: FEISEM images showed a repetitive pattern of the enamel crystals with several microporosities after the 30 s application of F 2000 PA; moreover a good adaptation of the adhesive resin on the conditioned enamel was observable. FEISEM analysis of the dentin surface revealed no evidence of a smear layer after the application of F 2000 PA for 30 <b>s.</b> Residual smear <b>plugs</b> were partially obliterating the tubule orifices when F 2000 PA was used, while they were completely absent after etching with 35 % phosphoric acid. The total etching technique revealed open tubules and resin tags formation after the application of SB 1. Conclusions: The one step etching/priming/bonding procedure of the F 2000 PA showed favorable results at ultra-structural level when applied on both the enamel and the dentin surface for 30 s (as per manufactures’ instructions), but the bond strength analysis showed higher values of bonding of the F 2000 compomer when the SB 1 adhesive agent (after etching with 35 % phosphoric acid) was used (7. 7 ± 2. 2 vs 19. 0 ± 4. 4 MPa) ...|$|R
40|$|Trace {{amounts of}} mercury {{are found in}} all coals. During combustion, or during thermal {{treatment}} in advanced coal processes, this mercury is vaporized and can be released to the atmosphere with the ultimate combustion products. This has been {{a cause for concern}} for a number of years, and has resulted in a determination by the EPA to regulate and control these emissions. Present technology does not, however, provide inexpensive ways to capture or remove mercury. Mercury that exits the furnace in the oxidized form (HgCl{sub 2 }) is known to much more easily captured in existing pollution control equipment (e. g., wet scrubbers for SO{sub 2 }), principally due to its high solubility in water. Work funded by DOE has helped understand the chemical kinetic processes that lead to mercury oxidation in furnaces. The scenario is as follows. In the flame the mercury is quantitatively vaporized as elemental mercury. Also, the chlorine in the fuel is released as HCl. The direct reaction Hg+HCl is, however, far too slow to be of practical consequence in oxidation. The high temperature region does supports a small concentration of atomic chlorine. As the gases cool (either in the furnace convective passes, in the quench prior to cold gas cleanup, or within a sample probe), the decay in Cl atom is constrained by the slowness of the principal recombination reaction, Cl+Cl+M{yields}Cl{sub 2 }+M. This allows chlorine atom to hold a temporary, local superequilibrium concentration. Once the gases drop below about 550 C, the mercury equilibrium shifts to favor HgCl{sub 2 } over Hg, and this superequilibrium chlorine atom promotes oxidation via the fast reactions Hg+Cl+M{yields}HgCl+M, HgCl+Cl+M{yields}HgCl{sub 2 }+M, and HgCl+Cl{sub 2 }{yields}HgCl{sub 2 }+Cl. Thus, the high temperature region provides the Cl needed for the reaction, while the quench region allows the Cl to persist and oxidize the mercury in the absence of decomposition reactions that would destroy the HgCl{sub 2 }. Promoting mercury oxidation is one means of getting moderate-efficiency, 'free' mercury capture when wet gas cleanup systems are already in place. The chemical kinetic model we developed to describe the oxidation process suggests that in fuel lean gases, the introduction of trace amounts of H{sub 2 } within the quench region leads to higher Cl concentrations via chain branching. The amount of additive, and the temperature at the addition point are critical. We investigated this process in a high-temperature quartz flow reactor. The results do indicate a substantial amount of promotion of oxidation with the introduction of relatively small amounts of hydrogen at around 1000 K ({approx} 100 ppm relative to the furnace gas). In practical systems the source of this hydrogen {{is likely to be a}} small natural gas steam reformer. This would also produce CO, so co-injection of CO was also tested. The CO did not provide any additional promotion, and in some cases led to a reduction in oxidation. We also examined the influence of NO and SO{sub 2 } on the promotion process. We did not see any influence under the conditions examined. The present results were for a 0. 5 <b>s,</b> isothermal <b>plug</b> flow environment. The next step should be to determine the appropriate injection point for the hydrogen and the performance under realistic temperature quench conditions. This could be accomplished first by chemical kinetic modeling, and then by tunnel flow experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in hardware and wireless technologies have made mobile communication devices affordable by a vast user community. With {{the advent of}} rich multimedia and social networking content, an influx of myriads of applications, and Internet supported services, there is an increasing user demand for the Internet connectivity anywhere and anytime. Mobility management is thus a crucial requirement for the Internet today. This work targets novel mobility management techniques, designed {{to work with the}} Floating Cloud Tiered (FCT) internetworking model, proposed for a future Internet. We derive the FCT internetworking model from the tiered structure existing among Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks, to define their business and peering relationships. In our novel mobility management scheme, we define Virtual Mobility Domains (VMDs) of various scopes, that can support both intra and inter-domain roaming using a single address for a mobile node. The scheme is network based and hence imposes no operational load on the mobile node. This scheme is the first of its kind, by leveraging the tiered structure and its hierarchical properties, the collaborative network-based mobility management mechanism, and the inheritance information in the tiered addresses to route packets. The contributions of this PhD thesis can be summarized as follows: · We contribute to the literature with a comprehensive analysis of the future Internet architectures and mobility protocols over the period of 2002 - 2012, in light of their identity and handoff management schemes. We present a qualitative evaluation of current and future schemes on a unified platform. · We design and implement a novel user-centric future Internet mobility architecture called Virtual Mobility Domain. VMD proposes a seamless, network-based, unique collaborative mobility management within/across ASes and ISPs in the FCT Internetworking model. The analytical and simulation-based handoff performance analysis of the VMD architecture in comparison with the IPv 6 -based mobility protocols presents the considerable performance improvements achieved by the VMD architecture. · We present a novel and user-centric handoff cost framework to analyze handoff performance of different mobility schemes. The framework helps to examine the impacts of registration costs, signaling overhead, and data loss for Internet connected mobile users employing a unified cost metric. We analyze the effect of each parameter in the handoff cost framework on the handoff cost components. We also compare the handoff performance of IPv 6 -based mobility protocols to the VMD. · We present a handoff cost optimization problem and analysis of its characteristics. We consider a mobility user as the primary focus of our study. We then identify the suitable mathematical methods that can be leveraged to solve the problem. We model the handoff cost problem in an optimization tool. We also conduct a mobility study - best of our knowledge, first of its kind - on providing a guide for finding the number of handoffs in a typical VMD for any given user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> mobility model. <b>Plugging</b> the output of mobility study, we then conduct a numerical analysis to find out optimum VMD for a given user mobility model and check if the theoretical inferences are in agreement with the output of the optimization tool...|$|R
