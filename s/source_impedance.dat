25|$|The gain of an {{amplifier}} is {{the ratio}} of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels. (When measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: G(dB)=10 log(Pout /(Pin)). RF amplifiers are often specified {{in terms of the}} maximum power gain obtainable, while the voltage gain of audio amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers will be more often specified (since the amplifier's input impedance will often be much higher than the <b>source</b> <b>impedance,</b> and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance). For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20dB will have a voltage gain of ten (but a power gain of 100 would only occur in the event the input and output impedances were identical).|$|E
25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., {{power signal}} ripple, non-zero <b>source</b> <b>impedance)</b> {{may lead to}} noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified {{power supply rejection ratio}} that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{proposed}} active source-pull {{measurement technique}} allows {{the creation of}} variable <b>source</b> <b>impedances</b> having true unitary complex reflection coefficients (total reflection at any desired phase). Based {{on the use of}} a reverse six-port reflectometer, frequency-independent <b>source</b> <b>impedances</b> can be synthesized and the power available from the source can also be calculated. The technique is found to be suitable for multi-tone characterization of microwave devices, for use as mixers or broadband power amplifiers. Experimental validations show that the linear measurement accuracy of the proposed technique is about ± 0. 007 ̸ ± 0. 5 ◦ for the reflection coefficients measurements and ± 0. 15 dB for the transducer gain evaluation while the accuracy for the nonlinear measurements is ± 0. 01 ̸ ± 1 ◦ and ± 0. 15 dB...|$|R

2500|$|If the {{comparator}} {{does not}} have internal hysteresis or if the input noise {{is greater than the}} internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input of the comparator. The resulting Schmitt trigger circuit gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the <b>source</b> <b>impedance</b> is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E

2500|$|RF {{condenser}} microphones use {{a comparatively}} low RF voltage, {{generated by a}} low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule {{may be part of}} a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low <b>source</b> <b>impedance.</b> The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The Sennheiser [...] "MKH" [...] series of microphones use the RF biasing technique.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} an artificial neural network-based algorithm to the single-ended fault location of transmission lines using voltage and current data. From the fault location equations, similar to the conventional approach, this method selects phasors of prefault and superimposed voltages and currents from all phases of the transmission line as inputs of the artificial neural network. The outputs of the neural network are the fault position and the fault resistance. With its function approximation ability, the neural network is trained to map the nonlinear relationship existing in the fault location equations with the distributed parameter line model. It can get both fast speed and high accuracy. The influence of the remote-end infeed on neural network structure is studied. A comparison with the conventional method has been done. It is shown that the neural network-based method can adapt itself to big variations of <b>source</b> <b>impedances</b> at the remote terminal. Finally, when the remote <b>source</b> <b>impedances</b> vary in small ranges, the structure of artificial neural network has been optimized by the pruning method. © 1997 IEEE.
