Predictions of Arctic sea ice conditions a few months to a few years in advance could be of interest for stakeholders. This article presents a review of the potential sources of Arctic sea ice predictability on these timescales. Predictability mainly originates from persistence or advection of sea ice anomalies, interactions with the ocean and atmosphere and changes in radiative forcing. After estimating the inherent potential predictability limit with state-of-the-art models, current <b>sea</b> ice <b>forecast</b> systems are described, together with their performance.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the improvement in}} ice edge error within the US Navy's operational <b>sea</b> ice <b>forecast</b> systems gained by assimilating high horizontal resolution satellite-derived ice concentration products. Since the late 1980 's, the ice forecast systems have assimilated near real-time sea ice concentration derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI and then SSMIS). The resolution of the satellite-derived product was approximately {{the same as the}} previous operational ice forecast system (25 km). As the <b>sea</b> ice <b>forecast</b> model resolution increased over time, the need for higher horizontal resolution observational data grew. In 2013, a new Navy <b>sea</b> ice <b>forecast</b> system (Arctic Cap Nowcast/Forecast System – ACNFS) went into operations with a horizontal resolution of ~ 3. 5 km at the North Pole. A method of blending ice concentration observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR 2) along with a sea ice mask produced by the National Ice Center (NIC) has been developed, resulting in an ice concentration product with very high spatial resolution. In this study, ACNFS was initialized with this newly developed high resolution blended ice concentration product. The daily ice edge locations from model hindcast simulations were compared against independent observed ice edge locations. ACNFS initialized using the high resolution blended ice concentration data product decreased predicted ice edge location error compared to the operational system that only assimilated SSMIS data. A second evaluation assimilating the new blended sea ice concentration product into the pre-operational Navy Global Ocean Forecast System 3. 1 also showed a substantial improvement in ice edge location over a system using the SSMIS sea ice concentration product alone. This paper describes the technique used to create the blended sea ice concentration product and the significant improvements in ice edge forecasting in both of the Navy's <b>sea</b> ice <b>forecasting</b> systems...|$|R

The employed metrics are the pan‐Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) and area (SIA), the Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE), the Spatial Probability Score (SPS), and the Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD). While the first two metrics evaluate a single integrated quantity, the latter three assess the spatial distribution of the ice cover.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{providing}} routine seven-day <b>forecasts</b> of <b>sea</b> level observable at tide gauge locations is described and evaluated. Forecast time series are aggregated from well-established operational {{systems of the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology; although following some adjustments these systems are only quasi-complimentary. Target applications are routine coastal decision processes under non-extreme conditions. The configuration aims to be relatively robust to operational realities such as version upgrades, data gaps and metadata ambiguities.

Characteristics of the bias correction term are demonstrated to be primarily static in time, with time varying signals showing regional coherence. This simple approach to exploiting existing complex systems can offer valuable levels of skill at a range of Australian locations. The prospect of interpolation between observation sites and exploitation of lagged-ensemble uncertainty estimates could be meaningfully pursued. Skill characteristics define a benchmark against which new operational <b>sea</b> level <b>forecasting</b> systems can be measured.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vertical}} shear on the horizontal dispersion properties of passive tracer particles on the continental shelf of the South Mediterranean is investigated {{by means of}} observation and model data. In situ current measurements reveal that vertical gradients of horizontal velocities in the upper mixing layer decorrelate quite fast ([*]∼[*]  1 day), whereas an eddy-permitting ocean model, such as the Mediterranean Forecasting System, tends to overestimate such decorrelation time because of finite resolution effects. Horizontal dispersion, simulated by the Mediterranean <b>sea</b> <b>Forecasting</b> System, is mostly affected by: (1) unresolved scale motions, and mesoscale motions that are largely smoothed out at scales close to the grid spacing; (2) poorly resolved time variability in the profiles of the horizontal velocities in the upper layer. For the case study we have analysed, we show that a suitable use of deterministic kinematic parametrizations is helpful to implement realistic statistical features of tracer dispersion in two and three dimensions. The approach here suggested provides a functional tool to control the horizontal spreading of small organisms or substance concentrations, and is thus relevant for marine biology, pollutant dispersion as well as oil spill applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigation of nonlinear mathematical models of the behavior of closed lakes using the example of the Caspian <b>Sea.</b> <b>Forecasting</b> the level of the Caspian Sea is crucial both for the economy of the region and for the region's environment. The Caspian Sea is a closed reservoir; {{it is well known that}} its level changes considerably due to a variety of factors including global climate change. A series of forecasts exists based on different methods and taking into account some of the following factors: the influence of the sun's activity; the atmospheric circulation; the changing shape of the world's ocean; geological phenomena; the river inflow; and the velocity of evaporation. All of these models were calculated based on the linearization of the relations considered. For the last two decades, the most popular model has been the linear stochastic equation of water balance. This model was used as the base of the well known project of reversing the flow of the northward-flowing rivers. But the real behavior of the Caspian <b>Sea</b> contradicted the <b>forecasting</b> done using this model. One of the reasons of the failure was ignorance of the relations mentioned above. We are inclined to think however that the main reason for failure was that the forecast used a linear equation. The goal of the present paper is to analyze and generalize, from the modern mathematical point of view, the forecasting methodology for the level of the Caspian Sea, including the nonlinear effects crucial influence on the dynamics of sea level. In particular, the mathematical problems concerning the nonlinear stochastic equations are considered...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sea</b> ice <b>forecasts</b> are {{becoming}} a demanding need since human activities in the Arctic are constantly increasing and this trend is expected to continue. In this context, the recent availability of the Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction Project (S 2 S) Dataset has a particularly good timing and provides a solid base to make an initial assessment of the predictive skills of probabilistic forecast systems with dynamical sea ice. In this study, we employ different verification metrics to compare the S 2 S <b>sea</b> ice <b>forecasts</b> with satellite observations and the models’ own analyses. In particular, {{the focus is on}} the sea ice spatial distribution in the Arctic, which is relevant information for potential final users. The verification metrics, specifically chosen to quantify the quality of the <b>forecasted</b> <b>sea</b> ice edge position, are the Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE), the Spatial Probability Score (SPS) and the Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD). Despite the early development stage of Arctic sea ice predictions on the seasonal time scale, and the fact that the main focus of the S 2 S systems is mostly not on sea ice per se, our findings reveal that some of the S 2 S models are promising, exhibiting better predictive skills than the observation-based climatology and persistence. However, the results also point to critical aspects concerning the data assimilation procedure and the tuning of the models, which can strongly affect the forecasts quality. The comparison of different versions of the ECMWF forecast system shows the benefits brought by a coupled dynamical description of the sea ice instead of its prescription based on persistence and climatological records. Moreover, the systematic application of the verification metrics to such a broad pool of forecasts provides useful indications about strengths and limitation of the verification metrics themselves. Given the increasing availability of new and better sea ice observations and the possible improvements to coupled seasonal forecast systems, the formulation of reliable Arctic sea ice predictions for the subseasonal to seasonal time scales appears to be a realistic target for the scientific community...|$|R
