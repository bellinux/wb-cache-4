Further planned improvements included {{the addition of}} a <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine,</b> either by refitting the existing boats or building a new, seventh one, but the imminent breakup of Yugoslavia happened before anything was realized.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiments}} {{showed the}} <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> {{could be better}} to power an extended-range electric vehicle rather than serving as the primary power for an automobile. The Spirit with the <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> was better suited to run at a constant power setting, {{in contrast to the}} internal combustion engine with its easy throttle regulation over a wide range. Although successful in the MOD 1 and MOD 2 phases of the experiments, cutbacks in funding further research and lack of interest by automakers ended possible commercialization of the Automotive <b>Stirling</b> <b>Engine</b> Program.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} projects in the application of combined heat and power(CHP) lies in energy production for buildings. <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> are very applicable to residential buildings, especially because of the higher electricity/heat efficiency. A literature review on <b>stirling</b> <b>engines</b> is first provided and a number of research works on the development and applications of <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> are discussed. Then according to buildings' energy consumption, relevant output of power density of <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> is estimated. From the results, the design parameters of <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> are derived and the temperature difference on frequency and performance of <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> is also discussed...|$|R

25|$|Applications of the <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> {{range from}} {{heating and cooling}} to {{underwater}} power systems. A <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> can function in reverse as a heat pump for heating or cooling. Other uses include combined heat and power, solar power generation, Stirling cryocoolers, heat pump, marine engines, low power aviation engines, and low temperature difference engines.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{heat engine}} that {{operates}} by cyclic compression {{and expansion of}} air or other gas (the working fluid) at different temperatures, such {{that there is a}} net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanently gaseous working fluid. Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator. The inclusion of a regenerator differentiates the <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> from other closed cycle hot air engines.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of closed cycle operation, the heat driving a <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> must be transmitted from a heat source to the working fluid by heat exchangers and finally to a heat sink. A <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> system {{has at least one}} heat source, one heat sink and up to five heat exchangers. Some types may combine or dispense with some of these.|$|E
40|$|Various {{models for}} free piston <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> are reviewed. Initial models were {{developed}} primarily for design purposes and to predict operating parameters, especially efficiency. More recently, however, such {{models have been}} used to predict engine stability. Free piston <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> have no kinematic constraints and stability may not only be sensitive to the load, but also to various nonlinear loss and spring constraints. The present understanding is reviewed of various loss mechanisms for free piston <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> and how they have been incorporated into engine models is discussed...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, W.T. Beale invented a free piston {{version of the}} <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> to {{overcome}} the difficulty of lubricating the crank mechanism. While {{the invention of the}} basic free piston <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> is generally attributed to Beale, independent inventions of similar types of engines were made by E.H. Cooke-Yarborough and C. West at the Harwell Laboratories of the UKAERE. G.M. Benson also made important early contributions and patented many novel free-piston configurations.|$|E

25|$|Very {{low-power}} engines {{have been}} built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. A displacer type <b>stirling</b> <b>engine</b> has one piston and one displacer. A temperature difference is required between {{the top and bottom}} of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the low-temperature difference (LTD) <b>stirling</b> <b>engine,</b> the temperature difference between one's hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The power piston in the displacer type <b>stirling</b> <b>engine</b> is tightly sealed and is controlled to move up and down as the gas inside expands. The displacer, on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The displacer moves up and down to control the heating and cooling of the gas in the engine.|$|E

40|$|This study {{takes into}} account <b>engines</b> working in <b>Stirling</b> cycles in {{cogeneration}} systems. <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> have been selected because of their characteristics of exploitation. The possibility of their use in cogeneration systems is more favourable in comparison with other combustion engines because they can avoid usage of industrial and transport fuels. The <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> enable the use of biomass, agricultural and other waste energy sources in micro tri- and cogeneration plants dedicated for the use in agriculture and forestry. Considering such applications, three types of usage structures of <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> are proposed. All three structures are dedicated to install in small residential or farm buildings. These three types of structure are named: “type master”, “type slave ” and “type customer”. In accordance with the proposed structures, different types of engine constructions are discussed, too. At the same time, the authors described the dependences between <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> and electric power energy systems. The arguments of grid power systems and dispersed energy resource in text were reviewed. After that overview, some legal problems are discussed. Finally, the conception of independent dispersed micro agropower system and some technical equipment were described. Technical realization of the proposed conception requires: proper type, installation and usage of <b>Stirling</b> <b>engines</b> and proper expectations of achieved results...|$|R

25|$|Like {{the steam}} engine, the <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> is {{traditionally}} classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers {{to and from}} the working fluid take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the working parts of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine where heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the working fluid. Most of the many possible implementations of the <b>Stirling</b> <b>engine</b> fall into the category of reciprocating piston engine.|$|E
