5|$|Many <b>saltwater</b> fish {{manufacture}} {{large amounts}} of trimethylamine oxide {{to protect them from}} the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh <b>saltwater</b> fish. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saltwater</b> fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to <b>saltwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} <b>saltwater</b> marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In <b>saltwater</b> marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Coquitlam {{does not}} have any beaches within the city limits, but the Tri-Cities offers {{freshwater}} beaches in neighbouring Anmore (Buntzen Lake, Sasamat Lake) and <b>saltwater</b> beaches in Belcarra and Port Moody.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Hardick died in 2005 while {{filming the}} U-boat. He {{surfaced}} unconscious {{and could not}} be revived. Hardick, age 60, died as the result of <b>saltwater</b> drowning associated with poor health according to the Rhode Island Medical Examiner's office.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} of Sheet Harbour is located along {{the shores of}} Sheet Harbour, a <b>saltwater</b> harbour which has two arms: The Northwest Arm and the Northeast Arm.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} appears on the $1000 Colombian Peso coin. In the United States, the {{loggerhead sea turtle}} is the {{official}} state reptile of South Carolina and also the state <b>saltwater</b> reptile of Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} estuaries of Hilton Head Island are {{the feeding}} grounds, breeding grounds, and nurseries for many <b>saltwater</b> species of game fish, sport fish, and marine mammals. The dense plankton population gives the coastal water its murky brown-green coloration.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{crocodilians}} {{are typically}} territorial and solitary. Individuals may defend basking spots, nesting sites, feeding areas, nurseries, and overwintering sites. Male <b>saltwater</b> crocodiles establish year-round territories that encompass several female nesting sites. Some species are occasionally gregarious, particularly during droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. Individuals of some species may share basking sites {{at certain times}} of the day.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian era Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town; before {{that it had}} been an {{agricultural}} village. The Victorian craze for bathing in the sea was catered for in the late 19th century by <b>saltwater</b> baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations remain), and bathing machines on the main beach.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{fish species}} in Massachusetts include bass, carp, catfish, and trout, while <b>saltwater</b> {{species such as}} Atlantic cod, haddock, and American lobster {{populate}} offshore waters. Other marine species include Harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic right whales, as well as humpback whales, fin whales, minke whales, and Atlantic white-sided dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Nematodes {{are among}} the largest animal phyla and include at least 12,000 known species that are parasites of vertebrates. In Kinsella's 1988 study in Florida, species {{diversity}} was higher in the <b>saltwater</b> marsh (Cedar Key) than the freshwater marsh (Paynes Prairie), but nematodes at Paynes Prairie occurred more commonly and made {{up the bulk of}} the parasites found in rice rats there.|$|E
5|$|Other {{buildings}} {{constructed by}} David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, {{known locally as}} The Douche. This is a <b>saltwater</b> shower building with a dovecote on top. A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea, the building {{is now in a}} serious state of disrepair, with roofing slates missing and the dovecote in danger of collapsing.|$|E
5|$|Traditional meals have ancient origins, such as {{bread and}} cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled {{vegetables}} and broths, and freshwater and <b>saltwater</b> fish. The 14th-century English cookbook, the Forme of Cury, contains recipes for these, and {{dates from the}} royal court of Richard II.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the <b>saltwater</b> streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
5|$|Although the Philippines lacks large {{mammalian}} predators, it {{does have}} some very large reptiles such as pythons and cobras, together with gigantic <b>saltwater</b> crocodiles. The largest crocodile in captivity, known locally as Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb). The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and <b>Saltwater</b> crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians {{are found}} mainly in {{lowlands}} in the tropics, but alligators also {{live in the}} southeastern United States and the Yangtze River in China. They are largely carnivorous, the various species feeding on animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian gharial are specialised feeders, while others like the <b>saltwater</b> crocodile have generalised diets. Crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial, though cooperative feeding does occur. During breeding, dominant males try to monopolise available females. Females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and, unlike most other reptiles, care for their hatched young.|$|E
5|$|Flooding in the Niigata area {{continued}} even {{following the}} construction Ohkouzu Channel and another channel, which was originally planned in the Edo period (1700s-1800s), {{was built on}} the western outskirts of Niigata City to further mitigate the risk of flooding and to help prevent <b>saltwater</b> intrusion into the Shinano estuary. The Sekiya Diversion Channel was originally to be funded by the Niigata Prefecture; however the 1964 Niigata earthquake resulted in the funds no longer being available so it was adopted as a national project.|$|E
5|$|Flukes (Trematoda) {{from the}} {{subclass}} Digenea are common parasites of small mammals with complex life cycles. In his 1988 study, Kinsella found an unprecedentend 21species of trematodes in Florida marsh rice rats. The intermediate hosts of these trematodes include {{a variety of}} invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, which are eaten by the marsh rice rat. Trematodes were generally more common at the Cedar Key <b>saltwater</b> marsh than at the freshwater marsh in Paynes Prairie.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of <b>saltwater</b> ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other <b>saltwater</b> and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a <b>saltwater</b> marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the <b>saltwater</b> marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the pleural cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are five}} species of dolphins which reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They are classed in the cetacean superfamily Platanistoidea. Four species live in fresh water rivers. The fifth species, the La Plata dolphin, lives in <b>saltwater</b> estuaries and the ocean. However, it is scientifically classed {{in the river}} dolphin family rather than the oceanic dolphin family. All species have adaptations to facilitate fish catching: a long, forceps-like beak with numerous small teeth in both jaws, broad flippers to allow tight turns, small eyes, and unfused neck vertebrae to allow the head to move {{in relation to the}} body.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid <b>saltwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and <b>saltwater</b> marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} {{is found in the}} Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in <b>saltwater</b> and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The {{loggerhead sea turtle}} has a low {{reproductive}} rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become , producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17â€“33 years and has a lifespan of 47â€“67 years.|$|E
5|$|The major oceanic {{divisions}} are defined {{in part by}} the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these {{divisions are}} (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked <b>saltwater</b> that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environmentsâ€”there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawaterâ€”and they are essential to the regulation of <b>saltwater</b> and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from <b>saltwater</b> areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational <b>saltwater</b> fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered {{by the state of}} Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or <b>saltwater</b> crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of <b>saltwater</b> which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the <b>saltwater</b> crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected <b>saltwater</b> inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
