5|$|The Great Depression {{presented}} a unique time for film-making in the United States. The economic disaster {{brought on by}} the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash</b> of 1929 changed American values and beliefs in various ways. Themes of American exceptionalism and traditional concepts of personal achievement, self-reliance, and the overcoming of odds lost great currency. Due to the constant empty economic reassurances from politicians {{in the early years of}} the Depression, the American public developed an increasingly jaded attitude.|$|E

The impact of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash</b> of 1929 and the Great Depression was severe, particularly as the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936. The bank saw its assets fall from a 1929 peak of CHF 1.6billion to its 1918 levels of CHF 1billion by 1936.|$|E

The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash</b> of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E

40|$|Studies of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crashes</b> are as sparse as the {{occurrence}} ofcrashes. The mainstream theoretical models on <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crashes</b> {{are rooted in}} rationalexpectations equilibrium models and classicalmarket microstructure models.

In this dissertation, we build a strategic trading model to link two major US stock marketcrashes: the 1987 crash and the 2010 Flash Crash. We then providecross-sectional empirical evidence to verify our model hypothesis and evaluate price impact dueto the information asymmetry effect and the limited risk-bearing capacity effect. We use statistical learningmethods to compare our model based predictors with other predictorsfor the maximum cross-sectional price drawdown of SP 500 stocks during the 2010 Flash Crash andcheck the robustness of ourfindings...|$|R

5|$|The New York Giants, an American {{football}} team which {{plays in the}} National Football League (NFL), have had a long, and at times turbulent financial history. The Giants were founded in 1925 by businessman and bookmaker Tim Mara with an investment of 500 US$, {{and became one of}} the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara passed ownership of the team on to his sons Wellington and Jack after the 1929 <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Crash</b> to insulate the team from creditors. At first the Mara sons owned the team in name only, but they took increasingly larger roles in the organization beginning in the mid-1930s. Tim Mara remained involved in the team's operations until his death in 1959, when his sons assumed full control of the club. After Jack's passing in 1965, his son, Tim, took over his share of the team.|$|E

To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.|$|E

5|$|The Rockefeller Center had {{originally}} been intended by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. {{to be a new}} location for the Metropolitan Opera House, but the <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Crash</b> brought an end to the scheme. Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the low construction costs during the recession. At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood. The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall. Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely taken up with elevators and other engineering services. It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} E850 named Lord Nelson {{was ordered}} from Eastleigh railway works in June 1925 but production proceeded slowly, at Maunsell’s insistence, {{to ensure that}} the weight was kept to a minimum at every stage, so the locomotive did not appear until August 1926. It was tested on a variety of duties over the next year, with sufficiently encouraging results for an initial order for ten more locomotives for delivery between May 1928 and April 1929 to be placed. These were originally scheduled to be allocated to Battersea depot and fitted with 4,000 gallon 6-wheeled tenders suitable for the Continental ports. However, during construction, it was decided to equip half of the class with 5,000 gallon 8-wheeled tenders necessary for the longer West of England routes and to allocate them to Nine Elms depot. A further batch of ten locomotives was ordered in 1928, before the previous batch had been delivered, but when it became apparent that the <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Crash</b> of 1929 would be likely to reduce the demand for Continental travel, this second order was reduced to five.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crash,</b> the nominee would {{have a good chance}} of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the e¤ect of non-constant elasticity of the pricing kernel on asset return characteristics in a rational expectations model.

Also, declining elasticity helps to motivate technical analysis and to explain <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>crashes.</b> Moreover, based on a general characterization of the pricing kernel, we propose analytical asset price processes which can be tested empirically. The numerical analysis reveals strong deviations from the geometric Brownian motion which are caused by declining elasticity of the pricing kernel.
