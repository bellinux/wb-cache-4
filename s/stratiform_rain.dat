During the 1 -month campaign, diurnal cycles over Jakarta were well identified by special networked soundings and a C-band radar. Radar and satellites captured the convective-type heavy rains {{that appeared in the}} afternoon over the array, which were followed by stratiform-type precipitation during the night. Thermodynamic budget analyses were also performed using sounding data. The period-averaged vertical profiles of Q 1 and Q 2 indicate that diurnal precipitation acted as deep convection in the diabatic heating and drying. The diurnal composite of the obtained parameters revealed key processes such as (1) just before the onset of the afternoon convective rain, the lower troposphere was moistened by subarray-scale processes; (2) moistening of the troposphere continued during the convective heavy precipitation; (3) the <b>stratiform</b> <b>rains</b> during the night were partly maintained by consuming the pre-existing hydrometeor aloft; and (4) in the early morning, the clouds redeveloped over the ocean to produce precipitation as well as hydrometeor aloft.

Numerous trees were also uprooted or blown down. An EF1 also struck a chicken farm near Seligman, Missouri the same day, while another EF1 occurred near Bergman, Arkansas, damaging homes and destroying a garage and a mobile home. A more significant and widespread outbreak of severe weather was anticipated on April 5, with the Storm Prediction Center initially issuing a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms across parts of the Southern United States. At 16:29 UTC, the SPC upgraded the moderate risk to a high risk for parts of Georgia and South Carolina in anticipation of what {{was expected to be}} a major tornado outbreak. However, a mainly unidirectional wind profile was present in the threat area that day, though explosive CAPE values and very steep lapse rates in combination with locally enhanced helicity due to outflow boundaries left behind by earlier storms were expected to compensate for this. Despite these factors, the outbreak of strong and destructive tornadoes that was expected did not occur, aided in part by cold-air damming in northern Georgia, along with large amounts of <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> and shower activity occurring in parts of the state {{as well as in the}} Florida Panhandle.

Also, it makes outflow boundaries findable within visible satellite imagery as a thin line of cumuliform clouds which is known as an arcus, or arc, cloud.

40|$|International audienceA {{number of}} {{competing}} theories {{to explain the}} initiation mechanism, longevity and propagation characteristics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) have been developed from observational analysis of the tropical climate and minimal dynamical models. Using the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture from paired satellite retrievals of H 2 O and HDO from the boundary layer and mid troposphere, we identify the different sources of moisture that feed MJO convection during its life cycle. These fluxes are then associated with specific dynamical processes. The HDO/H 2 O isotope ratio data show that during the early phase of the MJO, the mid-troposphere is dominated by moisture evaporated from the ocean surface that was transported vertically undergoing minimal distillation. The contribution from the evaporative source diminishes during early convective activity but reappears during the peak of MJO activity along with an isotopically depleted flux, which is hypothesized to originate from easterly convergence. The contribution of different moisture sources as shown from the HDO/H 2 O data is consistent with model results where the sustaining of deep convection requires a feedback between convergence, precipitation strength and evaporation. In the wake of an MJO event, the weak vertical isotopic gradient, depletion in boundary layer delta D and the uniquely moist and depleted vapor in the mid troposphere all point toward a prominent presence of moisture originated from rainfall re-evaporation, which confirms the prediction that the transition from convective to <b>stratiform</b> <b>rains</b> {{is important to the}} moisture budget of the MJO...|$|R

The ratio of the convective rain rate to the <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> rate is 4. 1 on average at the horizontal resolution of the PR data.

40|$|The Seawinds {{scatterometer}} on {{the advanced}} Earth observing satellite- 2 (ADEOS- 2) will determine surface wind vectors {{by measuring the}} radar cross section. Multiple measurements will be made {{at different points in}} a wind-vector cell. When dense clouds and rain are present, the signal will be attenuated, thereby giving erroneous results for the wind. This report describes algorithms to use with the advanced mechanically scanned radiometer (AMSR) scanning radiometer on ADEOS- 2 to correct for the attenuation. One can determine attenuation from a radiometer measurement based on the excess brightness temperature measured. This is the difference between the total measured brightness temperature and the contribution from surface emission. A major problem that the algorithm must address is determining the surface contribution. Two basic approaches were developed for this, one using the scattering coefficient measured along with the brightness temperature, and the other using the brightness temperature alone. For both methods, best results will occur if the wind from the preceding wind-vector cell can be used as an input to the algorithm. In the method based on the scattering coefficient, we need the wind direction from the preceding cell. In the method using brightness temperature alone, we need the wind speed from the preceding cell. If neither is available, the algorithm can work, but the corrections will be less accurate. Both correction methods require iterative solutions. Simulations show that the algorithms make significant improvements in the measured scattering coefficient and thus is the retrieved wind vector.

40|$|Convective systems over sub-Saharan Africa and the {{tropical}} East Atlantic have distinct geographical and seasonal variations in convective intensity and stratiform precipitation production as observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar. Over the East Atlantic, convective rain rates are lower {{and the percentage}} of total rain that is stratiform is higher compared to over West Africa. In addition, the East Atlantic has more shallow precipitating convection and less non-precipitating anvil than sub-Saharan Africa. During the monsoon season, convective rain rates {{and the percentage of}} area covered by anvil decrease while the <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> fraction and number of shallow convective cells increase in both regions compared to the pre-monsoon season. These observations suggest that convective sustainability, i. e. the ability of a region to continually support convection, helps determine whether a robust <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> area or non-precipitating anvil forms. In addition to convective sustainability, wind shear and the Saharan Air Layer appear to play important roles in the formation and extent of the stratiform components of convective cloud systems.

[...] University of Washington, 2003 This study uses Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) {{observations}} from 1998 [...] 2000 {{to characterize the}} convective and stratiform components of the tropical precipitation field. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis fields of relative humidity, temperature, and zonal wind are jointly analyzed with the TRMM PR observations to highlight the large-scale environmental characteristics of <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> (i. e., rain associated with deeper cloud systems and in which precipitation processes occur above the 0 °C level). This study also models the steady-state atmospheric response to the four-dimensional latent heating field implied by the TRMM PR tropics-wide convective and stratiform precipitation climatology. The TRMM PR provides an illuminating view of the ensemble of precipitating clouds across the tropics; shallow convective rain elements dominate the outer fringes of the tropical rain area but give way to deeper, more organized convective systems and associated stratiform areas toward heavy rain regions. The PR shows geographical and temporal variations {{in the proportion of}} rain that is stratiform, most notably a trans-Pacific gradient with low proportions of <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> over the maritime continent and high proportions over the eastern-central Pacific. This gradient becomes even more pronounced during El Nino. Variations in <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> production may be attributed to the environment's ability to sustain moderate convection and differences in zonal wind shear and momentum transport. Horizontal variations in the vertical heating profile implied by the PR <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> fraction pattern lead to variations in the height and vertical extent of circulation anomalies not present when the model is forced with latent heating derived from a geographically-uniform <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> fraction.

40|$|The rain rates {{associated}} with Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSS) deduced from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) follow the well known log-normal type frequency distribution characteristic of conventional radars and rain gauges. On the other hand, the current microwave radiometer rain retrieval algorithms cannot give good representations of convective and stratiform precipitation. Thus they capture poorly this log-normal character. In particular, this is noticed clearly over land areas. The {{objective of the}} present study is to improve TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) retrievals of convective and <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> to a level comparable to the PR. For this purpose, we have developed a TMI rain retrieval algorithm that depends primarily on the 85 GHz brightness temperatures (Tbs) and their spatial distribution.

40|$|Hourly {{rainfall}} data {{between the}} years 1975 and 2010 across the Peninsular Malaysia were analyzed for trends in hourly extreme rainfall events. The {{analyses were conducted}} on rainfall occurrences during the northeast monsoon (November–February) known as NEM, the southwest monsoon (May–August) known as SWM, and the two inter-monsoon seasons, i. e., March–April (MA) and September–October (SO). Several extreme rainfall indices were calculated at the station level. The extreme rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia showed an increasing trend between the years 1975 and 2010. The trend analysis was conducted using linear regression; no serial correlation was detected from the Durbin-Watson test. Ordinary kriging {{was used to determine}} the spatial patterns of trends in seasonal extremes. The total amount of rainfall received during NEM is higher compared to rainfall received during inter-monsoon seasons. However, intense rainfall is observed during the inter-monsoon season with higher hourly total amount of rainfall. The eastern part of peninsular was most affected by <b>stratiform</b> <b>rains,</b> while convective rain contributes more precipitation to areas {{in the western part of}} the peninsular. From the distribution of spatial pattern of trend, the extreme frequency index (Freq > 20) gives significant contribution to the positive extreme rainfall trend during the monsoon seasons. Meanwhile, both extreme frequency and extreme intensity (24 -Hr Max, Freq > 95 th, Tot > 95 th, Tot > 99 th, and Hr Max) indices give significant contribution to the positive extreme rainfall trend during the inter-monsoon seasons. Most of the significant extreme indices showed the positive sign of trends. However, a negative trend of extreme rainfall was found in the northwest coast due to the existence of Titiwangsa Range. The extreme intensity, extreme frequency, and extreme cumulative indices showed increasing trends during the NEM and MA while extreme intensity and extreme frequency had similar trends during the SWM and SO throughout Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, the hourly extreme rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia showed an increasing trend between the year 1975 and 2010 with notable increasing trends in short temporal rainfall during inter-monsoon season.

A case study for a squall-line system passing over the Goodwin Creek experimental watershed in northern Mississippi is presented. Microphysically, the leading convective line is characterized by large raindrop concentrations (> 500 drops per cubic meter), large mean raindrop sizes (> 1 mm), and wide raindrop size distributions (standard deviations > 0. 5 mm), as compared to the transition region and the trailing <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain.</b> The transition and stratiform phases have similar raindrop concentrations and mean raindrop sizes. Their main difference is that the distributions are wider in the latter. A scaling-law analysis reveals that the shapes of the scaled spectra are bent downward for small raindrop sizes in the leading convective line, slightly bent upward in the transition zone, and strongly bent upward in the trailing <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain.</b> The exponents of the resulting Z-R relationships are roughly the same for the leading convective line and the trailing <b>stratiform</b> <b>rain</b> (approximate to 1. 4) and slightly larger for the transition region (approximate to 1. 5), with prefactors increasing in this order: transition (approximate to 200), convective (approximate to 300), stratiform (approximate to 450). In terms of rainfall estimation bias, the best-fit mean R(Z(H), Z(DR)) relationship outperforms the best-fit mean R(Z) relationship, both for each storm phase separately and for the event as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Model {{calculations}} and {{measurements of the}} specific propagation and backscatter differential phase shifts (KDP and do, respectively) in rain are discussed for X- (l; 3 cm) and Ka-band (l; 0. 8 cm) radar wavelengths. The details of the drop size distribution have only a small effect on the relationships between KDP and rainfall rate R. These relationships, however, are subject to significant variations due to the assumed model of the drop aspect ratio {{as a function of}} their size. The backscatter differential phase shift at X band for rain rates of less than about 15 mm h 21 is generally small and should not pose a serious problem when estimating KDP from the total phase difference at range intervals of several kilometers. The main advantage of using X-band wavelengths compared to S-band (l; 10 – 11 cm) wavelengths is an increase in KDP by a factor of about 3 for the same rainfall rate. The relative contribution of the backscatter differential phase to the total phase difference at Ka band is significantly larger than at X band. This makes propagation and backscatter phase shift contributions comparable for most practical cases and poses difficulties in estimating rainfall rate from Ka-band measurements of the differential phase. Experimental studies of rain using X-band differential phase measurements were conducted near Boulder, Colorado, in a <b>stratiform,</b> intermittent <b>rain</b> with a rate averaging about 4 – 5 mm h 21. The differential phase shif...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the use of polarimetric observations in a radar-based winter hydrometeor classification algorithm. This is accomplished by deriving bulk electromagnetic scattering properties of <b>stratiform,</b> cold-season <b>rain,</b> freezing rain, sleet, dry aggregated snowflakes, dendritic snow crystals, and platelike snow crystals at X-, C-, and S-band wavelengths based on microphysical theory and previous observational studies. These results are then used to define the expected value ranges, or mem-bership beta functions, of a simple fuzzy-logic hydrometeor classification algorithm. To test the algorithm’s validity and robustness, polarimetric radar data and algorithm output from four unique winter storms are investigated alongside surface observations and thermodynamic soundings. This analysis supports that the algorithm is able to realistically discern regions dominated by wet snow, aggregates, plates, dendrites, and other small ice crystals based solely on polarimetric data, with guidance from a melting-level detection al-gorithm but without external temperature information. Temperature is still used to distinguish rain from freezing rain or sleet below the radar-detected melting level. After appropriate data quality control, little modification of the algorithm was required to produce physically reasonable results on four different radar platforms at X, C, and S bands. However, classification seemed more robust at shorter wavelengths because the specific differential phase is heavily weighted in ice crystal classification decisions. It is suggested that parts, or all, of this algorithm could be applicable in both operational and research settings. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the Lowered EXCELL model to discriminate between stratiform and convective precipitation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is located in the equatorial region. The model generates two long-term cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) that separately account for the two different types of rain, based on the input rainfall statistics reflecting the local climatology. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the applicability of the model in equatorial climates. The model performance in estimating stratiform and convective CDFs is carried out using 3 years of time series of rainfall intensity data collected in Kuala Lumpur by a disdrometer. The <b>stratiform</b> and convective <b>rain</b> rate CDFs are finally shown to be well predicted by the Lowered EXCELL model. Hence, the outcome of this paper seems encouraging for further application of the model to improve the prediction of rain attenuation for satellite communication, especially in equatorial region. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
