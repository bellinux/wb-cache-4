500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: [...] "One finishes Great Gatsby {{with a feeling of}} regret, not for the fate {{of the people in the}} book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald." [...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> what the book was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trial}} progressed, {{it became clear}} that {{convictions}} were unlikely. The New York Times reported that [...] "Evidence in the trial is extremely perplexing and suggests wholesale perjury on both sides.

2500|$|In a 1977 {{historical}} {{analysis of}} women in sports, New York Times columnist William C. Rhoden wrote, [...] "Althea Gibson and Wilma Rudolph are, without question, the most significant athletic forces among black women in sports history. While Rudolph's accomplishments brought more visibility to women as athletes ... Althea's accomplishments were more revolutionary because of the psychosocial impact on black America. [...] Even to those blacks who hadn't the <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> of where or what Wimbledon was, her victory, like Jackie Robinson's in baseball and Jack Johnson's in boxing, proved again that blacks, when given an opportunity, could compete at any level in American society." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 Briggs was {{appointed}} assistant director {{for research and}} testing by National Bureau of Standards Director George Kimball Burgess. On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by US President Herbert C. Hoover to Burgess {{as director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the US Congress before he left office. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name [...] "a good Democrat" [...] as director of the National Bureau of Standards. Roosevelt, not wishing to make a patronage appointment, replied, [...] "I haven't the <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> whether Briggs is a Republican or a Democrat; all I know is that he is the best qualified man for the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earlier, Cockburn {{had been}} moved to present rebuttals to the JFK {{assassination}} conspiracy theories by the Oliver Stone film JFK {{when it came out}} in 1991. He wrote in 1993 that [...] "In all the assassinology I've read or seen, Oswald is always unpersuasive. In JFK Oliver Stone hadn't the <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> how to portray him, which pointed up the weakness of his artistic insight and the preposterous premises on which it was based." [...] He interpreted the assassination as an attempt by Lee Harvey Oswald, whom he deemed a leftist, to [...] "take the pressure off Fidel Castro", and to that end it was successful {{at the level of the}} propaganda of the deed, Cockburn claims, because President Johnson later [...] "suspended the CIA assassination bids" [...] against Castro. He reiterated this view at a conference in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{was born}} to a {{sharecropping}} couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works (1877–1965) and Samuel Jones Davis (1873–1945), in the now-ghost town of Beech Springs southeast of Quitman in Jackson Parish in north Louisiana. The family was so poor that young Jimmie {{did not have a}} bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old. Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to the New York Times, [...] "Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had the <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> when it really was." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Davis was not sure exactly how old he was, noting only that he was born {{around the turn of the}} last century." [...] The birth date listed on his Country Music Hall of Fame plaque is September 11, 1902. However, the 1900 US Census attests to his being born in September 1899.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1901, some {{explanation}} for Diver's stuttering end to his cricket career emerged in newspaper {{reports of a}} court case in Walsall in which the North Worcestershire Brewery Company petitioned the police court {{to be allowed to}} transfer the licence of the Priory Hotel, Walsall, from Diver to his wife, Alice, on account of the fact that Diver had disappeared. Mrs Diver is reported to have told the court that her husband left on 12 November and that [...] "she had not the <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> that he was going away". A hotel guest had told her that Diver had been seen at Queenstown taking a ship for New York, but she had not heard from him since his disappearance. The licence was duly transferred temporarily to Mrs Diver, who was reported to have had [...] "considerable experience in the trade"; the police insisted that Diver {{should not be allowed to}} hold the licence if he reappeared, and Mrs Diver said that she [...] "would not allow her husband to live at or take part in the management of the house if he came back". A report in February 1902 noted that the transfer of the licence had been made permanent and that Diver's whereabouts were [...] "still unknown".|$|E

500|$|This episode marks Mark Snow's {{debut as}} a solo {{composer}} for the series. Carter stated he and the production crew were [...] "fearful" [...] of using too much music in the episode, and the first season as a whole.

The executives felt that viewers were not supposed to be [...] "confused" [...] after watching and must have at least a <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of what was going on.

40|$|Should radical {{uncertainty}} about the distant future dissuade us from judging options by referring to their consequences? I argue no. Some short-run benefits are sufficiently high that we should pursue them, even if our long-run estimates possess a very high variance. I discuss {{the relationship between the}} epistemic argument and fuzzy rankings and also arguments from infinity. Furthermore, extant versions of the epistemic argument require the assumption that we have no idea about the major consequences of our acts. Even a <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> about some major consequences will render the epistemic argument less plausible. In most applications of the epistemic argument, long-run uncertainty is not the relevant confounding variable; on close examination the epistemic argument tends to trade on other principles altogether. ...|$|R
60|$|The present {{aspect of}} that valley affords but a <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of its beauty in those days. The slopes are now clad with vineyards, which, {{although}} picturesque in idea, are really, {{to look at}} from a distance, no better than so many turnip fields. The vines are planted in rows and trained to short sticks, and as these rows follow the declivities of the hillside, they are run in all directions, and the whole mountain side, from the river far up, is cut up into little patches of green lines. In those days the mountains were clad with forests, which descended nearly to the river side. Here and there, upon craggy points, were situate the fortalices of the barons. Little villages nestled in the woods, or stood by the river bank, and a fairer scene could not be witnessed in Europe.|$|R

60|$|Here they abode for a fortnight, Ronald {{going up}} {{every two or}} three days to {{purchase}} provisions at the scattered cottages. On Saturday night they lit a great fire just inside the mouth of the cave, so that while the flames could be seen far out at sea the light would be unobserved by the garrison of Dunluce or any straggler on the cliff above. It had been arranged with Duncan that every Saturday night, weather permitting, he should sail across and look for a signal fire. The first Saturday night was wild and stormy, and although they lit the fire they had but <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> that Duncan would put out. The following week, however, the night was calm and bright, and after piling up the fire high they proceeded to the causeway, and two hours later saw to their joy a boat approaching. In a few minutes they were on board, and by the following morning reached Rathlin.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the midst}} of all these emergencies, however, the Legation was desperately understaffed. Gibson and his three colleagues were {{supposed}} to give full assistance to the new Polish government as it strove to avert famine, revive its industry, reduce unemployment, appease ethnic tensions, define its borders and put its ruined house in order. At the same time, the attention of the Legation was required to attend thousands of Polish Jews applying for visas to immigrate to the United States. The Legation, as it stroe to cope with all this, had only three clerks, (one of whom, Gibson write; was a young lady with a [...] "very <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of the English language gained in Russia"). In {{the midst of}} this turmoil, Gibson was expected to send in regular, perceptive reports on conditions in Poland and in neighboring Russia. The Legation was seriously overextended and some two months later, Gibson was complaining that [...] "we are all about to break down" [...] and declaring that if appropriations for more clerical staff were not quickly made, he would have to close the Chancery or send all his staff to the hospital to recover from overwork." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have gone}} through many wild adventures since then. I have heard {{the roar of the}} lion and the tiger in all circumstances, and the laugh of the hyena, besides many other hideous sounds, but I never in all my life listened to {{anything}} that in any degree approached in thundering ferocity the appalling roar that burst upon our ears immediately after that shot was fired. I can compare it to nothing, for nothing I ever heard was like it. If the reader can conceive a human fiend endued with a voice far louder than that of the lion, yet retaining a little of the intonation both of the man's voice and of what we should suppose a fiend's voice to be, he may form some <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of what that roar was. It is impossible to describe it. Perhaps Mak's expression in regard to it is the most emphatic and truthful: it was absolutely [...] "horriboble!" [...] Every one has heard a sturdy, well-grown little boy, when being thrashed, howling {{at the very top of}} his bent. If one can conceive of a full-grown male giant twenty feet high pouring forth his whole soul and voice with similarly unrestrained fervour, he may approximate to a notion of it.|$|R

60|$|The {{foregoing}} reminiscence, however, {{has drawn}} me {{aside from the}} main object of my sketch, in which I purposed to give a <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of those public, or partially public banquets, the custom of which so thoroughly prevails among the English people, that nothing is ever decided upon, in matters of peace and war, until they have chewed upon it {{in the shape of}} roast-beef, and talked it fully over in their cups. Nor are these festivities merely occasional, but of stated recurrence in all considerable municipalities and associated bodies. The most ancient times appear to have been as familiar with them as the Englishmen of to-day. In many of the old English towns, you find some stately Gothic hall or chamber in which the Mayor and other authorities of the place have long held their sessions; and always, in convenient contiguity, there is a dusky kitchen, with an immense fireplace where an ox might be roasting at his ease, though the less gigantic scale of modern cookery may now have permitted the cobwebs to gather in its chimney. St. Mary's Hall, in Coventry, is so good a specimen of an ancient banqueting-room, that perhaps I may profitably devote a page or two to the description of it.|$|R

5000|$|Response to Ermac's alternate-media incarnations {{has been}} mostly negative.
