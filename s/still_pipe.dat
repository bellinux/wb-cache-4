40|$|If an {{ultrasonically}} vibrating pipe is {{dipped into}} a liquid, the liquid is pumped {{up inside the}} pipe. We found in a previous study that the maximum pressure was improved from 1 kPa to 7. 2 kPa if {{the end of the}} pipe was installed on a plate with a small gap. In this study, the configuration is modified for a practical design in which a <b>still</b> <b>pipe</b> is located at a right angle to a piston-vibrated surface. We investigate the difference in the pump characteristics between the former and new configurations. Our experiments show that a maximum pressure of 20. 6 kPa is obtained by optimizing the inner and outer diameters of the pipe as well as the gap between the pipe end and the vibrato...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} guided radar level measurements of liquid materials in large metal tubes, socalled stilling wells, bypass or still pipes. In the RF domain these tubes function as overmoded circular waveguides and mode-matched excitation structures like waveguide tapers {{are needed to}} avoid higher order waveguide modes. Especially for high-precision radar measurements the multimode propagation effects need to be minimized to achieve submillimeter accuracy. Therefore, a <b>still</b> <b>pipe</b> simulator is introduced with the purpose to fundamentally analyze the modal effects. Furthermore, a generalized design criterion is derived for the spurious mode suppression of compact circular waveguide transitions under the constraint of specified accuracy levels. According to the obtained results, a promising waveguide taper concept will finally be presented. © Author(s) 2008...|$|E

It was his custom to mount straight to the nursery, taking about three degrees of the staircase at once, and coming upon us like a cheerful surprise. Five minutes elapsed--ten--and I saw and heard nothing of him. What could he be doing? Possibly waiting in the corridor below. Little Georgette <b>still</b> <b>piped</b> her plaintive wail, appealing to me by her familiar term, [...] "Minnie, Minnie, me very poorly!" [...] till my heart ached. I descended to ascertain why he did not come. The corridor was empty. Whither was he vanished? Was he with Madame in the salle-à-manger? Impossible: I had left her but a short time since, dressing in her own chamber. I listened. Three pupils were just then hard at work practising in three proximate rooms--the dining-room and the greater and lesser drawing-rooms, between which and the corridor there was but the portress's cabinet communicating with the salons, and intended originally for a boudoir.
