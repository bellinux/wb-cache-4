In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock, four miles by track from the river port of Morwellham, was significant. Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of lime was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous limekilns on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not slaked before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning. Later, <b>street</b> <b>sweepings</b> and other refuse from Plymouth and Devonport, together with bones for the newly discovered bone fertiliser, were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from British Columbia and the Baltic, in large baulks for use as supports in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the mine pumping engines.Tavistock was one of the three stannary towns of Devon and large quantities of refined tin ore were exported through Morwellham from twelfth century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed. The opening of the Tavistock Canal, between Tavistock and Morwellham, in 1817 facilitated traffic. Later, the East Cornwall Mineral Railway provided an outlet through the quays of Calstock from the Cornish side of the valley. [...] Other significant cargoes exported were quarried granite and, later, copper, lead and manganese ores, with their important by-product of arsenic. Arsenic was extracted from mispickel, once regarded as a waste product but later offering an important source of revenue as copper and tin extraction declined in profitability. The refined product was exported worldwide, in particular to the southern United States, where it was used as an insecticide in the cotton fields.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in management of MSW through micro-treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) in many cities of India. The OFMSW fraction is high (> 80 %) in many pockets within South Indian cities like Bangalore, Chikkamagalur, etc. and is largely represented by vegetable, fruit, packing and garden wastes. Among these, the last three have shown problems for easy decomposition. Fruit wastes are characterized by a large pectin supported fraction that decomposes quickly to organic acids (becomes pulpy) that eventually slow down anaerobic and aerobic decomposition processes. Paper fraction (newsprint and photocopying paper) as well as paddy straw (packing), bagasse (from cane juice stalls) and tree leaf litter (typical garden waste and <b>street</b> <b>sweepings)</b> are found in reasonably large proportions in MSW. These decompose slowly due to poor nutrients or physical state. We have examined the suitability of these substrates for micro-composting in plastic bins by tracking decomposition pattern and physical changes. It was found that fruit wastes decompose rapidly to produce organic acids and large leachate fraction such that it {{may need to be}} mixed with leachate absorbing materials (dry wastes) for good composting. Leaf litter, paddy straw and bagasse decompose to the tune of 90, 68 and 60 % VS and are suitable for composting micro-treatment. Paper fractions even when augmented with 10 % leaf compost failed to show appreciable decomposition in 50 days. All these feedstocks were found to have good biological methane potential (BMP) and showed promise for conversion to biogas under a mixed feed operation. Suitability of this approach was verified by operating a plug-flow type anaerobic digester where only leaf litter gathered nearby (as <b>street</b> <b>sweepings)</b> was used as feedstock. Here only a third of the BMP was realized at this scale (0. 18 m(3) biogas/kg VS 0. 55 m(3) /kg in BMP). We conclude that anaerobic digestion in plug-flow like digesters appear a more suitable micro-treatment option (2 - 10 kg VS/day) because in addition to compost it also produces biogas for domestic use nearby...|$|E

Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to determine prevalence of respiratory health symptoms and associated factors among street sweepers in Ilala Municipality. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional analytical study was designed 102 street sweepers as exposed group and 85 street vegetable sellers as unexposed group means less exposed to <b>street</b> <b>sweeping</b> dust from Ilala Municipality who worked one year and above and none smoker habit were studied, the respondent rate was 57. 7 %. Respiratory health symptoms and socio-demographic information were collected by using a modified American Thoracic Society respiratory symptoms questionnaire and level of utilization of PPEs were assessed by closed ended questions. Frequency distribution, Chi square test and logistic regression were used in data analysis. Results: The prevalence of respiratory health symptoms was higher among exposed than unexposed group and the difference was statistically significant, for cough (54. 9 % vs 12. 9 %) phlegm (39. 2 vs 7. 1 %), wheezing (32. 4 % vs 14. 1 %), nose irritating (35. 8 % vs 4. 7 %) and sneezing (63. 7 % vs 8. 2). <b>Street</b> <b>sweeping</b> dust was the main associated factor to cough, phlegm, wheezing, nose irritating and wheezing outcomes, while age associated with cough and phlegm outcomes and duration of employment associated with cough outcomes among street sweepers, and the association was statistically significant p< 0. 05.

A total of 1. 92 Mt of waste including privy midden, <b>street</b> <b>sweepings,</b> clinkers and slaughterhouse refuse was incorporated into the moss resulting in a modified topsoil with raised pH and reduced organic matter content compared with the subsoil. Elevated levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) are observed in the topsoil beyond the typical depth of atmospheric contamination; Cd and As concentrations exceed soil guideline values (SGVs) at 1. 8 and 43 mg/kg, respectively. Sequential extraction indicates that waste-derived Pb, Zn and Ni remain predominantly in the residual fraction, whereas Cu was mainly organically bound. Arsenic was predominately found in oxide and organic matter fractions with Cd in carbonate, oxide, organic matter and residual fractions. Pot trials indicated limited uptake of PTEs by vegetables grown on the waste-amended soil, with the exception of Cd uptake by lettuce (0. 22 mg/kg FW) and Pb uptake by radish (0. 16 mg/kg FW), which exceeded current EU limits of 0. 2 and 0. 1 mg/kg FW, respectively.

The survey encompassed three principal drainage subareas, Kaneohe, Waihee, and Waikane, with both upstream and downstream monitoring stations as well as other selected stream and bay sampling points. Both grab sampling and continuous sampling were employed for the stream stations; the latter technique required the use of automatic samplers in order to monitor the runoff from a particular rainfall or storm event. Mass emissions or stream loadings followed predictable patterns with increases from upstream to downstream stations, higher values in the more urbanized southern areas of the study area, and higher values for this wet-weather period compared to the dry-weather period. In two specific storm events for which data were obtained, the solids load and turbidity peaked before the stream flow hydrograph. Maximum chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide levels in bay sediments were obtained off-shore from stream mouths, near the urbanized areas. State water quality standards were exceeded in the case of bay waters for total nitrogen and total phosphorus. The phosphorus standard for most stream stations and the dissolved oxygen standard for both fresh and coastal waters was not exceeded. The total organic content was low except for high runoff events. Insufficient coliform data were obtained for statistical comparison with the state standards. Chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were detected in the ng/l range for most water samples and two bay samples contained PCB (0. 5 and 0. 2 μg/l). Stream samples had higher levels of pesticides than bay samples with a distribution pattern related to degree of urbanization. Heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Cr, Ni) were detected in all bay sediments analyzed. Urban <b>street</b> <b>sweepings</b> were collected with variations in rate of solids accumulation and concentration of nutrients, heavy metals, and pesticides.
