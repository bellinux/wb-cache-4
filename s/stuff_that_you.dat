For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
500|$|The musicians {{created the}} album tracks through {{improvisation}} and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to bang on; rent {{what you want to}} rent. Have fun and... be creative—See where your mind and your ideas take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E

Kimura wanted Chulip to be localized to show the world certain aspects of Japanese culture and [...] "all the kind of interesting <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can see every day". He also wanted to display a real, modern truancy problem for Japanese students with the game's cast of underground dwellers. Norikazu Yasunaga designed many of the game's mechanics. According to Kimura, [...] "for efficient procedure, [...] set it up so that the personality and the characteristics for each NPC had to be one-by-one". The character designs were done by Ryuji Nouguchi, who used items from Kimura's personal scrapbook and [...] "made them funny". The musical score to Chulip was composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi, another former member of Love-de-Lic. The soundtrack was released by King Records in Japan on a single disc on November 22, 2002. Songs 35 through 44 represent the [...] "Tsurukame Movie Soundtrack", consisting of music for each of the game's short films, while songs 45 and 46 are bonus tracks.|$|E

Otto is adept in {{drumming}} {{in a variety of}} styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music to bebop and funk. DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, [...] "I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player." [...] Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars. Three Dollar Bill, Yall features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. The song [...] "Stuck" [...] uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.|$|E

[...] "he {{only thing you can}} really sing or write is <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] In October 2009, People magazine revealed that Lopez's album was going to be called Love?. She would tell KIIS FM's DJ Skee that she had chosen to call her album Love? because love was something that still confused her. [...] "Love is the most confusing thing in the world, that's why the album is called Love with a question mark." [...] Lopez told The Advocates Brandon Voss that she also took into account the gay community and how they might feel towards the album. She said all her previous albums had a universal appeal and the LGBT community had played a part in the success of her music in the past, e.g. [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999).|$|E

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
2500|$|While on set filming for The Back-up Plan in June 2009, Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV's Larry Carol {{that she had}} been working on the follow-up album to 2007's Brave. She had been working on the album during pregnancy, {{but it was not until}} the birth of her twins, Max and Emme, that she was able to focus on the project. Carol asked about the direction of the album, but Lopez refused to comment, instead saying [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are going through in your music. [...] The only thing you can really sing or write is <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] At the time of the interview, two of the album's songs had leaked. The first, titled [...] "(What Is) Love?", was written by Wynter Gordon and co-written and produced by Emile Dernst II (D'Mile). After expressing dismay at the song's leak, its writer (Wynter Gordon) spoke of why the song was very personal to her: [...] " [...] not knowing what love is ...I felt like so many woman have that same story. No fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands..no parental support, they feel alone [...]. I've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love [...]" [...] Jean Baptist produced a 'part-two' for the song, which was mentioned at one of the album pre-release parties, attended by Rap-Up magazine, however the second part of the song was omitted from the track listing. The original version of the song, under the title [...] "What Is Love", was included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film, The Back-up Plan, starring Lopez.|$|E

A spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope of the tent. I suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the baby awoke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling! Before I could think, I sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a second was half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother's farewell was sounding in my ears, and I was back on the bed again. I reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the waist-band, and tugged it along, and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke; I snatched a new hold, and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall, and was still tugging away, all excited and happy and proud, when the master's voice shouted: ...|$|E
6000|$|Because {{there is}} {{perceptible}} in these developments, quite {{over and above}} the desire to influence opinion, a very real effort to get things explained. It is the most interesting and curious--one might almost write touching--feature of these organisations that they do not constitute a positive and defined propaganda such as the Germans maintain. The German propaganda is simple, because its ends are simple; assertions of the moral elevation and loveliness of Germany; of the insuperable excellences of German Kultur, the Kaiser, and Crown Prince, and so forth; abuse of the [...] "treacherous" [...] English who allied themselves with the [...] "degenerate" [...] French and the [...] "barbaric" [...] Russians; nonsense about [...] "the freedom of the seas"--the emptiest phrase in history--childish attempts to sow suspicion between the Allies, and still more childish attempts to induce neutrals and simple-minded pacifists of allied nationality to save the face of Germany by initiating peace negotiations. But apart from their steady record and reminder of German brutalities and German aggression, the press organisations of the Allies have none of this definiteness in their task. The aim of the national intelligence in each of the allied countries is not to exalt one's own nation and confuse and divide the enemy, but to get a real understanding with the peoples and spirits of a number of different nations, an understanding that will increase and become a fruitful and permanent understanding between the allied peoples. Neither the English, the Russians, the Italians, nor the French, to name only the bigger European allies, are concerned in setting up a legend, as the Germans are concerned in setting up a legend of themselves to impose upon mankind. They are reality dealers in this war, and the Germans are effigy mongers. Practically the Allies are saying each to one another, [...] "Pray come to me and see for yourself that I am very much the human <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are.
