5|$|The six German {{and three}} Japanese surface raiders that {{operated}} within Australian waters sank 18 ships and killed over 826 sailors (including the 82 prisoners murdered on board Tone in 1944). Kormoran {{was the only}} Axis <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> to be sunk within the Australia Station, and 78 of her crew were killed.|$|E
5|$|Not long afterwards, the Kriegsmarine {{launched}} Operation Rheinübung. The Bismarck {{and heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen set {{out into the}} Atlantic from Norway. Their target was the Atlantic Convoys. During the later stage of the Bismarck operation, a Catalina of No. 209 Squadron RAF spotted the vessel, just 650 miles short of his destination port of Brest, France. It relayed {{the message to the}} British Fleet, enabling Fairey Swordfish aircraft to intercept. An 818 Naval Air Squadron FAA aircraft piloted by Sub-Lieutenant John Moffat hit the Bismarck with a torpedo on its stern, jamming its rudder gears, which eventually led to its sinking. Prinz Eugen had been detached prior to Bismarck last battle. Despite her discovery by Coastal Command's aircraft further south, she escaped to Brest on 1 June. Rheinübung was the last attempt by a Kriegsmarine <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> to breakout into the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} KB-4, the <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> design bureau of the Baltic Shipyard, was {{selected}} for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements. They did manage to get agreement on 22 November 1936 for a thickening of the deck armor that raised the displacement to about 47,000 tons. Design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47,700 tons in April 1937, but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships. The issue was resolved by Premier Stalin at a meeting on 4 July when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56,000 tons. This forced the project to begin again.|$|E
50|$|Both {{military}} and civilian midget submarines have been built. Military types work with <b>surface</b> <b>ships</b> and other submarines as mother ships. Civilian and non-combatant military types are generally called submersibles, and normally work with <b>surface</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R

The {{creation of the}} first nuclear power plant along with the first nuclear reactors for submarines and surface ships was directed by Igor Kurchatov.

25|$|Immediately {{investigations}} {{were started}} by the French authorities in Quimper. Several explanations were advanced to explain the capsizing including a fishing accident, collision with a <b>surface</b> <b>ship,</b> rock or wreck, {{the presence of a}} sandbank, and an accident involving a submarine. In June 2004 the ship was raised for forensic examinations. The fish hold showed a compression due to the water pressure. In the absence of evidence of any ramming, the hypothesis of a collision with a <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> could be abandoned.|$|E

Effective Oct. 1, 1995 the U.S. Pacific Fleet's <b>surface</b> <b>ships</b> {{were to be}} reorganized {{into six}} core battle groups and eight {{destroyer}} squadrons.

50|$|The Tu-95RT variant in {{particular}} was a veritable icon of the Cold War as it performed a maritime surveillance and targeting mission for other aircraft, <b>surface</b> <b>ships</b> and submarines.

25|$|Global {{climate change}} {{has opened the}} waters of the Arctic along the {{northern}} shores of Alaska, Russia and Canada. The region is rich in natural resources. Countries abutting the Arctic Ocean have shown greater military patrol activity. The Military Times reported in 2015 that Russia had reactivated ten military bases, had increased <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> and aircraft patrols of its Northern Fleet, and had conducted missile tests in the region. The US Navy plans to have sufficient assets by 2030 to respond militarily in the Arctic. As of 2015, it conducted regular submarine patrols, but few air or <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> operations. Russia had twelve ice breakers versus two for the US. As of 2013, Canada had six ice breakers. In 2016, Canada announced the building of five ice-breaking Arctic and offshore patrol ships.|$|E
25|$|In January 1941, the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{were sent}} on a {{successful}} commerce raiding {{mission in the}} Atlantic.

25|$|In a {{separate}} study in 1993, two French {{students had been}} assigned {{the design of a}} Large Capacity Missile Ship, a 20,000-tonner with 500 VLS cells filled with land-attack missiles. This design was inspired by a RAND paper in that year, which suggested a land invasion could be halted by destroying 20% of its vehicles with precision munitions. This would take several days with aircraft, but a <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> with large numbers of land-attack missiles could achieve the same effect almost instantly.|$|E
25|$|While Ballard {{had been}} {{interested}} in the sea since an early age, his work at Woods Hole and his scuba diving experiences off Massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration. His work in the Navy had involved assisting {{in the development of}} small, unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a <b>surface</b> <b>ship,</b> and were outfitted with lighting, cameras, and manipulator arms. As early as 1973, he saw this as way of searching for the wreck of the Titanic. In 1977, he led his first expedition, which was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Occupied Nauru was at {{the very}} end of a long supply line linking the Pacific islands to Japan. The American advance toward the Western Pacific, and the growing {{effectiveness}} of American submarines, made supply missions to Nauru increasingly difficult. In September 1943, a 6,000ton freighter loaded with supplies for the Japanese garrison was sunk off the island. In addition, the annual monsoon rains largely failed during the 1943-1944 season, resulting in a severe drought on the island. In early January 1944, only two Japanese supply ships made it to Nauru. The second boat arrived on 10 January, and was the last <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> to resupply the base for the duration of the war. A final delivery of provisions and ammunition was made by two submarines in September 1944.|$|E

They found an average reduction in the range at which the ship could be seen at night from another ship of around 25% using binoculars, 33% using the naked eye; the results from the air were less conclusive. The best case was on the exceptionally clear moonless night of 29/30 January 1942, when Largs could be seen from a <b>surface</b> <b>ship</b> with the naked eye at [...] unlighted, but only [...] with her diffused lighting, a 57% reduction.|$|E
