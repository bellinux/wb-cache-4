25|$|<b>Sucralfate</b> has {{a similar}} {{effectiveness}} to H2 receptor blockers; however, <b>sucralfate</b> {{needs to be taken}} multiple times a day, thus limiting its use. Baclofen, an agonist of the GABAB receptor, while effective, has similar issues of needing frequent dosing in addition to greater adverse effects compared to other medications.|$|E
25|$|Cytoprotective {{agents are}} {{designed}} to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. They include the medications <b>sucralfate</b> and misoprostol. If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate.|$|E
25|$|Products {{containing}} multivalent cations, such as aluminium- or magnesium-containing antacids, {{and products}} containing calcium, iron or zinc invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include <b>sucralfate,</b> probenecid, cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine.|$|E
25|$|Impaired liver {{synthesis}} of clotting factors, low-grade fibrinolysis, and intravascular coagulation {{are typical of}} ALF. Thrombocytopenia is common and may also be dysfunctional. Replacement therapy is recommended only {{in the setting of}} bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure. Vitamin K can be given to treat an abnormal prothrombin time, regardless of whether there is poor nutritional status. Administration of recombinant factor VIIa has shown promise; however, this treatment approach requires further study. The use of gastrointestinal hemorrhage prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker, proton pump inhibitor, or <b>sucralfate</b> is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Long-term use of NSAIDs {{can lead}} to mucosal damage of the colon, {{secondary}} to decreased levels of homeostatic prostaglandins. Mucosal injury is usually limited to the right dorsal colon, but can be more generalized. Horses may display acute or chronic intermittent colic, peripheral edema secondary to protein losing enteropathy, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Treatment involves decreasing the fiber levels of the horse's diet by reducing grass and hay, and placing the horse on an easily digestible pelleted feed until the colon can heal. Additionally, the horse may be given misoprostol, <b>sucralfate,</b> and psyllium to try to improve mucosal healing, as well as metronidazole to reduce inflammation of the colon.|$|E

5000|$|Bioavailability: 5% as <b>sucralfate</b> is {{considered}} non-systemic, sucrose octasulfate: 5%, aluminum:0.005% ...|$|E
50|$|Recently, it {{has been}} thought that <b>sucralfate</b> also stimulates the {{production}} of prostaglandin E2, epidermal growth factors (EGF), bFGF, and gastric mucus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sucralfate</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of active duodenal ulcers not related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as the mechanism behind these ulcers is due to acid oversecretion. It is not FDA approved for gastric ulcers, as the main mechanism is not due to acid oversecretion but rather from diminished protection. The use for <b>sucralfate</b> in peptic ulcer disease has diminished recently, but it is still the preferred agent for stress ulcer prevention.|$|E
50|$|Possible agents include antacids, H2-receptor blockers, <b>sucralfate,</b> and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Tentative {{evidence}} supports that PPIs {{may be better}} than H2 blockers.|$|E
5000|$|Binding with proteins. Some {{drugs such}} as <b>sucralfate</b> binds to proteins, {{especially}} {{if they have a}} high bioavailability. For this reason its administration is contraindicated in enteral feeding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sucralfate</b> {{is often}} used as an {{adjunctive}} therapy. At a pH <4, it becomes thick in consistency and it binds to gastric ulcerations preferably over squamous epithelial cells. It is not recommended as the sole treatment of EGUS because {{it has not been}} shown to have great efficacy in treating ulcers of the squamous region, and has not been studied in cases of glandular ulcers. If it is used, it should not be given around the time of an H2 antagonist, because <b>sucralfate</b> binds best at a lower pH.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sucralfate</b> is {{a locally}} acting {{substance}} {{that in an}} acidic environment (pH < 4) reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form a cross-linking, viscous, paste-like material capable of acting as an acid buffer {{for as long as}} 6 to 8 hours after a single dose. It also attaches to proteins on the surface of ulcers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, to form stable insoluble complexes. These complexes serve as protective barriers at the ulcer surface, preventing further damage from acid, pepsin, and bile. In addition, <b>sucralfate</b> prevents back diffusion of hydrogen ions, and adsorbs both pepsin and bile acids.|$|E
50|$|Endoscopic therapies {{including}} argon plasma coagulation {{have been}} used for bleeding telangiectasia in radiation proctitis and at other intestinal sites, although there is a rick of perforation. <b>Sucralfate</b> enemas look promising in proctitis.|$|E
5000|$|Malabsorption - This {{includes}} GI damage, {{and also}} failure to absorb phosphate {{due to lack}} of vitamin D, or chronic use of phosphate binders such as <b>sucralfate,</b> aluminum-containing antacids, and (more rarely) calcium-containing antacids.|$|E
5000|$|Stress ulcer prophylaxisâ€”The use of <b>sucralfate</b> {{rather than}} H2 antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and {{measures}} to prevent aspiration, such as continuous subglottic suctioning, {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).|$|E
5000|$|Gastric ulcer {{not related}} to NSAID use and {{gastritis}} due to GERD. Triple combination therapy with lansoprazole + cisapride + <b>sucralfate</b> can significantly improve symptoms {{and quality of life}} and was more cost-effective than ranitidine combination group.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, octreotide, an {{analogue}} of somatostatin {{that leads}} to vasoconstriction of the portal circulation, {{can be used for}} active bleeding due to portal hypertensive gastropathy. [...] <b>Sucralfate,</b> a coating medication has also been used, but evidence is from animal models.|$|E
50|$|Like other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin chelates metals {{including}} aluminum, magnesium, <b>sucralfate,</b> iron, zinc, and divalent and trivalent cations like didanosine; {{using this}} drugs with antacids, some dietary supplements, or drugs buffered {{with any of}} these ions will interfere with available amounds of delafloxacin.|$|E
50|$|Cytoprotective {{agents are}} {{designed}} to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. They include the medications <b>sucralfate</b> and misoprostol. If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate.|$|E
50|$|Ketoprofen {{should not}} be used in {{combination}} with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, as this increases the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration. It should also be used with caution with other anticoagulants. It is commonly used with omeprazole, <b>sucralfate,</b> and cimetidine to help protect the GI tract.|$|E
50|$|Products {{containing}} multivalent cations, such as aluminium- or magnesium-containing antacids, {{and products}} containing calcium, iron or zinc invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include <b>sucralfate,</b> probenecid, cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine.|$|E
50|$|Phenylbutazone {{may be used}} in foals, but {{it should}} be used with {{particular}} caution. Premature foals, septicemic foals, foals with questionable kidney or liver function and foals with diarrhea require careful monitoring. Drugs to protect the GI tract such as omeprazole, cimetidine, and <b>sucralfate</b> are frequently used with phenylbutazone.|$|E
5000|$|Ranitidine, <b>sucralfate,</b> antacids {{containing}} magnesium or aluminum, supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc: co-administration {{with these}} substances {{can lead to}} therapeutic failure of the antibiotic due to decreased absorbment by the intestinal tract. For example, magnesium or aluminum antacids turn enoxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the gastroenteric tract.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms such as {{diarrhea}} and painful defecation {{need to be}} systematically investigated and the underlying causes each carefully treated. Complications such as obstruction and fistulae may require surgery. Several other methods have been studied in attempts to lessen the effects of radiation proctitis. These include <b>sucralfate,</b> hyperbaric oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, metronidazole, argon plasma coagulation, radiofrequency ablation and formalin irrigation.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effect seen is {{constipation}} (2-3%). Less commonly reported side effects (<0.5%) include flatulence, headache, hypophosphatemia, xerostomia (dry mouth), and bezoar formation.Avoid using this drug {{in people with}} chronic kidney failure, as it might cause aluminium accumulation and toxicity.There is {{a limited number of}} well-controlled studies investigating the safety and efficacy of <b>sucralfate</b> in children and pregnant women (Pregnancy Category B).|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} no direct {{treatment}} for AEN. Only treatment is for the underlying main diseases or conditions. Appropriate hydration is set. Antacids are also added for further recovery support. Common support drugs of antacids are either H2 receptor antagonists, and/or a proton pump inhibitor. <b>Sucralfate</b> was used as an option. Parenteral nutrition greatly increased chance of recovery. An esophagectomy can be issued if the disorder is severe enough.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a gastric cytoprotectant is any {{medication}} that combats ulcers not by reducing gastric acid but by increasing mucosal protection. Examples of gastric cytoprotective agents include prostaglandins which protect the stomach mucosa against injury by increasing gastric mucus secretion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit {{the synthesis of}} prostaglandins and thereby make the stomach more susceptible to injury. [...] Gastric cytoprotective drugs include carbenoxolone, deglycyrrhizinised liquorice, <b>sucralfate</b> (aluminium hydroxide and sulphated sucrose), misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue) and bismuth chelate (tri-potassium di-citrato bismuthate).|$|E
50|$|Difloxacin {{has been}} used {{concurrently}} with ectoparasiticides, antiepileptics, anesthetics, antihistamines, and topical anti-inflammatory drugs without adverse effects. It inhibits the metabolism of theophylline, caffeine, cyclosporine and warfarin. Azlocillin, cimetidine and probenecid increase blood levels of difloxacin. Compounds (i.e. <b>sucralfate,</b> antacids, multivitamins) containing di- and trivalent cations (i.e. iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium and zinc) may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones from the intestinal tract resulting in decreased bioavailability. Therefore, the concurrent oral administration of quinolones with foods, supplements or other preparations containing any of these compounds should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Impaired liver {{synthesis}} of clotting factors, low-grade fibrinolysis, and intravascular coagulation {{are typical of}} ALF. Thrombocytopenia is common and may also be dysfunctional. Replacement therapy is recommended only {{in the setting of}} bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure. Vitamin K can be given to treat an abnormal prothrombin time, regardless of whether there is poor nutritional status. Administration of recombinant factor VIIa has shown promise; however, this treatment approach requires further study. The use of gastrointestinal hemorrhage prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker, proton pump inhibitor, or <b>sucralfate</b> is recommended.|$|E
50|$|Phenylbutazone is {{occasionally}} used in {{dogs for}} the longer-term management of chronic pain, particularly due to osteoarthritis. About 20% of adult dogs are affected with osteoarthritis, {{which makes the}} management of musculoskeletal pain {{a major component of}} companion animal practice. The margin of safety for all NSAIDs is narrow in the dog, and other NSAIDs are more commonly used (etodolac, and carprofen). Gastrointestinal-protectant drugs, such as misoprostol, cimetidine, omeprazole, ranitidine, or <b>sucralfate,</b> are frequently included as a part of treatment with any NSAID. Dogs receiving chronic phenylbutazone therapy should be followed with regular blood work and renal monitoring.|$|E
50|$|Long-term use of NSAIDs {{can lead}} to mucosal damage of the colon, {{secondary}} to decreased levels of homeostatic prostaglandins. Mucosal injury is usually limited to the right dorsal colon, but can be more generalized. Horses may display acute or chronic intermittent colic, peripheral edema secondary to protein losing enteropathy, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Treatment involves decreasing the fiber levels of the horse's diet by reducing grass and hay, and placing the horse on an easily digestible pelleted feed until the colon can heal. Additionally, the horse may be given misoprostol, <b>sucralfate,</b> and psyllium to try to improve mucosal healing, as well as metronidazole to reduce inflammation of the colon.|$|E
50|$|Ciprofloxacin {{should not}} be taken with antacids {{containing}} magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs (sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate, <b>sucralfate,</b> didanosine), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, it {{should not be}} taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal.|$|E
50|$|There are {{foods and}} other {{substances}} that {{can interfere with}} absorption of thyroxine. Examples include calcium and iron supplements taken within four hours of levothyroxine, Other substances that reduce absorption are aluminium and magnesium containing antacids, simethicone, <b>sucralfate,</b> cholestyramine, colestipol, and polystyrene sulfonate. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine, but based on a study of 10 healthy people aged 20-30 (8 men, 2 women) {{it may not have}} a significant effect on bioavailability in young adults. A study of eight women suggested that coffee may interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, though at a level less than eating bran. Certain other substances can cause adverse effects that may be severe. Combination of levothyroxine with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia; and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants increase its toxicity. On the other hand, lithium can cause hyperthyroidism (but most often hypothyroidism) by affecting iodine metabolism of the thyroid itself and thus inhibits synthetic levothyroxine as well.|$|E
5000|$|Antacids and <b>sucralfate</b> {{were found}} to be no better than placebo in a {{literature}} review. [...] H2-RAs have been shown to have marked benefit in poor quality trials (30% relative risk reduction), but only a marginal benefit in good quality trials. Prokinetic agents would empirically seem to work well since delayed gastric emptying is considered a major pathophysiological mechanism in functional dyspepsia. [...] They have been shown in a meta-analysis to produce a relative risk reduction of up to 50%, but the studies evaluated to come to this conclusion used the drug cisapride which has since been removed from the market (now only available as an investigational agent) due to serious adverse events such as torsades, and publication bias has been cited as a potential partial explanation for such a high benefit. [...] Modern prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, erythromycin and tegaserod have little or no established efficacy and often result in substantial side effects. [...] Simethicone {{has been found to be}} of some value, as one trial suggests potential benefit over placebo and another shows equivalence with cisapride. [...] So, with the somewhat recent advent of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) class of medications, the question of whether these new agents are superior to traditional therapy has arisen.|$|E
