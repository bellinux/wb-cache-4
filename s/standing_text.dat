50|$|Assistive Technology is {{a generic}} term for devices and {{modifications}} (for {{a person or}} within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example {{of the use of}} a prosthesis dates to at least 1800 BC. The wheelchair dates from the 17th century. The curb cut is a related structural innovation. Other examples are <b>standing</b> frames, <b>text</b> telephones, accessible keyboards, large print, Braille, & speech recognition software. People with disabilities often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in Tourette's syndrome), or sign language in deaf communities.|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} ›resolute‹ {{reading of}} Wittgenstein, most notably represented by Cora Diamond and James Conant, {{claims that the}} text of the Tractatus does not convey a philosophical thesis. In engaging with the text and its literary form, the reader is supposed to cultivate an experience which will eventually allow her to confront (moral) reality without any obstructing philosophical abstractions. The article argues that this under- <b>standing</b> of the <b>text</b> implicitly rests on the traditional and highly problem- atic distinction between rhetoric and ›serious‹ speech, between a use of language which describes facts and one which elicits experiences. By re- constructing the alleged effect of a ›resolute‹ reading of the Tractatus with the help of Iser’s theory of literary experience, it is shown that the ›real- ism‹ that the resolute readers argue for can have no substance at all...|$|R
40|$|Self Landscape is an {{introductory}} {{image of the}} author's exhibition Lightsite, which toured Western Australian galleries from February 2006 to November 2007. It is a five-minute-long exposure photographic image captured inside a purpose-built, room-sized pinhole camera which is demountable and {{does not have a}} floor. Self Landscape depicts an inverted image of the outside environment - a revegetated farmland in the Great Southern Region of Western Australia. The light from the exterior landscape passes though the pinhole camera's aperture and illuminates the internal scene which includes that part of the landscape upon which the floorless room is erected, along with the author who is <b>standing</b> inside. The <b>text</b> "Hotspot" appears where the author has scribed that word with a torch during the long exposure. The image evokes the temporality of light. Here, light itself is portrayed as the primary medium through which we both perceive and describe landscape. It is through the agency of light that we construct our connectivity to landscape...|$|R
40|$|Founding {{fathers and}} classic texts {{are the main}} protagonists of a certain way of viewing the history, and of thereby {{defining}} the identity, of different disciplines {{in the social sciences}} and the humanities. However, the relationship between authors, texts and authorial-textual achievement is arguably a complex one, and it has produced a vast literature and heated debates over the last few decades. It is by achieving a classical <b>standing</b> that a <b>text</b> contributes to an author’s canonization as one of the discipline’s greats. But despite the agentic and individualistic connotations of the “author” concept, it is not always possible to trace exemplary texts back to a determinate author, who can be posited as their source. Texts can become classics in their own right, even when their authorship is loosely collective, doubtful or unknown. There can be, so to speak, a relative autonomy of texts regarding authors. Sometimes this results in equivocal situations and phony performances. Just consider the recent faux pas of India’s foreign minister, S. M. Krishna, who inadvertently read out the speech of the Portuguese foreign minister at a UN Security Council meeting. But the relative autonomy of texts vis-à-vis their purported sources does not only produce embarrassing political situations like the one described. It can, and often does, raise serious scholarly questions. It is one such case we discuss in this chapter. The text is Mind, Self, and Society, and the author is George Herbert Mead.

40|$|St. Louis-born Martha Gellhorn (1908 - 98) was the doyenne of {{twentieth century}} war correspondence. Opinionated, honest and unafraid, she covered {{conflicts}} from the Spanish Civil War to Reagan's wars in Central America in the 1980 s. "Martha Gellhorn: The War Writer in the Field {{and in the}} Text" is the first critical study of her Second World War fiction and journalism. How war is represented matters vitally to all of us. Often overlooked in accounts of war literature is the writer's precise position in relation to battle {{and his or her}} resultant <b>standing</b> in the <b>text.</b> Kate McLoughlin traces Gellhorn's daring attempts to access the war zone and her constructions of the woman war correspondent in her despatches, novels, short stories and play. Drawing on unpublished letters, close attention is given to Gellhorn's rivalry with Ernest Hemingway (the two were married from 1940 to 1945) over reaching the Normandy beaches on D-Day and its textual outcome in the pages of "Collier's" magazine. McLoughlin goes on to examine Gellhorn's increasingly negative portrayals of the glamorous female war reporter and to suggest why such disillusionment might have set in. In offering a methodology as well as a critical account, this book constitutes a case-study for scholars working on war representation. It will be of interest not only to students of literature, but also to those taking courses in journalism, media studies and women's studies...|$|R

Patteson contacted Dr. Patrick Shehan and Dr. Alexander Di Lella at Catholic University who provided him with hand-made transcriptions of the Masada fragments of the Ben Sirah scroll. The reception of these early inscriptions, six {{months prior to the}} publication of photographic images, greatly advanced Patteson’s work. As a result of his research, Patteson concluded that there is no other Hebrew <b>text</b> <b>standing</b> between the Cairo Geniza text and the autograph. The basic integrity of the Cairo Giniza Greek text was also established. In most instances the marginal readings in the Cairo Geniza text could be explained. The relationship between the Syriac version was not clear and more study of that version would be required. Patteson’s findings are detailed in his doctoral dissertation, A Study of the Hebrew Text of Sirach 39:27 to 41:24 is available for study in the Duke University Library. Patteson’s other interests included the origin of the alphabet, the pronunciation of ancient Hebrew, Martin Luther’s work as a translator of the Hebrew biblical text, and evidence of Aramaic originals underlying the Greek text of the four gospels.Patteson's work [...] "The Siloam Inscription and Alphabetic Origins" [...] was published by Case Western Press in 1970.|$|R
50|$|That the {{question}} of the createdness of the Qur’an is, among other things, a hermeneutical issue is reflected in the variety of arguments and issues that associate with it - whether the Qur’an or the traditions assert the Qur’an’s createdness, what “created” means, and whether and how this affects the <b>standing</b> of these <b>texts</b> as authoritative and as a consequence, the status of those who study them. Where the Qur’an is understood as the word of God, and the words and example of the Prophet transmitted through hadith also attain to divine significance, if the Qur’an cannot be taken to assert its own createdness, for the doctrine of createdness to be true the traditions would have to support it. Indeed, to admit the insufficiency of the hadith corpus to adjudicate what with the institution of the mihna becomes such a visible dispute would necessarily marginalize the authority of traditions. Thus it is not by accident that al-Ma’mun decides to administer the test on religious scholars. The test of the mihna was applied neither universally nor arbitrarily. In fact, the letter that Al-Ma’mun sent to his lieutenant in Baghdad instituting the mihna stipulated that the test be administered to qadis and traditionists (muhaddithin). Both of these groups regard hadith as central to Qur’anic interpretation and to matters of Islamic jurisprudence. In particular, the rhetorical force of muhaddithin acceptance of the doctrine is then to concede that either or both of the Qur’an and the hadith corpus attest to the doctrine, simultaneously validating the caliph’s theological position and legitimizing his claim to hermeneutical authority with regard to the sacred texts.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{phones are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular and individuals appear to be spending longer durations using them, {{but there seems to}} be no research to date investigating the effect on neck angle. However, increased neck flexion is associated with spinal pathologies (Ariëns et al, 2001). The CSP (2013) acknowledges physiotherapists play a key role in addressing public health issues, by raising awareness of the association between a musculoskeletal disorder and contributory factors. A convenience sample (n = 17) from an adult student population. Exclusion criteria included a musculoskeletal disorder of the spine or upper extremity. A same subject crossover design, counterbalanced with a washout period, was utilised. Photogrammetry was conducted to measure neck angles; there is support for the reliability and validity of this (van Niekerk et al, 2008). Neck angle was defined as the angle between a line joining C 7 and the tragus, and a vertical reference line from C 7 (Sommerich et al, 2001). The two conditions were a self-selected <b>standing</b> posture whilst <b>texting</b> and a standardised upright comfortable (non-texting) standing posture as defined by Silva et al (2011). Mean neck angle for the texting posture was 60. 61 ° (S. D. ± 4. 72), and for the standardised posture was 40. 49 ° (S. D. ± 9. 19). The mean difference in angles was 20. 12 °. (p = 0. 000). Neck angle (a forward head posture) is significantly greater (clinically and statistically) in a texting position. Physiotherapists have a key role to play in providing ergonomic advice; this study indicates that need to for mobile phone users and designers to have a greater awareness of the potential impact of mobile phones on posture, and consequently musculoskeletal disorders...|$|R
40|$|This two-part thesis explores {{aspects of}} Anglo-Saxon number culture through a {{detailed}} examination of numerical encyclopaedic notes. The first part (Chapters I-III) is an edition of seventy-two notes transmitted in eight Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. These manuscripts are London, British Library, MS Cotton Vespasian B. vi, British Library, MS Royal 2. B. v, British Library, MS Cotton Tiberius A. iii, British Library, MS Harley 3271, British Library, MS Cotton Julius A. ii; Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 183 and Corpus Christi College, MS 320; Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS, lat. 2825. The edition in Chapter III is preceded by the manuscript descriptions and discussions in Chapter II where the notes {{are placed in}} their manuscript contexts in order to explore questions about the codicological context and the cultural <b>standing</b> of these <b>texts.</b> The second part consists of three chapters, Chapters IV to VI. Chapter IV is an extensive commentary divided into four parts corresponding to {{the subject matter of}} the notes, which is chronological, spatial, enumerating and miscellaneous. Chapter V provides a series of case studies on metrology and the value of money in Anglo-Saxon monastic and lay culture. In Chapter VI, the computistical notes in British Library, MS Harley 3271 are discussed in the wider context of the study of computus. The two parts of the thesis demonstrate the rich culture of number symbolism these encyclopaedic notes are witnesses to and provide further evidence to the medieval belief of divine order based on Wisdom 11. 21 : ‘but thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight’. It further reveals how inextricably connected the spiritual and practical uses of number were, thereby pointing to an all-encompassing number culture which governed early medieval Christianity...|$|R
40|$|Aristide CANEPA: Riflessioni su stabilità dell’Esecutivo e democrazia rappresentativa nei sistemi parlamentari dell’Europa occidentale (Some Reflections about Stability of the Executive and Representative Democracy in the Parliamentary Systems of Western Europe) Abstract: The work is {{the result}} of prof. Canepa’s {{participation}} in a “Progetto di Ricerca di Interesse Nazionale” (National Interest Research Project) granted in 2006 by the Ministry of University and coordinated by prof. Michele Scudiero (University of Naples-“Federico II”), about “Stability of the Executive and representative democracy”. Prof. Canepa was part of the research unit of the University of Genoa, coordinated by prof. Adriano Giovannelli and in charge of “Stability of the Executive and representative democracy: comparative and European outlines”. Research Units from the Universities of Naples-“Federico II”, Cagliari, Milan and Calabria also took part in the research. Before the exposition of the work content, a little explanation is needed, regarding to the choice of the studied States. The work is focused on the parliamentary and semi-presidential regimes of the main States of Western Europe that never made experience of socialist regimes in their history: in this work, therefore, the concept of Western Europe is not to be regarded in a strictly geographical meaning, but in relation to the geo-political position of the same States before the fall of the Berlin wall. Through the analysis of constitutional <b>texts,</b> <b>standing</b> orders of the Parliaments and other sub-constitutional sources of law, as well as of political customs and usages, the work makes a survey of the main institutional solutions capable of influencing the sensitive balance between the need of stability of the Executive and guarantees for the representativeness of the democratic system. Among such institutional solutions, the work considers especially: the rationalisation of confidence relationship between Governments and Assemblies; the possible powers of the Executive in order to intervene in Parliament works and organization; legislative powers of the Executives and forms of the related parliamentary control; rules about the dissolution of Parliament; rules about the relations between Head of State and Prime Minister; rules about the election of the Head of State and about his/her powers; possible instruments of direct democracy and their influence on representative institutions’ working. Such a survey aims to represent {{the state of the art}} about the institutional balance between Executive and Legislative in the main democracies of Western Europe. But the work aims also to focus on the more recent trends in the matter, paying particular attention to the more significant constitutional reforms passed during the last decade in some of these democracies. Among them, the enforcement of the new Finnish Constitution in 1999 - 2000, the Greek Constitutional reforms of 2001 and 2008, the German one of 2006, as well as the several French reforms between 2000 and 2008 (paying particular attention to the last one, large and detailed) and the important institutional reforms passed in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2005. Furthermore, a part of the work refers to the new institutional balance introduced in the governing bodies of European Union by the Treaty of Lisbon, although with full consciousness that the absolutely unique nature of the EU institutions (especially the political ones: European Parliament, Commission and Council) claims for a great caution in applying to them the interpretative categories usually adopted by the constitutional science. In conclusion, the exam of the more recent reforms seems not to allow to identify an unequivocal direction in the complex process of institutional evolution in the European continent; nonetheless, the work seems to identify a general drift to diminish both the tendency to the centrality of Parliament, in the systems traditionally more oriented to stress the representativeness of the democratic system, and the strong centrality of the Government, in the systems traditionally more oriented to stress the stability of the Executive. A good example of the first kind is the new Finnish Constitution of 1999 - 2000, where both the diminution of the powers of the President and the new rules on the confidence relationship between Parliament and Government play in favour of the Prime Minister. A good example of the second kind is the French constitutional reform of 2008, which undoubtedly enlarged and strengthened the powers of the Parliament...|$|R
