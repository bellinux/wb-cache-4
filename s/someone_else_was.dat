25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We were doing the field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We were doing the field works while <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We were doing the field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We were doing the field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We were doing the field works before someone else started to sing.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell did {{not want}} to appoint Hanna, and offered the seat to Congressman Theodore Burton, a member of neither faction, who turned it down. [...] Historian Wilbur Jones speculates that the seat was refused because of Burton's unwillingness to {{alienate}} Hanna's supporters, an action which might sacrifice a career in the House of Representatives {{for the sake of a}} few months in the Senate. [...] The governor considered other options, such as arranging to get the position himself or calling a special session of the legislature and have them elect a new senator. [...] However, Bushnell eventually decided that appointing <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> not worth risking the wrath of the new presidential administration, and of Hanna (who was chairman of the Republican National Committee). [...] In late February 1897, McKinley sent a personal emissary, his old friend Judge William R. Day, to Bushnell, and the governor yielded. [...] Hanna was given his commission by Governor Bushnell in the lobby of Washington's Arlington Hotel on the morning of March5, 1897.|$|E

500|$|In {{his closing}} speech, defence counsel {{said that the}} key to the case was whether the Orsborne {{brothers}} intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a [...] "joy-ride half-way round the world", than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud [...] "against men whose reputations were above suspicion?". In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: [...] "Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent , the property of <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> being used by them without permission...George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer's interests". The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants. On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and James to 12 months.|$|E

Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> in the room."

2500|$|All 39 {{episodes of}} The Honeymooners were filmed at the DuMont Television Network's [...] Adelphi Theatre at 152 West 54th Street in Manhattan, {{in front of}} an {{audience}} of 1,000. Episodes never were fully rehearsed because Gleason felt rehearsals would rob the show of its spontaneity. A result was that, while the cast was able to bring a fresh approach to the material, mistakes often were made. Lines either were recited incorrectly or altogether forgotten, and actors did not always follow the scripted action directions. To compensate, the cast developed visual cues for each other. For example, Gleason patted his stomach when he forgot a line, while Meadows would glance at the icebox when <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> supposed to retrieve something from it.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in September 1972 Curtiss spent a {{great deal}} of time testing Genie's {{acquisition}} of pronouns and at first found that Genie strenuously resisted, often refusing to respond or clearly guessing, until becoming more receptive to them in late 1973. By December 1972 Genie understood and spontaneously used the pronoun I, pronouncing it with more stress for emphasis, but almost exclusively used it with the words want or like and still frequently referred to herself by name. She did not show any comprehension of any other pronouns besides you and me, which she interchangeably used; Genie would often say, [...] "Mama love you" [...] while pointing to herself, which Curtiss attributed to a manifestation of Genie's inability to distinguish who she was from who <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was.</b> Genie did not spontaneously use any other pronouns or use pronominal forms in her speech, although by 1973 she clearly understood the reciprocal pronoun each other.|$|E

2500|$|In many cases, the {{scientists}} used Genie's language development {{to help them}} gauge her overall psychological state. For instance, Genie consistently confused the pronouns you and me, often saying, [...] "Mama love you" [...] while pointing to herself, which Curtiss attributed to a manifestation of Genie's inability to distinguish who she was from who <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was.</b> The scientists especially noted that she often understood conceptual information even if she lacked the grammar to express it, which they wrote demonstrated that she had greater cognitive abilities than most children in congruous phases of language acquisition. In some instances, learning a new aspect of language played a direct role in furthering her development. At the time Genie learned to say [...] "May I have [...] " [...] as a ritual phrase she was also learning how to use money, and Curtiss wrote that this phrase gave Genie the ability to ask for payment and fueled her desire to make money, causing her {{to take a more}} active role in performing activities which would lead to a reward.|$|E
2500|$|Helene Deutsch's {{relationship}} with her mother was distant and cold. While she generally adored her father, Helene hated her mother, Regina. According to Helene, her mother, 'shared none of her husband's intellectual interests,' and Helene considered her mother's aspirations to be social and materialistic. Helene claimed her mother was abusive, often beating, slapping and verbally attacking her. Helene argued {{that her mother was}} abusive, not to punish her, but 'as an outlet for her own pent-up aggressions' because Helene was not the boy her mother had she wanted and expected. Helene often said that her childhood home was dominated by her mother's overwhelming concern for social propriety and status. Helene considered her mother 'uncultured, intellectually insecure, and a slave to bourgeois propriety'. Although Helene at times yearned for the love of her mother, she never really received any maternal love from her mother. Instead, any maternal presence came from her sister, Malvina, and a woman in the neighborhood affectionately called 'the Pale Countess.' During her childhood, Helene remembered being 'mothered by nine different nurses,' and hated feeling dependent on her [...] These feelings often led her to 'daydream that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> her real mother.' ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2015, the Canadian House of Commons {{public safety}} {{committee}} passed {{a motion to}} invite RCMP Commissioner Paulson to [...] "publicly display and discuss the video" [...] that Zehaf-Bibeau recorded at a future meeting of the committee. Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: [...] "This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [...] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit some soldiers just to show that you're not even safe in your own land, and you gotta be careful. We'll not cease until you guys decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the righteous {{of us who are}} trying to bring back religious law in our countries. Thank you." [...] The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, {{on the day of the}} shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.|$|E
