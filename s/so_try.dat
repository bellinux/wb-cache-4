By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote, [...] "See {{if there is any}} bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if <b>so</b> <b>try</b> and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily.

500|$|Russian {{psychiatrist}} Fedor Kondratev {{not only}} denied accusations {{that he was}} ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception {{of the existence of}} Soviet-era [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] was nothing more than: [...] "the fantasy [...] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [...] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends." [...] He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War. As Alexander Podrabinek writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion. In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under Russian Civil Code Article 152 on protecting one's honor, dignity and business reputation. According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions. The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia. As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, {{after the fall of the}} communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities, no matter how the doctors, if one may call them <b>so,</b> <b>try</b> to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.|$|E

Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, <b>so</b> <b>try</b> to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movieâ€”it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E
