50|$|The {{chassis frame}} has an {{underframe}} {{designed to make}} {{a unit of the}} engine and gearbox both of which are supported by it along the full length of both their sides. Suspension is by semi-elliptic springs all round. At the rear universal-jointed radius rods tie the rear-axle casing to the chassis frame. A triangular torque rod held at its front end by a spring buffer resists the reaction of driving and braking. Internal expanding brakes are fitted to the rear wheels together with an external hinged <b>shoe</b> <b>brake</b> behind the gear box.|$|E
5000|$|The twin leading <b>shoe</b> <b>brake</b> {{was adopted}} in 1968. This is often {{retrofitted}} to earlier bikes {{as shown in}} the bike pictured above which is a 1964 model. It provides superb braking and when set up correctly, performs as well as '70s era disc brakes. This year had the introduction of the Amal concentric carburettor. The TR6R was the [...] "Sport" [...] version with low pipes, and the TR6C was the [...] "Trophy Special" [...] with high pipes and folding footpegs. The TR6C Trophy Special was built at the request of Triumph's sole US distributor at the time, Johnson Motors in southern California, as a way to target the growing number of desert riders. It was fitted with Dunlop Trials Universal block-tread tires and was the model referred to as the [...] "Desert Sled".|$|E

Models 250 cc and above were fitted with large twin leading <b>shoe</b> drum <b>brakes</b> until 1975 when disc front brakes were introduced. Models under 250 cc had single leading <b>shoe</b> <b>brakes.</b> Most models had six-speed gearboxes, enabling the factory tuner to raise engine speed with the consequent narrowing of the power band.|$|R
5000|$|Traxxas's first RTR Nitro truck. The Traxxas' Nitro Hawk, though {{already a}} legacy model, is highly {{collectible}} {{and are still}} being sold at toy auctions till this time. The highest recorded bid, in 2011, sold for $360.00, {{much more than the}} price of a new one.The Traxxas Nitro Hawk was a two-wheel drive stadium truck with an all-aluminum chassis that came with four different engines, the Image [...]12, the TRX12, TRX15 and Pro15 in a special long crankshaft configuration. The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel secured with a nut {{at the end of the}} crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its <b>shoe</b> <b>brake</b> system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust spring load and 2.2-inch lite dish wheels with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back. Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.First editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.|$|E
40|$|MiroSurge is a System for robot-assisted {{minimally}} invasive surgery currently developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It consists of a variable number of MIRO lightweight robot arms, which can be equipped with different types of instruments {{for a wide range}} of surgical applications. To further extend the versatility of the system, the mobile support system MAIA was developed, where the robots can be moved independently from each other during the procedure. That way the system setup is simplified and the robots can be positioned in an advantageous configuration. In this work the existing concept was revised to enable electric position-controlled movement and fixation of the robot arms. By incorporating electric components the integration into the workflow of the operating room is simplified and the precision of the positioning increases. In a first step all system requirements regarding the planned use in the operating room and the internal targets of the DLR were gathered and organized. Based on these requirements the main functions of the system were identified and structured, appropriate solution principles were determined. Wherever feasible, commercially available components were used for the realization of the found solutions. All other parts were constructed using PTC Creo 2. 0. The separate parts were virtually assembled and the overall design was optimized. A parts list and technical drawings were compiled and all necessary data for the building of the system was created. Finally the fulfilment of the prior formulated requirements was verified and following tasks and possible improvements were investigated. The result of this development process is an electrically driven system. The movement of each robot cart is created by a pulley, which is driven by an electric motor and rolls along a drive belt. The position is detected by a magnetic positioning system, where a cart-mounted sensor moves along a scale tape. The fixation of the carts is achieved using a <b>shoe</b> <b>brake,</b> which is actuated by a ball-type linear drive combined with an electric motor. The system is controlled via computer, all necessary motor controllers are situated in an additional mobile rack...|$|E
50|$|The wheel {{cylinder}} {{consists of a}} cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each piston has a rubber seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a <b>brake</b> <b>shoe.</b> When <b>brake</b> pressure is applied, the pistons are forced out pushing the shoes {{into contact with the}} drum. Some designs use two single piston {{wheel cylinder}}s, one {{at the top of the}} drum and one at the bottom, each connected to one <b>brake</b> <b>shoe.</b>|$|R

50|$|SLS (single leading <b>shoe)</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are still}} {{used for the}} rear wheel of many motorcycles, and for the front wheel of smaller bikes and scooters. An SLS brake is less {{powerful}} than a TLS, {{but that is not}} an issue for a motorcycle's rear brake. Compared to cars, bikes are higher and have a shorter wheelbase, so weight-transference under braking is much more pronounced. Excessive braking force can cause the rear wheel to lock, so it is normal for a bike's rear brake to be much less powerful than the front. Since 1969, modern motorcycles tend to have disc brake(s) on the front wheel, and sometimes a smaller disc brake on the rear wheel. Before disc brakes became commonplace on bikes, performance machines tended to have twin-leading-shoe drum brakes, and some racing machines even had four-leading <b>shoe</b> drum <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|A popular {{modification}} by railroads {{in later}} years was {{reducing the number of}} <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> from 8 to 4 by reconfiguring the double-clasp brake rigging, removing one <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> per wheel.

50|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a {{class of}} brake in which each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} seat stay or fork. Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot.

The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. In the first-class lever design, the arm pivots above the rim. The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.Due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes.
