Due to the heterogeneity of the users of such systems and their short residence time, the usability of a system’s user interface is of great importance. Currently, an intuitive and flexible usage is often limited because of the monolithic system architecture of existing <b>Self-Service</b> <b>Systems.</b> Furthermore, today’s <b>Self-Service</b> <b>Systems</b> represent the one-and-only endpoint of communication with a customer when processing a transaction. The integration of the customer’s personal computing devices, like desktop PC, notebook, and smartphone is not sufficiently covered yet. In order to tackle these problems, we have established a methodology for developing adaptive UIs for Multi-Channel Self-Services where a customer may, for example, start a transaction on a PC at home, modify it with the smartphone, and finally finish it at a Self-Service terminal. In this paper we describe our integrated model-based approach {{for the development of}} adaptive user interfaces for distributed Multi-Channel <b>Self-Service</b> <b>Systems...</b>|$|R

The number of coins or tokens inserted determines the amount of time customers have to operate the equipment; in most instances, a minimum number of coins is necessary to start the equipment. These facilities are often equipped with separate vacuum stations that allow customers to clean the upholstery and rugs inside their cars.

The requirement of relocation exists {{at the beginning of each}} transport process in passenger transport. Finding the appropriate connection, familiarity with the transport conditions, the purchase of travel documents and their subsequent validation are other activities involving the transport process. One form of validation can be ensured by the responsible employees of the carrier. The second form is a creation of <b>self-service</b> <b>system</b> on the track section. Economic matters of carrier points to disadvantages of validation the travel documents by train crew in comparison to the tracks where is implemented the <b>self-service</b> <b>system.</b> Paper analyzes the possibilities of validation machine placement for the validation of travel documents, which can be placed at railway stations and stops or in vehicles in low demand areas of railway transport. The paper analyzes the factors that affect the required quantity of validation machines at the railway stations and stops or in railway vehicles, depending on the parameters of railway infrastructure (number of tracks, maximum track speed, number of railway stations and stops on the track and their average mutual distance), railway vehicle fleet (construction of the vehicles, number of doors, transport capacity) and transport technology (time of train sets circulation, transport distance, travel speed, creating timetable).

Through literature review, in-depth interviews, and participatory action research, we formalized five core system modules, including: 1) user behavior and lifestyle, 2) thematic trend analysis, 3) technology screening and translation, 4) idea visualization, and 5) O 2 O service connection, with corresponding design principles for supporting user creativity in a web-based self-services environment.

40|$|Customers {{behavior}} has been always {{one of the}} most important points of the marketing studies. Predicting and understanding how and why customers behave is a great challenge. Besides, there are so many variables involved in the consumption process, that it is not an easy task to establish models to understand it. Human behavior is based not only on personal characteristics, but also on the psychological, environmental, social and cultural environment that they are submitted. Predicting and understanding the behavior and habits of customers in case of food products or their daily intake foods is known to be a great challenge. However, there are different retailing system that deliver the food products from producers and manufacturer to customers. like in Sweden retailing system is mostly performed by <b>self-service</b> <b>system</b> while in Iran it is mostly based on full-service system. The differences between the retailing system of these two countries brought up the idea that retailing system can also act as a factor which can influence customers behavior, attitudes and perception to food products and their safeties. Therefore, this research has studied the change in retailing system trends and retailing system in Sweden & Iran. Moreover, by help of sample of customers in these two countries the behavior and habits of them upon food products has been considered and studied. Due to the gathered data and analysis, it seems that the retailing systems and the way that customers could have access to the products can have impact and influences on their behavior and habits upon the food products and food products safeties...|$|E
40|$|Large waiting {{times at}} {{hospital}} outpatient clinics are {{a cause of}} dissatisfaction to patients, cause additional stress to hospital staff, {{increase the risk of}} contagion and add complications for patients with medical conditions. Reducing waiting times and surgeon idle time improves the quality of service and efficiency of a hospital: this is a recently growing focus in healthcare. Oulu hospital wants to identify and reduce large waiting times at their out-patient clinic. For the past few years the clinic has used a <b>self-service</b> <b>system</b> whereby patients register on arrival and hospital staff use a patient call-in system. The past schedules are analyzed using this data: information visualizations and performance measures are provided. The worst performing clinic sessions are the subject of the scheduling optimization prototype system. The scheduling optimization focuses on predicting the duration of an appointment and the late arrival of the surgeon. These two factors have been identified as causes of long patient waiting times. The variance of the duration is identified to be high, therefore supervised-learning regression is used for both simple inference and prediction. The features that are good predictors and the results of the prediction accuracy are reported. With the predicted appointment durations, and surgeon arrival times, a scheduling optimization approach is used to improve the existing schedule; a simple greedy hill-climbing approach is evaluated. It is found that using the historical data to simulate a real day, appointment rules and scheduling optimization the patient waiting time is reduced with this method. Showing the system to be potentially promising...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Self-service</b> <b>systems</b> {{are very}} common in the public space and {{usability}} {{plays a crucial role}} for user acceptance. We describe the evaluation of a self-service ticketing machine installed in trams in the city of Graz. Two insitu methods (behavior observation, contextual interview) and an online survey were used. We discuss advantages of the different methods experienced in the present study according to effort and output. Unsurprisingly online survey was advantageous in terms of time effort. Concerning output, behavior observation identified the most issues with specific interface objects of all methods. Furthermore we were able to identify usage information about the user group of elderlies. Online survey provided a higher number of general issues with the machine and recommendations for change than the two in-situ methods. Further results are discussed and limitations of the study are described in the paper...|$|R
