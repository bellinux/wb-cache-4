50|$|One of {{the ways}} in which the new airline was {{planning}} to set a standard for high-quality in-flight service was by completely revamping the seat-back catering practised by most contemporary charter airlines. At the time, this consisted of serving spam salad on all flights out and sandwiches back. This seemed to be a low-cost way of minimal catering on inclusive tours but was labour-intensive especially when taking into account that these meals needed to be prepared freshly several hours before departure. Caterers were charging for fresh preparation and seasonal produce. However, the <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> tended to wilt and the sandwiches acquired quickly staled to the dry atmosphere inside an aircraft cabin. As a result, many passengers disliked the food. Thus Air Europe resolved to serve proper, restaurant-style meals including at least three courses — a starter, a hot main course and a dessert — on all flights, time permitting. This saw bulk-purchase of deep-frozen ingredients only to take advantage of lower rates. Eschewing inbound local catering, the frozen food could stay in the aircraft's holds, which would generally not be filled to capacity. Other than operating only brand-new aircraft from the very beginning, this was a second unique selling point.|$|E
40|$|Contaminated <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> {{have emerged}} as {{important}} vehicles for the transmission of enteric pathogens to humans. A recent outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg (S. Senftenberg) in the United Kingdom has been traced to the consumption of contaminated basil. Using the outbreak strain of S. Senftenberg, we found that it binds to basil, lettuce, rocket and spinach leaves showing a pattern of diffuse adhesion. Flagella were seen linking S. Senftenberg to the leaf epidermis, and the deletion of fliC (encoding phase- 1 flagella) resulted in a significantly reduced level of adhesion. In contrast, although flagella linking S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to the basil leaf epidermis were widespread, deletion of fliC did not affect leaf attachment levels. These results implicate the role of flagella in Salmonella leaf attachment and suggest that different Salmonella serovars use strain-specific mechanisms to attach to <b>salad</b> <b>leaves...</b>|$|E
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes {{child and}} travelers' {{diarrhea}} and {{is presumed to}} be water- and food-borne. Sporadic outbreaks were traced to consumption of contaminated fresh produce, particularly <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> as lettuce and parsley. Importantly, the mechanism by which ETEC binds <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> is not known. In this study we investigated the ability of clinical ETEC isolates to adhere to Eruca vesicaria (commonly known as rocket). Towards this end we inoculated pieces of cut E. vesicaria leaves with clinical ETEC isolates grown in Luria broth at 20 °C, conditions that are not permissive for expression of the plasmid-encoded colonization factors and hence mimic the actual transmission pathways of ETEC through intake of contaminated food. We found that ETEC strains bind E. vesicaria at various efficiencies. Examination of representative strains by scanning electron microscopy revealed that they adhere to the E. vesicaria surface in a diffuse pattern by extended filaments resembling flagella. Using the prototype ETEC strain H 10407 we found that it also binds to lettuce, basil and spinach leaves. Binding of H 10407 was dependent on flagella as a fliC mutant attached to leaves {{at a much lower}} efficiency. Interestingly, under the employed environmental conditions EtpA, which forms a flagellar tip structure, and colonization factor I are dispensable for leaf attachment. The results show that ETEC can bind specifically to <b>salad</b> <b>leaves,</b> which might represent an important, yet less recognized, source of infection...|$|E

40|$|Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella {{are capable}} of causing {{gastrointestinal}} illness if ingested with food. There is an urgent need within the food processing industry to improve the efficiency of both the sanitising processes used on fresh produce and the microbiological methods used to ensure its safety. The aims {{of this study were}} to develop novel microscopic methods to detect and quantify both indigenous leaf bacteria and viable human pathogens on <b>salad</b> <b>leaves,</b> without the need for recovery and culture, which may reduce the accuracy of quantification. The methods developed could then be used to quantify the number of indigenous and inoculated bacteria in situ on <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> as well as to identify factors affecting the quantity and spatial patterning of attachment. In addition, the efficacy of chemical biocides for the reduction of viable Salmonella on <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> was considered. Episcopic Differential Interference Contrast (EDIC) microscopy coupled with epifluorescence was used to rapidly and non-destructively view the natural microflora in situ on spinach leaves. Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson was inoculated onto spinach leaves in order to observe spatial and temporal patterning of colonisation under differing conditions. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mutants defective in curli fimbriae production were used to assess the role of curli in attachment to abiotic surfaces and leaves. Viability determination of potential viable but non-culturable (VNC), sub-lethally stressed cells was performed to assess the effect of chemical wash treatments on Salmonella attached to fresh spinach. The results obtained indicate that <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> are densely populated with naturally occurring bacteria; these are found predominantly in the margins between leaf epidermal cells as well as around leaf veins and stomata. Cells were present in complex three-dimensional aggregations, suggesting the presence of biofilms. Curli fimbriae were shown to be key in the attachment of Salmonella typhimurium to polystyrene but not to leaf surfaces. When Salmonella thompson was inoculated onto spinach leaves and then subjected to chemical washing in chlorine or Citrox, neither chemical was an effective biocide against the pathogen. Under-reporting of viable cell numbers by plate counting methods indicated that chlorine induced a viable but nonculturable (VNC) state amongst Salmonella. These findings have important implications for the sanitisation of salads; both stomatal penetration and the formation of biofilms could protect enteric bacteria on leaves from chemical and mechanical disinfection strategies. If human pathogens are able to spread to <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> from contaminated soil, irrigation water or directly from animal faeces, and actively penetrate the interior of the leaves, then the microbiological safety of ready-to-eat salads cannot be guaranteed. This study also suggests that current methods for detection of pathogenic bacteria in foods following processing may be under-reporting the threat to consumers due to the induction of the VNC state amongst pathogenic bacteria.

40|$|In August 2015, Public Health England {{detected}} {{an outbreak}} of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O 157 :H 7 caused by contaminated <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> in a mixed leaf prepacked salad product from a national retailer. The implicated leaves were cultivated at five different farms and the zoonotic {{source of the outbreak}} strain was not determined. In March 2016, additional isolates from new cases were identified that shared a recent common ancestor with the outbreak strain. A case-case study involving the cases identified in 2016 revealed that ovine exposures were associated with illness (n = 16; AOR 8 · 24; 95 % CI 1 · 55 - 39 · 74). By mapping the recent movement of sheep and lambs across the United Kingdom, epidemiological links were established between the cases reporting ovine exposures. Given the close phylogenetic relationship between the outbreak strain and the isolates from cases with ovine exposures, it is plausible that ovine faeces may have contaminated the <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> via untreated irrigation water or run-off from fields nearby. Timely and targeted veterinary and environmental sampling should be considered during foodborne outbreaks of STEC, particularly where ready to eat vegetables and salads are implicated...|$|E

40|$|The ‘processability’ of baby <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> may {{be defined}} as the ability to {{withstand}} the postharvest washing and packing processes that are involved in the production of ready-to-eat bagged salads. The inability of baby <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> (species including Lactuca sativa L. and Spinacia oleracea L.) to withstand processing results in a reduction in crop shelf-life. Leaves from geographically diverse locations displayed strikingly different processability scores from visual inspection. We have shown that these ‘good’ and ‘poor’ quality leaves may be differentiated from assessments of the biophysical properties of the cell wall (% plasticity) and epidermal cell size. Artificial manipulation of processability in the glasshouse through the application of a mechanical stress or a high salt stress produced L. sativa cv. Ravita (a leaf type ‘lollo rosso’ lettuce) leaves covering a range of processability. Mechanical stress, applied as a daily dose of 100 paper strokes, increased lettuce leaf shelf-life by 33 % and was associated with reduced % plasticity and smaller leaf epidermal cells. These traits are thus proposed to be of key importance in the description of processability, with the plant cell wall and plant cell wall gene expression implicated. The potential for future manipulation of these traits for the pre-packed salad market is considered...|$|E
40|$|Zoonotic {{pathogens}} such as Salmonella {{can cause}} gastrointestinal illness {{if they are}} ingested with food. Foods such as salads pose a greater risk because they are consumed raw and have {{been the source of}} major outbreaks of disease from fresh produce. The novel light microscopy methods used in this study allow detailed, high resolution imaging of the leaf surface environment (the phyllosphere) and allow pathogen tracking. Episcopic differential interference contrast microscopy coupled with epifluorescence was used to view the natural microflora in situ on <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> and their topographical distribution. Fluorescent nucleic acid staining was used to differentiate between bacterial colonists and inorganic debris. Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson expressing green fluorescent protein was inoculated onto individual spinach leaves for 24 h at 22 °C in order to observe spatial and temporal patterning of colonization on the two surfaces of each leaf under different osmotic conditions. The results obtained show that <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> are host to high numbers of bacteria, typically 105 per square millimetre. Cells are present in complex three-dimensional aggregations which often have a slimy appearance, suggesting the presence of biofilms. Washing of the leaves had little effect on the number of adherent pathogens, suggesting very strong attachment. Episcopic differential interference contrast microscopy is a rapid alternative to both scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy for visualizing leaf topography and biofilm formation in the natural state...|$|E
40|$|Baby <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> of salad roquette, arugula in the U. S. (Eruca vesicaria ssp. sativa) had an {{increased}} postharvest shelf life of 2 to 6 days, while lollo rosso lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. `Ravita') and red chard [Beta vulgaris L. var. flavescens (Lam.) Lam] baby <b>salad</b> <b>leaves</b> had increased shelf life of 1 to 2 days when harvested {{at the end}} of the day compared with leaves harvested at the start of the day. We have shown that improved shelf life of salad roquette and lollo rosso following end-of-day harvest was correlated with altered biophysical characteristics of the cell walls, with increased cell wall extensibility (percent plasticity and elasticity) measured at end of day. Leaf turgor pressure (P, MPa) was also highest in salad roquette and red chard {{at the end of}} day. Improved shelf life following `end of day' harvest was also associated with the accumulation of leaf sucrose in salad roquette but not lollo rosso and red chard following daily photosynthesis. Diurnal alterations of leaf starch concentration were detected in lollo rosso and red chard but not in salad roquette. The degree of leaf shelf life extension in salad roquette and red chard was further associated with the peak rates of leaf photosynthetic activity. These data suggest that, depending on species, significant improvements to postharvest shelf life could be achieved through the rescheduling of time of day for harvest and also provide relevant information on the selection of traits for future genetic improvement. <br/...|$|E
