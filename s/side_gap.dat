In order to improve the machining accuracy of NC-ECCEM technology, the research works on precision NC-ECCEM technology are needed, and especially the study on its shaping law is significant for improving the machining accuracy of workpiece profile. In this paper, the shaping law of machining the planar surface by use of a kind of inner-spraying cathode with rectangle section was studied. First, the basic differential equations of shaping law in the case of cathode movement were established. Then, considering the structure of the cathode, the methods for calculating the <b>side</b> <b>gap</b> in machining the planar surface was given.

Thus ultra-short current pulses can easily be obtained without a need to use an expensive ultra-short pulse generator.

40|$|Electrochemical {{micromachining}} (ECµM) is {{an emerging}} non-conventional manufacturing technology {{suitable for the}} fabrication of micro-sized components {{on a wide range}} of electrically conductive materials. This study emphasises on the effects of electrolyte temperature on the Faradaic effect during electrochemical microdrilling on nickel plates by a cylindrical microtool made of tungsten. A short cylindrical microtool of 43 µm in diameter near to the tool tip and 53 µm mean diameter was selected, and allowed to machine on nickel plate. During machining, only the electrolyte temperature was varied keeping all the other parameters constant. The shape and size of the fabricated microholes, machining time, actual material removal rate, non-Faradaic non-transient effect and the number of short circuits are considered as response factors. Experimental results confirm that the material removal rate and machining time, respectively, increases and decreases with an increase in the electrolyte temperature.

40|$|The {{steady flow}} {{characteristics}} around a swing-type valve plate {{installed in a}} rectangular duct are studied theoretically and experimentally {{in order to determine}} the fluid force acting on a swing-type check valve and the side-gap-leakage effects. The results show that the side-gap leakage has dominant influence upon the fluid force characteristics, which can be well predicted by a small modification of the conventional two-dimensional potential flow theory. For the case of a large <b>side</b> <b>gap,</b> the pressure over the valve plate becomes nearly uniform and is equal to the upstream one. And that the fluid force is expressed as a function of only the velocity ratio of the jet to the upstream, if the side-gap-leakage is less than the mainflow volume. It is pointed out that the separation zone at the back of a valve plate is recovered very rapidly due to momentum transfer effects of side-gap-leakage, and that the outlet flow from a valve plate is not contracted with its width nearly equal to the valve opening one.

40|$|AbstractThe metal grille, {{commonly}} {{composed of}} {{an amount of}} diamond holes, has been growingly used as a key structure on stealth aircraft. Electrochemical machining (ECM) promises to be increasingly applied in aircraft manufacturing {{on the condition that}} process stability is guaranteed. In this work, a flow field model was designed to improve the process stability. This model is endowed with a variety of flow channel features, together with vibrating feeding modes. The flow field distribution on the bottom surface of the diamond hole was discussed and evaluated as well. The numerical results show that a short arc flow channel could significantly enhance the uniformity of electrolyte velocity distribution and a vibrating feeding of the cathode enables to reduce both fluctuations of the electrolyte velocity and pressure on the bottom surface of the diamond hole. Consequently, the flow field mutations were eliminated. It is verified from the experimental results that a short arc flow channel, when combined with vibrating feeding, is capable of improving machining localization and process stability markedly. What is more, the <b>side</b> <b>gap</b> on the bottom surface of the diamond hole could also be reduced by the abovementioned approach...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining {{symmetric}} {{and balanced}} gaps under equilateral loads {{is a common}} goal in posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) -retaining and -sacrificing TKAs. Owing to limitations in existing surgical tensors, however, tensing knee ligaments with standardized and symmetric loads has been possible only with the patella subluxated or everted. We therefore determined the influences of (1) patellar eversion versus complete reduction, (2) PCL resection, and (3) load magnitude on gap symmetry and balance in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) -deficient knee. We used a novel computer-controlled tensioner to measure gaps in 10 cadavers with an applied force of 50  N, 75  N, and 100  N per <b>side.</b> <b>Gap</b> data were acquired at 0 º, 30 º, 60 º, 90 º, and 120 º flexion with the patella reduced and everted and with the PCL intact and resected.
