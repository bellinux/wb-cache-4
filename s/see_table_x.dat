40|$|Appendix C {{presents}} the equations {{that were used}} to calculate media and food concentrations of contaminants for the indirect exposure pathways. Also included in the appendix are equations used in estimating individual cancer risk and hazard quotients. Parameter values and references are presented in Appendices A and E. The individual equations are organized into six groups. These are as follows: 1) soil concentration; 2) terrestrial food chain concentration; 3) aquatic food chain and drinking water concentration; 4) direct inhalation exposure; 5) cancer risks and hazard quotients; and 6) breastmilk exposure. Each group is discussed in a separate section in this appendix. The introduction to each section provides a brief discussion of the equations. Equations are presented in a table format. The tables show the equations, identify the exposure scenarios, list all input parameters, and identify the default values where appropriate. The default value column of the tables may contain one of the following designations instead of (or in addition to) a default value: • shaded, no value: this signifies that this row of the table describes either the parameter being calculated by the given equation or a units conversion constant in the equation. • modeled (see Appendix A) : this indicates a deposition rate or air concentration, as determined by the ISCSTDFT model, as described in Section 3. • calculated (<b>see</b> <b>Table</b> C-x. <b>x)</b> : this indicates that an equation is given for calculating the parameter in the indicated <b>table.</b> • site-specific (<b>see</b> Appendix A) : this indicates that the parameter is site-specific and that no default value is considered appropriate. • chemical-specific (see Appendix E) : this indicates that the parameter is chemical-specific, and specific values are provided in Appendix E. • varies (see Appendix E) : this indicates that the parameter- typically an exposure parameter- varies, and specific values are provided in Appendix E...|$|R
