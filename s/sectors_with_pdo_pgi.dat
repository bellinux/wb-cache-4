40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{research}} on competitive interdependency of Italian extra virgin olive oil through analysis of the sales scanner data. The paper analyses the strengths and weaknesses of Social Network Analysis approach in the olive oil market. The research addresses issues of three segments of high quality olive oils: popular extra virgin olive oil, pdo/pgi extra virgin olive oils, and finally, the " 100 % Italian olive oil". The analysis results show several aspects. The extra virgin olive oil market is highly polarized. There are large industrial companies with national products and other smes with regional products. While large enterprises have an intensive distribution in all grocery shops, in the distributions of smes the situation is much more complex. Some smes have a very strong sales organization, but fail to have similar market shares. Conversely, other small businesses, even if they have a low level of distribution, are able to gain market share more high. The analysis of sales by the sna approach remains a useful tool for smes which need to rationalize their presence in the grocery sector. Finally, the analysis shows segments of the market (<b>pdo,</b> <b>pgi,</b> bio, etc.) where smes may be able to compete with large industrial firms. ...|$|R

The aim of this work is to understand how consumers make their choices based on the most important peaches’ attributes and levels. In this work, 4 attributes with 3 levels in each attribute have been considered (price: 1. 5 €/kg, 2. 5 €/kg and 3. 5 €/kg; origin: PDO Calanda, non PDO Calanda and non Calanda; packaging: bulk, conventional packaging and active packaging; and fruit size: small, medium and big). Four Best-Worst (BW) exploded models have been utilised, two of them with scale factors. All those models have been compared to two traditional Discrete Choice (DC) models. Results show that traditional DC models have better performance than the other models and the best model is when consumers select the best option. Within the exploded models, the choice sequence decisions starting from worst options are better than those which start from best option.

All samples were found to meet the European Legislation, but some didn’t meet the requirements of the PDO specifications. Concerning the floral origin of honey, our results showed the prevalence of rosemary (Lavandula pedunculata) pollen. The microbiological quality of all the analyzed samples was satisfactory, since fecal coliforms, sulfite-reducing clostridia and Salmonella were absent, and molds and yeasts were detected in low counts. Significant differences between the results were studied using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s HSD test. The samples were submitted to discriminant function analysis, in order to determine which variables differentiate between two or more naturally occurring groups (Forward Stepwise Analysis).

Identify natural climate extreme {{variability}} {{is very important to}} understand the interaction between this kind of variability and the anthropogenically-forced. This paper investigate temporal variability of extreme temperature indexes from a daily database of maximum and minimum temperature from five meteorological stations in Uruguay, Southeastern South America. The indexes are percentile-based from the 1961 - 1990 base period; we use Tx 90 (warm days), Tx 10 (cold days), Tn 90 (warm nights) and Tn 10 (cold nights). We analyzed the annual, summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) series of each index. The Tx 90, Tx 10 and Tn 10 indexes had significant negative trends, while Tn 90 have significant positive trend. A marked minimum in almost all detrended indexes were detected around {{the second part of the}} 1970 s, which is presumably related to the well known climatic jump of 1976 / 77. The spectral analysis was performed using the Multitaper Methods. The detrended annual series, showed significant interannual oscillation with periods of 3 to 5 years and in some index and for the longest series a significant oscillation of 7 to 10 years were also found. To better identify temporal variability in decadal to multidecadal scales, the series were smoothed in time by 10 -year running mean. A significant oscillation at 99 % level were found in all indexes and for all the station with period of 15 to 25 years. The interannual variability was also significant for the smoothed series. Relationship between temperature indexes and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, were studied for the smoothed annual, summer (DEF) and winter (JJA) seasonal series. The most relevant result, showed a significant negative correlation <b>with</b> <b>PDO</b> phases. A positive (negative) PDO index is correlated with cold (warm) winters and warm (cold) summers. Two of the stations analyzed have an out of phase behavior of the Tn 10 and Tx 90 10 -yr running mean indexes.

40|$|Variations in {{agricultural}} production due to rainfall and temperature fluctuations are a {{primary cause of}} food insecurity on the African continent. Analysis of changes in phenology can provide quantitative information {{on the effect of}} climate variability on growing seasons {{in agricultural}} regions. Using a robust statistical methodology, we describe the relationship between phenology metrics derived from the 26 year AVHRR NDVI record and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI). We map the most significant positive and negative correlation for the four climate indices in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa between two phenological metrics and the climate indices. Our objective is to provide evidence of whether climate variability captured in the four indices has {{had a significant impact on}} the vegetative productivity of Africa during the past quarter century. We found that the start of season and cumulative NDVI were significantly affected by large scale variations in climate. The particular climate index and the timing showing highest correlation depended heavily on the region examined. In Western Africa the cumulative NDVI correlates <b>with</b> <b>PDO</b> in September-November. In Eastern Africa the start of the June-October season strongly correlates <b>with</b> <b>PDO</b> in March-May, while the PDO in December-February correlates with the start of the February-June season. The cumulative NDVI over this last season relates to the MEI of March-May. For Southern Africa, high correlations exist between SOS and NAO of September-November, and cumulative NDVI and MEI of March-May. The research shows that climate indices can be used to anticipate late start and variable vigor in the growing season of sensitive agricultural regions in Africa...|$|R

We analyzed the extent to which PDO specifications and/or a mountain environment influence the spatial distribution of estimated breeding values (EBVs) of cows and the herd–year effects (HYEs) for milk yield (kg/lactation) and protein and fat contents (g/kg), as well as lactation ranks and calving months. The study focused on the northern French Alps. A total of 37 023 lactations, recorded in 2006, in 1153 herds were analyzed. The cows belonged to the Montbéliarde (21 516 lactations), Abondance (10 346 lactations) and Tarentaise (5161 lactations) breeds. The two factors of variation considered were the status of the commune where the farm was located in relation to PDO (three categories: area <b>with</b> no <b>PDO,</b> area <b>with</b> a <b>PDO</b> <b>with</b> no milk yield limit, area <b>with</b> a <b>PDO</b> <b>with</b> a milk yield limit) and ‘mountain’ environment (four categories based on the European regulation: plain, piedmont, mountain and high mountain). In the Abondance breed, the average lactation rank increased with an increase in production constraints due to the PDO or to a mountain environment. In the Abondance and Tarentaise breeds, grouping of calving in winter was most marked in the ‘PDO with a milk yield limit’ and ‘high-mountain’ categories. In the Tarentaise breed, no significant effect on any trait and any variable was found in the ‘PDO’ or ‘mountain’ categories. In the other two breeds, the average EBV for milk yield decreased with an increase in the constraints due to <b>PDO,</b> <b>with</b> differences of 226 and 93 kg between extreme values in the Abondance and Montbéliarde breeds, respectively. The average HYE for milk yield was higher in the Abondance breed in the ‘PDO with no milk yield limit’ category than in the other categories (+ 740 and + 1110 kg, respectively); HYE was not affected by the ‘PDO’ factor in the Montbéliarde breed or by the ‘mountain’ factor in either breed. Concerning the protein and fat contents, the effect of the ‘PDO’ and ‘mountain’ factors depended on the trait, the variable and the breed.
