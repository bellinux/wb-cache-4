5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could {{be said for the}} souls of the family, both living and dead. It was built by Peter Lyte in about 1343, and was completed by 1358, and would have served both the original manor which now no longer survives and later {{the existing}} house. It has a small window, or <b>squint,</b> that permitted servants and others to observe communion from the house.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (<b>squint).</b> Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} <b>squint</b> (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E

50|$|<b>Squinting</b> is {{most often}} practiced by {{people who suffer from}} {{refractive}} errors of the eye who either do not have or are not using their glasses. <b>Squinting</b> helps momentarily improve their eyesight by slightly changing the shape of the eye to make it more round, which helps light properly reach the fovea. <b>Squinting</b> also decreases the amount of light entering the eye, making it easier to focus on what the observer is looking at by removing rays of light which enter the eye at an angle and would need to otherwise be focused by the observer's faulty lens and cornea.|$|R

5|$|Chevelle {{has sold}} over four million albums in the United States. The band's first studio album, Point #1, was {{released}} on a small record label called <b>Squint</b> Entertainment. Chevelle's second album, Wonder What's Next (October 8, 2002), was certified Platinum by the RIAA after a debut at No.14 on the United States albums chart, Billboard 200. This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In) (September 21, 2004), the band's third album debuted at No.8 and has been certified Gold. Chevelle has since released a fourth album, Vena Sera (April 3, 2007), a fifth album, Sci-Fi Crimes, (August 31, 2009), and a sixth album Hats Off to the Bull (December 6, 2011). Their seventh album, La Gárgola, {{was released on}} April 1, 2014. Their eighth album, The North Corridor, was released on July 8, 2016. Other releases from Chevelle include two live albums, DVDs and a compilation of band favorites.|$|E

25|$|An anchorite — {{apparently}} a woman called Myliana — was {{housed in a}} stone cell attached to the church from about 1250. A <b>squint</b> was added {{at the same time}} to give her a view into the chancel towards the altar and to allow her to receive Communion. Another known occupant of the cell was Prior Robert, who died there in 1285. The <b>squint</b> was later blocked, but in about 1900 it was uncovered. Some lancet windows were added in the nave in the late 13th century, and in the 14th century the chancel received two new window openings.|$|E

25|$|For the two lead male characters, {{who play}} step {{brothers}} in the film, several actors from the Tamil film industry were considered. Real-life siblings Surya and Karthi, as well as Jeeva and Githan Ramesh were considered for the roles, which were at last won by Arya, renewing his association with Bala after Naan Kadavul, and Vishal Krishna. Vishal later creditted Arya, who were friends even before entering the film industry, for {{becoming part of the}} project. Both actors had to change their looks; they reportedly tonsured their heads for their roles, and kept their looks secretive, avoiding public appearances. Vishal stated that he sports a <b>squint</b> and wore braces throughout the film. He reportedly became the first ever actor to attempt a <b>squint</b> look in a feature film, which was considered for an entry in The Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E
25|$|Synkinesis is {{the result}} from miswiring of nerves after trauma. This result is {{manifested}} through involuntary muscular movements accompanying voluntary movements. For example, voluntary smiling will induce an involuntary contraction of the eye muscles causing the eye to <b>squint</b> when smiling. Most commonly involved are facial muscles and the extraocular muscles, rarely the hands are performing mirror movements.|$|E

Set within the arch is a further chamfered arch supported by respondshalf-piers attached to walls supporting an archof semi-circular columns with flat-face faceted moulded bases, and foliate capitals that have been part-restored. A 19th-century-added arched <b>squint</b> is on each side of the chancel arch, each with a chamfered rebate as part of the arch. Set above each <b>squint</b> on the chancel side is a gable as moulding with, at its spring and point, a carved foliated detail. Within the chancel is a 14th-century piscina containing a quatrefoil shaped drain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{linear range}} walk yields a {{significant}} range– azimuth coupling effect {{in a highly}} <b>squinted</b> synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Although the linear range walk correction (LRWC) technique can effectively mitigate such coupling effect, it causes azimuth variation in the resulting signal and, as such, the so-called “azimuth-shift invariance ” property becomes invalid. In order to eliminate the azimuth variation, a new spectrum processing ap-proach based on azimuth resampling is proposed in this paper. Af-ter performing the LRWC, the azimuth resampling is {{carried out in the}} 2 -D frequency domain and transforms the signal spectrum to be equivalent to that of a broadside SAR. For <b>squinted</b> beam-steering SAR (BS-SAR), e. g., spotlight SAR, sliding spotlight SAR, and Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans SAR, the azimuth resampling is combined with the azimuth signal reconstruction al-gorithm. As a result, both the azimuth variation, which is induced by the LRWC, and the aliasing, which is caused by antenna beam steering, can be avoided. Therefore, after the azimuth resampling, the <b>squinted</b> SAR data can be focused by exploiting a conventional broadside SAR imaging algorithm. An analysis of the motion error for airborne SAR data processing is also provided. Simulation and real data results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

25|$|Cavernous sinus {{thrombosis}} is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, {{where there}} is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura, due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face. The facial veins in this area anastomose with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins of the orbit, which drain directly posteriorly into the cavernous sinus through the superior orbital fissure. Staphyloccoal or Streptococcal infections of the face, for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the cavernous sinus, causing stroke-like symptoms of double vision, <b>squint,</b> as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis.|$|E
