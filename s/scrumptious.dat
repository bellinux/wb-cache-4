[...] "Cubby" [...] Broccoli, who had made five James Bond films previously.

500|$|Rock critic Robert Christgau, {{writing for}} Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in 2007, called Younger Than Yesterday [...] "the Byrds' first mature album, {{a blend of}} space-flight twang and electric hoedown infused with the imminent glow of 1967 yet underlined with crackling realism." [...] Critic John Nork gave the album a glowing review on the Analogue Planet website, calling it [...] "a <b>scrumptious</b> smorgasbord of eclectic musical styles and groundbreaking innovation", before concluding that [...] "in every sense, Younger Than Yesterday is an utterly brilliant album, arguably the Byrds' best." [...] Alan Bisbort, writing in the book Rhino's Psychedelic Trip, described Younger Than Yesterday as [...] "an essential snapshot of an incense-scented, acid-drenched world in motion: a kaleidoscope whose every turn yielded some fantastic window on the age." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan J. Kroll of {{the website}} SoapCentral {{wrote that the}} process to find a {{replacement}} for Tom was an [...] "exhaustive search". Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the [...] "Top 5 Actresses" [...] poll of CBS Soaps In Depth for over eight consecutive weeks. [...] Her relationship with Billy has garnered a significant fan following, allowing them to lead CBS Soaps In Depths [...] "Top 10 Couples" [...] poll for over six consecutive weeks. Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and Billy, said she thought their [...] "retro wedding" [...] was [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "extremely well written and not overdone". Zap2it placed Victoria and Billy at number four of their [...] "10 Best Soap Couples of 2011". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are [...] "so <b>scrumptious</b> together", and that [...] "it's so nice to have some reason to say something kind about The Young and the Restless for a change". Giddens {{also said that he}} [...] "adores this pairing that he was so prepared to hate". Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: [...] "Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from [...] "until death to us part," [...] to [...] "until one of us changes our mind." [...] However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.|$|E

Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters--six of us at a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn't caught her by her sash just {{in the nick of}} time she'd fallen in and prob'ly been drowned. I wish it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Marilla, I assure you it was sublime." ...|$|E

60|$|Aunt Tommy is {{all white}} and dimpled. She has curly {{red hair and}} big jolly brown eyes and <b>scrumptious</b> {{freckles}}. I do like freckles in a girl, although Jill goes wild if she thinks she has one on her nose. When we talked of writing this story Jill said I wasn't to say that Aunt Tommy had freckles because it wouldn't sound romantic. But I don't care. She has freckles and I think they are all right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, all right, boys," [...] she said, her {{trembling}} voice curiously {{at variance}} with her words; [...] "I'll get along somehow, but I tell you I'll have something <b>scrumptious</b> to pay for this--see if I don't."

6000|$|... "DEAREST GUARDY,--I'm sorry {{this is such}} a mangy little valentine; I couldn't go out to get {{it because}} I've got a beastly cold, so I asked Jock, and the pig bought this. The satin is simply <b>scrumptious.</b> If you don't come and see me in it some time soon, I shall come and show it to you. I wish I had a moustache, because my top lip feels just like a matchbox, but it's rather ripping having breakfast in bed. Mr. Pillin's taking us to the theatre the day after to-morrow evening. Isn't it nummy! I'm going to have rum and honey for my cold.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've been crying," [...] remarked Josie, with {{aggravating}} pity. [...] "I suppose you're homesick--some {{people have}} so little self-control in that respect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so long. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem ALL red. I'd a perfectly <b>scrumptious</b> time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable around, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla'd load you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd {{have gone to the}} park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards same place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd been before that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I was," [...] said Anne comfortably. [...] "It wasn't so hard as {{you might}} imagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There {{are a lot of}} nice girls in school and we had <b>scrumptious</b> fun playing at dinnertime. It's so nice {{to have a lot of}} little girls to play with. But of course I like Diana best and always will. I ADORE Diana. I'm dreadfully far behind the others. They're all in the fifth book and I'm only in the fourth. I feel that it's kind of a disgrace. But there's not one of them has such an {{imagination}} as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with 'May I see you home?' on it. I'm to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know you'll tell me the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had just}} a stupid, silly, commonplace quarrel. So commonplace that, if you'll believe me, I don't even {{remember}} {{just how it}} began. I hardly know who was the more to blame for it. Stephen did really begin it, but I suppose I provoked him by some foolishness of mine. He had a rival or two, you see. I was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little. He was a very high-strung, sensitive fellow. Well, we parted in a temper on both sides. But I thought it would all come right; {{and it would have}} if Stephen hadn't come back too soon. Anne, my dear, I'm sorry to say" [...] . Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a predilection for murdering people, [...] "that I am a dreadfully sulky person. Oh, you needn't smile, [...] . it's only too true. I DO sulk; and Stephen came back before I had finished sulking. I wouldn't listen to him and I wouldn't forgive him; and so he went away for good. He was too proud to come again. And then I sulked because he didn't come. I might have sent for him perhaps, but I couldn't humble myself to do that. I was just as proud as he was [...] . pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination, Anne. But I could never care for anybody else and I didn't want to. I knew I would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry anybody who wasn't Stephen Irving. Well, it all seems like a dream now, of course. How sympathetic you look, Anne [...] . as sympathetic as only seventeen can look. But don't overdo it. I'm really a very happy, contented little person in spite of my broken heart. My heart did break, if ever a heart did, when I realized that Stephen Irving was not coming back. But, Anne, a broken heart in real life isn't half as dreadful as it is in books. It's a good deal like a bad tooth [...] . though you won't think THAT a very romantic simile. It takes spells of aching and gives you a sleepless night now and then, but between times it lets you enjoy life and dreams and echoes and peanut candy as if there were nothing the matter with it. And now you're looking disappointed. You don't think I'm half as interesting a person as you did five minutes ago when you believed I was always the prey of a tragic memory bravely hidden beneath external smiles. That's the worst [...] . or the best [...] . of real life, Anne. It WON'T let you be miserable. It keeps on trying to make you comfortable [...] . and succeeding...even when you're determined to be unhappy and romantic. Isn't this candy <b>scrumptious?</b> I've eaten far more than is good for me already but I'm going to keep recklessly on." ...|$|E
