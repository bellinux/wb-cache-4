5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to <b>silvicultural</b> practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the <b>silvicultural</b> {{system now}} called {{coppicing}} was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different <b>silvicultural</b> system is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 <b>silvicultural</b> systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy of}} {{the peoples of the}} Oriente was {{essentially}} <b>silvicultural,</b> although horticulture was practiced. They extracted dyes from the achiote plant for face paint, and curare poisons for blowgun darts from various other plants. Complex religious systems developed, many of which incorporated (or perhaps originated from) the use of hallucinogenic plants such as Datura and Banisteriopsis. They also made coil ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Age, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, {{geographical}} location, {{site and}} growing conditions, <b>silvicultural</b> treatment, and seed source all {{to some degree}} influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986). Variation of specific gravity within the bole of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.|$|E
25|$|The hickories as a {{group are}} classed as {{intermediate}} in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant hardwoods (including the hickories) are climax, and the trend of succession toward this climax is very strong. Although most <b>silvicultural</b> systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26).|$|E
25|$|The {{aim of the}} WFC is to {{contribute}} to orient/shape international action in <b>silvicultural</b> aspects and stimulate global competency and reflection that can inform {{the development of the}} global forestry sector. The WFC may also be providing guidance to national and international forestry organizations as to the most appropriate and effective means to coordinate international actions concerning technical and policy. Finally, the Congress can contribute to identify action lines, define guidelines to stimulate the development of national policies, propose incentives to orient the public and private sector, promote international cooperation in forestry matters, whilst contributing to social progress and the conservation of natural resources at global, regional and national levels.|$|E
25|$|Comprehensive <b>silvicultural</b> {{programmes}} {{had made}} it possible for the Finns simultaneously to increase forest output and to add to the amount and value of the growing stock. By the mid-1980s, Finland's forests produced nearly 70 million cubic meters of new wood each year, considerably more than was being cut. During the postwar period, the annual cut increased by about 120 percent to about 50 million cubic meters. Wood burning fell to one-fifth the level of the immediate postwar years, freeing up wood supplies for the wood-processing industries, which consumed between 40 million and 45 million cubic meters per year. Indeed, industry demand was so great that Finland needed to import 5 million to 6 million cubic meters of wood each year.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry {{has carried}} out forest {{inventories}} and drawn up <b>silvicultural</b> plans. According to surveys, between 1945 {{and the late}} 1970s foresters had cut trees faster than the forests could regenerate them. Nevertheless, between the early 1950s and 1981, Finland was able to boost the total area of its forests by some 2.7 million hectares and to increase forest stands under 40 years of age by some 3.2 million hectares. Beginning in 1965, the country instituted plans that called for expanding forest cultivation, draining peatland and waterlogged areas, and replacing slow-growing trees with faster-growing varieties. By the mid-1980s, the Finns had drained 5.5 million hectares, fertilized 2.8 million hectares, and cultivated 3.6 million hectares. Thinning increased the share of trees that would produce suitable lumber, while improved tree varieties increased productivity {{by as much as}} 30 percent.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{they are}} a fragile eco-system, even small climate changes can have a {{profound}} effect.

In particular some view the fires of 2004 as an event possibly driven in part by global warming. The agency states that [...] "global climate change and drought are helping to poise the Pinaleños for epidemic insect or disease outbreaks and catastrophic, stand-replacing fires. Indeed, both of these events have taken place in recent years. The flora and fauna have not evolved to tolerate these new conditions or catastrophic events, so {{there is a need to}} use <b>silvicultural</b> management and prescribed burning to begin to restore the natural balance in the remaining forests and woodlands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mario Javier Fernandez-Vega is a Puerto Rican {{forester}} {{who uses}} <b>silvicultural</b> techniques.

About his model Fernandez {{has been known to}} comment, [...] "Soy de aquí como el coquí" [...] I am from here just like the coqui, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. It should be noted, although incorrect, many believe that the Coqui and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coquis that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. Sadly, the Coqui a source of pride to its people, is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of co kee co kee is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.|$|E

5000|$|Continuous cover {{forestry}} (commonly {{referred to}} as [...] "CCF") is an approach to the sustainable management of forests whereby forest stands are maintained in a permanently irregular structure, which is created and sustained through the selection and harvesting of individual trees.
