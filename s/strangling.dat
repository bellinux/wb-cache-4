50|$|In finance, a <b>strangle</b> is an {{investment}} strategy involving the purchase or sale of particular option derivatives that allows the holder to profit based on how much {{the price of the}} underlying security moves, with relatively minimal exposure to the direction of price movement. A purchase of particular options is known as a long <b>strangle,</b> while a sale of the same options is known as a short <b>strangle.</b> As an options position <b>strangle</b> is a variation of a more generic straddle position. <b>Strangle's</b> key difference from a straddle is in giving investor choice of balancing cost of opening a <b>strangle</b> versus a probability of profit. For example, given the same underlying security, <b>strangle</b> positions can be constructed with low cost and low probability of profit. Low cost is relative and comparable to a cost of straddle on the same underlying.Strangles can be used with equity options, index options or options on futures.|$|R

The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of <b>strangles</b> among horses residing on horse farms in main regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To achieve this goal, field visits were made to horse farms in Al-Ahsa, Dammam, Jubail, Riyadh, Jeddah and Tayf. A total of 75 farms that contain 926 horses were visited. Farm owners and managers were questioned regarding the presence of signs similar to <b>strangles.</b> In the meantime, horses were clinically evaluated. This survey indicated no horses were <b>strangles</b> confirmed. Finally, 35 horses admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at King Faisal University were examined. These horses were admitted for signs of respiratory disorders. Physical and endoscopic examination as well as bacterial culture indicated they were <b>strangles</b> free. <b>Strangles</b> seems not to be a threat to horses in Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalisation of McKean's free {{boundary value problem}} for American options by considering an American <b>strangle</b> position, where the early exercise of {{one side of the}} payoff will knock-out the out-of-the-money side. When attempting to evaluate the price of this American <b>strangle,</b> it is not correct to simply price the component American call and put options which make up the <b>strangle,</b> and take the sum of their values. The Fourier transform technique is used to derive the integral equation for the price of our American <b>strangle.</b> From this expression, a coupled integral equation system for the <b>strangle's</b> call- and put-side free boundaries is found. While the equation for the price of the <b>strangle</b> is simply the sum of its component American call and put option equations, the free boundary for each side is shown to have a more complex nature. A numerical algorithm for solving the coupled integral equation system for the free boundaries is provided, and the resulting approximations are used to determine the price of the American <b>strangle</b> position. Numerical comparisons between the <b>strangle</b> price and the price of a portfolio formed from a long position in both an American call an American put option are presented.

We highlight {{and compare the}} properties of European, American, and hybrid <b>strangles</b> with pricing and hedging in mind. The new quadrature approach we propose can account for systems of coupled integral equations that locate the early exercise boundaries of finite-lived contracts. We show that this method is efficient, accurate, and fast for pricing all types of early exercisable <b>strangles.</b> Other advantages of this technique are that it avoids the non-monotonic gradient problem faced by others and it allows users to control for errors. We then investigate the hedging of all <b>strangles,</b> we derive analytical expressions for some Greek parameters, and we stress how these parameters can differ (or not) from each other...|$|R

5|$|By {{taking this}} new role, Rainilaiarivony {{became the first}} Hova to {{concurrently}} serve as both Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The sociopolitical transformation that had been triggered by the <b>strangling</b> of RadamaII reached its zenith with Rainilaiarivony's consolidation of administrative power. Rasoherina and her successors remained the figureheads of traditional authority, participated in political councils and provided official approval for policies. The Prime Minister issued new policies and laws in the Queen's name. However, the day-to-day governance, security and diplomatic activities of the kingdom principally originated with, and were managed by, Rainilaiarivony and his counselors. This new level of authority enabled the Prime Minister to amass a vast personal fortune, whether through inheritance, gifts or purchase, including 57 houses, large plantations and rice paddies, numerous cattle and thousands of slaves. The most prominent of Rainilaiarivony's properties was the Andafiavaratra Palace, constructed {{for him on the}} slope just below the royal Rova compound by English architect William Pool in 1873.|$|E

5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fighting had led to a severe shortage of ammunition among the defenders, and attempts to resupply the Australians were plagued by heavy shelling. The use of salvaged ammunition stabilised the situation momentarily after one of B Company's two Vickers medium machine-guns was destroyed by Chinese shelling, and its ammunition belts were subsequently broken up and dispersed among the riflemen. However, this soon resulted in {{a large number of}} mechanical failures and weapon stoppages, causing additional problems for the defenders. The evacuation of casualties was again an issue, and the Assault Pioneer Platoon—commanded by Lieutenant Jock McCormick—was used as stretcher bearers and to run ammunition forward, as were a number of the other specialist platoons. Their ammunition nearly exhausted, the Australians resorted to kicking and <b>strangling</b> many of the attacking Chinese during the brutal fighting. Fearing the Australians would be overwhelmed by the persistent Chinese attacks, Taylor ordered the Borderers and Shropshires to detach their Korean porters to resupply the Australians, while a full divisional concentration of artillery was fired in support of 3 RAR.|$|E

After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a murder-suicide, to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case.

5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's <b>strangling</b> represented {{more than a simple}} coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E

Allied air superiority was so overwhelming, that Luftwaffe personnel climbed into fighter fuselages, or squeezed into the cockpits of Bf 109s alongside the pilot rather than risk flying in transport aircraft. Most ground crew and pilots attempted to escape this way. Flying large numbers of personnel in one go and by transport was too dangerous; 16 personnel {{were killed in a}} crash on 29 or 30 April.
