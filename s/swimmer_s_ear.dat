40|$|This review {{describes}} {{mean and}} turbulent flow and mass transport {{in the presence}} of aquatic vegetation. Within emergent canopies, the turbulent length scales are set by the stem diameter and spacing, and the mean flow is determined by the distribution of the canopy frontal area. Near sparse submerged canopies, the bed roughness and near-bed turbulence are enhanced, but the velocity profile remains logarithmic. For dense submerged canopies, the drag discontinuity {{at the top of the}} canopy generates a shear layer, which contains canopy-scale vortices that control the exchange of mass and momentum between the canopy and the overflow. The canopy-scale vortices penetrate a finite distance into the canopy, δe, set by the canopy drag. This length scale segregates the canopy into two regions: The upper canopy experiences energetic turbulent transport, controlled by canopy-scale vortices, whereas the lower canopy experiences diminished transport, associated with the smaller stem-scale turbulence. The canopy-scale vortices induce a waving motion in flexible blades, called a monami.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{some recent}} trends in vegetation hydrodynamics, focusing on conditions within channels and spanning spatial scales from individual blades, to canopies or vegetation patches, to the channel reach. At the blade scale, the boundary layer formed {{on the plant}} surface {{plays a role in}} controlling nutrient uptake. Flow resistance and light availability are also influenced by the reconfiguration of flexible blades. At the canopy scale, there are two flow regimes. For sparse canopies, the flow resembles a rough boundary layer. For dense canopies, the flow resembles a mixing layer. At the reach scale, flow resistance is more closely connected to the patch-scale vegetation distribution, described by the blockage factor, than to the geometry of individual plants. The impact of vegetation distribution on sediment movement is discussed, with attention being paid to methods for estimating bed stress within regions of vegetation. The key research challenges of the hydrodynamics of vegetated channels are highlighted.

40|$|Seismic wave {{propagation}} through two-dimensional core-mantle boundary (CMB) ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) is modeled using a global pseudospectral algorithm. Seismograms are synthesized for {{several types of}} ULVZ models to investigate {{the effect of these}} structures on SKS and SPdKS phases. One-dimensional models and two-dimensional models with different, quasi- 1 -D velocity structures on the source and receiver sides of the CMB provide a baseline for comparison with other 2 -D models. Models with finite length ULVZs are used to test the sensitivity of the SPdKS travel time and waveform to different portions of the P diffracted wave path. This test shows that SPdKS waves are only sensitive to ULVZs with lengths > 100 km. Our results give three tools for identifying and characterizing 2 -D ULVZ structures. First, dual SPdKS pulses indicate exposure to at least two separate CMB velocity structures, either different source and receiver-side CMB velocities or different adjacent velocity regions for which Pdiff inception occurs outside of and propagates into a ULVZ. Second, high-amplitude SKS precursors indicate a very “strong” (i. e., thick and/or large velocity perturbations) ULVZ. Hence, the absence of SKS precursors in most previous ULVZ studies indicates that very strong, sharp ULVZs are not common. Third, mean SPdKS delays relative to PREM constrain the minimum ULVZ strength and length combinations required to produce a given travel time delay.

40|$|The genetic {{relationship}} between a Vertisol and an associated Mollisol with an argillic horizon was studied. These soils are taxadjuncts of the Hawkins and Ostler series, respectively. They occur in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah and have similar parent materials, altitudes, and slope percentages. Ostler soils have a dense cover of Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and occur preferentially on north aspects. Mule 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ear</b> (Wyethia amplexicaulis) is the dominant vegetation on Hawkins soils, which are most frequent on south aspects. Erosion is prevalent on Hawkins soils because the mule 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ear</b> does not adequately cover the soil surface during the fall, winter, and early spring. The dense oak woods and the litter cover on the Ostler soil protect it from erosion. Both soils dried sufficiently for cracks to develop in their clayey portions. The Ostler soil was drier, probably because it has more and longer transpiring vegetation than the Hawkins soil. The Ostler subsoil and the Hawkins solum both had cracks, slickensides, high clay contents, high COLE values, and smectite as the dominant clay mineral. These characteristics of high shrink-swell activity were most strongly expressed in the Hawkins soil. The Ostler subsoil clay was overlain abruptly by loam surface soil. The textural difference was attributed to lessivage, eolian contributions mixed with preexisting surface soil by soil animals, and in situ clay formation in the subsoil. Eolian additions were inferred from the presence of easily weathered silt and clay-size minerals in the Ostler A horizons and within the zone of mixing in the Hawkins soil. These minerals were not present or were less abundant in the Ostler subsoil and in the Hawkins C horizon. The formation of Hawkins soils (Vertisols) probably resulted from erosional exposure of the clay subsoil of Ostler soils or their precursors...|$|R
40|$|A lock {{exchange}} {{experiment is}} used to investigate the propagation of gravity currents through a random array of rigid, emergent cylinders which represents a canopy of aquatic plants. As canopy drag increases, the propagating front varies from the classic profile of an unobstructed gravity current to a triangular profile. Unlike the unobstructed lock exchange, the gravity current in the canopy decelerates with time as the front lengthens. Two drag-dominated regimes associated with linear and nonlinear drag laws are identified. The theoretical expression for toe velocity is supported by observed values.

Neither group followed an established diet or presented statistically significant differences in terms of nutritional supplement drink and chocolate intake. There were statistically significant differences in terms of oral hygiene. No significant difference in clinical indexes (DMFT, PlI, and GI) was present. S. mutans was harbored by 18. 6 % of competitive and the 32. 2 % of non-competitive <b>swimmers.</b> <b>S.</b> sobrinus was detected in 22. 03 % of competitive and 91. 6 % of non-competitive swimmers (p< 0. 05). S. sanguinis was found only in the saliva of competitive swimmers. The average S-IgA of competitive swimmers decreased significantly at T 2 (p< 0. 05). The pool water had a daily average pH of 7. 22. Conclusions Microbial markers, immune status and sporting characteristics are important for establishing guidelines for management of training load {{in order to minimize}} physical stress and the risk of oral infection...|$|R
40|$|Differences {{in water}} density can drive an {{exchange}} flow between the vegetated and open regions of surface water systems. A laboratory experiment {{has been conducted}} to investigate this exchange flow, using a random array of rigid, emergent cylinders to represent the canopy region. The flow pattern was captured using a CCD camera. The velocity of the current entering the canopy and the volume discharge both decrease with increasing vegetative drag and also decrease gradually over time. Theoretical predictions for velocity and discharge rate are developed and verified with experimental observations. Extensions to field conditions are also discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the meanders of {{composition}} and their intertextuality in the samba controversy between Noel Rosa and Wilson Batista. We observe dialogism in the verbal and musical interaction between the samba writers and several texts of the 1930 <b>s.</b> When <b>ears</b> are in tune with the "samba controversy," one observes that the compositions reveal inexorable tensions between the festive world of the "malandro" and the limits of the reality of the time. Accordingly, based on studies that address this theme, we aim to present an insight into this musical "duel," which is not restricted to purely aesthetics issues, but certainly disseminated in society...|$|R
