If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their <b>spin</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

Properties, Uses, Applications: Hydrogen Gas and Liquid Hydrogen|publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.|accessdate=5 February 2008}} In the orthohydrogen form, the spins {{of the two}} protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular <b>spin</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> of 1 (+); in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular <b>spin</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> of 0 (–). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, {{also known as the}} [...] "normal form". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.|$|E
