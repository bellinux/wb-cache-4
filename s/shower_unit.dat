40|$|In New Zealand, {{residential}} {{problems related}} to old age are of concern due to the increasing population of older people and the challenges that aging brings. These challenges include generational social expectations and intergenerational living, accompanied by cultural traditions of family, living and the home environment. It is becoming common for younger generations to live away from their elderly family members in the western world, which can cause psychological, financial and safety issues for the older generation. In New Zealand's aging population, which includes Maori, Samoan and Asian people, these aging issues are approached in culturally specific ways. This design-led research report explores 'filial piety', an ancient Chinese philosophy, {{in the context of}} an industrial design practice that embraces established principles and design processes related to product design, ergonomics, emotional design and universal design. The design emerged out of an observation that the New Zealand domestic environments do not typically allow for or attend to modes of intergenerational living, a societal attribute common in China where the philosphy of 'filial piety' leads families and their homes to be more generous and responsive to the physical and spiritual needs of all, in particular, the needs of the elderly.

40|$|Scale {{formation}} in domestic appliances {{is a widespread}} problem in the UK. This project has focussed on calcium carbonate scale {{formation in}} electric showers. A literature survey identified that CaCO; deposition on heated surfaces could be controlled by chemical or non chemical methods, each with various degrees of effectiveness. One {{of the most effective}} control methods was the addition of chemicals, although {{this may not be the}} most suitable option for the domestic environment. So here the chemical inhibitors tested were used for a benchmark for all the other studies. Two laboratory tests were involved t allow u to study CaCO; precipitation and scale formation. The effect of chemical additives on CaCO; precipitation was investigated using a jar tester. The longest delay to precipitation was obtained by polyacrylic acid dosing, closely followed by zinc. To study CaCO; formation on a heated surface, a rapid scaling test was developed. This test was conducted at 42 °C and 70 °C to examine and compare a range of treatment options, including chemical dosing, electrolytic, magnetic and electronic water conditioning and low fouling surfaces. From the options examined, the most successful was electrolytic dosing of zinc/copper media with over 95 % reduction in scaling at both temperatures. Further, the use of low fouling surfaces, such as Diamond - like carbon coating could also potentially be used in electric showers. Reduction in scaling achieved on this surface was on average 68 %. Surface properties of the materials were analysed using an atomic force microscope and their relationship with the scaling behaviour of the surfaces examined. The scaling rates at both temperatures typically increased with increasing adhesion force but no clear relationship was found between the roughness of the surfaces and their scaling behaviour. The relationship between CaCO 3 precipitation and scale formation in synthetic solution and natural hard water was also explored here. The induction period in natural hard water was 55 minutes longer and the scaling rate 40 % lower than i synthetic hard solution of similar composition. In addition, two shower test rigs, one based at Cranfield University and the other in Attleborough were used in this study. These were used primarily to enable the compilation of background data on scale formation in electric showers, where it was found that the design of the unit has a significant influence on the scale formation. The test rig was also used t test the strategies identified during the laboratory phase of the work. It was found that electrolytic zinc dosing reduced scaling by up to 54 %, depending on the <b>shower</b> <b>unit</b> design...|$|E

Since being in Africa I have visited such large cities as Oran. Constantine and Tunis and several smaller towns and points of interest too numerous to mention, I had the opportunity to visit the ruins of Carthage a short time ago. Of Course {{there are a lot more}} recent ruins now. During this time I have spent in Africa we have always lived and operated the hospital entirely in tents. The enlisted men have lived in their small pup tents. The boys have made many variations of homes by combining more tents and by building them up higher by use of sides of boards, tin or anything available. On the whole the boys have them fixed up quite cozy. Of course we have the old fashioned open type of plumbing, with a few modern variations. We wash up and shave in our helmets and even wash out a few clothes in them in a pinch, but most of the time for laundry purposes we can either get a pail or empty five gallon cans that previously had dehydrated potatoes in it. We have had showers varying from a steel drum up on a bank with a pipe and improvised shower head on it to the present outfit we have which is a GI portable <b>shower</b> <b>unit</b> which pumps the water from a tank into a overhead arrangement of four shower heads. In cool weather which is very rare now they can also heat the water with this outfit.

A well-established provision for mass-casualty decontamination that incorporates the use of mobile <b>showering</b> <b>units</b> has been developed in the UK. The effectiveness of such decontamination procedures will be critical in minimizing or preventing the contamination of emergency responders and hospital infrastructure. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate three empirical strategies designed to optimize existing decontamination procedures: (1) instructions in the form of a pictorial aid prior to decontamination; (2) provision of a washcloth within the showering facility; and (3) an extended showering period. The study was a three-factor, between-participants (or "independent") design with 90 volunteers. The three factors each had two levels: use of washcloths (washcloth/no washcloth), washing instructions (instructions/no instructions), and shower cycle duration (three minutes/six minutes). The effectiveness of these strategies was quantified by whole-body fluorescence imaging following application of a red fluorophore to multiple, discrete areas of the skin. All five showering procedures were relatively effective in removing the fluorophore "contaminant", but the use of a cloth (in the absence of instructions) led to a significant (appox. 20 %) improvement in the effectiveness of decontamination over the standard protocol (p < 0. 05). Current mass-casualty decontamination effectiveness, especially in children, can be optimized by the provision of a washcloth. This simple but effective approach indicates the value of performing controlled volunteer trials for optimizing existing decontamination procedures...|$|R

Incentivized by its carbon-cost effectiveness, waste water heat exchangers (WWHX) have been selected and incorporated in a newly constructed Sports Pavilion at the University of Brighton in the UK. This £ 2 m sports development serving several football fields was completed in August 2015 providing eight water and energy efficient shower rooms for students, staff and external organizations. Six of the shower rooms are located on the ground floor and two on the first floor, each fitted with 5 or 6 thermostatically controlled <b>shower</b> <b>units.</b> Inline type of WWHX were installed, each consisted of a copper pipe section wound by an external coil of smaller copper pipe through which the cold water would be warmed before entering the shower mixers. Using the installation at Sport Pavilion as the case study, this research aims to evaluate the environmental and financial sustainability of a vertical waste heat recovery device, over a life cycle of 50 years, with comparison to the normal use of a PVC-u pipe. A heat transfer mathematical model representing the system has been developed to inform the development of the methodology for measuring the in-situ thermal performance of individual and multiple use of showers in each changing room. Adopting a system thinking modelling technique, a quasi-dynamic simulation computer model was established enabling the prediction of annual energy consumptions under different shower usage profiles. Data based on the process map and inventory of a functional unit of WWHX were applied to a proprietary assessment software to establish the relevant outputs for the life cycle environmental impact assessment. Life cycle cost models were developed and industry price book data were applied. The results indicated that the seasonal thermal effectiveness was over 50 % enabling significant energy savings through heat recovery that led to short carbon payback time of less than two years to compensate for the additional greenhouse gas emissions associated with the WWHX. However, the life cycle cost of the WWHX is much higher than using the PVC pipe, even with significant heat recovered under heavy usage, highlighting the need to adopt more economic configurations, such as combining waste water through fewer units, in order to maximize the return on investment and improve the financial viability...|$|R

My laundry, done by yours truly, has not been too bad since I don’t wait for clothes to accumulate, but wash often. Some of the men have had the French natives do their clothing but I don’t like the way they dip the clothes in a stagnant pool and beat the clothes with paddles. This process seems to get the clothes clean somehow. The food continues to be good [...] so far so good.

The Queensland State Government has built, in Rockhampton, a Research House {{as part of their}} 'Towards Healthy and Sustainable Housing Research Project'. Research House was built using water-efficient infrastructure and has two rainwater tanks (total capacity 7 kL). The Central Queensland University (CQU) was asked to design a greywater treatment and reuse system for the House. The proposed design incorporates a backflow prevention device on the water mains entry to the house. The harvested storm water from the rainwater tanks will provide water for the hot-water system and laundry. This will reduce the amount of potable mains water required by the house and potentially provide softer water that should reduce the scaling in the hot-water system and require lower doses of detergents. The greywater from the laundry, <b>shower,</b> and vanity <b>unit</b> will be collected and primary treated in a deep vertical greasetrap.

Such conditions are inconsistent with the human dignity of prisoners and are frequently counterproductive. It {{is for this reason that}} the American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s (ABA) Criminal Justice Standards on the Treatment of Prisoners propose several important reforms in this area of criminal justice policy. From 2007 to 2009, I had the privilege of serving as the Reporter for the Task Force that produced these Standards, which the ABA has now adopted and which are reprinted in this issue of the American Criminal Law Review. Like all of the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s Criminal Justice Standards, these are offered by the ABA as a source of insight and authority for judges, legislators, and government officials who are aiming to rationalize and improve the criminal justice system. 2 In this Article, I discuss both how and why the ABA Standards deal with the crucial issue of the use of segregation. To summarize, in order to comply with the Standards, jails and prisons must: * Provide sufficient process prior to placing or retaining a prisoner in segregation to be sure that segregation is warranted. (ABA Treatment of Prisoners Standard 23 - 2. 9 [hereinafter cited by number only] 3) * Limit the permissible reasons for segregation. Disciplinary segregation should generally be brief and should rarely exceed one year. Longer-term segregation should be imposed only if the prisoner poses a continuing and serious threat. Segregation for protective reasons should take place in the least restrictive setting possible. (23 - 2. 6, 23 - 5. 5) * Decrease isolation within segregated settings. Even prisoners who cannot mix with other prisoners should be allowed in-cell programming, supervised (and physically isolated) out-of-cell exercise time, face-to-face interaction with staff, access to television or radio, phone calls, correspondence, and reading material. (23 - 3. 7, 23 - 3. 8) * Decrease sensory deprivation within segregated settings. Jails and. prisons must limit the use of auditory isolation, deprivation of light and reasonable darkness, punitive diets, etc. (23 - 3. 7, 23 - 3. 8) * Allow prisoners to gradually gain more privileges and be subjected to fewer restrictions, even if they continue to require physical separation. (23 - 2. 9) * Refrain from placing prisoners with serious mental illness in what is an anti-therapeutic environment. Jails and prisons must instead maintain appropriate secure mental-health housing for such prisoners. (23 - 2. 8, 23 - 6. 11) * Carefully monitor prisoners in segregation for mental-health deterioration and deal with deterioration appropriately if it occurs. (23 - 6. 11) The ABA is far from the first organization to offer proposals to reform solitary confinement. 4 The Standards 2 ̆ 7 unique contribution, however, is to address all the aspects of long-term segregation by presenting solutions that embody a consensus view of representatives of all segments of the criminal justice system who worked on them together in the exhaustive and collaborative ABA Standards process. 5 Part I of this Article provides information on the Standards more generally. Part II discusses the history of segregated housing and general observations about its effects. Part III discusses the approach taken by the ABA Standards with respect to permitted rationales for the use of segregated housing. Part IV describes the Standards 2 ̆ 7 procedural requirements for placing prisoners in long-term segregation. Finally, Part V focuses on those Standards that are intended to mitigate the effects of isolating conditions. This Article is part of a paper Symposium on the Standards; it is joined by an essay by ACLU National Prison Project Director David Fathi focusing on prisoners 2 ̆ 7 access to courts and other oversight bodies, and another on immigration detention by New York City Department of Corrections Commissioner Dora Schriro...|$|R
