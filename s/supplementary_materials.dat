5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend {{received}} generally positive reception; reviewers {{praised the}} game's replay value {{as well as}} its writing and characterization, while repetitive gameplay and the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love mode received a more mixed response. A sequel, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star, was released on 29 December 2011, with an English version being released on Christmas Day the following year. In addition to the main games in the series, Hatoful Boyfriend has made transitions into other media: a monthly webcomic was serialized in the anthology Manga Life WIN+, several <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> and official dōjin works have been released, and four drama CDs based on the series have been made. An episodic web series began in 2014.|$|E

They shaped Creation [...] a flat world of finite extent [...] from the primordial chaos, and placed the gods (numberless immortal spirits resembling the Kami of Shinto) to watch over it.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a report}} that more colleges are resorting to {{computerized}} fact-checking software, as well as anti-plagiarism tools such as Turnitin, which checks documents for unoriginal content on the web, possibly {{as a response to}} well-publicized scandals in which a student won admission to Harvard University by fraudulent means. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> generally carry [...] "no weight" [...] in college admissions, according to one view. A report in Time Magazine suggested that many elite colleges used a vaguer measure of institutional fit to decide who is admitted, which is based on nonacademic qualities and may favor [...] "underrepresented minorities and students who demonstrate exceptional talent." [...] Students who take a [...] "gap year" [...] between high school and college can benefit if the year was enriching and developing and helped the student mature.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 2008 interview, Yukimura {{revealed}} that he was inspired to enter the manga industry by reading the manga Fist of the North Star as a boy. In the same interview, {{he said he had}} always wanted to produce a series which reflected the same themes of [...] "strength and justice". He has occasionally used omake (bonus) chapters and other <b>supplementary</b> <b>materials</b> to comment on the production of Vinland Saga. In volume two, Yukimura's omake is about a research trip he took to Iceland in 2003 before beginning the series. The author's commentary sections in volumes one and three both discuss Yukimura's desire to learn about and portray the daily lives of Vikings in addition to their wars and the events of historical chronicles. Yukimura is aided in drawing Vinland Saga by four known assistants: Haito Kumagai, Kazuoki Suzuki, Tomoyuki Takami, and Daiju Watanabe.|$|E
