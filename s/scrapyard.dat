5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two <b>scrapyard</b> employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The <b>scrapyard</b> owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the <b>scrapyard</b> owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the <b>scrapyard</b> and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the <b>scrapyard</b> also died.|$|E
5|$|That same day, {{the four}} men present when the {{cylinder}} was opened (two of the scrap collectors and two <b>scrapyard</b> employees) began to feel ill, experiencing headaches, nausea and vomiting. The scrap collectors succeeded in taking the lead cylinder apart, and took the parts to sell at the <b>scrapyard</b> the next day. The <b>scrapyard</b> employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the <b>scrapyard</b> owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the scrap collector to take it elsewhere, and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{ten people}} were {{admitted}} to hospital with radiation sickness: the four scrap collectors, the two <b>scrapyard</b> employees, the <b>scrapyard</b> owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those {{working at the}} <b>scrapyard)</b> were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received inpatient care. All {{but one of the}} patients developed agranulocytosis or bicytopenia (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have his finger amputated. Three patients (the two <b>scrapyard</b> workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis, all within two months of exposure.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the <b>scrapyard</b> owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the <b>scrapyard,</b> and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the <b>scrapyard</b> entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|By August 1968 Woodham’s {{had bought}} 297 locomotives, of which 217 were still {{held at the}} <b>scrapyard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} an {{operational}} period of only eight years. This unique locomotive was saved from being scrapped at Woodham Brothers <b>scrapyard</b> in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales {{when it was}} purchased {{by a group of}} railway enthusiasts who restored it from <b>scrapyard</b> to as-built condition in 13 years. Since then, modifications have been made to the original design, resulting {{in one of the most}} efficient and powerful steam locomotives ever to run in Britain. As a result, the Duke of Gloucester can frequently be seen on the mainline around Britain.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a <b>scrapyard</b> on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the <b>scrapyard</b> to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the <b>scrapyard,</b> but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
5|$|The two {{fighter jets}} were {{acquired}} from a <b>scrapyard</b> in Arizona, and {{were sent to}} Ross's studio in Oakland, California for disassembly and reconfiguration.

5|$|After the Grand Fleet was {{dissolved}} in early 1919, Thunderer was transferred {{back to the}} Home Fleet {{for a few months}} before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The ship was converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and served in that role until she was sold for scrap in late 1926. While being towed to the <b>scrapyard,</b> Thunderer ran aground; the ship was refloated and subsequently broken up.|$|E

5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} <b>scrapyard.</b> There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the <b>scrapyard.</b> Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of {{the class}} have survived into {{preservation}} thanks to the high workload of Woodham Brothers <b>scrapyard</b> in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, which found it easier and more commercially lucrative to scrap railway wagons, keeping the more technical steam locomotives for a downturn in workload. Five of the surviving Merchant Navy's have run in preservation, these being: 35005, 35006, 35018, 35027 & 35028. Three of them have even run on the mainline at some points in preservation: 35005 Canadian Pacific, 35018 British India Line and 35028 Clan Line, Both 35018 and 35028 are currently mainline certified.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their <b>scrapyard</b> in Blyth {{and so was}} {{partially}} stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep to allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{the event}} {{as a serious}} {{radiological}} accident, the OAEP organized an emergency response team to manage the situation, {{in conjunction with the}} local public health and civil defense authorities. They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The <b>scrapyard</b> and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
