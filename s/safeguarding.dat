40|$|Executive Summary The <b>safeguards</b> {{system of}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is {{intended}} to provide the international community with credible assurance that a State is fulfilling its <b>safeguards</b> obligations.

40|$|The US {{has placed}} certain special nuclear {{materials}} declared excess to their strategic needs under international <b>safeguards</b> through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

To help identify and provide workable solutions to these concerns, the Office of <b>Safeguards</b> and Security has conducted a program to determine possible changes to the DOE <b>safeguards</b> and security requirements designed to help facilities under international <b>safeguards</b> inspections more easily comply with domestic <b>safeguards</b> goals during international inspection activities.

40|$|Nuclear <b>safeguards</b> are {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic {{features of}} a facility which reduce probability of the successful acquisition of special nuclear material (SNM) by hostile actors. Future bulk handling facilities in the United States will include both domestic and international <b>safeguards</b> {{as part of a}} voluntary agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. A new framework for <b>safeguards,</b> the <b>Safeguards</b> Envelope Methodology, is presented. A <b>safeguards</b> envelope is a set of operational and <b>safeguards</b> parameters that define a range, or ?envelope,? of operating conditions that increases confidence as to the location and assay of nuclear material without increasing costs from security or safety. Facilities operating within <b>safeguards</b> envelopes developed by this methodology will operate with a higher confidence, a lower false alarm rate, and reduced <b>safeguards</b> impact on the operator. Creating a <b>safeguards</b> envelope requires bringing together security, safety, and <b>safeguards</b> best practices. This methodology is applied to an example facility, the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. An example diversion scenario in the front-end of this nuclear reprocessing facility, using actual operating data, shows that the diversion could have been detected more easily by changing operational parameters, and these changed operational parameters would not sacrifice the operational efficiency of the facility, introduce security vulnerabilities, or create a safety hazard...|$|R
