5000|$|Development of the Thury thread {{began in}} 1876, when the Horological Section of Geneva Society of Arts {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} look into the requirements for a uniform thread standard for use in Horological arts in Switzerland. Professor Thury began his studies by collecting and measuring samples of screws made by nine independent screw and screw tackle manufacturers in Switzerland. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard Whitworth thread form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots. Thread forms with rounded or [...] "radiused" [...] crests and roots like the Thury and Whitworth thread generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger stress riser can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation. The Thury thread is unusual in having a comparatively small 47.5° thread flank angle, which was chosen to make fabrication easier and to achieve greater holding capacity than screws with larger flank angles. Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size [...] "0" [...] being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size [...] "1" [...] is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size [...] "0", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size [...] "0". The Thury thread was {{believed to be the first}} thread form to solve the problem of creating a single system of screw dimensions applicable to all sizes. The relationship between the pitch P of a Thury screw and its diameter D is expressed by the equation D=6P5/6. Another variable Thury standardized is the thread depth, which had until then been variable when cutting threads in different materials. The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard <b>screw</b> <b>gauge,</b> where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the Whitworth thread standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard. However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest mil.|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensions}} of technical products are often of major importance for t heir proper functioning. Dimensional tolerances define {{how much the}} true dimensions may deviate from the aimed dimensions. Dimensional quality c ontrol ensures that the dimensional properties of the product comply wit h the tolerances. For single and non-complex products instruments like v ernier calipers and micrometer <b>screw</b> <b>gauges</b> can be used, while for more complex inspection tasks and series measurements usually coordinate meas uring machines (CMMs) are used. Because measurement devices also show measurement errors, a measurement result will never be exact. This means {{there will always be}} a measurement uncertainty that should be take n into account while evaluating conformance of products to tolerances. I f measurement uncertainty is neglected, this can result in false rejecti on or false acceptance of products, with possibly far-reaching consequen ces. Reliable measurement uncertainties are indispensable for unambiguou s evaluation of tolerances. Measurement uncertainty determination for coordinate measuring machines is difficult because of the many unce rtainty contributors (CMM hardware errors, temperature, measurement stra tegy, [...] .) that are involved. Therefore conventional uncertainty calcula tion methods, based on analytical propagation of standard uncertainties, can not be applied. Measurement uncertainty determination based on Mont e Carlo simulations is a valuable alternative to conventional uncertaint y calculation methods. These methods can cope much better with the compl exity of CMM measurements. This thesis describes four contributio ns to the determination of measurement uncertainties for feature measure ments on CMMs by means of Monte Carlo methods: When considering measurement uncertainties for feature measurements on C MMs, the influence of feature form deviations is often neglected because feature form deviations are not known in advance and hence difficult to model or to account for. Form deviations of features, like e. g. circles, lines, planes and cylinders, can have an important influence on the me asurement uncertainty, particularly if only a limited set of points is s ampled. Neglecting the influence of form deviations results in less reli able or wrong uncertainty statements, that may lead biased acceptance or rejection of parts. This thesis describes a method to determine the inf luence of feature form deviations on the measurement uncertainty. The measurement accuracy of a CMM varies over the measurement volume. Th is is mainly related to the geometric errors of the CMM in combination w ith the Abbe-offsets to the scales. This thesis presents a method to mod el the geometric errors of a CMM. It is based on the kinematic model of the CMM and simulated motion errors of the different axes. In contrast t o other approaches the proposed method does not need an error mapping of the CMM. The only input needed for this method are the scale positions and a valid ISO 10360 - 2 specification of a CMM. This thesis also elaborates an uncertainty determination method to combi ne the influence of feature form deviations and CMM hardware errors on t he measurement uncertainty for feature measurements. This method relies on a two-step Monte Carlo method: a first step to determine the form dev iation uncertainty, a second step to determine the uncertainties of the other feature parameters. Measured features are often used to construct part coordinate systems (P CS) or other features (e. g. a constructed point as intersection of two m easured lines). This means there will also be uncertainties associated w ith part coordinate systems and constructed features. Similarly there wi ll also be uncertainties related to measured geometrical tolerance value s (perpendicularity, parallelism, coaxiality, [...] .). Uncertainty evaluati on software (UES) for CMMs should take into account these derived uncert ainties. This thesis describes the implementation of an uncertainty eval uation software that takes into account the influence of feature form de viations and CMM hardware errors on measurement uncertainties of feature s and derived parameters. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{in vitro}} {{investigation}} compared {{the effect of}} using either gold or titanium retaining screws on preload in the dental implant- abutment complex. Inadequate preload can result in screw loosening, whilst fracture may occur if preload is excessive. These are the most commonly reported complications in implant-retained prostheses, and result in unscheduled, costly and time-consuming visits for {{the patient and the}} clinician. This study investigated changes in preload generation after repeated torque applications to gold and titanium screws. The test set-up consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment, and the test samples of gold and of titanium retaining screws. The implant bodies were anchored using a load cell, and the transmucosal abutments were attached using either gold or titanium retaining <b>screws.</b> A torque <b>gauge</b> was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm, and 40 Ncm to the retaining screws. The preloads generated in each screw type were compared at each torque setting, and after repeated tightening episodes. In addition, the effect of applying torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations was also examined. Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining screws. Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of the gold screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Based on the findings of this study, gold retaining screws generate better preload than titanium. Torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex. However, further investigations, with torque applications repeated until screw breakage, are needed to advise on ideal maintenance protocols. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Closed {{reduction}} and internal fixation by an anterior approach is an established option for operative treatment of displaced Type II odontoid fractures. In elderly patients, however, inadequate screw purchase in osteoporotic bone {{can result in}} severe procedure-related complications. PURPOSE: To improve the stability of odontoid fracture screw fixation in the elderly using a new technique that includes injection of polymethylmethacrylat (PMMA) cement into the C 2 body. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of hospital and outpatient records as well as radiographs of elderly patients treated in a university hospital department of orthopedic surgery. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty-four elderly patients (8 males and 16 females; mean age, 81 years; range, 62 - 98 years) with Type II fractures of the dens. OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications, cement leakage (symptomatic/asymptomatic), operation time, loss of reduction, pseudarthrosis and revision surgery, patient complaints, return to normal activities, and signs of neurologic complications were all documented. METHODS: After closed {{reduction and}} anterior approach to the inferior border of C 2, a guide wire is advanced {{to the tip of}} the odontoid under biplanar fluoroscopic control. Before the insertion of one cannulated, self-drilling, short thread <b>screws,</b> a 12 <b>gauge</b> Yamshidi cannula is inserted from anterior and 1 to 3 mL of high-viscosity PMMA cement is injected into the anteroinferior portion of the C 2 body. During polymerization of the cement, the screws are further inserted using a lag-screw compression technique. The cervical spine then is immobilized with a soft collar for 8 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Anatomical reduction of the dens was achieved in all 24 patients. Mean operative time was 64 minutes (40 - 90 minutes). Early loss of reduction occurred in three patients, but revision surgery was indicated in only one patient 2 days after primary surgery. One patient died within the first eight postoperative weeks, one within 3 months after surgery. In five patients, asymptomatic cement leakage was observed (into the C 1 -C 2 joint in three patients, into the fracture in two). Conventional radiologic follow-up at 2 and 6 months confirmed anatomical healing in 16 of the 19 patients with complete follow-up. In two patients, the fractures healed in slight dorsal angulation; one patient developed a asymptomatic pseudarthrosis. All patients were able to resume their pretrauma level of activity. CONCLUSIONS: Cement augmentation of the screw in Type II odontoid fractures in elderly patients is technically feasible in a clinical setting with a low complication rate. This technique may improve screw purchase, especially in the osteoporotic C 2 body...|$|R
40|$|MDent, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandPURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this in vitro {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} effect of using either gold or titanium retaining screws on preload in the dental implant body-abutment complex. This preload is of vital importance for the long term success of the dental implant complex. Inadequate preload results in either loosening or fracture of the retaining screw, and is the most commonly occurring mechanical complication in implant supported/retained prostheses. Similar complications occur when excessive preload is applied to the retaining screws. These complications can result in unscheduled visits with costly and time consuming repairs for the clinician and patient. Routine maintenance protocols for implant supported prostheses range from biannually to five year visits to the dentist. Maintenance visits involve removal of the prosthesis facilitating cleaning of both the implant and prosthesis and inspection of retaining screws. This study sought to gain insight into changes in preload generation after repeated torque application to gold and titanium screws and to observe whether gold or titanium generated better preload. A maintenance protocol would be suggested if any observable pattern was noted. MATERIALS AND METHODS The test setup consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment and the retaining screws (gold or titanium). The implant body was anchored using a load cell. Transmucosal abutments were attached to the implant body using either a gold or titanium v retaining <b>screw.</b> A torque <b>gauge</b> was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm and 40 Ncm to the retaining screws. This was undertaken to investigate the effect of gold or titanium on preload generated. The effect of applying torque beyond manufacturers recommended 32 Ncm was carried out to see if greater preloads could be achieved. All components were from the Southern Implant system. RESULTS Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining screws. Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of gold retaining screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Maintenance protocols suggest replacing retaining screws every 20 years. After ten torque cycles were applied to each screw there was an insignificant change in preload generated in both titanium and gold screws. This study was therefore inconclusive with regards to maintenance protocols. CONCLUSION Within the limitations of this study, gold retaining screws generated better preload than titanium. Torque application beyond manufacturers’ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex. Further investigation into repeated torque application to retaining screws is required, to determine ideal maintenance protocols...|$|R
