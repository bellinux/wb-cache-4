40|$|Abstract. Resolution is {{a crucial}} {{parameter}} in pre-excavation surveys of archaeological sites. Geophysical methods based on Laplace (gravity, magnetics), diffusion (e. g. low-frequency electromagnetics) and wave equations (i. e. <b>seismics</b> and ground-penetrating radar GPR) are often applied in this sequence to attain increasing detail about subsurface characteristics (i. e. shape and location of subsurface volumes) and physical properties. We apply potential (magnetic gradiometry) and wave-equation based (i. e. <b>seismics</b> and GPR), combined with dedicated data-processing and analysis techniques based on instantaneous attributes, {{to the study of}} different archaeological sites, namely: an area characterized by scattered remains of unknown shape and dimension, a prehistoric grave, buried walls and foundations, a funerary tumulus. The depth range of interest is between 80 and 500 cm. Magnetic gradiometry, filtered to remove long wavelength anomalies and to focus the analysis on a +/- 5 nT range, allows clear identification of buried brick-walls, with unavoidable uncertainty concerning the depth of the targets.

40|$|P-wave {{refraction}} <b>seismics</b> {{is a key}} {{method in}} permafrost research but its applicability to low-porosity rocks, that constitute alpine rock walls, has been denied in prior studies. These explain p-wave velocity changes in freezing rocks exclusively due to changing velocities of pore infill, i. e. water, air and ice. In existing models, no velocity increase is expected for low-porosity bedrock. We postulate, that mixing laws apply for high-porosity rocks, but freezing in confined space in low-porosity bedrock also alters physical rock matrix properties. In the laboratory, we measured p-wave velocities of 22 decimeter-large low-porosity ( 100 micro-fissures) from 25 °C to – 15 °C in 0. 3 °C increments close to the freezing point. P-wave velocity increases by 7 – 78 % when freezing parallel to cleavage/bedding and matrix velocity increases from 5 – 59 % coincident to an anisotropy decrease in most samples. The expansion of rigid bedrock upon freezing is restricted and ice pressure will increase matrix velocity and decrease anisotropy while changing velocities of the pore infill are insignificant. Here, we present a modified Timur's 2 -phase equation implementing changes in matrix velocity dependent on lithology and demonstrate the physical basis for refraction <b>seismics</b> in low-porosity bedrock...|$|R
40|$|Jeffreys Ledge, located ~ 50 km off {{the coast}} of New Hampshire, USA, is a major physiographic feature in the western Gulf of Maine (WGOM), {{extending}} over 100 km along its axis, while generally only being 5 to 10 km in width (~ 20 km maximum). The feature rises over 200 m from nearby basins to depths less than 50 m on the ridge surface. A major field campaign was undertaken at Jeffreys Ledge and adjacent areas in order to assess the roles of glaciation, sea-level fluctuations, and marine processes {{on the development of the}} major depositional environments. The study focused on an ~ 500 sq km area that extended from the shallowest reaches to the deep adjacent basins utilizing high resolution multibeam echosounder bathymetry (synthesized and gridded at the highest possible resolution), subbottom <b>seismics,</b> videography, and bottom sediment sampling. Due to the coarseness of the sediments composing the surface of Jeffreys Ledge (which frequently included cobbles and boulders), direct sampling was largely limited. Therefore, a descriptive seafloor classification utilizing video was developed and applied. The seafloor on Jeffreys Ledge typically ranges from sandy pebble gravel to pebble cobble gravel with boulders. Major glacial features include several boulder ridges ~ 5 m in elevation that extend kms in length. These ridges, which run roughly parallel to the axis of Jeffreys Ledge, likely reflect winnowed recessional moraines. Smaller, asymmetric linear ridges with varying orientations are found on the western (landward) boundary. Although the origin of these features are unknown, they are believed to be relict glacial features as well. On the seaward (east) edge of the platform facing the open Gulf of Maine is a relatively smooth, sandy bathymetric high that likely was formed by wave processes during the last sea-level low stand. Subbottom <b>seismics</b> show evidence of soft sediment faulting and slumping on the flanks of the ridge and in the adjacent muddy basins.
