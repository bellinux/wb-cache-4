At that time, mechanical reduction gears for such high power applications were not available. The core idea of hydrodynamic torque converters and fluid couplings is to provide wear free power transmission using a hydraulic closed pump and turbine cycle. In the following decades, hydrodynamic torque converters experienced significant improvements driven by the automotive industry, and their use spread into various applications. Today, torque converters are commonly used in cars, busses, locomotives, construction equipment, and gas compression as a means of (i) smooth power transmission, (ii) to provide torque amplification during startup conditions, and (iii) to act as a damper for driver and driven equipment torsional disturbances and shock loads. In the oil and gas industry, torque converters are often used as integrated components in drive transmissions for electric motor driven compressors or pumps trains. They provide step-less speed variation along with progressive torque increase towards low speed. For example, torque converters and hydraulic couplings can be used to drive a variable speed centrifugal compressor using a fixed speed electric motor without the need for a variable frequency drive. In recent years, torque converters in combination with planetary gearboxes have been successfully demonstrated as a viable technology for variable speed electric motor driven centrifugal compressor applications. Torque converters are also used as soft starters between generators and gas or steam turbines. The unique power transmission features of the torque converter make it an option for equipment that requires <b>start-up</b> torque <b>assistance</b> and speed control. Modern torque converters up to 65, 000 kW have been designed and are widely in operation...|$|R

The goal of this program is to support organizations wishing to use Formal Inspections {{to improve the quality}} of software and system level engineering products. The Technology Transfer Program provides <b>start-up</b> materials and <b>assistance</b> to help organizations establish their own Formal Inspection program. The course materials and certified instructors associated with the Technology Transfer Program have proven to be effective in classes taught at other NASA centers as well as at JPL. Formal Inspections (NASA tailored Fagan Inspections) are a set of technical reviews whose objective is to increase quality and reduce the cost of software development by detecting and correcting errors early. A primary feature of inspections is the removal of engineering errors before they amplify into larger and more costly problems downstream in the development process. Note that the word 'inspection' is used differently in software than in a manufacturing context. A Formal Inspection is a front-end quality enhancement technique, rather than a task conducted just prior to product shipment for the purpose of sorting defective systems (manufacturing usage). Formal Inspections are supporting and in agreement with the 'total quality' approach being adopted by many NASA centers...|$|R

40|$|Most Vietnamese {{enterprises}} {{are small}} and medium enterprises (SMEs). According to the official definition in 2001 these are defined as enterprises with less than 300 employees or registered capital of 10 billion Vietnamese dong. Of the 155, 771 formally registered enterprises in operation in 2007, SMEs accounted for 97. 4 percent of total enterprises according to the employee criterion or 84. 7 percent according to the registered capital criterion. If the informally registered household enterprises are included, Vietnamese SMEs accounted for over 99 percent of total business establishments {{in the country in}} 2007. A majority of SMEs are from the domestic non-state sector, which made up approximately 96 percent of total SMEs in 2007. Manufacturing SMEs accounted for almost 92 percent of total manufacturing enterprises in operation in Vietnam in 2007. They are more export-oriented compared to SMEs in other sectors such as agriculture or services. In addition, manufacturing SMEs are noted for their ability to create stable jobs. This thesis examines the performance of Vietnamese non-state manufacturing SMEs. In particular, it analyses firm level technical efficiency of domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs in Vietnam over the 2002 – 2007 period after the introduction of the important Enterprise Law in 2000. It identifies the sources of inefficiency from the characteristics of the firms and business environment for manufacturing SMEs in aggregate and by sub-sectors. The study provides evidence-based policy recommendations to improve efficiency and competitiveness of domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs in Vietnam. Using stochastic frontier production function, an econometric approach, the study analyses 5, 204 observations of SMEs in three surveys conducted in 2002, 2005 and 2007. Under this approach, a best practice frontier is estimated from the sample and actual performance of individual firms is compared against this frontier to calculate their technical efficiency level. The cross-sectional results from the estimations reveal that manufacturing SMEs in Vietnam have relatively high average technical efficiency, ranging from 84. 25 percent to 92. 55 percent. An analysis is also conducted for nine sub-sectors within the manufacturing sector. It is found that the high-tech Electronics and Electrical Equipment sub-sector has the lowest technical efficiency level of around 80 percent, while the low-tech Wood and Furniture sub-sector achieves full technical efficiency. This sub-sector has simple technology which makes it easier for firms to reach the production frontier. The study further examines the factors influencing efficiency. Findings from this study indicate that innovation through major product improvement, government assistance in credit at start-up, household and collective ownership had a positive relationship with the technical efficiency of the aggregate manufacturing sample. Meanwhile, firm size, firm age, urban location, cooperation with foreign partners, subcontracting, government assistance in premises/land at <b>start-up,</b> and government <b>assistance</b> in credit during operation adversely affected the technical efficiency of manufacturing SMEs. The effects of new product innovation and limited liability and joint-stock ownership on technical efficiency are mixed. Exporting is found to have no significant influence on the technical efficiency of Vietnamese domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs. While many of the results above confirm the findings from earlier studies, some results are against mainstream ideas and similar with the results from other transitional economies. Policy recommendations derived from the empirical evidence are also discussed in this study. It suggests that Vietnamese domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs need to upgrade their technology and move the current production frontier upward. It appears that Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs have almost exhausted the current production frontier. This is reflected in their high level of technical efficiency. The move from static efficiency to dynamic efficiency will also improve the performance of Vietnamese SMEs in their participation in international value chains. There is a clear message to support the development of new firms, small firms, rural firms and informally registered enterprises which achieve better technical efficiency performance. Meanwhile, older firms, larger firms among manufacturing SMEs, urban firms and formally registered enterprises need to improve technology, human capital and management skills necessary to become better suited to the changing conditions of Vietnam’s economy with increasing international economic integration and competition. Government assistance should be better targeted to specific sub-sectors based on their technical efficiency performance. A one-size-fits-all policy for SMEs, or even just manufacturing SMEs, may not have the intended impact. The procedures and requirements for assistance should be transparent and simplified enough to give access to firms that need it most. The findings from this study provide a clear picture about the performance of Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs with policy implications that are relevant to SMEs in other transitional economies and developing countries...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} German public <b>start-up</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes administered by the Deutsche Ausgleichsbank (DtA) {{on the performance of}} young firms. The empirical analysis is based on firms from the ZEW Entrepreneurship Study that either received start-up loans in one or more DtA schemes or did not receive any funding from the DtA at all. The paper applies a non-parametric matching approach often applied by labour market economists. The interesting success measure is the average annual employment growth rate over a six year period and the resulting causal effect is the difference of this measure between the group of subsidized firms and the selected control group firms that did not receive any DtA start-up loans. The empirical analysis shows that DtA start-up loans significantly improve the average employment growth rate. ...|$|E

Total cash earnings and the unemployment rate, which are the macro economic indicators, had positive effects on latent entrepreneurship in Japan. Judging from the significance of their estimations, the latent entrepreneurship is explained by the “Push hypothesis”.

40|$|Mathematics (NCTM) {{identified}} the "Technology Principle " {{as one of}} six principles of high quality mathematics education (NCTM, 2000). This principle states: "Technology is essential {{in teaching and learning}} mathematics; it influences the mathematics that is taught and enhances students ' learning " (p. 24). There is widespread agreement that mathematics teachers, not technological tools, are the key change agents to bringing about reform in mathematics teaching with technology (Kaput, 1992; NCTM 1991, 2000). Yet, preparing teachers to use technology appropriately is a complex task for teacher educators (Mergendoller, 1994). Waits and Demana (2000) argue that adoption of technology by teachers requires professional development that focuses on both conceptual and pedagogical issues, ongoing support in terms of "intensive <b>start-up</b> <b>assistance</b> and regular follow-up activities " and a desire to change from within the profession (p. 53).

40|$|Objectives This {{research}} {{explores the}} relationship between young firms, their growth orientation-intention {{and a range of}} relationships which can be seen to provide business support. Prior-work Research indicates that networks impact the firm’s ability to secure resources (Sirmon and Hitt 2003; Liao and Welsch. 2004; Hanlon and Saunders 2007). Networks have been evaluated {{in a number of ways}} ranging from simple counts to characteristics of their composition (Davidsson and Honig 2003), strength of relationships (Granovetter 1973) and network diversity (Carter et al 2003). By providing access to resources and knowledge (from <b>start-up</b> <b>assistance</b> and raising capital, (e. g. Smallbone et al, 2003), networks may assist in enabling continued persistence during those times where firms may experience resource constraints owing to firm growth (Baker and Nelson 2005). Approach The data used in this research was generated in the 2008 UK Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) survey. Over 1, 000 of the firms responding were found to fall into the category of “young”, ((defined as firms under 4 years old). Firms were considered the unit of analysis with the entrepreneur being the chief spokesperson for the firm. Preliminary data analysis considered key demographic characteristics and industry classifications, comparing the FSB data with that of the UK government’s own (BERR) Small Business Surveys of 2007 and 2008, to establish some degree of representativeness of the respondents. The analysis then examined networks with varying potential ability to provide support for young firms, the networks measured in terms of number, diversity, characteristic and strength in its relationship to young firm growth orientation. The diversity of business-support-related relationships ranged from friends and family, through professional services, customers and suppliers, and government business services, to trade associations and informal business networks. The characteristics of these formal and informal sources of support for new businesses are examined across a range of business support-type activities for new firms. The number of relationships and types of business support are also explored. Finally, the strength of these relationships is examined by analysis of the source of business support, type of business support, and links to the growth orientation-intention of the firm, after controlling for a number of key variables related to firm and industry status and owner characteristics. Results Preliminary analysis of the data by means of univariate analysis showed that average number of sources of advice was around 2. 5 (from a potential total of 6). In terms of the diversity of relationships, universities had by far the smallest percentage of firms receiving beneficial advice from them.
