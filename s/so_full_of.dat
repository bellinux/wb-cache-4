5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed {{of many of these}} same elements. The ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its ba; thus, the sun was called the ba of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a ka, another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's ba to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, {{were believed}} to house divine bas in this way. Gods could be ascribed many bas and kas, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said {{to be one of the}} kas of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the ba of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> life-giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat.|$|E

25|$|Comăneci {{was born}} to Gheorghe and Ștefania Comăneci, and has a younger brother. Her parents {{separated}} in the 1970s, and her father (1936–2012) later moved to Bucharest. She and her younger brother Adrian were raised in {{the faith of the}} Romanian Orthodox Church. In a 2011 interview, Nadia's mother Ștefania said that she enrolled her daughter into gymnastics classes simply because she was a child who was <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> energy and active that she was difficult to manage. Comăneci graduated from Politehnica University of Bucharest with a degree in sports education that qualified her to coach gymnastics.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies by}} Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) {{say that the}} river is <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> killer {{pollutants}} that those living along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal {{are more prone to}} cancer {{than anywhere else in the}} country. Conducted by the National Cancer Registry Programme under the ICMR, the study throws up shocking findings indicating that the river is thick with heavy metals and lethal chemicals that cause cancer. According to Deputy Director General of NCRP A. Nandkumar, the incidence of cancer was highest in the country in areas drained by the Ganges and stated that the problem would be studied deeply and with the findings presented in a report to the health ministry.|$|E
25|$|Even if karma is denied, God still {{cannot be}} the {{enforcer}} of consequences. Because {{the motives of}} an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> suffering. If his motives {{are assumed to be}} egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.|$|E

25|$|Until 1617 such {{drugs and}} {{medicines}} as were in common use {{were sold in}} England by the apothecaries and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate charter, and it was enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary’s shop. The preparation of physicians’ prescriptions was thus confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear to make them dispense accurately, by {{the issue of a}} pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by the College of Physicians, and by the power which the wardens of the apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of examining the shops of apothecaries within 7m. of London and destroying all the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, the first authorized London Pharmacopoeia, was selected chiefly from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, but it was found to be <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> errors that the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh edition was published in the following December.|$|E
25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} of the {{compositional}} process was the writing out in ink of a fair copy of the full score (Reinschrift der Partitur). This task was begun by Wagner himself on 15 February 1854, {{while he was still}} at work on the instrumentation draft. It was delayed, however, by his decision to start work on Die Walküre (28 June 1854). Sometime in the summer of 1854 he hired a copyist to make a fair copy in ink of Das Rheingold (using his own unfinished fair copy as a model), but the copyist's work was <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> blunders that Wagner was forced to dismiss him and resume work on his own copy. He worked at it on and off for several months, alternating this work with the ongoing composition of Die Walküre. By 25 September 1854 the fair copy of Das Rheingold was finally completed. Wagner then sent it to the Dresden copyist Friedrich Wölfel, who completed a beautiful and very accurate ink copy on 11 November 1855. Wöfel's copy was used as the source-text (Stichvorlage) for the first public printing of the complete opera in 1873.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|By the 19th century, {{the scope}} of Leonardo's {{notebooks}} was known, {{as well as his}} paintings. Hippolyte Taine wrote in 1866: [...] "There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries." ...|$|E

However, things did not turn up according to his plans the following day, as he was late and was still suffering the effects of a hangover. When Harrison played the sample to Beyoncé in the studio, the singer initially had doubts about the [...] "sound <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> blaring fanfare;" [...] it seemed too retro and according to her, no one used horn riffs in the 21st century. Nevertheless, Beyoncé became friendlier to the sample, much to Harrison's delight, and gave him two hours to write and compose the song while she went out.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} the New York premiere, the critics greeted Gianni Schicchi warmly; most reviewers {{found it to}} be the best of the three operas. New York Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel described it as [...] "so uproariously funny... <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> life, humor, and ingenious devices". The New York Times reviewer James Huneker considered the opera to be [...] "a rollicking, madcap scherzo, overflowing with merry deviltries... And the last shall be first." [...] Huneker praised De Luca as [...] "a most engaging rascal, fit for a minor niche in Moliere's gallery". The Times critic also was amused by Marto Malatesta as [...] "The 'Kid' Gherardino, who is spanked by the irate family".|$|E
500|$|The main U.S. {{contribution}} to the FANK effort {{came in the form}} of the bombers and tactical aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. When President Nixon launched the incursion in 1970, American and South Vietnamese troops operated under an umbrella of air cover that was designated Operation Freedom Deal. When those troops were withdrawn, the air operation continued, ostensibly to interdict PAVN/Viet Cong troop movements and logistics. In reality (and unknown to the U.S. Congress and American public), they were utilized to provide tactical air support to FANK. As a former U.S. military officer in Phnom Penh reported, [...] "the areas around the Mekong River were <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> bomb craters from B-52 strikes that, by 1973, they looked like the valleys of the moon." ...|$|E

500|$|The Appreciation, {{which had}} {{originally}} been intended for distribution around the Royal Navy, was deemed <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> [...] "far-reaching and astringent criticism of Jellicoe" [...] and of new and therefore irrelevant tactical theory that Beatty and his Board of Admiralty were compelled to decide against its publication. [...] Indeed, Admirals Roger Keyes and Ernle Chatfield were moved to write to Beatty that if published the Appreciation [...] "would rend the service to its foundations". [...] The final straw had been the very public heckling of Dewar when he lectured from his Appreciation to the twenty students of the Senior Officers' War Course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. [...] It was decided to expurgate the existing document, which {{had been removed from}} circulation and release it. It was published as The Narrative of the Battle of Jutland in 1924.|$|E
500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it [...] "really an emotional decision", she explained: [...] "He was <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided {{it would be fun to}} take a great leap with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E
