5|$|In 1969, {{more than}} 400 students, {{angry about the}} {{dismissal}} of a popular professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the <b>student</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the Monday {{following}} the first sit-in, the Baptist Minister's Conference of Nashville, representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted {{to support the}} <b>student</b> <b>movement,</b> thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students. Local religious leaders called on people of good will to boycott downtown merchants who practiced segregation. Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic hardship for the merchants.|$|E
5|$|During the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election Karmal {{was one of}} four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad, Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the <b>student</b> <b>movement</b> in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.|$|E
40|$|University <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> are diverse {{socio-cultural}} entities. Depending on {{the cultural}} and economic moment, university <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> have been intensely political entities that participate in steering the aims of government and nation. However at other moments, <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> have been less concerned with wider socio-political issues, and have worked mainly {{within the realm of}} student issues and university administration. This paper applies a matrix to analyze the commonalities and differences between various <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> and to understand more about their relationships to their immediate and broader environments. This article examines three <b>student</b> <b>movements,</b> and some of the factors leading to their evolution in India, Argentina and the United States by building on concepts first introduced by Philip Altbach in 1968...|$|R
50|$|Students from Orlando West and Diepkloof High Schools (both in Soweto) {{created the}} African <b>Students</b> <b>Movement</b> in 1970. This {{spread to the}} Eastern Cape and Transvaal, drawing other high schools. In March 1972, the South African <b>Students</b> <b>Movement</b> (SASM) was instituted.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the rise and}} decline of <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> in Europe and America during the 1960 s and 1970 s. Drawing on materials on <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> {{in a number of}} countries, it assesses their historical significance, {{in the context of a}} larger ‘protest wave’ with which the <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> of the period intersected. Relating these movements to students’ changing position within advanced capitalism, it suggests that their dynamics were shaped both by the specific characteristics of students as political actors and by the patterns of their inter-relations with other contemporaneous movements. The article concludes by noting more recent developments, suggesting that the story of <b>student</b> <b>movements</b> still offers interesting new possibilities...|$|R
5|$|The Nashville sit-ins, {{which lasted}} from February 13 to May 10, 1960, {{were part of}} a nonviolent direct action {{campaign}} to end racial segregation at lunch counters in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The sit-in campaign, coordinated by the Nashville <b>Student</b> <b>Movement</b> and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, was notable for its early success and emphasis on disciplined nonviolence. It was part of a broader sit-in movement that spread across the Southern United States {{in the wake of the}} Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{the first}} serious student revolts started to emerge, {{motivated}} by the local and global changes of the decade, like the Vietnam war, the European <b>student</b> <b>movement,</b> {{the presence of the}} Peace Corps in Latin-America and specially in Colombia, the rejection of the IDB loan and the presence of the foreign foundations. On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university. Nevertheless, the support for the rector dropped, who had to resign. Since mid February to April, the university was closed until the new rector was appointed.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the <b>Student</b> <b>Movement</b> House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot {{before and during the}} rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{returned}} to his former dwellings at 95 Cambridge Street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over £100 in rent. This angered Ross {{and contributed to the}} breakdown of their friendship. He then rented a flat in Camden Town with his friend Dinah Snock, whom he had met at an anti-imperialist rally in Trafalgar Square. Kenyatta socialised at the <b>Student</b> <b>Movement</b> House in Russell Square, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended various Africans in the city. To earn money, he worked as one of 250 black extras in the film Sanders of the River, filmed at Shepperton Studios in Autumn 1934. A number of other Africans in London criticised him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people. Appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the African-American Paul Robeson.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the <b>student</b> <b>movement.</b> The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
5|$|With Suharto {{increasingly}} seen as {{the source}} of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician Amien Rais, spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations. The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998, when security forces killed four demonstrators from Jakarta's Trisakti University. Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General Wiranto and Prabowo, and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the <b>student</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid <b>student</b> <b>movement</b> at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{the city}} gained a {{reputation}} as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, {{as well as the}} <b>student</b> <b>movement.</b> The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford began {{a career}} in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible <b>Student</b> <b>movement,</b> and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.|$|E
