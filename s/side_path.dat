60|$|The guide, however, {{settled the}} {{question}} by taking {{hold of the}} horse's bridle, and leading him off into the <b>side</b> <b>path.</b> The two travellers followed him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{surface is}} {{compacted}} earth. It {{has been described}} as [...] "rough, steep and inadequately signposted". It features tall forests and views of the Thomson River. [...] The trail features <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> to the Horseshoe Bend tunnel, and to the small town of Coopers Creek, as well as connections to the Australian Alps Walking Track.|$|R
50|$|This game is {{classified}} as Adventure, and not a traditional Role-playing game. This is {{because most of the}} game is set on a predetermined path that you can only travel in one direction, with few exceptions of <b>side</b> <b>paths.</b> Enemy encounters are set at predetermined locations and formations. This is in contrast to a Role-playing game focusing on dungeon crawling and open exploration.|$|R

60|$|On a run it did {{not take}} long to reach the little home by the <b>side</b> <b>path.</b> As they neared it, Ralph pointed excitedly to the sitting-room windows.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't go {{into the}} church,' she said suddenly, with such final {{decision}} that Ursula immediately halted, turned round, and branched off up a small <b>side</b> <b>path</b> {{which led to the}} little private gate of the Grammar School, whose grounds adjoined those of the church.|$|E
50|$|From the trailhead, a {{well-defined}} path is followed through woodland displaying {{a variety of}} plants and trees. The wooded area eventually gives way to wetlands and a small lake. Here the path becomes a boardwalk round the lake. The trail is a circular route of about 3 mi total, there are several small <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> taking the total trail length to about 4 mi.|$|R
25|$|There are 20 {{levels in}} Shrek the Third. The levels are highly linear, with <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> {{containing}} rewards for {{the completion of}} mission-style quests (three or five) and easter eggs such as an appearance by the (Penguins) from the Madagascar film. After completing a level, the player is awarded bonus Far Far Pounds, the game's currency used for purchasing items in the gift shop. The difficulty setting multiplies the bonuses obtained.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009The 2009 Donauinselfest was on {{the verge}} of being {{canceled}} due to flooding. It had rained consistently for the last few days, making it necessary to open flood protection, which leveled out the water level on the sides of the Donauinsel, but being enough to flood the <b>side</b> <b>paths,</b> that would have provided an important escape route should it be necessary. Luckily, the water level sank and the roads were cleared in time, saving the event.|$|R
6000|$|At length {{they were}} set down at what the Frenchwoman thought a safe distance, and paying the cabman, set out along the <b>side</b> <b>path,</b> Josephine admonishing her lady that it was best not to walk so swiftly, or to look guilty, or they would be [...] "trahies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what nonsense! I {{like these}} verses very much. I will read them as I {{walk along the}} <b>side</b> <b>path,</b> where I shall hear the bees, and catch the flutter of a {{butterfly}} among the words. That {{will be a very}} fitting way to read this poet.' ...|$|E
60|$|The tall {{shade of}} the {{horseman}} darkened the room in which Mrs. Hall sat, and made her start, for he had ridden by a <b>side</b> <b>path</b> {{to the top of}} the slope, where riders seldom came. In a few seconds he was in the garden with Sally.|$|E
50|$|The 3m wide paths, {{with some}} 2.5m wide <b>side</b> <b>paths,</b> were {{funded by a}} {{combination}} of Infrastructure Auckland and Land Transport New Zealand grants / subsidies. The construction of the paths in the 2000s at that time included 5 bridges, 11 boardwalks, 5 retaining walls and a number of property purchases, for a total of slightly more than $10 million. The project also included a variety of local artworks, from ceramic tiles to cultural markers and kinetic sculptures, with a budget of $380,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{cemetery}} is geographically {{aligned with}} the church, and takes up {{a large portion of}} the land area. The oldest graves are on the eastern <b>side</b> of the <b>path,</b> and typically face west. Newer graves on the western <b>side</b> of the <b>path</b> generally face east.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, {{shortly after}} his arrival in Honolulu, Father Valentin Franckx, SS.CC., former pastor of Saint Augustine by the Sea Catholic Church in Waikīkī laid out a central road and <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> in the {{cemetery}} so that each lot could be reached without walking over neighboring lots. Many trees were removed and in 1892, Father Valentin planted the stately royal palms that line the main lane to the cemetery. Father Valentin reported that a society was organized for the upkeep and improvement of the cemetery. Members paid an annual fee of five dollars.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is getting}} hot," [...] thought the youth, {{and started to}} retreat, when he heard more {{soldiers}} coming {{from the direction of}} the cave. As there now seemed no help for it, he crossed the trail and plunged along a <b>side</b> <b>path,</b> leading eastward,--a trail running directly to Guantanamo.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Martineau {{had assumed}} an {{attitude}} of trained observation on the <b>side</b> <b>path.</b> His hands rested on his hips and his hat was a little on one side. He was inclined to agree with Sir Richmond. [...] "I don't know," [...] he considered. [...] "You wanted some such blow-off as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, I've {{got to see}} the end of this," [...] said Tom, and led the way by a <b>side</b> <b>path</b> to the Widow Taylor's cottage. This was a short cut, but Aleck {{would not}} take it, because of the briar bushes and the dust. As the boys were in their knockaround suits they did not mind this.|$|E
50|$|The Fitchburg Cutoff Path largely {{runs through}} Alewife Brook Reservation, with several <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> through the {{reservation}} {{leading to the}} Little River and a nearby industrial park. The trail starts at a new pedestrian bridge just northwest of the Alewife station, {{across the street from}} the south end of the Minuteman Path. The western trail head is marked by small signs, just north of where the MBTA rail line crosses Brighton Street. The west end is served by the MBTA #78 bus, with a stop just south of the railroad tracks.|$|R

The route winds around the {{northern}} slopes of Lantau Peak and descends into Tung Chung Valley. The trail passes woodland, mountain streams and also hillside monasteries. The impressive views over Shek Pik {{make a strong}} contrast with the airport which {{is seen in the}} distance. <b>Side</b> <b>paths</b> skirt the small monasteries seen along the way. All around are natural hillsides, rich with life forms, some of them rare.|$|R
50|$|The Thames Path crosses Temple Footbridge {{from the}} Buckinghamshire to Berkshire <b>side.</b> The <b>path</b> then crosses back across {{footbridges}} between the islands at Hurley where Hurley lock is located.|$|R
6000|$|Benham {{found himself}} with Amanda upon a <b>side</b> <b>path,</b> a little {{isolated}} by some swaggering artichokes {{and a couple}} of apple trees and so forth from the general conversation. They cut themselves off from the continuation of that by a little silence, and then she spoke abruptly and with the quickness of a speaker who has thought out something to say and fears interruption: [...] "Why did you come down here?" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} the party met a company of peasant girls {{coming down from the}} mountain. They came into the path by which our {{travellers}} were ascending from a <b>side</b> <b>path</b> which seemed to lead up a secluded glen. These girls came dancing gayly along with bouquets of flowers in their hands and garlands in their hair. They looked bright and blooming, and seemed very contented and happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad!" [...] said Holmes. [...] "Bad! Stand clear, Watson! Not an {{unnecessary}} footstep! What do I read here? He fell wounded--he stood up--he remounted--he proceeded. But {{there is no}} other track. Cattle on this <b>side</b> <b>path.</b> He was surely not gored by a bull? Impossible! But I see no traces of anyone else. We must push on, Watson. Surely, with stains as well as the track to guide us, he cannot escape us now." ...|$|E
50|$|From the {{intersection}} of the Blue Ridge Parkway and Hwy 80, drive north on Hwy 80. At 2.2 miles is the left hand turn to Roaring Fork and Setrock Creek Falls (South Toe River Rd). Continue past there on Hwy 80, drive just over 5 miles and turn left on White Oak Rd (SR1156). Drive another 1/2 mile or so and turn left on White Oak Creek Rd (SR1157). This road dead ends after another 1.5 miles. Park here and walk up the old logging road and look for some <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> down to the base.|$|R
50|$|The formal garden {{contains}} a wide central path lined with hedges and topiaries. Grassy <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> wander through colorful and exotic flowers. The garden’s colors change {{every few weeks}} in the warmer months as new species come into bloom. Spring-time bulbs are abundant with many varieties of tulips and daffodils. Summer-time flowers include an extensive selection of roses. Many similar species are planted together, allowing the visitor to observe the subtle differences. Most plantings are well identified with signs and pictures. Remarkable specimen trees are featured including holly, ginkgo, European beech, Japanese Umbrella Pine, Dawn Redwood, and others.|$|R
6000|$|From {{one of the}} <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> {{amongst the}} houses a woman stepped out on the road, a slight girlish figure walking {{under the shade of}} a large tray {{balanced}} on its head. The consciousness of something moving stirred Reshid's half-sleeping senses into a comparative wakefulness. He recognised Taminah, Bulangi's slave-girl, with her tray of cakes for sale--an apparition of daily recurrence and of no importance whatever. She was going towards Almayer's house. She could be made useful. He roused himself up and ran towards the gate calling out, [...] "Taminah O!" [...] The girl stopped, hesitated, and came back slowly.|$|R
60|$|They {{followed}} {{the road by}} which they had come, for about a mile; and then turned off a <b>side</b> <b>path</b> in the forest, to the left. They followed this for a short distance, only, into the forest; and then, {{when they arrived at}} a small, open space, a halt was ordered. The prisoner was dropped unceremoniously to the ground, by the two franc tireurs who carried him on their shoulders, and a fire was speedily lighted.|$|E
60|$|But {{the creatures}} led their captives {{away from the}} rocks and the road, down the hill by a <b>side</b> <b>path</b> until they came before a low {{mountain}} of rock {{that looked like a}} huge bowl turned upside down. At the edge of this mountain was a deep gulf--so deep that when you looked into it there was nothing but blackness below. Across the gulf was a narrow bridge of rock, and {{at the other end of}} the bridge was an arched opening that led into the mountain.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes {{the land}} is cleared, and he finds himself by the {{homestead}} of a forest farm, and remarks the buildings, distinguished not only by their neatness, but the propriety of their rustic architecture. Still advancing, the deer become rarer, and the road is formed by an avenue of chestnuts; the forest, on each side, being now transformed into vegetable gardens. The stir {{of the population is}} soon evident. Persons are moving to and fro on the <b>side</b> <b>path</b> of the road. Horsemen and carts seem returning from market; women with empty baskets, and then the rare vision of a stage-coach. The postilion spurs his horses, cracks his whip, and dashes at full gallop into the town of Montacute, the capital of the forest.|$|E
2500|$|Warmbloods: pulled mane, usually braided (either <b>side).</b> Short bridle <b>path</b> [...] in length.|$|R
50|$|Han Xin {{knew that}} he could not let Xiang Yu return to the capital. Han Xin ordered his forces to {{increase}} the number of ambushes, in order to force the Chu troops into a canyon area near Gaixia, where Xiang Yu could not move at will. As the ambushes increased, Xiang Yu, an excellent strategist, became more and more certain that the main traps would await him inside the canyon. So although his troops were constantly ambushed, he insisted that his troops head straight back to the capital city through the main road as fast as they could, avoiding the <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> through the canyon.|$|R
50|$|At {{the heart}} of the old city of Welland, near the Main Street Bridge, the Welland River passes under the old Welland Canal, then runs {{parallel}} to it for a few miles. Between the old canal and the river lies a long narrow strip of land referred to as Merrit Island that is now a park. The end of the park closest to the centre of the city has picnic tables and playground equipment. The island also includes a main trail that follows the bank of the old canal for {{the entire length of the}} park, with a variety of intermittent <b>side</b> <b>paths</b> and trails.|$|R
