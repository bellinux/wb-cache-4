5|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the {{original}} multi-track tape, there had never been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley <b>Smile.</b> The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from the original mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley <b>Smile.</b>|$|E

40|$|Two {{babies were}} {{observed}} from their third week to their sixth month of life. Our {{goals in the}} study were: to investigate developmental changes in <b>smiling</b> patterns; to analyze the <b>smiling</b> patterns observed {{in the presence of}} mother`s affective behaviors, and to verify whether the babies can answer contingently, with <b>smiles,</b> to mothers` affective behaviors. The babies and their mothers were videotaped at home. It was verified a positive linear trajectory tendency for the babies` <b>smiles.</b> The babies revealed a particular tendency to display one or two kinds of <b>smiles.</b> Babies answered contingently with <b>smiles</b> to their mothers` affective behaviors. Correlations between the most frequent types of babies` <b>smiles</b> and his/her mothers` <b>smiles</b> were verified (r = 37, p <. 0017 - baby 1, and r =. 62, p <. 0017 - baby 2). Different types of <b>smiles</b> were exhibited by the babies as contingent answers to mothers` behaviors. The results show an association between babies` <b>smiles</b> and their mothers` affective behaviors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|In November 2011, after 44 years, a {{compilation}} box {{set of the}} Beach Boys' <b>Smile</b> sessions was finally released by Capitol Records. Parks was personally absent from The <b>Smile</b> Sessions advertising campaign and liner notes, and {{refused to comment on}} the box set, despite initially giving his approval. In promotional interviews for The <b>Smile</b> Sessions and the Beach Boys' 50th Reunion Tour, Mike Love suggested that <b>Smile</b> collapsed due to substance abuse, and that the project was heavily influenced by Parks' drug use. One interview included an off-the-cuff comment by Brian Wilson saying that it was Parks who introduced him to LSD and amphetamines, something Parks has previously denied. Later in 2011, Parks formally responded to these claims via his web site in a post that accused Love of Mammon and historical revisionism. In February 2013, The <b>Smile</b> Sessions {{went on to win the}} Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.|$|E

Research results showed that when the faces are upright, compared with quiet face, the response time of <b>smiling</b> face is quicker and the recognition time of <b>smiling</b> is improved. Moreover, holistic recognition strategy had its advantage under the upright condition; however it was uneasy to exert its function under the upside-down condition. <b>Smiling</b> face cognition was greatly influenced by the upside-down effect and <b>smiling</b> face recognition relied more on the holistic recognition strategy. What is more, holistic recognition strategy could overcome difficulties of recognizing various particular facial expressions of people from different cultures, and the <b>smiling</b> face could be commonly shared between the different cultures...|$|R
