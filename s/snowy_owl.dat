5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E

25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of tundra is low: 1,700 {{species of}} vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found, although millions of birds migrate there {{each year for}} the marshes. There are also a few fish species. There are few species with large populations. Notable animals in the Arctic tundra include caribou (reindeer), musk ox, Arctic hare, Arctic fox, <b>snowy</b> <b>owl,</b> lemmings, and polar bears (only near ocean-fed bodies of water). Tundra is largely devoid of poikilotherms such as frogs or lizards.|$|E
25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and <b>snowy</b> <b>owl.</b> Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur. The snow goose, common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl {{that live in the}} region.|$|E
25|$|Focused on {{the culture}} of the Inuit and Eskimos of Alaska, the museum housed over 5,000 {{artifacts}} in a former home on the campus of Western Oregon University in Monmouth. Included among the artifacts are items that demonstrate the natural environment of these native Alaskans. To showcase the environment, the museum had a room dedicated to Arctic wildlife. This life-sized diorama is called the Circumpolar Room and had an automated system that provides a narrative on the animals of the Arctic while lights illuminate busts of these animals. Animals on display included musk ox, wolves, Arctic fox, a polar bear, brown bears, a <b>snowy</b> <b>owl,</b> and caribou.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{tracking}} devices to monitor birds is extensive, but {{the effects of}} such instruments on equipped individuals are still insufficiently taken into account. Here we evaluate potential effects of backpack-mounted satellite transmitters (platform terminal transmitters; PTTs) on survival of 28 <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls</b> Bubo scandiacus. Six confirmed deaths were all probably related to natural and human-induced causes. Although PTT operational time was significantly shorter than expected lifetime of <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls,</b> five owls were observed alive after transmissions ceased. Additionally four PTTs stopped due to low battery levels, indicating end of transmitter life and not owl mortality. We {{found no evidence of}} mortality caused by PTTs, but sample sizes are relatively low and detrimental effects on equipped <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls</b> cannot be excluded.

500|$|In January 2015, The Royal Canadian Geographical Society's magazine, Canadian Geographic, {{announced}} {{a project to}} select a national bird for Canada, a designation which the country has never formally recognized. Dubbed the National Bird Project, the organization conducted an online poll inviting Canadians to vote for their favourite bird. The poll closed on 31 August 2016, and {{a panel of experts}} convened the following month to review the top five selections: the grey jay, common loon [...] (Gavia immer), <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> (Bubo scandiacus), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus). The project announced on 16 November 2016 that the grey jay was selected as the winner of the contest, and will recommend that the Canadian government make the selection official as part of Canada's sesquicentennial celebrations in 2017.|$|E
500|$|The white {{protective}} coloration {{of arctic}} animals was noted by an early student of camouflage, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in his 1889 book Darwinism; he listed the polar bear, the American polar hare, the <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> and the gyr falcon as remaining white all year, while the arctic fox, arctic hare, ermine and ptarmigan change their colour, and observed [...] "the obvious explanation", {{that it was}} for concealment. Later zoologists such as Hugh B. Cott have echoed his observations, adding that other animals of the Arctic such as musk ox, moose, reindeer, wolverine and raven never become white [...] "even in the coldest parts of their range". Cott noted that both animals that hunt, like polar bear and stoat, and prey animals like ptarmigan and mountain hare, require camouflage to hide from prey or from predators respectively. There is little experimental evidence for the adaptiveness of white as camouflage, though the ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan [...] "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that cryptic brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." [...] All the same, he notes, [...] "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by Gyrfalcons throughout the winter." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, though owls {{are portrayed}} as flying {{directly}} to the recipient of their package, it is implied that owl traffic can be monitored and even interrupted.

The state has the nation's largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska, and supports healthy populations of black bear and [...] moose. Located on the Mississippi Flyway, Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks, and game birds such as grouse, pheasants, and turkeys. It is home to birds of prey including the bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, and <b>snowy</b> <b>owl.</b> [...] The lakes teem with sport fish such as walleye, bass, muskellunge, and northern pike, and streams in the southeast are populated by brook, brown, and rainbow trout.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{than these}} two species, {{a large share}} of the {{raptorial}} prey for eagle-owls is made up of other owls. Given that all European owls are to some extent nocturnal, they may be encountered and killed upon detection by the Eurasian eagle-owl. In Europe, it has killed every other species of owl, from the tiny pygmy owl and scops owl to the large [...] great grey owl and the [...] <b>snowy</b> <b>owl.</b> The Eurasian eagle-owl is the only raptor that has been known to prey on <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> on [...] multiple occasions. However, the threat Eurasian eagle-owls poses to other raptors can be exaggerated. Occasionally, with adequate mammal prey populations, they can nest as close as a few dozen meters of other raptors and never harass them. When nesting in the same groves as the [...] long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus) in southeastern Bulgaria, Eurasian eagle-owls did not predate the buzzards at any point. Long-legged buzzards have been killed however in Kazakhstan. Even in those occasional cases where they pick off one or several raptors, they do not effect the overall population, unless the raptorial prey is already heavily diminished due to some other (often human-based) cause. For example, despite both being a known predator both, they did not significantly depress numbers of either northern goshawks or tawny owls in southern Finland. One study showed that many raptors engage in spatial avoidance during potential encounters with Eurasian eagle-owls and while the predation by eagle-owls did decrease raptor population densities, they seldom caused declines in breeding success or altered habitat occupancy.|$|E
2500|$|Herbivores on {{the tundra}} include the Arctic hare, lemming, muskox, and caribou. They are preyed {{on by the}} <b>snowy</b> <b>owl,</b> Arctic fox, Grizzly bear, and wolf. The polar bear is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [...] and marine species endemic to the colder regions.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Tracking {{individual}} animals using satellite telemetry {{has improved}} {{our understanding of}} animalmovements considerably. Nonetheless, thorough statistical treatment of Argos datasets is often jeopardized by theircoarse temporal resolution. State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets,such as the limited temporal resolution of locations {{and the lack of}} information pertaining to the behavioural state ofthe tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation ofmodelled locations on a 3 -year Argos dataset of 9 breeding <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> to assess whether searching behaviour forbreeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. Results: The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching andmoving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> constantly switched from moving to searching behaviourduring pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow coverand depth was low. This suggests that <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> adapt their searching effort to environmental conditions encounteredalong their path. Conclusions: This modelling technique increases our understanding of movement ecology and behavioural decisions ofindividual animals both locally and globally according to environmental variables...|$|R
