5|$|Between 1907 and 1910, {{the ships}} {{of the class}} were heavily rebuilt, with the {{exception}} of Kaiser Karl der Grosse. During the modernization, the ships had their <b>superstructures</b> cut down. Four 15cm guns and one torpedo tube were also removed. The ships' 8.8cm guns were repositioned to the upper decks where the 15cm guns had been located. Also, the smoke stacks were lengthened.|$|E

This study {{presents}} {{three new}} methods for <b>superstructure</b> synthesis of heat exchanger networks (HENs) and mass exchanger networks (MENs) that involve {{the use of}} key parameters in HEN and MEN to define <b>superstructure</b> intervals. The key parameters are the stream supply and target temperatures/compositions. The Supply-Based <b>Superstructure</b> (SBS) uses the supply temperatures/compositions of both the hot/rich streams and the cold lean streams. The Supply and Target-Based <b>Superstructure</b> (S&TBS) uses the supply temperatures/compositions of hot/rich streams and the target temperatures/compositions of cold/lean streams for {{the definition of the}} <b>superstructure</b> intervals. The Target and Supply-Based <b>Superstructure</b> (T&SBS) uses the target temperatures/compositions of hot/rich streams and the supply temperatures/compositions of cold/lean streams for the definition of the <b>superstructure</b> interval boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Improving the {{performance}} of available base-isolation technologies in conjunction with optimum using of dynamic properties of <b>superstructure</b> such as stiffness, damping and mass has gained lot of interests in the earthquake engineering field. In this study, the effect of <b>superstructure</b> characteristics on performance of multi-story buildings isolated with lead-plug laminated rubber bearings has been investigated. The <b>superstructure</b> characteristics considered at current research are <b>superstructure</b> mass, <b>superstructure</b> stiffness and <b>superstructure</b> damping, which were varied in the range that is compatible with engineering practice. Comparing the study results {{it has been observed}} that, there is optimum amount for each of the dynamic properties of the <b>superstructure</b> which will make design criteria achievable in seismic base-isolation of multi-story buildings. To this purpose, five reinforced concrete moment resisting frame buildings with two, five, nine, fourteen and twenty stories were considered. They were designed according to UBC 97, in fixed-base form and base-isolated form. Five different amount for <b>superstructure</b> base-mass were assigned and 25 related models were created. Variations in <b>superstructure</b> stiffness and <b>superstructure</b> damping were considered in the same manner. All of 85 model buildings were subjected to five ground motion records which have been scaled to have PGA = 0. 4 g. Nonlinear time-history analyse...|$|R
5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without <b>superstructures.</b> They {{were built in the}} Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller {{than those of the}} early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the <b>superstructures</b> which tower over the shrines.|$|E
5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the <b>superstructures</b> were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E

5|$|Investigations of the West Group have {{revealed}} an occupation {{beginning in the}} Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic. The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable <b>superstructures</b> and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E
5|$|The company started {{producing}} {{bus chassis}} in 1950, and the <b>superstructures</b> were {{built by a}} number of Finnish coach builders. The last models were appreciated {{by a number of}} bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja bus chassis were fitted with air brakes by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in Finland.|$|E
5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the <b>superstructures</b> were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E

5|$|She was reconstructed between 1931 and 1934 {{with new}} boilers, fire-control systems and greatly {{enlarged}} <b>superstructures.</b> During the Winter War she bombarded Finnish coastal artillery positions one time. Her anti-aircraft armament was greatly reinforced in early 1941, just before Operation Barbarossa. She provided gunfire support against the Germans during the Siege of Leningrad despite being bombed {{three times and}} under repair for a year. Retained on active duty after the war she became a training ship in 1954 before being struck off the Navy List in 1956 and slowly scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The architects in the Karnataka region seem to {{have been}} {{inspired}} by architectural developments in northern India. This is evidenced {{by the fact that they}} incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting <b>superstructures)</b> of the Sekhari and Bhumija types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.|$|E
5|$|General manager Kytölä {{travelled}} to France and West Germany in 1947 {{and early}} 1948 to buy military surplus {{materials from the}} Western Allies. He bought 425 White Motor Company M2 Half-Track vehicles, 186 lorry engines, 304 Cadillac V8 engines, 4 Mack ED diesel engines, 2 Hercules Diesel DFXE engines, 11,000 GMC wheels and one 45-tonne-capacity trailer. Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948. The White Half-Track vehicles were without armour; Kytölä's idea was to equip them with <b>superstructures</b> for field or forest clearing, or to convert them into Four-wheel drive lorries by replacing the tracks with a conventional rear axle. In total, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were converted into 4×4 or 4×2 vehicles. These lorries were sold as Vanaja VaWh. Some of the half-track vehicles were scrapped for parts; the last was sold in 1952.|$|E

40|$|<b>Superstructure</b> of a RO-RO ship {{plays an}} {{important}} role to allocate things inside the ship, for instance passengers, cars, goods and so on. <b>Superstructure</b> consists of transversal and longitudinal deck beam to support the structure. It is well known that the <b>superstructure</b> has significant contribution to the longitudinal strength. The investigation of the <b>superstructure</b> of a RO-RO ship particularly its influence to longitudinal strength is very limited. In addition, this influence is not clearly explained in the regulation for the structural strength under longitudinal bending. In conjunction with this, the influence of <b>superstructure</b> is therefore must be considered. To investigate the influence of <b>superstructure</b> on the longitudinal strength of RO-RO ship, the Smith???s method implemented into Beam-HULLST is applied and the formulation in Beam-HULLST is based on the thin-walled beam theory. As a simple calculation, the cross section of RO-RO ship is taken to be analyzed. The results obtained by Beam-HULLST with and without the <b>superstructure</b> are compared with one another for the investigation of the cross section???s progressive collapse behavior...|$|R
50|$|In Marxist theory, {{human society}} {{consists}} of two parts: the base (or substructure) and superstructure; the base comprises the forces and relations of production—employer-employee work conditions, the technical division of labour, and property relations—into which people enter to produce the necessities and amenities of life. These relations determine society’s other relationships and ideas, which are described as its <b>superstructure.</b> The <b>superstructure</b> of a society includes its culture, institutions, political power structures, roles, rituals, and state. The base determines (conditions) the <b>superstructure,</b> yet their relation is not strictly causal, because the <b>superstructure</b> often influences the base; {{the influence of the}} base, however, predominates. In Orthodox Marxism, the base determines the <b>superstructure</b> in a one-way relationship.|$|R
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The <b>superstructures</b> of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija <b>superstructures.</b> The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E
5|$|A {{site was}} first {{identified}} {{for the power}} plant in the 1970s when a study was carried {{out on the water}} resources of the Albors Mountains by the Belgian firm Traksionel. Several sites for dams were identified including Siah Bisheh as a potential place for a pumped-storage power plant. In 1975, a feasibility report on the Siah Bisheh project was submitted to the Ministry of Energy. The Albors Mountains study concluded in 1977 and geologic studies began in 1978 but were halted in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1983, Lahmeyer International was contracted to create designs for Phase II (underground excavation) which were completed in 1985, the same year construction on the dam's diversion tunnels began. Further designs for Phase I (<b>superstructures)</b> were developed and construction continued until 1992 when a lack of funding halted the project once again. Construction would not commence again until 2001. In 2002 and 2003, contracts for the dams and power plant were awarded and construction continued. The project was 90 percent complete as of April 2012. Both the upper and lower reservoir were complete and had finished impounding in January 2013. The first of four generators was commissioned in May 2013 and the remaining were operational by 1 September 2015.|$|E
50|$|In the Marxist {{economic}} base and <b>superstructure</b> model of society, base denotes {{the relations of}} production and modes of production, and <b>superstructure</b> denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The {{economic base}} of production determines the political <b>superstructure</b> of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the <b>superstructure</b> {{and the nature of}} the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a feudal mode of production, religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the <b>superstructure,</b> while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Kamikaze-class ships {{consisted of}} four [...] Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun {{forward of the}} <b>superstructure,</b> one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft <b>superstructure.</b> The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear.

5|$|Triadic pyramids first {{appeared}} in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three <b>superstructures</b> all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The Q'umarkaj example {{is the only one that}} has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.|$|E
