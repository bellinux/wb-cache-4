5|$|After the war, Tegetthoff {{was moved}} to Venice where she was shown as a war trophy by the Italians. During that time period, she starred in the movie Eroi di nostri mari which depicts the sinking of her sister <b>ship.</b> <b>From</b> 1924 to 1925, she was {{scrapped}} at La Spezia.|$|E
5|$|After the war, she {{was sold}} to the South African Navy and renamed Pietermaritzburg. The ship was later {{converted}} into a midshipmans' training ship during the early 1960s. She served as a barracks <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> 1968 to 1991 when Pietermaritzburg was listed for disposal. The ship was scuttled as an artificial reef off the South African coast in 1994.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> sinking on the reef.|$|E

The slaves were exchanged for goods from the Americas, destined for the slave plantations. <b>Ships</b> <b>from</b> the Americas would then take raw materials back to England.

5|$|In February and March 2011, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism {{sponsored}} {{a test of}} the route by shipping roof tiles to Europe via the Trans-Siberian. The tiles were transported by <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> Hamada, Shimane to Vladivostok, then by the railway to Moscow. The transit time was expected to be 30 days, in comparison with the 50 days on average it takes to ship cargo by <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> Hamada to ports in western Russia. If successful, the ministry would use the results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to utilize the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.|$|E

5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} {{also showed that}} {{restarting}} the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding.

5|$|After the Grand Fleet was {{dissolved}} in early 1919, Orion {{was transferred to}} back to the Home Fleet {{for a few months}} before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet.

A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
50|$|Convoy SC-104 was the 104th of the {{numbered}} {{series of}} World War II Slow Convoys of merchant <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Sydney, Cape Breton Island to Liverpool.

50|$|The Hellenic Navy {{used the}} Jason class ships to replace older American landing <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> the Second World War era.

5|$|In 1970, {{a sudden}} {{eruption}} in Beerenberg forced the immediate evacuation of the station. A Hercules was {{dispatched to the}} island and successfully landed on the strip. Thereafter the Hercules became the regular military aircraft at Jan Mayen. Aircraft gradually took over more of the transport to the island, and from 1973 all supplies except diesel and special freight was transported by <b>ship.</b> <b>From</b> 1975 the 333 Squadron would occasionally drop mail and supplies using the P-3 Orion {{as a supplement to}} the landings of the Hercules.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909, at the {{launching}} ceremony for Danton, socialist activists prevented the <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> leaving the stocks. The ship was eventually launched on 4 July 1909. A week {{after she was}} completed, she {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom in honour of the Coronation of George V in 1911. Upon her return to France, Danton was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, along with her sister ships and the two powerful dreadnoughts Courbet and Jean Bart. In 1913, while off Hyères in the Mediterranean, Danton suffered an explosion in one of her gun turrets, which killed three men and injured several others.|$|E
