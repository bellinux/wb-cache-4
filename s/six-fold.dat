5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have <b>six-fold</b> symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their <b>six-fold</b> symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
5|$|The polyps of {{stony corals}} have <b>six-fold</b> {{symmetry}} while those of soft corals have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In stony corals these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules. In some tropical species these are reduced to mere stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle-like appearance. In most corals, the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both stony and soft corals can be zooxanthellate, the corals supplementing their plankton diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts. The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts.|$|E
25|$|The {{hexagonal}} crystal family is also {{split into two}} crystal systems – the trigonal, which has a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, which has a <b>six-fold</b> axis of symmetry.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to TCE {{was reported to}} correlate with development of symptoms of Parkinson's Disease in three laboratory workers. A retrospective twin study of pairs discordant for Parkinson's showed a <b>six-fold</b> increase in Parkinson's risk associated with TCE workplace exposure.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphism {{can extend}} beyond pure {{symmetry}} content. The aluminosilicates are {{a group of}} three minerals – kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in <b>six-fold</b> coordination by oxygen; the silicon, as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like stishovite (SiO2, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure). In kyanite, the second aluminium is in <b>six-fold</b> coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as AlAlSiO5, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5).|$|E
25|$|Each {{face of the}} {{construction}} becomes a Sierpinski carpet, and {{the intersection of the}} sponge with any diagonal of the cube or any midline of the faces is a Cantor set. The cross section of the sponge through its centroid and perpendicular to a space diagonal is a regular hexagon punctured with hexagrams arranged in <b>six-fold</b> symmetry.|$|E
25|$|The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al2SiO5 – are {{structurally}} {{composed of}} one 4− tetrahedron, and one Al3+ in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al3+ {{can be in}} <b>six-fold</b> coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, Mn2SiO4. The garnet group has a general formula of X3Y2(SiO4)3, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller <b>six-fold</b> coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al3+ in the Y position: pyrope (Mg3Al2(SiO4)3), almandine (Fe3Al2(SiO4)3), and spessartine (Mn3Al2(SiO4)3). The ugrandite garnets have Ca2+ in the X position: uvarovite (Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3), grossular (Ca3Al2(SiO4)3) and andradite (Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.|$|E
25|$|Deficits tend to {{aggravate}} with time, {{developing in}} many cases into dementia. A person with PD has a <b>six-fold</b> increased risk of suffering it, and the overall rate in people with the disease is around 30%. Moreover, prevalence of dementia increases in relation to disease duration, going up to 80%. Dementia {{has been associated with}} a reduced quality of life in disease sufferers and caregivers, increased mortality, and a higher probability of moving to a nursing home.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS. BV is associated with up to a <b>six-fold</b> increase in HIV shedding. There is also a correlation between the absence of vaginal lactobacilli and infection by Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis. BV is {{a risk factor for}} viral shedding and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. BV may increase the risk of infection with or reactivation of human papillomavirus (HPV).|$|E
25|$|One {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} vancomycin involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, D-alanyl-D-alanine, to which vancomycin binds. The D-alanyl-D-lactate variation results {{in the loss of}} one hydrogen-bonding interaction (4, as opposed to 5 for D-alanyl-D-alanine) possible between vancomycin and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity. The D-alanyl-D-serine variation causes a <b>six-fold</b> loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{developing}} IBS increases <b>six-fold</b> after acute gastrointestinal infection. Postinfection, further risk factors are young age, prolonged fever, anxiety, and depression. Psychological factors, such as depression or anxiety, have not been shown to cause or influence the onset of IBS, but {{may play a role}} in the persistence and perceived severity of symptoms. Nevertheless, they may worsen IBS symptoms and the patient quality of life. Antibiotic use also appears to increase the risk {{of developing}} IBS. Research has found that genetic defects in innate immunity and epithelial homeostasis increase the {{risk of developing}} both post-infectious as well as other forms of IBS.|$|E
25|$|Every year, {{thousands}} {{of cases of}} the plague are still reported to the World Health Organization, although, with proper treatment, the prognosis for victims is now much better. A five- to <b>six-fold</b> increase in cases occurred in Asia {{during the time of}} the Vietnam War, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. The Plague is now commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas which now account for over 95% of reported cases. The plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals. In the United States, mammals such as the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered black-footed ferret are under threat.|$|E
25|$|Qantas and Emirates {{began their}} {{alliance}} on 31 March 2013, {{in which their}} combined carriers offered 98 flights per week to Dubai, that saw bookings up <b>six-fold.</b> To accommodate Muslim sensitivities, the airline stopped serving pork on flights bound to/from Europe, which provoked a backlash on social media. In September that year, following the announcement the carrier expected an A$250million(million) net loss for the half-year period that ended on 31 December and the implementation of cost-cutting measures that would see the cut of 1,000 jobs within a year, S downgraded Qantas credit from BBB- (the lowest investment grade) to BB+, which may imply a rise in borrowing costs and a limitation in the investment potential. Moody's applied a similar downgrading a month later.|$|E
25|$|Phyllosilicates {{consist of}} sheets of {{polymerized}} tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important {{examples include the}} mica, chlorite, and the kaolinite-serpentine groups. The sheets are weakly bound by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates. In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in <b>six-fold</b> coordination by oxygen) that balanced out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. 4−) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked {{in a variety of}} combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{operations}} can {{be grouped}} into five major categories {{in terms of}} their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains {{one of the largest in}} terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased <b>six-fold</b> from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.|$|E
25|$|Coordination polyhedra are {{geometric}} representation {{of how a}} cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si4+ surrounded by four O2−. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: {{in the case of}} the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where compound is compressed such that silicon is in <b>six-fold</b> (octahedral) coordination by oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination number because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers between leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure such as in the mantle, many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and garnet will change to a perovskite structure, where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Another example are the aluminosilicates kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite (polymorphs, as they share the formula Al2SiO5), which differ by the coordination number of the Al3+; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature. In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.|$|E
500|$|A non-aggregated {{snowflake}} often exhibits <b>six-fold</b> radial symmetry. The initial symmetry {{can occur}} because the crystalline structure of ice is <b>six-fold.</b> The six [...] "arms" [...] of the snowflake, or dendrites, then grow independently, and {{each side of}} each arm grows independently. Most snowflakes are not completely symmetric. The micro-environment in which the snowflake grows changes dynamically as the snowflake falls through the cloud, and tiny changes in temperature and humidity affect {{the way in which}} water molecules attach to the snowflake. Since the micro-environment (and its changes) are very nearly identical around the snowflake, each arm can grow in nearly the same way. However, being in the same micro-environment does not guarantee that each arm grow the same; indeed, for some crystal forms it does not because the underlying crystal growth mechanism also affects how fast each surface region of a crystal grows. [...] Empirical studies suggest less than 0.1% of snowflakes exhibit the ideal <b>six-fold</b> symmetric shape. Very occasionally twelve branched snowflakes are observed; they maintain the <b>six-fold</b> symmetry.|$|E
500|$|Panjwai is {{the birthplace}} of the Taliban {{movement}} and has traditionally been a stronghold of the Taliban. It has been an area of heavy fighting and was the focus of a [...] in 2010, which brought a more than two-fold increase in airstrikes, night raids into Afghan homes, insurgent casualties, and a <b>six-fold</b> increase in special forces operations throughout Afghanistan. Fighting in Panjwai and adjacent Zhari, Arghandab and Kandahar districts was particularly intense. Conflict between the civilian population and U.S. forces was exacerbated by the wholesale destruction of some villages by U.S. forces, mass arrests, murder of civilians by rogue units, and high casualties from improvised explosive devices (IEDs).|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis is classed {{as being}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List. The {{population}} consists of 150,000 mature adults, and is stable, although some populations have unknown trends. A partial survey of under 50% of the North American population published in 2007 found an almost <b>six-fold</b> {{increase in the}} last four decades. The estimated breeding range is huge, at [...] Fluctuating breeding populations and high mobility of colonies make estimating the population difficult. Attempted censuses of breeding colonies across Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and the Carolinas yielded a count of 166,000 breeding birds in 2001, and 209,000 in 2004. The conservation status has been listed in two states—it is a Species of Special Concern in Florida, and a species of Moderate Conservation Concern in Alabama. The preservation of colony sites and freshwater foraging areas is important to maintaining populations; however, the highly mobile nature of breeding colonies makes this challenging.|$|E
500|$|All Hope Is Gone is {{the fourth}} studio album by American metal band Slipknot. Released on August 20, 2008 by Roadrunner Records, the album was {{published}} in two versions: the standard album in a CD case and a special edition packaged in a <b>six-fold</b> digipak containing three bonus tracks, a 40page booklet, and a bonus DVD with a documentary of the album's recording. Preparation for the album began in 2007, while recording started in February 2008 in the band's home state of Iowa. Before the album's launch, Slipknot released a series of promotional images and audio samples from the album through various websites. All Hope Is Gone is considered the band's most eclectic-sounding album, incorporating elements from their previous three. The album shows Slipknot completely abandoning the nu metal genre, moving to a groove metal style. Songs such as the opening track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] and the title track espouse the band's more brutal, death metal-influenced edge, reminiscent of songs such as [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut self-titled album; slow burning, [...] "trippy" [...] elements such as [...] "Gehenna", reminiscent of [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from their second album Iowa; and more tragic, sentimental tracks such as [...] "Dead Memories" [...] and [...] "Snuff".|$|E
500|$|Planning of the Fleet line {{continued}} and parliamentary approval {{was given in}} July 1969 for {{the first phase of}} the line, from Baker Street to Charing Cross. Tunnelling began on the £35million route in February 1972 and the Jubilee line opened north from Charing Cross in May 1979. The tunnels of the approved section continued east of Charing Cross under Strand almost as far as Aldwych station, but no work at Aldwych was undertaken and they were used only as sidings. Funding for the second phase of the work was delayed throughout the 1970s whilst the route beyond Charing Cross was reviewed to consider options for serving anticipated development in the London Docklands area. By 1979, the cost was estimated as £325million, a <b>six-fold</b> increase from the £51million estimated in 1970. A further review of alternatives for the Jubilee line was carried out in 1980, which led to a change of priorities and the postponement of any further effort on the line. When the extension was eventually constructed in the late 1990s it took a different route, south of the River Thames via , [...] and [...] to provide a rapid link to , leaving the tunnels between [...] and Aldwych redundant.|$|E

2500|$|The base of unit of a {{silicate}} mineral is the 4− tetrahedron. In {{the vast}} majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen. In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be <b>six-fold</b> or octahedral coordination, such as in the perovskite structure or the quartz polymorph stishovite (SiO2). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of rutile (TiO2), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si4+ to be substituted by [...] Al3+ because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those case, the 5− tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different.|$|E
2500|$|In 1830, Hessel proved that, as a {{consequence}} of Haüy’s , morphological forms can combine to give exactly 32 kinds of crystal symmetry in Euclidean space, since only two-, three-, four-, and <b>six-fold</b> rotation axes can occur. [...] A crystal form here denotes a set of symmetrically equivalent planes with Miller indices enclosed in braces, {hkl}; form does not mean [...] "shape". [...] For example, a cube-shaped crystal of fluorite (referred to as Flussspath by Hessel) has six equivalent faces. [...] The entire set is denoted as {100}. [...] The indices for each of the individual six faces are enclosed by parentheses and these are designated: (010), (001), (100), (010), (001), and (100). [...] The cube belongs to the isometric or tessular class, as do an octahedron and tetrahedron. [...] The essential symmetry elements of the isometric class is the existence of a set of three 4-fold, four 3-fold, and six 2-fold rotation axes. [...] In the earlier classification schemes by the German mineralogists Christian Samuel Weiss (1780 - 1856) and Friedrich Mohs (1773 - 1839) the isometric class had been designated sphäroedrisch (spheroidal) and tessularisch (tesseral), respectively.
