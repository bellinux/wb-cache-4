5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared <b>subgrade</b> and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E

30|$|The paper {{presented}} a simple approach {{to calculate the}} depth of and the placement of steel reinforcement for an isolated square footing under concentric loading. Observations were limited to square footings and columns with concentric loading. The working stress method (WSM) and the limit state method (LSM) failed to fulfill the rigidity requirements for a footing {{in the absence of}} sufficient width. The proposed procedure for calculating depth can be used in any case, because it gives a more conservative depth for lower <b>subgrades</b> and smaller depth for higher <b>subgrades</b> when compared to the existing methods. Depth calculated using the new approach agreed well with finite-element method (FEM), and also it satisfied the criterion for development length in compression (Ldc) for lower <b>subgrades.</b> For higher <b>subgrades,</b> depth should be calculated using the maximum of the LSM, the new approach, or minimum reinforcement approach. Reynolds’s handbook approach should not be used for higher <b>subgrades,</b> because it results in a lower depth than FEM. For the calculation of rigid depth, the total moment should be considered, which could be calculated by the conventional method or by Reynolds’s handbook equations.|$|R

40|$|Rutting is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} encountered in flexible pavements supported by weak <b>subgrades.</b> Reinforcing the weak <b>subgrades</b> {{is one of the}} promising alternatives to alleviate the pavement surface rutting. This paper presents the results of laboratory model tests on a circular plate supported by geocell reinforced sand <b>subgrades.</b> A series of tests were carried out by varying the height of the geocell mattress with an additional layer of basal geogrid placed underneath the geocell mattress. The surface settlements (rutting) were measured through displacement gauges. Strain gauges were placed along the width of the basal geogrid to verify their performance as a base layer. A substantial reduction in surface rutting is observed in the case of geocell reinforced beds with basal geogrids. A seven fold improvement in bearing capacity was obtained with the provision of an additional geogrid layer over unreinforced <b>subgrades.</b> Overall, a basal geogrid layer provides higher structural support mobilized through membrane effect to the geocell reinforced pavement layer...|$|R

The Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) has used hydrated lime for over 30 years to stabilize <b>subgrades.</b> In 1998 a project was initiated to assess material properties and performance derived from lime treated <b>subgrades</b> (LTS). This thesis describes some pertinent findings of the study. In situ properties of lime stabilized <b>subgrades</b> are identified based on Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) deflection measurements, Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) profiles, and Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) logs. The in situ properties are compared to laboratory strength and resilient modulus test results for the same materials to establish reliable design resilient and strength properties for these stabilized layers. A laboratory mixture design and testing protocol is presented for lime stabilized <b>subgrades.</b> Comparison of field test data and laboratory test data shows that laboratory design test properties were achieved in the field. These properties are used in a mechanistic analysis to assess the effectiveness of the lime stabilized <b>subgrades</b> in Mississippi.

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining {{to restore the}} desired track geometry and smoothness of vehicle running. Weakness of the <b>subgrade</b> and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a resilient pad).|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{ties are}} cheaper {{and easier to}} obtain than timber and better able to carry higher axle-weights and sustain higher speeds. Their greater weight ensures {{improved}} retention of track geometry, especially when installed with continuous-welded rail. Concrete ties have a longer service life and require less maintenance than timber due to their greater weight, which helps them remain in the correct position longer. Concrete ties need to be installed on a well-prepared <b>subgrade</b> with an adequate depth on free-draining ballast to perform well. Concrete ties amplify wheel noise, so wooden ties are often used in densely populated areas.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{strength}} provided by concrete pavements, uniformity trumps strength for <b>subgrades</b> and subbases. The primary objective for building a roadbed or foundation for concrete pavement is to obtain a condition of uniform support for the pavement that will prevail throughout its service life. This mindset is somewhat contrary to the traditional thought that thickness and/or strength are the key objectives for building a long-lasting roadbed. The reasoning for this change in mindset is {{a better understanding of how}} concrete pavements distribute loads and what this means for the <b>subgrades</b> and/or subbases below them. This publication details how uniformity is more important than strength for <b>subgrades</b> and subbases used in concrete pavement structures, what this means in regards to design and construction, how to obtain a uniform support condition, and the importance of long-lasting uniformity. More on these topics is available in ACPA’s EB 204 P, “Subgrades and Subbases for Concrete Pavements. ” Strength versus Uniformity Paving concrete typically has a specified 28 -day flexural strength ranging from 550 to 750 psi (3. 8 to 5. 2 MPa), or greater, and a modulus of elasticity ranging from 4 to 6 million psi (28, 000 to 41, 000 MPa), helping provide a high degree of rigidity.

2500|$|Asphalt (specifically, asphalt concrete), {{sometimes}} called flexible pavement {{due to the}} nature in which it distributes loads, has been widely used since the 1920s. The viscous nature of the bitumen binder allows asphalt concrete to sustain significant plastic deformation, although fatigue from repeated loading over time is the most common failure mechanism. [...] Most asphalt surfaces are laid on a gravel base, which is generally at least as thick as the asphalt layer, although some 'full depth' asphalt surfaces are laid directly on the native <b>subgrade.</b> [...] In areas with very soft or expansive subgrades such as clay or peat, thick gravel bases or stabilization of the <b>subgrade</b> with Portland cement or lime may be required.

30|$|Footing is an {{important}} part of a structure, because its repair is extremely difficult and cumbersome. Therefore, all structural parameters should be carefully considered when designing a footing. An isolated footing needs sufficient depth, when considering the fixed base assumption. Extensive research has previously been conducted to define and formalize the depth of a rigid footing, i.e., the depth required, such that footing behaves as a rigid. Alternatively, working stress method (WSM) and limit state method (LSM) provide a lower depth for low <b>subgrades</b> and a higher depth for high <b>subgrades</b> than that required by rigid condition if a unit width footing is considered for the design. This paper presents a simple approach for calculating the depth to meet the rigid condition under static loading. The proposed calculation method produced a better rigidity than the existing approaches and it correlated well to the finite-element method (FEM) for low <b>subgrades.</b> The reinforcement distribution is function of the bending moment (BM). Steel is uniformly embedded throughout the length or width of conventional footing methods, but this is inappropriate, because the bending moment is not uniform along the length or width of the footing. This paper proposes solutions to this by redefining the placement of steel in the central zone of the footing. The effective zone for reinforcement was based on the FEM results. This simple procedure was developed for calculating the maximum moment using the Diagonal Strip Method (DSM). DSM is a substitute for FEM, and it has been shown to correlate well. The BM at central zone as well as at the edges can be calculated to define the spacing of the reinforcements.|$|R
2500|$|Distress and {{serviceability}} loss {{on concrete}} roads {{can be caused}} by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs.

Slab stabilization is a non-destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] methods including patching and diamond grinding. The technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints, cracks or the pavement edge.|$|E
