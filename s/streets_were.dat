5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began {{to lay out the}} city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). <b>Streets</b> <b>were</b> laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton {{has very}} broad and {{straight}} downtown streets (generally {{two or three}} full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning; <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. In addition, some of today's <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.|$|E

50|$|Indian {{independence}} saw {{a rush to}} rename streets. The {{process has}} slowed down as few <b>streets</b> <b>are</b> left to be renamed. Chowringhee Road was renamed after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Park <b>Street</b> <b>was</b> renamed after Mother Teresa. Theatre Road was renamed after William Shakespeare.

5|$|A {{second phase}} {{to convert the}} {{remaining}} section of freeway of Tower Bridge Gateway to a city street began in 2010. The 3rd Street underpass and subsequent interchange was removed and signalized intersections at 5th and 3rd <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> created. The project was completed in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando II died on 23 May 1670 of {{apoplexy}} and dropsy and was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medicean necropolis. At {{the time}} of his death, the population of the grand duchy was 720,594 souls; the <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> lined with grass and the buildings {{on the verge of collapse}} in Pisa, while Siena was virtually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February24, a house caught fire and the flames were spread to other {{buildings}} by the wind. In two hours, most of Holmden Street, and parts of Brown and Second <b>Streets,</b> <b>were</b> reduced to smoldering ashes.

50|$|As St. Paul <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> mostly one-way southbound, Calvert <b>Street,</b> which <b>is</b> {{directly}} east of St. Paul, {{is open to}} northbound traffic. North Calvert <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> a name of {{a portion}} of the street. South Calvert <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> a name for the downtown portion.|$|R
30|$|The second {{observed}} parameter is {{the average}} driving velocity of vehicles. The data was collected from a total of 40 vehicles that crossed intersection. Ten vehicles from each <b>street</b> <b>were</b> sampled, and their velocity data was collected. The average velocity is determined by arithmetic mean of the whole data from start {{to the end of}} travelling. From the data, the average velocity of vehicles on the North <b>street</b> <b>is</b> 82.9  km/h, on East <b>street</b> <b>is</b> 82.3  km/h, on West <b>street</b> <b>is</b> 76.4  km/h, and on the South <b>street</b> <b>is</b> 85.6  km/h. Then, the average velocity for crossing the intersection with four incoming <b>streets</b> <b>is</b> equal to average of the average velocity of each <b>street,</b> which <b>is</b> 81.8  km/h.|$|R

5|$|The {{street is}} a square on the British Monopoly game board, forming {{part of the}} green set ({{together}} with Regent Street and Bond Street). The three <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> grouped together as they are all primarily retail areas.

5|$|A grand {{funeral was}} held for the Prince Imperial two days after his death. The <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> crowded with {{ordinary}} people who greatly mourned the prince's death. So remarkable was the event that tourists paid {{for the privilege of}} watching the funeral procession from a hotel in downtown Rio de Janeiro. Pedro Afonso was buried in the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
25|$|Due to this {{planning}} a modern city with tall offices, apartment buildings, broad boulevards and busy shops is present. Principal thoroughfares are the Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa <b>Street.</b> Abu Dhabi <b>is</b> {{known in the}} region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design {{of the inner city}} roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal <b>streets</b> <b>are</b> oddly numbered, while all vertical <b>streets</b> <b>are</b> evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche <b>is</b> <b>Street</b> #1, Khalifa <b>is</b> <b>Street</b> #3, Hamdan <b>is</b> <b>Street</b> #5, Electra <b>street</b> <b>is</b> <b>Street</b> #7 and so on. Conversely, Salam <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> St #8.|$|R

5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000people were housed in shelters, {{many of whom}} remembered Hurricane Iwa 10years prior. Because schools were canceled, traffic was light during the evacuation, and <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> clear by mid-morning. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage.|$|E
5|$|Country estates {{had been}} built in the area as early as the 1830s, and some of Louisville's great early mansions, {{predominantly}} in the Italianate style, were built along Broadway, very near Old Louisville, before the Civil War. Development from 1850 to 1870 occurred between Broadway and Kentucky Street, the northern extreme of what came to be called Old Louisville. North-south city <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> extended throughout the area in the 1850s, and a mulecar line was extended down Fourth to Oak in 1865.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{flags and}} other symbols were confiscated. The {{war on the}} Polish {{language}} included the tearing down of signs in Polish and the banning of Polish speech in public places. Persons who spoke Polish in the <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> often insulted and even physically assaulted. The Germanization of place names prevailed. Many treasures of Polish culture – including memorials, plaques and monuments to national heroes (e.g., Kraków's Adam Mickiewicz monument) – were destroyed. In Toruń, all Polish monuments and plaques were torn down. Dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout Poland. The Nazis planned to level entire cities.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E
5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon that section of route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion.
