25|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} Syrah {{are also used}} in the {{production}} of other wine styles, such as rosé wine, fortified wine in Port wine style, and sparkling red wine. While Australian sparkling Shiraz traditionally have had some sweetness, a number of Australian winemakers also make a full-bodied sparkling dry Shiraz, that contains the complexity and sometimes earthy notes that are normally found in <b>still</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{sparkling}} wine {{was invented in}} the Limoux area of Languedoc in 1535, the wine we know today as Champagne was first produced in the French region {{of the same name}} around 1700. For centuries prior to this, <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> from the region had been served as part of coronation festivities throughout Europe, and the French aristocracy had offered it in tribute to foreign kings, associations with celebration and occasion which survive to the present day.|$|E

25|$|The Alella DO {{is located}} {{near the city of}} Barcelona and was awarded DO status in 1956. The area is known mainly for its white wine {{production}} which can range from oak aged sweet wine to cool fermented dry wines. The principal grape of the area is the Pansa blanca, a local name for the Xarel·lo grape. There are some plantings of the international varieties Chardonnay and Chenin blanc, used in both <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> and Cava production.|$|E

25|$|The viticultural and {{winemaking}} {{practices of}} making sparkling wine have many similarities {{to the production}} of <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> with some noted divergence. At the vineyard, grapes are harvested early when there is still high acid levels. In areas like Australia, winemakers aim to harvest the grapes at 17 to 20° brix. Unlike <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> production, high sugar levels are not ideal and grapes destined for sparkling wine production may be harvested at higher yields. Care is taken to avoid tannins and other phenolic compounds with many premium producers still choosing to harvest by hand rather than risk mechanical harvesting which may split the berries and encourage maceration between the skins and juice. The press house is often close by the vineyard to where the grapes can be quickly pressed and separated from their skins. Red wine grapes like Pinot noir can be used in the production of white sparkling wines because their juice is initially clear and is only later tinted red through exposure to the color pigments in grape skins. While some skin exposure may be desirable in the production of rosé sparkling wines and some blanc de noirs (white of blacks), most sparkling wine producers take extended precautions to limit the amount of skin contact.|$|E
50|$|With the {{creation}} of the DOCG Franciacorta, the former DOC was renamed Terre di Franciacorta for the <b>still</b> <b>wines</b> and then in 2008, Curtefranca.The renaming was a legal requirement to avoid confusion between the DOC <b>still</b> <b>wines</b> and the DOCG sparkling wines. These are made in two types: a Burgundy-style Bianco based either on Chardonnay or Pinot bianco or a blend of both, and a Bordeaux-style Rosso based on either Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon or both, and Merlot, with smaller amounts of Nebbiolo and Barbera. Pinot noir is permitted only in the DOCG sparkling wines, with no option of a Burgundian-style <b>still</b> red <b>wine</b> under the DOC rules.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} Champagne {{has seen the}} wine evolve from being a pale, pinkish <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> to the {{sparkling}} wine now associated with the region. The Romans {{were the first to}} plant vineyards in this area of northeast France, with the region being cultivated by at least the 5th century, possibly earlier. When Hugh Capet was crowned King of France in 987 at the cathedral of Reims, located {{in the heart of the}} region, he started a tradition that brought successive monarchs to the region—with the local wine being on prominent display at the coronation banquets. The early wine of the Champagne region was a pale, pinkish wine made from Pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|Anjou Pétillant AOC Wines labeled {{under this}} {{designation}} are semi-sparkling (similar to the Italian wine frizzante) {{and sold in}} regular <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> bottles and corks rather than Champagne bottles. These wines are aged in the bottle {{for a minimum of}} 9 months before release and can range in sweetness levels from dry to medium sweet. The white wines produced under this style must be composed of a minimum 80% Chenin blanc with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc responsible for the remaining 20%. A semi-sparkling rosé style may be produced under the Rosé d'Anjou Pétillant AOC designation and be composed of predominantly Grolleau with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis also permitted.|$|E
25|$|The Anderson Valley {{is one of}} California's coolest {{wine growing}} regions in the state being deeply {{influenced}} by the cool Pacific fog coming in off the coast. Early plantings of Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Noir in the 1960s and 1970s {{led to the formation}} of a handful of wineries by 1980. The potential for sparkling wine production became apparent in the 1980s when Champagne house Louis Roederer selected Anderson Valley for its California operation Roederer Estate. The Champagne firm scouted California extensively for years trying to find a region with the most climatic similarities to the Champagne region of France. Pinot Noir - grown for both sparkeling and <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> production - is the dominant varietal for the region. A 2015 vineyard census determined that 87 of 91 vineyard properties in the region grow Pinot Noir.|$|E

25|$|Vouvrays {{are known}} for their {{longevity}} and aging potential, particularly if the vintage was favorable. Some wines, most notably the sweeter Moelleux styles, have the potential to age and develop in the bottle for several decades to a century. While modern producers are contributing to making examples more approachable to drink while young, some premium examples still made in the traditionally high acid style will often need 3 to 7 years of bottle age before the acidity tones down. Dry or Sec examples from favorable vintages can have the potential to age for 15–20 years or more but many are ready to drink within 4 or 5 years after vintage. Sparkling Vouvrays tend not to have the same aging potential as their <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> counterparts or vintage dated Champagne and are usually meant to be consumed within 3 years of vintage or, for non-vintage bottling, soon after purchase.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{grapes of}} the Côte Chalonnaise {{are the same}} major grapes found throughout Burgundy [...] Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Additionally there is significant plantings of Aligoté around the town of Bouzeron. Other minor grapes of the region include Gamay, Melon de Bourgogne, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris (known locally as Pinot Beurot). The Gamay that is grown here is often blended with lower quality Pinot noir to make Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains. In addition to <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> production, a sizable amount of sparkling wine is also produced. The wines of the Côte Chalonnaise are often very fruit-forward in their youth. The white wines of the region are characterized by their toasty, smokey notes due to fermentation in oak barrels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tendency}} of <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> from the Champagne region to lightly sparkle was {{noted in the}} Middle Ages but this was considered a wine fault and was disdained in early Champagne winemaking although it made the pride of other historic sparkling wine production areas like Limoux. Dom Pérignon was originally charged by his superiors at the Abbey of Hautvillers {{to get rid of}} the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar. Later, when deliberate sparkling wine production increased in the early 18th century, cellar workers would still have to wear a heavy iron mask that resembled a baseball catcher's mask to prevent injury from spontaneously bursting bottles. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The mysterious circumstance surrounding the then unknown process of fermentation and carbonic gas caused some critics to call the sparkling creations [...] "The Devil's Wine".|$|E
2500|$|Through their {{extensive}} holdings, the monasteries of the Christian Church {{made many}} advances in French winemaking and viticulture {{with the study}} and observation of key vineyards sites, identifying the grape varieties that grew best in certain regions and discovering new methods of production. In 1531 it was a monk in the Languedoc region of Limoux that discovered the process of turning <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> into sparkling wine. Though the widespread tale of Dom Pérignon [...] "inventing" [...] the sparkling wine known as Champagne is inaccurate, the Benedictine monk nonetheless made several important contributions {{to the history of}} French wine. In 1668, Brother Pierre Perignon was appointed treasurer of the abbey of Hautvillers, located north of Épernay with his role including management of the abbey's vineyard holdings and the collection of tithes from the community in the form of grapes and wines. Dom Perignon took the wine from all these sources and blended them to produce a wine that fetched far higher prices than wines from other parts of Champagne. Perignon's practice of blending from several different vineyards was unique and largely unheard of till then. He also pioneered the practice of severe pruning in the vineyard to keep yields low.|$|E
50|$|Verdicchio is the {{principal}} grape behind two Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines produced in the provinces of Macerata and Ancona, Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi. In addition to producing <b>still</b> <b>wines,</b> Verdicchio grapes are also used to make sparkling wine and straw wine.|$|R
50|$|The champagnes rest on lees in the cellars {{for years}} before disgorgement. Armand de Brignac uses a unique dosage that {{comprises}} the best <b>still</b> <b>wines</b> aged for one year in French oak barrels.

50|$|Local lore {{suggests}} that Dom Pérignon {{learned how to}} produce sparkling white wine while serving in this Abbey {{before moving to the}} Champagne region and popularizing the drink, but this is almost certain to be false since Dom Pérignon was involved with improving Champagne's <b>still</b> <b>wines,</b> and not the sparkling ones.|$|R
2500|$|In the Champagne, Chardonnay is one {{of three}} major grape {{varieties}} planted in the region. It is most commonly found in the Aube and Marne départments which, combined with Chablis, accounted {{for more than half of}} all plantings of Chardonnay in France during the 20th century. In the Côte des Blancs (white slope) district of the Marne, Chardonnay thrives on the chalk soil. The three main villages around the Côte grow Chardonnay that emphasizes certain characteristics that the Champagne producers seek depending on their house style. The village of Avize grows grapes that produce the lightest wines, Cramant makes the most aromatic, and Mesnil produces wines with the most acidity. The Côte des Blancs is the only district in the Champagne region [...] predominately planted with Chardonnay. In the four other main districts-Aube, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne-Chardonnay lags behind Pinot noir in planting. In the outlying region of Aisne, only Pinot Meunier has a significant presence. Despite being less planted, the Blanc de Blancs style of Champagne (made from only Chardonnay grapes) is far more commonly produced than Blanc de Noirs. This is partly because Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier produce very coarse and heavy wines that lack the finesse and balance that Chardonnay brings to the mix. Nonsparkling <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> Chardonnay is produced under the Coteaux Champenois AOC. The wine is much more acidic than that of Chablis and is normally made bone-dry.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{production}} of [...] "non-vintage" [...] Champagne, {{a certain amount of}} aged <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> is used for blending with <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> of the youngest vintage, before this blended base wine undergoes second fermentation in bottle to become sparkling Champagne. This aged <b>still</b> <b>wine</b> is called reserve wine, and this practice is meant to ensure that a certain Champagne house's non-vintage product has a consistent style over the years. Since the reserve wine is used in {{the production}} process, it is never bottled and sold as it is, but the proportion and age of the reserve wine is often seen as one of the indicators of the quality of a Champagne and the producer's level of ambition.|$|E
