25|$|For some people, sensations {{from the}} {{previous}} night's dreams are sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep. However they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall. At least 95% of all dreams are not remembered. Certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during REM sleep. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, {{the content of the}} dream is not remembered. Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall. Using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography (EMG), researchers have been able to record basic dream imagery, dream <b>speech</b> <b>activity</b> and dream motor behavior (such as walking and hand movements).|$|E

50|$|Bell’s {{analysis}} of the newsreaders’ speech revealed that they spoke differently based on the intended radio audience. He identified relationships {{in the frequency of}} sociolinguistic variables, such as postvocalic t, which corresponded to the speech of the radio audiences. Bell proposed that because the topic of speech (identical news topics), speaker, and <b>speech</b> <b>activity</b> were the same, the most plausible way of accounting for the variation was that the newscasters were attuning their speech to what they perceived to be the norms for the respective radio audiences.|$|E
50|$|Voice {{activity}} detection (VAD), {{also known}} as <b>speech</b> <b>activity</b> detection or speech detection, is a technique used in speech processing in which {{the presence or absence}} of human speech is detected. The main uses of VAD are in speech coding and speech recognition. It can facilitate speech processing, and can also be used to deactivate some processes during non-speech section of an audio session: it can avoid unnecessary coding/transmission of silence packets in Voice over Internet Protocol applications, saving on computation and on network bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|Just {{as there}} are {{differences}} of compliment responses among separate cultures, there are also differences among men and women within the same culture. American women tend to give and receive more compliments than men do. The idea that women's <b>speech</b> <b>activity</b> works much differently {{compared to that of}} men can be observed through compliment responses, as women often work at creating and reaffirming solidarity with compliment response strategies. Wolfson found that elaborate responses to compliments among women occur between intimate, status-unequal, and status-equal acquaintances, and that a majority of elaborate responses occurred between status-equal women.|$|E

50|$|Beyond phonology, Shcherba made {{significant}} contributions to the wider fields of linguistics and lexicography. In contrast to Ferdinand de Saussure, he recognized three rather than two objects of study: <b>speech</b> <b>activity,</b> language systems, and language material. He placed emphasis {{on the question of the}} capacity of the speaker to produce sentences never previously heard, a question which would become important to the linguistics of the later twentieth century. He also emphasized the importance of experiments in linguistics, particularly that of negative results, developing methods which became important for field study. He was the teacher of the lexicographer Sergei Ozhegov, author of the most widely used Russian dictionary.|$|E

50|$|For a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} such as digital mobile radio, Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data (DSVD) or speech storage, it is desirable to provide a discontinuous transmission of speech-coding parameters. Advantages can include lower average power consumption in mobile handsets, higher average bit rate for simultaneous services like data transmission, or a higher capacity on storage chips. However, the improvement depends mainly on the percentage of pauses during speech and the reliability of the VAD used to detect these intervals. On the one hand, it is advantageous to have a low percentage of <b>speech</b> <b>activity.</b> On the other hand clipping, that is the loss of milliseconds of active speech, should be minimized to preserve quality. This is the crucial problem for a VAD algorithm under heavy noise conditions.|$|E
