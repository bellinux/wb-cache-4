5|$|Later, von Neumann {{suggested}} a new method of linear programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between <b>simplices,</b> with the pivoting decision {{determined by a}} nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.|$|E
25|$|Diagrams can {{be labeled}} by their graph structure. The first forms studied by Ludwig Schläfli are the orthoschemes which have linear graphs that {{generate}} regular polytopes and regular honeycombs. Plagioschemes are <b>simplices</b> represented by branching graphs, and cycloschemes are <b>simplices</b> represented by cyclic graphs.|$|E
25|$|In {{algebraic}} topology, <b>simplices</b> {{are used}} as building blocks to construct an interesting class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes. These spaces are built from <b>simplices</b> glued together in a combinatorial fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define {{a certain kind of}} homology called simplicial homology.|$|E

She looked straight beyond; {{not at the}} closed door. Like one rehearsing a part she began to speak. Father Barry's head sank forward into his hands. The nun's story fell gently, mercifully softened. As she went on the priest raised his eyes. Sister <b>Simplice</b> dreaded the question burning on his lips.|$|R

25|$|The {{name of the}} {{algorithm}} {{is derived from the}} concept of a simplex and was suggested by T. S. Motzkin. <b>Simplices</b> are not actually used in the method, but one interpretation of it is that it operates on simplicial cones, and these become proper <b>simplices</b> with an additional constraint.|$|E

25|$|The orbispace {{associated}} to an orbihedron has a canonical metric structure, coming locally from the length metric {{in the standard}} geometric realization in Euclidean space, with vertices mapped to an orthonormal basis. Other metric structures are also used, involving length metrics obtained by realizing the <b>simplices</b> in hyperbolic space, with <b>simplices</b> identified isometrically along common boundaries.|$|E

25|$|Sperner colorings {{have been}} used for {{effective}} computation of fixed points. A Sperner coloring can be constructed such that fully labeled <b>simplices</b> correspond to fixed points of a given function. By making a triangulation smaller and smaller, one can show that the limit of the fully labeled <b>simplices</b> is exactly the fixed point. Hence, the technique provides a way to approximate fixed points.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{infinite}} hyperbolic Coxeter groups. Hyperbolic groups are categorized as compact or not, with compact groups having bounded fundamental domains. Compact simplex hyperbolic groups (Lannér <b>simplices)</b> exist as rank 3 to 5. Paracompact simplex groups (Koszul <b>simplices)</b> exist up to rank 10. Hypercompact (Vinberg polytopes) {{groups have been}} explored but not been fully determined. In 2006, Allcock proved that there are infinitely many compact Vinberg polytopes for dimension up to 6, and infinitely many finite-volume Vinberg polytopes for dimension up to 19, so a complete enumeration is not possible. All of these fundamental reflective domains, both <b>simplices</b> and nonsimplices, are often called Coxeter polytopes or sometimes less accurately Coxeter polyhedra.|$|E

25|$|A multidimensional {{case can}} be proved by {{induction}} on the dimension of a simplex. We apply the same reasoning, as in the two-dimensional case, to conclude that in a n-dimensional triangulation there is an odd number of full-colored <b>simplices.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} more {{convenient}} and conceptually appealing to pass to the barycentric subdivision of Y. The vertices of this subdivision correspond to the <b>simplices</b> of Y, so that each vertex has a group attached to it. The edges of the barycentric subdivision are naturally oriented (corresponding to inclusions of <b>simplices)</b> and each directed edge gives an inclusion of groups. Each triangle has a transition element attached to it belonging {{to the group of}} exactly one vertex; and the tetrahedra, if there are any, give cocycle relations for the transition elements. Thus a complex of groups involves only the 3-skeleton of the barycentric subdivision; and only the 2-skeleton if it is simple.|$|E
