50|$|One of the {{challenges}} of cancer treatment is how to destroy malignant tumors without damaging healthy cells. A new method that shows great promise for accomplishing this employs {{the use of a}} <b>suicide</b> <b>gene.</b> A <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> is a gene which will cause a cell to kill itself through apoptosis. There are currently two methods of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy being used. Gene-directed enzyme-producing therapy (GDEPT) uses a gene taken from the cancer cell and then modified with other genes to form enzymes that are harmless to healthy cells. This foreign enzyme is inserted into the tumor cells where it releases a prodrug, which is a small molecule harmless to healthy cells, but destructive to cancerous cells. The modified <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> converts the non-toxic prodrug into a cytotoxic substance. The second method of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is called virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy. This uses a virus, such as herpes simplex or cold virus, as the carrier, or vector, to deliver the modified genes to the cancer cells. <b>Suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is not necessarily expected to completely eliminate the need for chemotherapy and radiation treatment for all cancerous tumors. The damage inflicted upon the tumor cells, however, makes them more susceptible to the chemo or radiation. This approach has already proven effective against prostate and bladder cancers. The application of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is being expanded to several other forms of cancer as well. Cancer patients often experience depressed immune systems, so they can suffer some side effects of the use of a virus as a delivery agent.|$|E
50|$|Suicide {{genes are}} often {{utilized}} in biotechnology {{to assist in}} molecular cloning. Vectors incorporate suicide genes for an organism (such as E. coli). The cloning project focuses on replacing the <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> by the desired fragment. Selection of vectors carrying the desired fragment is improved since vectors retaining the <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> result in cell death.|$|E
50|$|Although adoptive {{transfer}} of CAR-modified T-cells {{is a unique}} and promising cancer therapeutic, there are significant safety concerns. Clinical trials of this therapy have revealed potential toxic effects of these CARs when healthy tissues express the same target antigens as the tumor cells, leading to outcomes similar to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A potential {{solution to this problem}} is engineering a <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> into the modified T cells. In this way, administration of a prodrug designed to activate the <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> during GVHD triggers apoptosis in the suicide gene-activated CAR T cells. This method has been used safely and effectively in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Adoption of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy to the clinical application of CAR-modified T cell adoptive cell transfer has potential to alleviate GVHD while improving overall anti-tumor efficacy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{multiple}} {{drug resistance}} protein (MDR 1) is frequently overexpressed in human glioma. The {{aim of this study}} is to clone the MDR 1 promoter from C 6 /ADR, construct the double <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> expressive vector con-trolled by MDR 1 promoter, and explore its targeted expression in C 6 /ADR cells. MDR 1 promoter from C 6 / ADR genomic DNA, which was linked with T vector, was amplified by using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After cut by NdeI and HindIII, MDR 1 promoter was cloned into pcDNA 3 -TK (thymidine kinase) plasmid. The cytosine deaminase (CD) gene from pcDNA 3 -CD-TK plasmid was directly cloned into the above vector to construct pcDNA 3 -MDR 1 -promoter-CD-TK vector. Then this vector was transfected into C 6 and C 6 /ADR cells respectively by liposome. After selection by G 418, the tumor cell lines were stably established. Then these cell lines were exam-ined through PCR and RT-PCR to respectively detect the integration and expression of TK and CD genes. The re-sults showed the length and sequence of MDR 1 promoter amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pcDNA 3 -MDR 1 -promoter-CD-TK expression vectors were constructed successfully. PCR indicated the double <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> were integrated into C 6 and C 6 /ADR cells. RT-PCR reveled that CD and TK genes expressed in C 6 / ADR/CD-TK cells, whereas not in C 6 /CD-TK cells.

5000|$|A <b>suicide</b> <b>gene,</b> in genetics, {{will cause}} a cell to kill itself through apoptosis. Activation of these genes can be due to many processes, but the main {{cellular}} [...] "switch" [...] to induce apoptosis is the p53 protein. Stimulation or introduction (through gene therapy) of suicide genes is a potential way of treating cancer or other proliferative diseases. Suicide genes {{form the basis of}} a strategy for making cancer cells more vulnerable, more sensitive to chemotherapy. The approach has been to attach parts of genes expressed in cancer cells to other genes for enzymes not found in mammals that can convert a harmless substance into one that is toxic to the tumor. Most suicide genes mediate this sensitivity by coding for viral or bacterial enzymes that convert an inactive drug into toxic antimetabolites that inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acid. Suicide genes must be introduced into the cells in ways that ensure their uptake and expression by as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting their expression by normal cells. <b>Suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy for cancer requires the vector to have the capacity to discriminate between target and non target cells, between the cancer cells and normal cells.|$|E
40|$|Persistence of HIV despite highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART) is {{a lasting}} challenge to virus eradication. To develop a strategy complementary to HAART, we constructed {{a series of}} Rev-dependent lentiviral vectors carrying diphtheria toxin A chain (DT-A) and its attenuated mutants, as well as human TRAF 6. Expression of these <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> following delivery through viral particles is dependent on Rev, which exists only in infected cells. Among these toxins, DT-A has been known to trigger cell death with as little as a single molecule, whereas two of the attenuated mutants in this study, DT-A(176) and DT-A(ΔN), were well-tolerated by cells at low levels. TRAF 6 induced apoptosis only with persistent overexpression. Thus, these <b>suicide</b> <b>genes,</b> which induce cell death at different expression levels, offer a balance between efficacy and safety. To minimize possible mutagenesis introduced by retroviral integration in non-target cells, we further developed a non-integrating Rev-dependent (NIRD) lentiviral vector to deliver these genes. In addition, we constructed a DT-A-resistant human cell line by introducing a human elongation factor 2 (EF- 2) mutant into HEK 293 T cells.

Here, we engineered a lentivirally encoded herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) with expression restricted to undifferentiated hPSCs through regulation by the let 7 family of miRNAs. We show that induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) expressing a let 7 -regulated HSVtk transgene are selectively killed by ganciclovir (GCV), whereas differentiated cells are fully protected. However, in contrast to previous studies, we find that in vivo GCV administration results in longer latency but does not prevent teratoma formation by iPSCs expressing either a constitutive or a let 7 -regulated HSVtk, without evidence of silencing of the HSVtk. Clonal analyses of iPSCs expressing HSVtk revealed frequent emergence of GCV resistance which, at least in some cases, could be attributed to preexisting inactivating mutations in the HSVtk coding sequence, selected for upon GCV treatment.

50|$|Recently 4-IPO {{has been}} used in {{experiments}} where it plays a role in T-cell therapy. Autologous T-cells can be altered to express tumor specific antigens.

One {{of the most promising}} therapeutic strategies in this regard is cancer <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy (CSGT), which is rapidly progressing into new frontiers.The therapeutic success, in CSGT, is primarily contingent upon precision in delivery of the therapeutic transgenes to the cancer cells only. This is addressed by discovering and targeting unique or / and over-expressed biomarkers displayed on the cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Specificity of cancer therapeutic effects is further enhanced by designing the DNA constructs, which put the therapeutic genes {{under the control of the}} cancer cell specific promoters. The delivery of the suicidal genes to the cancer cells involves viral, as well as synthetic vectors, which are guided by cancer specific antibodies and ligands. The delivery options also include engineered stem cells with tropisms towards cancers. Main mechanisms inducing cancer cells' deaths include: transgenic expression of thymidine kinases, cytosine deaminases, intracellular antibodies, telomeraseses, caspases, DNases. Precautions are undertaken to eliminate the risks associated with transgenesis. Progress in genomics and proteomics should help us in identifying the cancer specific biomarkers and metabolic pathways for developing new strategies towards clinical trials of targeted and personalized gene therapy of cancer.By introducing the gene into a malignant tumor, the tumor would reduce in size and possibly disappear completely, provided all the individual cells have received a copy of the gene.|$|E
40|$|In mammals four {{deoxyribonucleoside}} kinases, with {{a relatively}} restricted specificity, catalyze the phosphorylation of the four natural deoxyribonucleosides. When cultured mosquito cells, originating from the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, were examined for deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities, only a single enzyme was isolated. Subsequently, the corresponding gene was cloned and over-expressed. While the mosquito kinase (Ag-dNK) phosphorylated all four natural deoxyribonucleosides, it displayed an unexpectedly higher relative efficiency for the phosphorylation of purine versus pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides than the fruit fly multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 145).

Jan van Deursen, James Kirkland, Tamara Tchkonia, Nathan LeBrasseur, and Darren Baker at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., provided the first direct in vivo evidence that cellular senescence causes signs of aging by eliminating senescent cells from progeroid mice by introducing a drug-inducible <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> and then treating the mice with the drug to kill senescent cells selectively, as opposed to decreasing whole body p16. Another Mayo study led by James Kirkland in collaboration with Scripps and other groups demonstrated that senolytics, drugs that target senescent cells, enhance cardiac function and improve vascular reactivity in old mice, alleviate gait disturbance caused by radiation in mice, and delay frailty, neurological dysfunction, and osteoporosis in progeroid mice. Discovery of senolytic drugs was based on a hypothesis-driven approach: the investigators leveraged the observation that senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis to discover that pro-survival pathways are up-regulated in these cells. They demonstrated that these survival pathways are the [...] "Achilles heel" [...] of senescent cells using RNA interference approaches, including Bcl-2-, AKT-, p21-, and tyrosine kinase-related pathways. They then used drugs known to target the identified pathways and showed these drugs kill senescent cells by apoptosis in culture and decrease senescent cell burden in multiple tissues in vivo. Importantly, these drugs had long term effects after a single dose, consistent with removal of senescent cells, rather than a temporary effect requiring continued presence of the drugs. This was the first study to show that clearing senescent cells enhances function in chronologically aged mice.|$|E

Methods Human KDR promoter, Escherichia coli (E. coli) cytosine deaminase (CD) gene and the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) gene were cloned using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasmid pKDR-CDglyTK was constructed with the KDR promoter and CDglyTK genes. A recombinant adenoviral plasmid AdKDR-CDglyTK was then constructed and transfected into 293 packaging cells to grow and harvest adenoviruses. KDR-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV 304) and KDR-negative liver cancer cell line (HepG 2) were infected with the recombinant adenoviruses at different multiplicity of infection (MOI). The infection rate was measured by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. The infected {{cells were cultured in}} culture media containing different concentrations of prodrugs ganciclovir (GCV) and/or 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC). The killing effects were measured using two different methods, i. e. annexin V-FITC staining and terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. Results Recombinant adenoviruses AdKDR-CDglyTK were successfully constructed and they infected ECV 304 and HepG 2 cells efficiently. The infection rate was dependent on MOI of recombinant adenoviruses. ECV 304 cells infected with AdKDR-CDglyTK were highly sensitive to GCV and 5 -FC. The cell survival rate was dependent on both the concentration of the prodrugs and the MOI of recombinant adenoviruses. In contrast, there were no killing effects in the HepG 2 cells. The combination of two prodrugs was much more effective in killing ECV 304 cells than GCV or 5 -FC alone. The growth of transgenic ECV 304 cells was suppressed in the presence of prodrugs. Conclusion AdKDR-CDglyTK/double prodrog system may be a useful method for suppressing tumor angiogenesis. </p...|$|R
