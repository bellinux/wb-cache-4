5|$|Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was {{ten days}} before the child's tenth birthday. <b>Skelton</b> was {{scheduled}} to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. Calling themselves The Friends of Red <b>Skelton,</b> his friends in the television, film and music industries organized The Friends Of Red <b>Skelton</b> Variety Show, which they performed to replace The Red <b>Skelton</b> Show for that week; by May 27, 1958, <b>Skelton</b> had returned to his program. The death of Richard profoundly affected the family; by 1961 Richard's model trains had been moved to a storeroom in the Bel Air mansion, but <b>Skelton</b> refused to have them dismantled. In 1962, the <b>Skelton</b> family moved to Palm Springs, and <b>Skelton</b> used the Bel Air home only on the {{two days a week}} when he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.|$|E
5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard <b>Skelton</b> was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (n√©e Fields) and Joseph Elmer <b>Skelton.</b> Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, <b>Skelton</b> may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the <b>Skelton</b> family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and <b>Skelton</b> because they thought he had no future.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, <b>Skelton</b> went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached <b>Skelton,</b> who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked <b>Skelton</b> what events were going on in town, <b>Skelton</b> suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper <b>Skelton</b> had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted <b>Skelton,</b> who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> {{received}} a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 1987, and in 1988, he {{was inducted into}} the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Television Hall of Fame. He was one of the International Clown Hall of Fame's first inductees in 1989. <b>Skelton</b> and Katharine Hepburn were honored with lifetime achievement awards by the American Comedy Awards in the same year. He {{was inducted into the}} National Radio Hall of Fame in 1994. <b>Skelton</b> also has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his radio and television work.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> was a Freemason, {{a member}} of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was {{a member of}} both the Scottish and York Rite. He was a {{recipient}} of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. <b>Skelton</b> became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young <b>Skelton</b> asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. <b>Skelton</b> decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> {{was made}} an honorary brother of Phi Sigma Kappa at Truman State University. In 1961 {{he became an}} honorary brother of the Phi Alpha Tau Fraternity of Emerson College when {{he was awarded the}} Joseph E. Connor Award for {{excellence}} in the field of communications. He also received an honorary degree from the college at the same ceremony. <b>Skelton</b> received an honorary high school diploma from Vincennes High School. He was also an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity; <b>Skelton</b> had composed many marches which were used by more than 10,000 high school and college bands. In 1986, <b>Skelton</b> received an honorary degree from Ball State University.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> {{went on the}} {{air with}} his own radio show, The Raleigh Cigarette Program, on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was Ozzie Nelson; his wife, Harriet, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with <b>Skelton</b> in skits.|$|E
5|$|A car {{accident}} on 22 September 2015 at Streatham, Victoria during a Thirsty Merc tour killed the band's stage manager and injured drummer Mick <b>Skelton.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 2013, <b>Skelton</b> {{announced}} on air {{that she was}} leaving the show in September after five years {{to be replaced by}} Radzi Chinyanganya.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> {{believed}} that his life's work {{was to make}} people laugh; {{he wanted to be}} known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red <b>Skelton</b> Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> was a {{prolific}} writer of both {{short stories and}} music. After sleeping only {{four or five hours}} a night, he would wake up at 5a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. <b>Skelton</b> was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. <b>Skelton</b> was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.|$|E
5|$|According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film's {{portrayal}} of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela did not struggle performing on The Red <b>Skelton</b> Show.|$|E
5|$|After its move to Salford in September 2011, Blue Peter had {{a format}} with two {{permanent}} presenters, Helen <b>Skelton</b> and Barney Harwood, supplemented by guest presenters for particular topics, such as Naomi Wilkinson for wildlife.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, <b>Skelton</b> {{was engaged}} to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had {{obtained}} a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with <b>Skelton</b> was over. The actress further denied {{that the reason for}} the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting {{in the middle of the}} relationship or reconciling with her former husband.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 1938, <b>Skelton</b> {{replaced}} Red Foley as {{the host}} of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest {{at one of his}} banquet performances and recommended <b>Skelton</b> to one of his clients.|$|E
5|$|The Red <b>Skelton</b> Memorial Bridge {{spans the}} Wabash River and {{provides}} the highway link between Illinois and Indiana on U.S. Route 50, near Skelton's home town of Vincennes. He attended the dedication ceremonies in 1963.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, <b>Skelton</b> {{made several}} {{specials}} for HBO including Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner (1981) and the Funny Faces series of specials. He gave a Royal Command Performance for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1984, which was later {{shown in the}} U.S. on HBO. A portion {{of one of his}} last interviews, conducted by Steven F. Zambo, was broadcast as part of the 2005 PBS special The Pioneers of Primetime.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} more than 40years before the first {{crossing}} of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955‚Äì58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the <b>Skelton</b> Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July 2006 when Matt <b>Skelton</b> beat Danny Williams for the Commonwealth heavyweight title. On 7 April 2007 Joe Calzaghe beat Peter Manfredo {{to retain}} his WBO super middleweight belt. On 3 November 2007 Calzaghe beat Mikkel Kessler to retain his WBO super middleweight belt {{and win the}} WBA and WBC super middleweight titles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> and Edna {{worked for}} a year in Camden, New Jersey, {{and were able to}} get an {{engagement}} at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skelton</b> {{was bitter}} about CBS's {{cancellation}} {{for many years}} afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
5|$|Skelton's artwork of clowns {{remained}} a hobby until 1964 {{when his wife}} Georgia convinced {{him to have a}} showing at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that <b>Skelton</b> had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.|$|E
5|$|Spalding's {{memorial}} became relatively obscure, and was {{not covered}} extensively in any publication about Lutyens' works until the publication of Tim Skelton's Lutyens and the Great War in 2008. Barbara McLaren later married Bernard Freyberg, {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Division, which <b>Skelton</b> speculates may have led to Lutyens' commission for the Royal Naval Division Memorial on Horse Guards Parade in London.|$|E
5|$|Burges's two finest gothic {{churches were}} also {{undertaken}} in the 1870s, the Church of Christ the Consoler, Skelton-on-Ure, and St Mary's, Studley Royal. His patron, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, although not as rich as Bute, was his equal in romantic medievalism and had been a friend of Bute's at Oxford, which {{may account for the}} choice of Burges as architect. Both churches were built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned the Church of Christ the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, <b>Skelton</b> was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Visitor and the regular cast, actor Hart Bochner, James Burkholder, actress Aimee Garcia, Jack Samson, actress Stacey Scowley, Debra <b>Skelton,</b> Reginald VelJohnson, actor Tico Wells, actress Mae Whitman, and actor Bruce Willis guest-starred in the episode in both voice and live-action appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge, writer Steve Callaghan, voice actor Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Recurring guest cast members Adam West and Patrick Warburton also made {{appearances in the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{follows the}} three Jack {{brothers}} ‚Äì Jack Frost, Jack Lantern and Jack <b>Skelton</b> ‚Äì who have traveled from the fairy {{world to the}} human world through a portal that opens every year on Halloween. Losing track of time, they {{spend too much time}} in the human world, and forget about returning until there only is one hour left to the portal's closing; the fairy Pixie shows them a shortcut, which, while dangerous, {{is the only way to}} return to the portal in time.|$|E
5|$|The divorce {{meant that}} <b>Skelton</b> {{had lost his}} married man's deferment; he was once again {{classified}} as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, {{the day before he}} was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role {{of one of the}} three Jack {{brothers}} ‚Äì Jack Frost, Jack Lantern, or Jack <b>Skelton</b> ‚Äì who have visited the human world for Halloween, and need to return to the fairy world before the portal connecting the two worlds closes. The player needs to make their way through six areas, which consist of a number of floors, defeating enemies by using character-specific attacks and collecting keys to be able to advance to the next floor. It received generally positive reception for its gameplay, but was criticized for the lack of puzzle elements and under-utilization of the Virtual Boy's 3D effect.|$|E
5|$|By 1857 a {{blast furnace}} had opened {{close to the}} Durham {{coalfield}} {{on the north side}} of the Tees. Backed by the rival West Hartlepool Harbour & Railway, the Durham & Cleveland Union Railway proposed a line from the mines in Skinningrove and Staithes, via Guisborough and a bridge over the Middlesbrough & Redcar Railway to a jetty at Cargo Fleet, from where a ferry would carry the ore across the Tees to the blast furnaces. When the proposal was before Parliament the S suggested that their Middlesbrough & Redcar could be extended to Saltburn, and the Tees crossed by a swing bridge. The Cleveland Railway received permission for a line from Skinningrove as far as Guisborough, and the S permission for an extension to Saltburn and a branch to a mine at <b>Skelton.</b> This 1858 S Act also authorised the merger of the S with the railways it held on lease.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Sinatra {{bought a}} share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, a casino hotel which {{straddles}} the California-Nevada state line on the north shores of Lake Tahoe. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted the Sinatra show business pals, Red <b>Skelton,</b> Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel. Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands. That year, Sinatra's son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., was kidnapped, but was eventually released unharmed. Sinatra restored his gaming license in February 1981, following support from Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles {{did not yet}} exist however, and so his engineer Reginald <b>Skelton</b> developed {{the idea of a}} caterpillar track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him {{all the way to the}} Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Maulay {{had vowed}} {{to go on}} crusade in 1220, and in 1241 he finally {{set out for the}} Holy Land, along with Richard of Cornwall. Maulay died later in 1241, {{probably}} while still in the Holy Land. His wife died before him and his heir was his son Peter de Maulay. Besides his heir, Maulay had two other sons‚Äì Robert and Stephen, and a daughter, Hilary, who married Piers de Brus, son and heir of Piers de Brus, the Lord of <b>Skelton.</b> Maulay had endowed a chantry at Meaux Abbey in Yorkshire in memory of his wife. He also confirmed grants of lands to Eskdale Priory, a Grandmontine house founded by Isabella's father, and to Nostell Priory. Maulay was also a benefactor of the Knights of Saint Thomas, a military religious order for Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald <b>Skelton</b> and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Railway, the M and the S {{were all}} taken over in 1865 by the North Eastern Railway (NER). The new {{management}} authorised {{the construction of}} a link from Saltburn (which the S had reached in 1861) via <b>Skelton</b> to the Cleveland Railway's route at Brotton, forking south to reach Guisborough. This connection, completed in 1872, provided a new connection between Teesside and the East Cleveland mines, running north of the Eston Hills. Further capacity was provided by doubling the tracks on the line running east of Guisborough. This made the former Cleveland Railway's line west of Guisborough redundant and it was closed in 1873 after only twelve years of service, though the parallel MG line to Middlesbrough remained open for a further 90 years.|$|E
5|$|The West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway (WHH) and {{a number}} of landowners struck an {{agreement}} to construct a line from the Tees at Cargo Fleet via Normanby, Upsall and Guisborough to Skinningrove, with connecting links and branches to Staithes and Skelton-in-Cleveland. The line would connect to the WHH's own route north of the river via a crossing of the Tees. Several local landowners through which the proposed line ran were key to the scheme ‚Äì Captain Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough, J.T. Wharton of <b>Skelton</b> Castle, Anthony Lax Maynard of Skinningrove and Ralph Ward Jackson of Greatham Hall, Normanby. Ward Jackson, who was the chairman of the WHH, was {{the driving force behind the}} project and envisaged making West Hartlepool into the industrial heart of Teesside.|$|E
