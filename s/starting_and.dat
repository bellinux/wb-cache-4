But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E

The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.|$|E

After signing with the Freedom, Harris stated that her contributions to the team would not be through <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> playing, as Erin McLeod was the starting goalkeeper for the team at the time. On July 24, McLeod suffered an ACL tear during a match against FC Gold Pride. Brianna Scurry, the back-up for the Freedom, had suffered a concussion {{earlier in the year}} and was also out for the season. Harris was left as the starting goalkeeper and made her first appearance for the team on July 28, 2010, where she started in a match against Atlanta Beat. She appeared in the seven remaining games of the regular season and earned the Freedom a spot in the playoffs. The Freedom took on the Philadelphia Independence {{in the first round of}} the playoffs on September 19. Harris made three saves in regular time and the match was scoreless after 90 minutes. In the 120th minute, Amy Rodriguez scored for Philadelphia, resulting in a 1–0 victory and the Freedom's elimination from the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during <b>starting,</b> <b>and</b> allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
5|$|Though Lavender {{seemed to}} pitch well {{to begin the}} 1916season, his record of 1–6though June10 was a direct {{contrast}} to his low 2.89ERA. In his next start, against the Giants on June14, he allowed only an infield single to Benny Kauff. The New York Sun noted that Kauff's single was {{as a result of}} a ground ball that took a bad hop and bounced away from the fielder. Lavender continued to pitch well throughout the season, both <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> in relief, culminating with a complete game shutout against Pittsburgh on September9, his fourth shutout of the season. However, in his last four appearances, he was credited with the loss in three, and his ERA rose from 2.05 to 2.83. His season win–loss record was 10–14 in 36 games and 188innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Although 52 {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Riggs clinched the third pole position of his career, and his third consecutive at Lowe's Motor Speedway, {{with a time of}} 28.203 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kahne, his Evernham Motorsports teammate, and held the pole position until Riggs' lap. Kurt Busch originally qualified in third, but his car's right-rear shock absorber was found to have violated NASCAR regulations during the post-qualifying inspection because it did not bounce back. Busch was required to start from 42nd position after using a provisional. As a result, Casey Mears inherited third, Sadler fourth, and Harvick fifth. Burton, Martin, Clint Bowyer, Reed Sorenson and Johnson rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Kenseth, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified eleventh, while Earnhardt took 16th and Kyle Busch 18th. The nine drivers who failed to qualify were Elliott, Kevin Lepage, Derrike Cope, Chad Chaffin, Hermie Sadler, Kirk Shelmerdine, Kenny Wallace (who crashed on his first timed lap), Morgan Shepherd (who elected not to set a lap time), and Carl Long (who crashed while attempting to record a timed lap). After the qualifier Riggs said that his team knew his car was good, and achieved a good draw by recording his lap time {{in the latter half of}} the session. He stated when returning to the track, his team wanted to get back into a rhythm of <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> finishing in a top position.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Patriots and {{new head}} coach Bill Parcells {{were looking to}} improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed Scott Secules, and {{attempted}} to sign Steve Beuerlein, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen {{was traded to the}} Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots chose Drew Bledsoe with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a restricted free agent in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As {{was the case in the}} 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The 1995 season was similar, with Bledsoe <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 3017. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the Denver Broncos. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.|$|E
