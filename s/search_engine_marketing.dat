This paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and economic perspective to understand IT markets. This framework {{was applied to the}} <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market.</b> We study critical characteristics of the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market,</b> including major players, search techniques, network structure, and market structure and try to assess whether any <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> have monopoly power given that advertising price in the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market</b> is not easily attained and that no price is charged from users for most services provided by <b>search</b> <b>engines.</b> We focus on major <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> that provide general search services. We assume that the top 19 <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> in the June 2000 rating from Nielsen/NetRatings account for 100 % market share.

40|$|We analyze a <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market</b> from a law and {{economics}} perspective and incorporate the choice of quality-improving innovations by a <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> platform in a two-sided model of Internet <b>search</b> <b>engine.</b> In the proposed framework, we first discuss the legal issues the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market</b> raises for antitrust policy through analysis of several types of abusive behavior by the dominant platform. We also explore possible consequences of monopolization of the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market</b> for advertisers and users {{in the form of}} excessive pricing and deterioration {{of the quality of the}} search results. Second, in the technical analysis part, we incorporate these considerations in a two-sided market model and analyze the rate of innovation, pricing, and quality choices by the dominant <b>search</b> <b>engine.</b> Our findings show that a dominant monopoly platform results in higher prices and underinvestment in quality-improving innovations by a <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> relative to the social optimum. More generally, we show that monopoly is sub-optimal in terms of harm to advertisers in the form of excessive prices, harm to users in the form of reduction in quality of search results, as well as harm to the society in the form of lower innovation rates in the industry. © The Author (2012).

This paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and economic perspective to the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market.</b> The findings indicate that (1) despite {{an increasing number of}} <b>search</b> <b>engines,</b> barriers to entry seem high, largely due to the exponential {{growth in the number of}} web sites and the non-scalability of the current search technology and collective switching costs; (2) older <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> sites tend typically to have more features to lock in users. Using standard economic indicators (CR 4 = 58 % and HHI= 1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by anticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in this paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern. Based on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other possible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The trend shows that some <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> may dominate the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market.</b> We suggest conducting research in the coverage performance of <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> and investigate "information search cost" as a performance indicator of search techniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive conduct (e. g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer welfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market</b> is a particularly powerful approach for E-Commerce.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{understand}} and further explain the reasons culminating in Google's relative failure in the Chinese <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>market.</b> By examining Google's tenure in China, Google's fairings in other large East Asian markets, and other Western corporations' troubles adapting to the Chinese market, this paper works to exhibit the reasons for Google's failure in China. Many of Google's high-ranking officers have claimed censorship {{as the most important}} factor in forcing the industry giant to vacate one of the fastest growing and most populous <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>markets</b> in the world, but this paper seeks to exemplify that Google's approach to China was flawed and may have contributed to its failure just as much as censorship. Through the utilization of papers detailing Google's efforts in various East Asian markets, various sources showing the Chinese government's works against Google and the Chinese public's perception of Google's actions, and works discussing Google's strategy in East Asia, the paper analyzes how Google was affected both by internal and external stimuli in the four areas that affect <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> loyalty according to various researchers: speed, comprehensiveness, ease, and relevance. The conclusion is that, while nothing is certain due to how interconnected every aspect of the question is, Google's flawed business plan for the Chinese market and inability to overcome the label as an overly foreign corporation ultimately concluded in its inability to best China's homegrown <b>search</b> <b>engine,</b> Baidu, and its decision to depart the Chinese market...|$|R
