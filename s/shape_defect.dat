Rock magnetism provides non-destructive methods for analyzing these minerals such as magnetic hysteresis measurements, temperature-dependent remanence measurements, Mössbauer spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance and so on. With such methods, rock magnetists can measure the effects of past climate change and human impacts on the mineralogy (see environmental magnetism). In sediments, {{a lot of the}} magnetic remanence is carried by minerals that were created by magnetotactic bacteria, so rock magnetists have made significant contributions to biomagnetism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{cold rolling}} process, {{asymmetric}} <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> {{are still a}} common problem to strip quality. For the mills with inverse symmetry roll shifting system, different roll wear and thermal contour of top roll system and bottom roll system could cause asymmetric <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> during shifting operation. In this paper, three dimension finite element simulation models of inverse shifting roll system were established to calculate the parameters and to analyze the effects. Based on the idea in the mill engineering that mill style option depended on the product grade, shifting weakness was evaluated and the opinion of limit shifting was suggested. To improve control effect to asymmetric <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> in cold rolling, shape control system with asymmetric shape control ability is developed, including asymmetric edge drop control at upstream stands and asymmetric flatness control at last stand. The further improvement of asymmetric shape control theory and practice is the key way to reach the higher precision of shape quality in cold strip mills...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantitative}} evaluation of elastic springback in {{sheet metal stamping}} processes is still today a very interesting research topic, since this phenomenon causes a manufacturing <b>shape</b> <b>defect.</b> A measurement technique based on the shadow moire method, already developed by the present authors, has been further upgraded and applied to evaluate the springback phenomenon in the deep drawing of square boxes, the basic three-dimensional stamping process. In particular this technique is able to determine the final lateral surface of the drawn parts, once extracted from the dies, and to compare such surface with the ideal one derived from the die's computer-aided design (CAD) geometry.

40|$|The {{problem of}} defect {{detection}} in 2 D and 3 D shapes is analyzed. A shape {{is represented by}} a set of its contour, or surface, points. Mathematically, the problem is formulated as a specific matching of two sets of points, a reference one and a measured one. Modified Hausdorff distance between these two point sets is used to induce the matching. Based on a distance transform, a 2 D algorithm is proposed that implements the matching in a computationally efficient way. The method is applied to visual inspection and dimensional measurement of ferrite cores.

40|$|The {{roll forming}} process is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry for the manufacture of structural and crash components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS). Due to the high strength of UHSS (< 1 GPa) even small and commonly observed material property variations from coil to coil can result in significant changes in material yield and through that affect the final shape of the roll formed component. This requires the re-adjustment of tooling to compensate for <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> and maintain part geometry resulting in costly downtimes of equipment. This paper presents a first step towards an in-line shape compensation method that based on the monitoring of roll load and torque allows for the estimation of <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> and the subsequent re-adjustment of tooling for compensation. For this the effect of material property variation on common <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> observed in the roll forming process as well as measurable process parameters such as roll load and torque needs to be understood. The effect of yield strength and material hardening on roll load and torque as well as longitudinal bow is investigated via experimental trials and numerical analysis. A regression analysis combined with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) techniques is employed to establish {{the relationships between the}} process and material parameters and to determine their percentage influence on longitudinal bow, roll load and torque. The study will show that the level of longitudinal bow, one of the major <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> observed in roll forming, can be estimated by variations in roll load and torque...|$|R

40|$|Shape {{representation}} is a well-researched domain, which {{plays an important}} role in many applications ranging from image analysis and pattern recognition to computer graphics and computer animation. Therefore, many methods for shape representation exist in the literature. One of the techniques for shape {{representation is}} based on convex hull. The convex hull of a shape is the smallest polygon that positions the entire points of the input shape within the polygon [1]. In this work, a starfruit <b>shape</b> <b>defect</b> estimation technique based on convex hull is presented. The aim is to transform the input shape into convex hull with better efficiency compared to the previous technique. Based on the resulting convex hull, the <b>shape</b> <b>defect</b> of the starfruit will be quantified. The convex hull algorithm has been introduced as early as 1972 by Graham [10]. Then, few other algorithms have been introduced [3, 4]. The problem with these early-introduced algorithms is their low computational efficiency because of the involvement of sorting process of the input points. Sorting the input points consumes O(n log n) running time and it is less memory efficient, as it requires an extra temporary array. After the sorting process, the algorithm employs a stack-based method to form the convex hull, which runs in just O(n) time...|$|E

Researches on this area have achieved significant progress in modelling the convex rib degree and prevention measures.|$|E

30|$|The steel, defect position, {{and size}} could be {{formed in the}} image {{reconstruction}} results. The small <b>shape</b> of the <b>defect</b> was difficult to reconstruct in computerized tomography images, possibly because {{the diameter of the}} defect was smaller than the wavelength of the ultrasonic wave. In the image reconstruction results, we also found that, if the concrete cracks had a greater impact on the propagation of the ultrasound, it was difficult to obtain an image reconstruction. Although the defects were detected by the proposed method and the position {{and the size of the}} defect can be reconstructed in CT images, the <b>shape</b> of the <b>defects</b> was different from the actual defects. The possible reason for this was due to the anisotropic property of ultrasonic waves. Therefore, we should further research the impact of ultrasonic wave propagation on image reconstruction. The typical <b>defect</b> <b>shapes</b> considered are relatively regular, but the internal defects of concrete tend to be irregular, so the influence of irregular <b>shape</b> <b>defects</b> on sound wave propagation characteristics and defect position detection will be considered later.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a shape {{representation}} {{based on}} concave and convex area along a closed curve is presented. The proposed technique involves {{the process of}} the curvature estimation from the input curve and search for its corresponding critical points. By splitting the critical points into concave and convex categories, the concave and convex area are computed. From these statistical features, two problems related to the shape (curve) are investigated. Here, the proposed technique is tested on <b>shape</b> <b>defect</b> estimation and shape recognition of starfruit. In the first case, defect is measured by computing concave energy, which is proportional to the defect. For shape recognition, starfruit’s stem is identified and removed from the starfruit’s shape, as it will contributes false computation of defect measurement. For both cases, the proposed technique is tested with three different curvature estimation techniques to validate the results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear dynamic {{model of the}} contact forces and vibration generated in rolling element bearings due to a surface defect in a raceway. A rectangular <b>shape</b> <b>defect</b> with sharp edges is selected for modelling because previous models {{were not able to}} predict the low frequency vibration event that occurs when a rolling element enters the defect. Simulations are presented for two defect sizes. In the first simulation, the defect length is small such that the rolling elements do not strike the bottom of the defect. The simulated results compare well with experimental results, and predict the low and high frequency events that occur when a rolling element passes through the defect observed in the experimental results. In the second simulation, the defect length is increased such that a rolling element strikes the bottom of the defect. This simulation demonstrates the benefits over models that do not consider the mass of the rolling elements. The benefits are illustrated by a detailed analysis of the contact forces that occur as a rolling element passes through the defect. The developed model can be used to simulate the vibration response of bearings with a defect in the raceway to aid in the development of new diagnostic algorithms.

40|$|Several {{definitions}} can be {{made for}} the term ‘outlier ’ such as a single observation far away {{from the rest of the}} observation set. The outlier is the observation that not includes systematic and gross errors but random errors and differs from the other data with its distribution. It is assumed that geodetic observations free from systematic and gross errors always have random errors which are in normal distribution. If an observation is separated from the other data with respect to its random error which is not in normal distribution, that observation is named ‘outlier’. To date several approaches have been developed to identify the outliers more accurately. The first proposed approaches, conventional methods, used the statistical tests to detect outlying observations and removed them from the data set. The main drawback of such an application is the <b>shape</b> <b>defect</b> of the network. Unlike the conventional methods, the robust estimations do not remove any observation from the network. They reduce the effects of the possible outliers on the adjustment model as making the weights of the outlying observations smaller even zero.
