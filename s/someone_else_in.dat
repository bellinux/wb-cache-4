25|$|According to his biography, from 1868 on {{he began}} to feel {{overburdened}} by his pastorate, as his church was very large with only a single minister. This led to the 1870 hiring of Rev. A.

By now an older man, and with the difficult task on ministering to a large church without any help, Lord felt the need to leave the position of pastor to <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> September 1873, his resignation was reluctantly accepted by the Central Presbyterian Church, after 38 years as pastor.|$|E

25|$|Procrastination is {{considerably}} more widespread in students {{than in the}} general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point.

25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> short, {{in the absence}} of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Supreme Court {{observed}} it {{is essential}} in cases of trover, that the property must be found; it must {{at the time when}} the finder came upon it, to have been in such a situation as to clearly indicate that it was lost. It cannot have been placed there by the original owner who lost it by carelessness or forgetfulness, where it was later found by <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> such cases, the owner of the premises where the property is found is treated as a quasi-bailee (i.e. he holds the property for the original owner), and he may maintain trover against the finder. Since the log was not intentionally laid by the (unknown) owner on the land of the plaintiff (Deaderick), and hence he was not a quasi-bailee for the owner, he cannot hold against the superior right of the defendant (Oulds) arising out of his prior possession and earlier finding of the log. Judgment for ownership of the log was to the defendant Oulds.|$|E
