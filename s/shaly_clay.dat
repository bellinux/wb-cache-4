40|$|In the Northern Apennines, the {{geological}} situations {{due to the}} superimposition of competent rocks on argillaceous and <b>shaly</b> <b>clay</b> substrata are particularly widespread and give rise to complex and prolonged mass movements. To these situations, the case of Sasso di Simone and Simoncello is ascribable. Due to the intense tectonic stresses which have accompanied the orogenesis of the Apennine chain, these competent tabular-shaped cliffs are affected by widespread fractures whose nature and distribution directly influence {{the evolution of the}} slope movements. The latter are not confined to the lithic rocks, but extend also to the clayey substratum, which is also highly tectonised, thus causing complex landslides, prevalently showing lateral spreading deformations, concentrated along the cliff margins. The main cause of the persistent slope instability is identified with the high erodibility and deformability of the clayey soils, of which a basic geotechnical classification is given...|$|E

The Batuasih Formation, overlying conform- ably the Walat Formation, consists  of claystone, dark gray, <b>shaly,</b> brittle, containing <b>clay</b> ball, calcite veins, with carbonate intercalations. The geochemical analysis conducted on twelve samples shows the TOC values vary between 0. 49 – 1. 14 % and T max of 431 – 434 o C. Four samples are categorized to be immature, while the rests are mature. HI values of the Batuasih Formation varying from 77 - 191 mg HC/ TOC indicate that the samples are of C and CD organic facies. Based on those analyses, the source rock is favourably potential to generate a small quantity of hydrocarbon and gas. The hydrocarbon source rock potential level in the investigation area shows a poor to fair organic richness, and its kerogen is included into types II and III. The source rock quality based on the Hydrogen Index (HI) value tends to be a gas prone.   </div...|$|R
40|$|We used Broad-Ion-Beam {{polishing}} {{in combination}} with Scanning Electron Microscopy to study the microstructure and porosity in the Shaly facies of Opalinus Clay (northern Switzerland). With resolutions of a few nm, we studied areas of around 1 mm 2, sufficiently large to be statistically representative for the microstructure. In three samples from a 1 m long drill core from the Mt Terri laboratory, a qualitative description of the microstructure was combined with quantitative description of porosity. Eight different mineral phases and six different pore types are identified, in the clay matrix, siderite, pyrite framboids and fossil shells respectively. Pore sizes in the clay matrix have a power law distribution with an exponent of 2. 4. Porosity inferred from the BIB–SEM method is comparable to that measured using mercury porosimetry. Based on micrographs made perpendicular and parallel to the bedding we show that pores and minerals are homogeneously distributed in 3 D, and present a microstructural model for the Shaly facies of Opalinus Clay. This model defines predictable homogeneous porous and non-porous regions with similar pore characteristics. Combined, these form the heterogeneous fabric of Opalinus <b>Clay</b> (<b>Shaly</b> facies) ...|$|R

One of {{the most}} {{important}} steps in well log analysis is proper evaluation of <b>shaly</b> formations. <b>Clay</b> minerals may cause a lot of problems with calculating porosity or water saturation (Jarzyna 1997). There are several different methods that allow us to determine the volume of shale in the geological formation. It is a fact that choosing correct technique is often a problem which many well log analysts must struggle with (Bassiouni 1994). This paper shows the results that interpreter might obtain using different types of methods for quantitative determination of shale content. Well logs used for the calculation of the shale volume come from Borehole A- 1, which is located in west central Poland in Greater Poland Voivodeship. The first method for the determination of the shale volume was the Gamma Ray technique. This method allowed to calculate the amount of shale using only one log as an input (Ellis & Singer 2008). Both nonlinear and linear equations were applied to calculate the volume of shale. The second technique used is the Neutron-Density Method (Techlog Manual 2011), where two logs were used as an input data source, Neutron Porosity log (NPHI) and Bulk Density (RHOB). The third and the last method for calculating the volume of shale in Borehole A- 1 was Resistivity technique, with deep resistivity log (Schlumberger 1998). The results obtained with each technique were compared to each other and then combined together. The last step allowed to calculate the final volume of shale (Schlumberger 1998). Since each technique gave different results, and it was impossible to choose the correct one, the combination of methods had to be applied for the calculation of shale volume. The errors for every method have a tendency to increase, not to reduce, the apparent shale volume (Schlumberger 1998), therefore a "minimum combination" was applied, meaning that the minimum values of all the variables (calculated shale volumes) were used as an input. Results of the "minimum combination" method give the most probable information about the volume of the shales within the analyzed geological formation. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Key petrophysical {{properties}} of reservoir sequences {{are determined by}} their individual mineral compositions, and are routinely evaluated through the analysis of cores and geophysical well logs. However, mineralogical studies are seldom incorporated in reservoir assessment. The objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate the influence of mineralogy on petrophysical {{properties of}} petroleum reservoir beds and the application of mineralogical studies in reservoir evaluation. Mineralogical analyses were performed on core samples from the Plover Formation, the principal reservoir sequence in the Northwest Shelf area of Australia, intersected in two separate wells in the Laminaria petroleum field. The techniques used included X-ray powder and oriented-aggregate analysis, optical microscopy and whole rock geochemistry. Quantification of each mineral phase based on whole-rock powder data was performed using the Rietveld-based Siroquant technique. Results from the Siroquant assay were used as an indicator of mineralogy for the individual samples and were compared with core plug and geophysical log data. X-ray micro-tomography analysis of selected samples was also performed. The reservoir sequences in both wells were sand-dominated, consisted mostly of quartz, clay mineral matrix and cement of silica, pyrite or calcite. The abundance of clay minerals increased in the shale and shaly sandstone intervals. Comparison of mineralogical and core plug analyses of samples from the same depths showed that the down-hole variations in porosity, permeability, grain density and radioactivity were accompanied by changes in mineralogy. Higher proportion of clay minerals in shales was indicated by higher gamma log signals. The gamma log may be taken as an indicator of shaliness only in intervals where kaolinite is proportional to the quantity of illitic clays. Sonic log and neutron log porosity values are comparable with core plug porosity data in sandstone intervals. However, clay minerals increase the sonic log response, thereby increasing porosity in <b>shaly</b> intervals. <b>Clay</b> minerals tend to decrease the neutron log response causing higher porosity indication in shales, similar to that expected in sandstones. Routine density log analysis underestimated porosity values because of the contribution of dense minerals to the bulk density of the formation. Use of laboratory determined grain and fluid densities resulted in improved density log porosity compared to core porosity. X-ray tomography analysis revealed an overall positive correlation between mineralogy and porosity data. Routine geophysical log evaluation revealed inconsistent results when compared to core analysis data because of the influence of minerals on various logs. It is essential that mineralogical studies be included in reservoir assessment. X-ray tomography may provide an alternative approach in evaluating porosity and mineralogy...|$|R
40|$|The report {{documents}} the drilling of well Deep Blue No. 2, the second deep geothermal test {{hole at the}} Blue Mountain Geothermal Area, Humboldt County, Nevada. The well was drilled by Noramex Corp, a Nevada company, with funding support from the US Department of Energy, under the DOE’s GRED II Program. Deep Blue No. 2 was drilled as a ‘step-out’ hole from Deep Blue No. 1, to further evaluate the commercial potential of the geothermal resource. Deep Blue No. 2 {{was designed as a}} vertical, slim observation test hole to a nominal target depth of 1000 meters (nominal 3400 feet). The well tests an area of projected high temperatures at depth, from temperature gradients measured in a group of shallow drill holes located approximately one kilometer to the northeast of observation hole Deep Blue No. 1. The well is not intended for, or designed as, a commercial well or a production well. Deep Blue No. 2 was spudded on March 25, 2004 and completed to a total depth of 1127. 76 m (3700 ft) on April 28, 2004. The well was drilled using conventional rotary drilling techniques to a depth of 201. 17 m (660 ft), and continuously cored from 201. 17 m (660 ft) to 1127. 76 m (3700 ft). A brief rig-on flow-test was conducted at completion to determine basic reservoir parameters and obtain fluid samples. A permeable fracture zone with measured temperatures of 150 to 167 °C (302 to 333 °F) occurs between 500 to 750 m (1640 to 2461 ft). The well was left un-lined in anticipation of the Phase III - Flow and Injection Testing. A further Kuster temperature survey was attempted after the well had been shut in for almost 3 weeks. The well appears to have bridged off at 439 m (1440 ft) as the Kuster tool was unable to descend past this point. Several attempts to dislodge the obstruction using tube jars were unsuccessful. Deep Blue No. 2 encountered variably fractured and veined, fine-grained rocks of the Singas Formation, and intruded by minor strongly altered fine-grained felsic dikes, and less altered fineto medium-grained felsic to intermediate dikes. Widespread open fractures and extensive of quartz veining in many intervals of the core indicate a high degree of fracturing and flow of silica-bearing fluids, almost certainly hotter than 200 °C (392 °F), at some time, but these fractures are now partially sealed. Intervals of soft <b>shaly</b> mudstone, common <b>clay</b> gouge, and rocks with generally low permeability (few veins and fractures) may also form a seal or ‘cap’ above the main high temperature reservoir at Blue Mountain. The encouraging results from Deep Blue No. 2 support further drilling at Blue Mountain. Higher temperature fluids can be expected where fractures providing channels for the circulation of hot water from depth have not been sealed extensively by silica deposition...|$|R
40|$|Clay rich {{formations}} are investigated thoroughly as candidate host rocks for {{the deep}} geological storage of radioactive waste. In the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory (Switzerland) Opalinus Clay is investigated {{with the aim}} to analyse its hydrological, geochemical and rock mechanical properties. Detailed investigation of the pore morphology and pore space contributes {{to the understanding of}} the sealing capacity, coupled flow, and associated deformation in clay. The Opalinus Clay formation is a fine-grained sedimentary rock deposited 180 Ma ago in a shallow sea compacted to a low porosity of 9 – 25 % (depending on the measuring method used) and low permeability. On the regional scale the lateral variability of facies and lithology is low. Opalinus Clay is subdivided in six subfacies where the two end-members are the Shaly and the Sandy facies. To minimize damage of the clays microstructure the samples investigated, in this study, were carefully dried, as described in Chapter 2. After drying samples were imaged using a combination of Broad-Ion-Beam (BIB) milling and Scanning-Electron-Microscope (SEM) imaging. The method allows direct imaging of the clay fabric and porosity down to the nm scale. Visible porosity in the SE-micrographs was than segmented either manually or automatically (Chapter 3). A combination of BIB-milling and SEM imaging allows large representative area investigation of claystones, and a summary on porosity, pore morphology and pore size distribution of undamaged Opalinus <b>Clay</b> <b>Shaly</b> facies microstructures can be found in Chapter 4. This approach is able to provide a qualitative study of porosity as well as quantification of the pores directly from the micrographs at the nm - µm scale. Although the overall micro fabric differs per layer and per facies (Chapter 5), a low variability of the microstructure and porosity has been observed within each mineral phase. For example microstructurally the BIB polished cross-sections, produced in samples that have a high content of clay matrix (> 60 %), display comparable microstructures for Sandy and Shaly facies samples of Opalinus Clay. The same is true for the pore size distribution and prominent pore shape per mineral phase, independent of the facies or polished cross-sections investigated; the pores within the clay matrix follow a similar pore size distribution and possess similar pore shapes. The large mineral grains, fossil shells and mineral aggregates are completely surrounded by the clay matrix, where the kind and amount of minerals depend on the facies of Opalinus Clay. The microstructure and porosity of the Shaly facies has also been investigated in 3 D using a combination of µ-CT, BIB-SEM and FIB-SEM techniques (Chapter 6). The µ-CT measurements are used to get a 3 D microstructural overview down to the µm scale. Afterwards a 2 D BIB-polished cross-section was made through the µ-CT sample to examine the 2 D microstructure down to the nm scale. FIB-SEM was used to study the 3 D pore connectivity on two selected areas (Clay matrix and fossil shell) down to the nm scale. Next to the samples from the undisturbed Shaly and Sandy facies of Opalinus Clay, samples from the ‘Main fault’ (Mont Terri rock laboratory, Switzerland) were investigated, for the details see Chapter 7. Differences in microstructure with the undisturbed samples are the numerous micrometer wide calcite, celestine and pyrite filled veins present in the disturbed samples. Furthermore, damage zones of about 15 µm wide featuring less porosity are present. In order to investigate the pore connectivity Wood’s metal injection experiments were performed (Chapter 8). Preliminary results show that Wood’s metal although present in the bigger cracks and a few pores did not intruded a greater part of the pores present in the sample. This can indicate that that the connecting pore throats are smaller than 9 nm wide...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{insignificant}} {{contribution of}} the potassium-free clay minerals in the Shurijeh Formation, the natural gamma ray, potassium and thorium logging data were used confidently to obtain estimates of Shurijeh clay content. There was a strong linear correlation between the weight percent clay and the natural gamma ray log data based on the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. According to the XRD results, the non-producing well was more <b>shaly</b> with a <b>clay</b> quantity of {{one and a half}} order of magnitude larger than that was in the gas producing well. The clay content calculated from the modified natural gamma ray log and its spectral components data, exceeded the actual core-measured of this parameter, probably because of the other non-clay radioactive minerals and/or the size of sampling. It is clear that the borehole logging instrument measures the natural radioactivity in a large portion of rock weighing many kilograms, in contrast to the core sample which represents {{only a small portion of}} a kilogram. This is known as the size sampling effect. On the density versus gamma ray cross-plot (Fig.  6), most of data points of non-producing well, which exhibited a high amount of gamma ray activity, plotted toward the up right corner of the cross plot, while the gas producing well data points fell toward the left corner of the cross-plot (showing lower densities and radioactivities). It was investigated from Fig.  9 that the two most precise estimator logs for the clay content estimations in the Shurijeh Formation were the gamma ray and thorium logs, whereas the potassium log had the most estimation errors due to the existence of potassium deficient clays such as kaolinite and chlorite. On the basis of the average percent relative error, among all of the previously proposed modifications in the Shurijeh Formation, those introduced by Dewan, Bhuyan–Passey, and Larinov had the most widely overestimations. Dewan equation produced the largest estimation errors, because of the exponential value of 3 in its formulation, which was an educated guess and there was no measured data in the literature to support it. Buhyan–Passey modification generated relatively erroneous estimations, due to the non-realistic assumption of identical properties for both clay minerals in the clastic reservoirs and the adjacent shales. Larinov equation for the highly consolidated rocks provided overestimations as well and the reason for this inapplicability might lie in the general assumption used in its formulation. It is being formulated based on the fact that the older rocks subjected to deep burial contain more illitic minerals than the other rocks due to the illitization of smectite as a function of burial depth. Since there are many exceptions to this generalization, if clay contents are picked from Larinov older rock curve, like what is shown in Fig.  8, they are subject to an error. The modification proposed by Clavier [23] was a good compromise between the tertiary and older rock equations for estimation of the clay contents in the reservoirs; however, it appeared to slightly overestimate the clay content of the Shurijeh reservoir Formation (Fig.  8). The agreement between the XRD data and the Stieber estimates was satisfactory; nevertheless the estimations given by the empirical calibration improved the accuracy of the estimations much better than that. For the clay content estimation purpose, the application of the empirical relationship was found more reliable than the previously proposed modifications of the natural gamma ray log, due to its indicator values and low estimation errors. The estimation errors of all of the previously proposed modifications were depended to the log type (the gamma ray, potassium or thorium logs), unlike the empirical non-linear calibration which had approximately equal errors for all of the different types of logs. Overall, it seemed that the generalization ability of the empirical non-linear calibration relationship was much better than the previous calibrations and the fitting error of the model was less. The average clay contents achieved by the locally calibrated gamma ray index were 9.88 and 11.45 % in the gas producing and non-producing well, respectively. These amounts were much lower than the values obtained from the former modifications and were in more accordance with the laboratory measured data. These findings have had a great impact on the estimation of hydrocarbon in place and reserves of the Shurijeh. Overall, both the actual and estimates of weight percent clay from the different modifications, placed the Shurijeh Formation in the shaly sandstone category.|$|R
