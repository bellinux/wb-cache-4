50|$|Not {{until the}} {{teething}} troubles had been resolved was the S 4 put into series production in 1902 in Borsig, from 1906 also in Henschel and Humboldt. Unlike the prototypes the production engines were developed {{independently of the}} S 3, and 104 examples {{were built in the}} years to 1909 when procurement was halted in favour of the Prussian S 6. Up to 1906 a smokebox superheater was installed; afterwards <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> superheaters were used.|$|E
50|$|The smokebox {{superheater}} {{installed on}} the first machines was soon replaced by a <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> superheater. In all, 275 engines of this class were built up to 1910. 110 examples had {{to be handed over}} after the First World War as reparations. 163 locomotives were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 37.0-1, where they were allocated the running numbers 37 001-163. The locomotives with numbers 37 201-206 were, by contrast, G 6 and P 6 class engines respectively of Lübeck-Büchen Railway (LBE), that had a different design from the Prussian locomotives.|$|E
50|$|During {{locomotive}} running, unburnt {{pieces of}} coal, ash and cinders {{lodged in the}} heating and <b>smoke</b> <b>tubes,</b> which therefore had to be cleaned out at specified intervals. Usually, this process took place every 500 to 1,000 kilometres. The tube cleaning equipment consisted of a mobile work platform and a compressed air pipe to blow through the heating and <b>smoke</b> <b>tubes.</b> For this activity, an employee (the tube cleaner) carried out this job on a designated siding. Cleaning all the tubes could take about an hour. A DR Class 01.5, for example, had 168 heating and <b>smoke</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R

50|$|From {{the third}} series (01 077 et seq.) the boilers were {{delivered}} with longer <b>smoke</b> <b>tubes</b> {{and thus a}} shorter firebox. All engines originally had a central lock for the smokebox door. The first locomotives had gas lighting on delivery; from 01 010 they had electrical lighting and the last few batches were given a third headlight.|$|R
50|$|These steam {{locomotives}} {{were brought}} into service, {{after it was}} clear that the Saxon Class I V (later DRG Class 55) could no longer the demands placed on it. The locomotive had a hollow, Klien-Lindner axle at the back and, initially, a long steam collection pipe above the centre of the boiler which was replaced on later models by two steam domes and a connecting pipe. Twenty machines were delivered by the firm of Hartmann as wet steam engines, a further 30 with a Schmidt <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> superheater.|$|E
5000|$|Locomotives {{fitted with}} a {{superheater}} will usually have a superheater header in the smokebox. Steam enters the header as [...] "wet" [...] (saturated) steam, and then passes through a superheater element. This {{takes the form of}} a pipe which runs twice through an enlarged <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> in the boiler. The steam enters a separate chamber in the header, this time as superheated or dry steam. The advantage of superheating is that the steam has greater expansive properties when entering the cylinders, so more power can be gained from a smaller amount of water and fuel.|$|E
5000|$|This {{limitation}} led to {{the weight}} savings in many areas. At first, the plate frame was made of 22 mm thick material; this later had to be changed to the usual 25 mm. On the first few engines, a smokebox superheater was installed, but the design this was changed {{during the first year}} in favour of a Schmidt <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> superheater. The long boiler was located well forward in order to spread the weight to the front carrying wheels and to keep the axle load within the maximum limits, thus giving the engine the typical appearance of a [...] "Garbe locomotive".|$|E
50|$|In Germany too, {{locomotive}} sheds {{often had}} tube cleaning equipment (Rohrblasgerüst) {{which was used}} to blow through the boiler tubes. This tube cleaning, carried out by a steam lance, {{had to be done}} once a week.

50|$|It was {{not until}} about 1839 that the truly {{portable}} engine appeared, allowing the application of steam power {{beyond the confines of}} the farmyard. William Tuxford of Boston, Lincolnshire started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal <b>smoke</b> <b>tubes.</b> A single cylinder and the crankshaft were mounted on top of the boiler, and the whole assembly was mounted on four wheels: the front pair being steerable and fitted with shafts for horse-haulage between jobs. A large flywheel was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. Several Tuxford engines were displayed at the Royal Agricultural Society's Show at Bristol in 1842, and other manufacturers soon joined in, using the basic design of the Tuxford engine as a pattern for the majority of portable engines produced thereafter.|$|R

40|$|This Bureau of Mines {{investigation}} addressed {{two primary}} issues of air velocity measurement in mines: the determination {{and use of}} correction factors, {{and the development of}} guidelines for the selection of a suitable site at which the measurements should be taken. Other facets of the investigation included a comparison of measurement methods and devices, and aircourse cross-sectional area measurement. The study consisted of theoretical, laboratory, and in- mine investigations. The measurement devices included in the experimental phase were vane anemometer, vortex shedding anemometer, a prototype thermoanemometer, <b>smoke</b> <b>tube,</b> and oil of wintergreen sprayer. The measurement methods included single-point centerline, timed-point traverse, continuous traverse for the anemometers, and various distances and cloud positions for the <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> and oil of wintergreen devices. The study resulted in guidelines for measurement site selection that are applicable to most in-mine situations. It also showed that the use of correction factors is problematic. There are many potential pitfalls and there are cogent arguments against using certain correction factors.

Conversely, the constraints imposed on the fixed-point sensors are more rigorous because they are capable of measuring the airflow at only one point (Thimons and Kohler 1985).|$|E

40|$|Fire tube boiler is a {{one type}} of boiler. It is {{developed}} as {{the second of the}} three major historical types of boilers which are low-pressure tank, fire tube boiler and high-pressure water tube boiler.

40|$|The {{vaporization}} {{of tungsten}} from the APT spallation target dominates the radiological source term for unmitigated target overheating accidents. Chemical reactions of tungsten with steam which persist to tungsten temperatures {{as low as}} 800 C result {{in the formation of}} a hydrated tungsten-oxide which has a high vapor pressure and is readily convected in a flowing atmosphere. This low-temperature vaporization reaction essentially removes the oxide film that forms on the tungsten-metal surface as soon as it forms, leaving behind a fresh metallic surface for continued oxidation and vaporization. Experiments were conducted to measure the oxidative vaporization rates of tungsten in steam as part of the effort to quantify the MT radiological source term for severe target accidents. Tests were conducted with tungsten rods (1 / 8 inch diameter, six inches long) heated to temperatures from approximately 700 C to 1350 C in flowing steam which was superheated to 140 C. A total of 19 experiments was conducted. Fifteen tests were conducted by RF induction heating of single tungsten rods held vertical in a quartz glass retort. Four tests were conducted in a vertically-mounted tube furnace for the low temperature range of the test series. The aerosol which was generated and transported downstream from the tungsten rods was collected by passing the discharged steam through a condenser. This procedure insured total collection of the steam along with the aerosol from the vaporization of the rods. The results of these experiments revealed a threshold temperature for tungsten vaporization in steam. For the two tests at the lowest temperatures which were tested, approximately 700 C, the tungsten rods were observed to oxidize without vaporization. The remainder of the tests was conducted over the temperature range of 800 C to 1350 C. In these tests, the rods were found to have lost weight due to vaporization of the tungsten and the missing weight was collected in the downstream condensate system. The aerosol formed a fine white smoke of tungsten-oxide which was visible to the eye as it condensed in the laminar boundary layer of steam which flowed along the surface of the rod. The aerosol continued to flow as a <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> downstream of the rod, flowing coaxially along the centerline axis of the quartz glass tube and depositing by impaction along the outside of a bend and at sudden area contractions in the piping. The vaporization rate data from the 17 experiments which exceeded the vaporization threshold temperature are shown in Figure 5 in the form of vaporization rates (g/cm{sup 2 } s) vs. inverse temperature (K{sup {minus} 1 }).

40|$|The use of Podiatry {{services}} is increasing and {{the exposure to}} dust and noise in Podiatry facilities has not been well documented in the literature. Concern for exposure to dust and noise has been raised due {{to the amount of}} particles seen when grinding and sanding custom moulded shoe inserts. Shoe inserts are made from a range of materials including polypropylene, polyurethane foams, ethylene/acetate copolymers, vinyl acetate and aluminina trihydrate. Monitoring for PM 2. 5, PM 10 and noise was undertaken in a teaching podiatry laboratory on two days to ascertain if they were at a level hazardous to health. In addition the ventilation system was assessed to determine if the capture velocities were sufficient to determine if the current ventilation system is sufficient to control the potential hazards. Because the laboratory is used by a variety of students during the day, static monitoring was undertaken in preference to personal sampling so that a broad range of exposures could be determined. The results of the dust monitoring shows that the levels of PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were within levels considered adequate from a public health viewpoint although peaks did occur during the clean-up of the laboratory. Noise monitoring highlighted that although the average levels were acceptable there is concern that a number of machines have noise levels exceeding 80 dBA.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively evaluate hood leakage by measuring face velocity and turbulence during a volume generating process designed to simulate a hot process, defined here as any operation producing high temperature gases. A hot process has been recognized as a causal factor in the leakage of contaminants from laboratory fume hoods since 1950. A literature search reveals that during the last couple of decades only Johnson et al. reported a quantitative linear relationship between thermal loading and breathing zone trace gas concentrations using the ASHRAE 110 - 1995 method. Hot processes may well be the most common and least recognized of the operational factors able to cause fume hoods to leak. For hood performance testing, I conducted smoke tests and face velocity tests. Smoke tests were executed by means of <b>smoke</b> <b>tubes</b> and <b>smoke</b> matches as screening tools for hood leakage. Face velocity tests were conducted at 16 points arranged to represent equal areas of the hood face when the sash was fully opened. Face velocity data were indexed in time and space and used to estimate turbulence. By assuming corresponding samples were collected simultaneously, turbulence parameters were computed as both spatial and temporal averages of the velocity pressure. Turbulence is represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to average face velocity at each measurement point. Turbulence is generated by pressure differences occurring between the velocity pressure at the hood face and the volume generating rate that simulates a hot process. Through the average face velocity and turbulence measurements, I found that at a fixed exhaust flow, with a fixed injection volume flow, turbulence is stronger in the open sash position than in the reduced sash position. Further, turbulence associated with a volume generating process is more evident in the space-based data than in the time-based data. Face velocity at each point tends to decrease in a hood when the flow injected by a volume generating process increases. These data suggest that when a hood is operated with a volume generating process, leakage can be minimized by reducing the sash opening, by not positioning any object within six inches of the hood face, and by keeping face velocities stable...|$|R
