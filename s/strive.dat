5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may <b>strive</b> for truth, it may also <b>strive</b> for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that competitive, insecure <b>striving</b> (<b>striving</b> to avoid inferiority) has strong links with mood disorders, self-harm, and appearance anxiety. However, with rates of reported self-harm in young people rising, it seems important to explore the link between competitive <b>striving</b> and self-harm in young adults. Ninety participants completed a series of questionnaires which measured <b>striving</b> to avoid inferiority, self-harm, mood, social comparison, goal orientation, and self-ideals. The results indicated that competitive insecure <b>striving</b> was significantly related to self-harm, depression, anxiety, and stress...|$|R

5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these.

40|$|Objectives: Recent {{research}} suggests that self-oriented perfectionism may be similar to conscientious achievement <b>striving.</b> Flett and Hewitt (2006) have argued, however, that despite some similarities, there are also critical theoretical differences. The {{purpose of the current}} investigation was to examine differences between self-oriented perfectionism and conscientious achievement <b>striving</b> in terms of their relationship with core dimensions of perfectionism. Method: A sample comprising 255 male cricket players (age M = 15. 51 SD = 1. 63) from British county cricket academies completed measures of self-oriented perfectionism, conscientious achievement <b>striving</b> and various other dimensions of perfectionism (e. g., high standards, perfectionistic <b>striving,</b> selfcriticism,and fear of failure). Results: Analyses indicated that self-oriented perfectionism and conscientious achievement <b>striving</b> shared an association with high standards and perfectionistic <b>striving.</b> However, self-oriented perfectionism was also positively related to concern over mistakes, a fear of failure and negative reactions to imperfection. Further, the relationship between self-oriented perfectionism and both high standards and perfectionistic <b>striving</b> remained significant after controlling for conscientious achievement <b>striving.</b> Conclusion: The findings suggest that these two achievement related personality factors are distinct and are likely to have divergent consequences for junior athletes...|$|R

50|$|The {{four stages}} of life {{complete}} the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.

The other three strivings are Artha - the <b>striving</b> for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; Kama - the <b>striving</b> for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and Moksa - the <b>striving</b> for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu Dharma.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and <b>strive</b> to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E
