The fort sustained heavy damage to its <b>surface</b> <b>installations</b> and the Germans entered the perimeter on 15 May, but did not take the fort. A 20 May assault was held off with help from the Fort de Battice. Another assault the next day brought the fort's surrender, as it was nearly out of ammunition. There were significant casualties on both sides during the battle. The fort's garrison was taken by the Germans to Königsberg in East Prussia for five years. During the German occupation the fort was used for bunker buster bombs testing like the Röchling shell, causing major damage. The Belgian Army, whose property the fort remains, decided to leave the damage rather than attempt to restore it in 1989.|$|E

2500|$|Actions in the Briançon {{area were}} focused on {{the threat posed by}} the mountaintop {{batteries}} at [...] the Italian Fort Chaberton, armed with eight 149mm guns in turrets. On 17 June 1940, Chaberton opened fire on the Fort de l'Olive, with little effect. The next day, infantry pressure was applied around the Cleyda blockhouse, and fire was exchanged between Italian batteries and ouvrage Janus. By the 20th, Italian forces of the Assietta Division were infiltrating around Montgenèvre and Chaberton was firing on Janus, Gondran, les Aittes and Infernet, cutting electricity to Janus. Janus operated on local power while a battery of 280mm mortars of the 154th Position Artillery Regiment (154e Régiment d'Artillerie de Position) was set up in two locations near Gondran and Infernet. Several columns of Italian infantry made probing attacks in the vicinity of [...] Cerveyrette. On the 21st, Chaberton fired on Janus and Gondran, firing about 900 shells at Janus alone, causing moderate damage to the <b>surface</b> <b>installations.</b> However, the French mortar batteries were by this time in place. Fire from the heavy mortars damaged five of the eight Italian guns of Chaberton. The next day was relatively quiet, apart from some infantry infiltration by the Italian Sforzesca Division near the base of the Janus massif. [...] Skirmishing took place on the 23rd, when the Italians captured the avant-poste Est du Chenaillet. Chaberton began firing again, receiving counter-battery fire from the French batteries in reply. [...] The exchange continued the next day, and stopped only when the armistice took effect on the 25th, with six of eight Italian gun positions destroyed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMusculoskeletal {{injury is}} the leading cause of racehorse {{attrition}} and fatalities. Many factors have been implicated in racehorse musculoskeletal injury, including race surface. Race surface material has been shown to affect ground reaction forces applied to the hoof, limb kinematics, surface dynamic mechanical behavior, and incidence of injury. The optimal interaction of the racehorse hoof with the race surface during locomotion is unknown. Further, the effect of surface on limb biomechanics has only been examined by installing a surface and observing horses during gallop across the <b>surface.</b> <b>Installation</b> of new <b>surfaces</b> is financially costly, results in lost training time, and does not allow a thorough evaluation of possible mechanisms of injury associated with surface/hoof interactions. A computational equine limb-surface simulation model is needed to examine racehorse limb biomechanics on virtual surfaces, and further to consider the possible musculoskeletal consequences of a <b>surface,</b> prior to <b>installation.</b> A racetrack <b>surface</b> model was developed for use in musculoskeletal modelling and simulation applications. Surface parameters were determined by fitting empirical force, displacement, and velocity data collected during vertical and angled dynamic soil tests using a track-testing device. Simulations of the dynamic soil tests on the surface closely reproduced measured load and displacement data. In the future, this surface model may be incorporated in racehorse limb simulations of gallop using virtual surface parameters to predict the optimal surface mechanical properties for musculoskeletal health during racing and training...|$|R
