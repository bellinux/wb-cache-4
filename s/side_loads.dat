2500|$|The optimal {{approach}} is {{from behind and}} below (not level with) the drogue. [...] Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. [...] After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. [...] This opens the tanker's main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). [...] Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> on the probe. [...] Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. [...] If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light. [...] Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} investigations on {{the nozzle}} start-up <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics were performed. The {{objective of this}} study is to identify the three-dimensional <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics and to compute the associated aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>load</b> using an anchored computational methodology. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, and pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and a simulated inlet condition based on a system calculation. Finite-rate chemistry was used throughout the study so that combustion effect is always included, and the effect of wall cooling on <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics is studied. The <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics captured include the afterburning wave, transition from free- shock to restricted-shock separation, and lip Lambda shock oscillation. With the adiabatic nozzle, free-shock separation reappears after the transition from free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation, and the subsequent flow pattern of the simultaneous free-shock and restricted-shock separations creates a very asymmetric Mach disk flow. With the cooled nozzle, the more symmetric restricted-shock separation persisted throughout the start-up transient after the transition, leading to an overall lower <b>side</b> <b>load</b> than that of the adiabatic nozzle. The tepee structures corresponding to the maximum <b>side</b> <b>load</b> were addressed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bending fatigue {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of gears. The method of gear fatigue design was {{discussed}} in many papers. Most of them are based on GB/T 3480 - 83. But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single <b>side</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. For double <b>sides</b> <b>loaded</b> gear, only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single <b>side</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. A new formula based on fatigue theory is given to modify the mean stress in consideration of the load character of doubled <b>sides</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. The method given in the paper is an addition to the traditional gear design method...|$|R
50|$|The {{strain of}} <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> can be {{directly}} reduced {{with the use of}} internal stop tubes which reduce the maximum extension length, leaving some distance between the piston and bore seal, and increasing leverage to resist warping of the seals. Double pistons also spread out the forces of <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> while also reducing stroke length. Alternately, external sliding guides and hinges can support the <b>load</b> and reduce <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> forces applied directly on the cylinder.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantages}} of the cast wheels versus spoked are several, and {{include the use of}} tubeless tires for higher speed and better retention of inflation; better runout tolerance and the elimination of spoke maintenance; better rigidity and thus better handling; weight reduction due to smaller hub size; and better handling of <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> for motorcycles with sidecar rigs.|$|E
40|$|Two {{cold flow}} {{subscale}} nozzles were tested for <b>side</b> <b>load</b> characteristics during simulated nozzle start transients. The two test article contours were a truncated ideal and a parabolic. The current paper {{is an extension}} of a 2009 AIAA JPC paper on the test results for the same two nozzle test articles. The <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments were measured with the strain tube approach in MSFC s Nozzle Test Facility. The processing techniques implemented to convert the strain gage signals into <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moment data are explained. Nozzle wall pressure profiles for separated nozzle flow at many NPRs are presented and discussed in detail. The effect of the test cell diffuser inlet on the parabolic nozzle s wall pressure profiles for separated flow is shown. The maximum measured <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments for the two contours are compared. The truncated ideal contour s peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moment was 45 % of that of the parabolic contour. The calculated <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments, via mean-plus-three-standard-deviations at each nozzle pressure ratio, reproduced the characteristics and absolute values of measured maximums for both contours. The effect of facility vibration on the measured <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments is quantified and the effect on uncertainty is calculated. The nozzle contour designs are discussed and the impact of a minor fabrication flaw in the nozzle contours is explained...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} investigations on {{the start-up}} <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics for a regeneratively cooled, high-aspect-ratio nozzle were performed. The objectives {{of this study}} are to identify the three-dimensional <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics and to compute the associated aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>load</b> using an anchored computational methodology. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and a transient inlet condition based on an engine system simulation. Computations were performed for both the adiabatic and cooled walls {{in order to understand the}} effect of boundary conditions. Finite-rate chemistry was used throughout the study so that combustion effect is always included. The results show that three types of shock evolution are responsible for side loads: generation of combustion wave; transitions among free-shock separation, restricted-shock separation, and simultaneous free-shock and restricted shock separations; along with oscillation of shocks across the lip. Wall boundary conditions drastically affect the computed <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics: the adiabatic nozzle prefers free-shock separation while the cooled nozzle favors restricted-shock separation, resulting in higher peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> for the cooled nozzle than that of the adiabatic nozzle. By comparing the computed physics with those of test observations, it is concluded that cooled wall is a more realistic boundary condition, and the oscillation of the restricted-shock separation flow pattern across the lip along with its associated tangential shock motion are the dominant <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics for a regeneratively cooled, high aspect-ratio rocket engine...|$|R

50|$|Drill presses {{are often}} used for {{miscellaneous}} workshop tasks other than drilling holes. This includes sanding, honing, and polishing. These tasks can be performed by mounting sanding drums, honing wheels and various other rotating accessories in the chuck. This can be unsafe in some cases, as the chuck arbor, which may be retained in the spindle solely by the friction of a taper fit, may dislodge during operation if the <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> are too high.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{software}} packages that {{are capable of}} solving the rotor dynamic system of equations. Rotor dynamic specific codes are more versatile for design purposes. These codes make it easy to add bearing coefficients, <b>side</b> <b>loads,</b> and many other items only a rotordynamicist would need. The non-rotor dynamic specific codes are full featured FEA solvers, and have many years of development in their solving techniques. The non-rotor dynamic specific codes {{can also be used to}} calibrate a code designed for rotor dynamics.|$|E
40|$|The contour {{inflection}} of {{the dual}} bell nozzle forces the flow to a symmetrical and controlled separation under sea level conditions. At a certain altitude, {{the transition to}} high altitude mode takes place: the flow attaches rapidly the nozzle extension wall down to the exit plane. During this transition, the separation point moves in the extension generating potential high <b>side</b> <b>load</b> peaks due to its asymmetrical position. A campaign of cold flow tests has been conducted to evaluate the generation of <b>side</b> <b>load.</b> The phenomenology during each phase of the flow has been presented {{in the first part}} of this work. The influence of the various geometrical parameters on flow behavior and <b>side</b> <b>load</b> generation is investigated in this study. The extension length is shown to be the critical parameter for flow stability, transition duration and <b>side</b> <b>load</b> generation. A trade off has to be found for the optimization of the dual bell concept to rocket applications...|$|R

50|$|An {{unrelated}} {{effect in}} terraced houses is the claimed 'bookend effect'. This claims that <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> {{from the central}} houses cause the end houses, particularly their end walls, to bulge outwards. The effect arises from cyclical expansion and contraction effects, both daily and annually. As the terrace expands, the end walls are pushed outwards, leading to cracking in walls or lozenge distortion of door and window frames. As the terrace contracts again, the usual weaknesses of building materials in tension cannot recover these movements entirely and the cracks remain. This effect is most pronounced in taller structures, those of four storeys and taller. The existence, or not, of this effect is itself controversial.|$|E
50|$|Bracing wires {{primarily}} {{divide into}} flying wires which hold the wings down when flying and landing wires which hold the wings {{up when they}} are not generating lift. (The wires connecting a basket or gondola to a balloon are also called flying wires.) Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage. In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, bracing wires must also carry powerful inertial loads generated during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the landing wires at the moment of touchdown.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{very rare}} that a coil would just stop working in an {{electromagnetic}} coupling [...] Typically, if a coil fails it is usually due to heat which has caused the insulation of the coil wire to break down. The heat {{can be caused by}} high ambient temperature, high cycle rates, slipping or applying too high of a voltage. Bushings can be used in some clutches that have low speed, low <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> or low operating hours. At higher loads and speeds, bearing mounted field/rotors and hubs are a better option. Most brakes are flanged mounted and have bearings but some brakes are bearing mounted. Like the coils, unless bearings are stressed beyond their physical limitations or become contaminated, they tend to have a long life and they are usually the second item to wear out.|$|E

5000|$|Trials bike rims are {{significantly}} wider than those used for cross country, downhill and BMX bikes. Wider rims mean that any given tyre fitted {{to the rim}} will hold a bigger volume of air thanks to the tyre beads being held further apart by the rim. This means the tyre has a wider contact patch and therefore can be run at lower tyre pressure. The change in volume of a tyre on a wide rim when landed on a sharp corner will tend to be {{greater than that of}} a narrow rim, which again leads to improved pinch puncture resistance, critical for trials as landing on sharp edges is a very common requirement of both competition and street trials. A wider rim also makes it much harder for a tyre to roll off the rim when exposed to <b>side</b> <b>loads,</b> again a very common occurrence in trials riding.|$|E
50|$|Seat belts are {{an obvious}} example of webbings used in auto safety {{but there are}} myriad other uses. Nylon and {{polyester}} webbing are used {{a great deal in}} auto racing safety for a large variety of items. Racing harnesses restraining the driver have used nylon webbing for years, but since the death of Dale Earnhardt polyester webbing is becoming more popular due to its increased strength, and lower rate of elongation under load. The nylon commercial type 9 webbing generally used in racing harnesses stretches approximately 20 to 30 percent of its initial length at 2500 lb (11.1 kN) while polyester only stretches 5 to 15 percent. Window nets to prevent objects from entering the driver compartment are constructed of polypropylene webbing, as are helmet nets used to reduce <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> to the head in Sprint cars. The HANS device uses webbing tethers to attach the helmet to the collar, and the Hutchens device is made almost entirely of webbing.|$|E
