5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown {{scraping}} the bottom twice. Each time she was able to pull free, and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness. They had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01:22 the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary. A naval <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> demanded their identification.|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{produced}} between 1965 - 1979 were {{equipped with}} old-style lights: turn <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> were colorless (white), rear lights were round, {{and the back}} of the body was rounder. Subsequent post-1979 models got amber (yellow) <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> and rear lights were slightly bigger and rectangular.|$|R

5|$|Once the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> in the {{locomotive}} turns green, {{the journey from}} the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where {{the locomotive}} takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{recognizing}} <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> in traeic scenes {{in real time}} has been developed. It consists {{of a set of}} different feature extraction operations acting as sequential filters. In order to be classified as part of the image of an active <b>signaling</b> <b>light,</b> a set of pixels must pass each one of these filters. This multifilter approach is model-based, and it comprises much of the available knowledge about <b>signaling</b> <b>lights.</b> In addition to color, this includes characteristics like the locations of the lights relative to the vehicle, their size, symmetry, and blinking frequencies. The individual filters, and the way how they cooperate, have been designed {{in such a way that}} the system recognizes active <b>signaling</b> <b>lights</b> reliably, while false alarms are largely avoided. We have implemented the approach on a real-time vision system and tested it both in simulations under approximately real conditions and in real highway scenes by using a robot-car...|$|R

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 3 March 2004, a Seremban-bound KTM Komuter train in the Seremban Line {{collided}} with the rear of another Komuter train facing the same direction, which had been waiting at a signal between Tiroi station and Seremban station for five minutes. Forty were injured, but no deaths were reported. The accident was ascribed to the faulty <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> (struck by lightning) that stopped the earlier train, though {{the driver of the}} rear-ending train is reported to have run a red light into the section occupied by the rear-ended train. The resulting crash disrupted KTM Komuter services along the line for a day. This is so far the worst accident involving the KTM Komuter service.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} police {{telephones}} in Britain {{were introduced in}} Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, {{as well as a}} mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} terminus of the freeway, SR 143 {{begins at the}} intersection of 48th Street and Broadway, climbing over Interstate 10 on the original 48th Street bridge built without any shoulder lanes in 1967. Traffic heading southbound at this point is warned of a traffic signal that hides over the optical horizon of the overpass to most traffic. To combat safety issues raised by the lack of visibility of the main traffic signals, a second traffic signal was installed at a higher elevation so that it is visible to traffic on the northern approach of the overpass. At one point, the second signal included a high-intensity strobe embedded in the red signal; however, the strobe has since been removed. In addition to the strobing <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> rumble strips have been cut into the bridge deck at several intervals, and there is a sign that turns on if the signal is red and the speed limit is reduced, further alerting traffic that the freeway is ending.|$|E

25|$|In May 1966 the Australian Government, {{responding}} to {{the changing nature of}} international shipping, granted permission for the Queensland Government to construct a composite structure comprising lighthouse, signal station and radar station, on the lighthouse reserve at Caloundra Head. The new structure was part of a pilot station scheme based at the Mooloolah River, and was to serve as a guide to the North West Channel and a <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> for Caloundra Harbour. Fully completed and operational by 1968, the new lighthouse was erected close to the 1896 lighthouse and for a time the two towers stood side by side. Constructed in reinforced concrete, the new lighthouse resembled an airport control tower. A new light that used a revolving table and comprised two stacks of sealed beam lamps was designed and installed. It was manned 24 hours a day and four houses were built outside the reserve to accommodate the staff and their families. A similar signal station tower was constructed at Lytton Hill, making the Caloundra tower one of only two of this type built in Australia. With the Lytton Hill tower being demolished in the 1990s, the Caloundra tower remains the only surviving example.|$|E
25|$|Buick's largest, plushest {{and most}} {{expensive}} models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders {{culminating in a}} sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
500|$|For all {{of their}} efficiency, atomic line filters are not perfect; there are many sources of error, or [...] "noise", in a given system. These are {{manifest}} as electromagnetic radiation independent of the working processes of the filter {{and the intensity of}} the <b>signal</b> <b>light.</b> One source of error is the thermal radiation of and within the ALF itself. Some thermal radiation comes directly from the filter and happens to be within the bandpass of the second broad band filter. More noise is created if the filter is designed for output in the infrared range, as most of the thermal radiation would be in that spectrum. These emissions may stimulate the vapor and create the radiation it is trying to detect in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> (at night). <b>Signal</b> <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|R

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 November 1941, Sydney was {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, near Carnarvon, and heading south towards Fremantle. Around 15:55, the cruiser spotted a merchant ship on a northbound course, which quickly turned away from the coast at [...] Sydney increased speed to [...] and made to intercept. As she closed the gap, Sydney began to signal the unidentified merchantman, first by <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> then after no reply was forthcoming and the distance between the two ships had decreased, by a combination of light and signal flag. The merchant ship hoisted her callsign, but as she was ahead and just port of Sydney, the flags were obscured by the funnel. A request from the cruiser that the merchant ship make her signal letters clear, which the signals officer did by lengthening the halyard and swinging the flags clear. The callsign was that of the Dutch ship Straat Malakka, but she was not on Sydneys list of ships meant to be in the area. Further flag signals were exchanged between the ships, with Sydney asking the Dutch ship's destination and cargo.|$|E
500|$|The Military Landing Officer, Major J. R. Broadbent {{landed with}} the first wave in the same LCP(R) as Pike. With him was an Amphibian Scout {{carrying}} the red <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> that was to mark {{the centre of the}} beach for later waves. They were unable to reach the correct location in time for the second wave, but were able to place it and switch it on in time for the third, so it was the first to land on Scarlet Beach. Although the first wave had landed seven minutes late, the second was fifteen, and the third was half an hour behind schedule. In the confusion, two LCIs collided, killing two soldiers and injuring eight. [...] Some of the LCI captains were reluctant to drive their ships in hard enough, and many troops disembarked into water that was over their heads. Sergeant Iaking Iwagu, of the Royal Papuan Constabulary, landing with 9 Platoon of the Papuan Infantry Battalion, was awarded the George Medal for attempting to save Captain A. B. Luetchford, who was hit in deep water. The third wave found the Japanese bunkers still manned, and assaulted them. Most of the Japanese defenders withdrew rather than fight to the finish.|$|E

Station {{adjacent}} to Disneyland's entrance, where a pump-style handcar {{built by the}} Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company {{can be seen on}} a siding, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. The train will take around 18 minutes to complete a round trip on the main line when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running; on any given day, between two and four trains run, with three trains running on average. An engineer accompanied by a fireman operates the locomotive, while conductors {{at each end of the}} train supervise the passengers. Prior to departing Main Street, U.S.A. Station, the engineer must confirm whether the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> in the locomotive's cab is green, indicating that the track segment ahead is clear, or red, indicating that the track segment ahead is occupied by another train. The DRR's route is divided into eleven such segments, or blocks, and each locomotive has a block signal in its cab to communicate the status of each block. Prior to the installation of cab signalling in the locomotives around 2005, the status of each block along the railroad's [...] of main-line track was displayed by track-side block signals, of which only the ones at the four stations remain.|$|E
