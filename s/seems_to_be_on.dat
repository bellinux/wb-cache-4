5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government. Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja (still a minor at 15) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{romance novels}} {{are the most}} popular {{literary}} genre, comprising almost 55% of all paperback books sold in 2004. The genre is also popular in Europe and Australia, and romance novels appear in 90 languages. Most of the books, however, are written by authors from English-speaking countries, leading to an Anglo-Saxon perspective in the fiction. Despite the popularity and widespread sales of romance novels, the genre has attracted significant derision, skepticism, and criticism. Romance erotica <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the rise as more women explore this new subgenre.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get {{over the top of the}} hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|Goblin Island {{became the}} first in the {{so-called}} Scottish Sequence of six titles, four of which are set largely in Scotland: Goblin Island itself, set on 'Loch Avie', a fictionalised Loch Lomond; Princess in Tatters, set on 'Loch Ruel', which may be Loch Fyne; A Holiday Queen, set at 'Morven' on what appears to be Loch Long; and Schoolgirls and Scouts set at 'Glenleny', which also <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> Loch Long, but a bit further up the loch. Of the other two in the series, Twins of Castle Charming - perhaps Oxenham's rarest title - is set largely in Switzerland, whereas Finding Her Family has some early scenes set in Ealing and mainly takes place in Saltburn.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{mobilization}} of 1915 the Bulgarian General Staff was left with few unmobilized reservists. In order to secure a source of reinforcements for the army it opened new military schools for young infantry, cavalry, artillery officers and soldiers. Thus {{from the end of}} 1915 until the beginning of 1918 the four regular annual contingents of young conscripts were called and received their training. Their total number was 214,343 and was sufficient for the replacing the 181,515 casualties that had occurred. The exact number of all the mobilized men during the war however remains unclear. Some sources point at a number of 1,200,000 men which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the high side but still may be close to the truth. When trying to determine the precise number it {{must be taken into account}} that towards September 1918 the Bulgarian Army reached a strength ranging between 855,175 and 877,392 men under arms in all branches of the service, or some 18% of the population, and that for the duration of the war the army also used the manpower of the territories it had occupied – some 133,837 men from the Macedonian regions were mobilized.|$|E

500|$|During the [...] and [...] seasons, Sidle <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a {{downward}} spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. Also, the fact that Grissom decided to promote Nick Stokes instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is driving under the influence, she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to bring her home, and finally seems to notice her emotional state. Later, in , she loses her temper with a domestic abuse suspect and then argues with supervisors Catherine Willows and Conrad Ecklie, which results in her suspension. Following this incident, she admits to Grissom {{that she has a}} problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak. Sidle then opens up to him and reveals her family story; it is during this season that she apparently starts bonding with Grissom. During the subsequent seasons ( [...] and [...] ), after it is revealed that they are in a relationship, she appears to be happier and on a more even keel.|$|E
500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{says that}} [...] "the eight-legged horse of Odin is the typical steed of the shaman" [...] {{and that in}} the shaman's {{journeys}} to the heavens or the underworld, a shaman [...] "is usually represented as riding on some bird or animal." [...] Davidson says that while the creature may vary, the horse is fairly common [...] "in the lands where horses are in general use, and Sleipnir's ability to bear the god through the air is typical of the shaman's steed" [...] and cites an example from a study of shamanism by Mircea Eliade of an eight-legged foal from a story of a Buryat shaman. Davidson says that while {{attempts have been made to}} connect Sleipnir with hobby horses and steeds with more than four feet that appear in carnivals and processions, but that [...] "a more fruitful resemblance <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the bier on which a dead man is carried in the funeral procession by four bearers; borne along thus, he may be described as riding on a steed with eight legs." [...] As an example, Davidson cites a funeral dirge from the Gondi people in India as recorded by Verrier Elwin, stating that [...] "it contains references to Bagri Maro, the horse with eight legs, and it is clear from the song that it is the dead man's bier." [...] Davidson says that the song is sung when a distinguished Muria dies, and provides a verse: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. Everything <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E
