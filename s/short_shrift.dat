Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} {{knowledge}} of Wilfrid are the medieval Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and {{the works of}} the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's Vita is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The Vita is selective in its coverage, and gives <b>short</b> <b>shrift</b> to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the Vita is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives, {{as was the case with}} Stephen's work. It appears that the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.|$|E

For Friedman, globalization is emboldening people in countries, like in India, to make societal and governmental demands {{that are similar to}} those made by Americans in the United States. This Essay seeks to add a new layer to the debate over Friedman’s flattening-world thesis. Focusing on India, in particular, I shall argue that as the trajectory of India’s economic development appears on the rise, the sad reality is that too many observers, like Friedman, have ignored how the functioning of the country’s legal system is spiraling downward Furthermore, as I shall also suggest, Freidman’s thesis that {{globalization has}} indelibly altered human behavior, unfortunately <b>short</b> <b>shrifts</b> how preexisting institutional and cultural factors still remain relevant in shaping decision-making processes...|$|R
40|$|Employee {{turnover}} {{continues to}} be one of the most vexing and costly challenges in the hospitality industry. Despite the obvious expense of turnover, few studies have attempted to account for the diverse costs associated with replacing staff. Rather than estimate the cost of turnover, the web-based tool described in this report compiles the specific costs of turnover in the following five categories: pre-departure costs, recruiting costs, selection costs, orientation and training costs, and the cost of lost productivity. Looking specifically at turnover among front-desk associates, recruiting constitutes a substantial portion of turnover costs. The greatest expense, however, that of lost front-desk productivity, may also be the most overlooked. A case study that examines one hotel company 2 ̆ 7 s fast-track management-training program for college graduates found that training costs are a substantial portion of the hiring process-an expense that is magnified by a 25 -percent attrition of trainees. Both with the web-based data and the case study, the effects of turnover on existing employees and supervisors appear to be given <b>shorter</b> <b>shrift</b> than they deserve. Further participants in the web-based study would be instrumental in solidifying the costs of turnover for the lodging industry...|$|R

25|$|The guerrilla can be {{difficult}} to beat, but certain principles of counter-insurgency warfare are well known since the 1950s and 1960s and have been successfully applied. The widely distributed and influential work of Sir Robert Thompson, counter-insurgency expert of the Malayan Emergency, offers several such guidelines. Thompson's underlying assumption is that of a country minimally committed {{to the rule of law}} and better governance. Some governments, however, give such considerations <b>short</b> <b>shrift,</b> and their counter-insurgency operations have involved mass murder, genocide, starvation and the massive spread of terror, torture and execution. In the Soviet war in Afghanistan for example, the Soviets countered the Mujahideen with a policy of wastage and depopulation, driving over one third of the Afghan population into exile (over 5 million people), and carrying out widespread destruction of villages, granaries, crops, herds and irrigation systems, including the deadly and widespread mining of fields and pastures.|$|E
5000|$|The terms First Stadtholderless Period and Second Stadtholderless Period became {{established}} as terms {{of art in}} Dutch historiography during the 19th century, the heyday of nationalistic history writing, when Dutch historians wistfully looked back on {{the glory days of}} the Dutch Revolt and the Dutch Golden Age and were looking for scapegoats for [...] "what went wrong" [...] in later years. Partisans of the new royal house of Orange-Nassau, like Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, who were indeed continuing the traditions of the Orangist party during the Republic, recast that history as a heroic narrative of the exploits of the stadtholders of the House of Orange (interestingly, the Frisian stadtholders from the House of Nassau-Dietz, though the forebears of the House of Orange-Nassau, were less prominently featured). Anybody who had stood in the way of those stadtholders, like the representatives of the States Party, eminently fitted the role of [...] "bad guys" [...] in these romantic stories.

5000|$|Riverside Park was {{conceived}} in 1866 and formally {{approved by the}} state legislature {{through the efforts of}} city parks commissioner Andrew Haswell Green. The first segment of park was acquired through condemnation in 1872, and construction soon began following a design created by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed the adjacent, gracefully curving Riverside Drive. In 1937, under the administration of commissioner Robert Moses, 132 acre of land were added to the park, primarily by creating a promenade that covered the tracks of the Hudson River Railroad. Moses, working with landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke also added playgrounds, and distinctive stonework and the 79th Street Boat Basin, but also cut pedestrians off from direct access to most of the riverfront by building the Henry Hudson Parkway by the river's edge. According to Robert Caro's book on Moses, The Power Broker, Riverside Park was designed with most of the amenities located in predominantly white neighborhoods, with the neighborhoods closer to Harlem getting <b>shorter</b> <b>shrift.</b> Riverside Park, like Central Park, has undergone a revival late in the 20th century, largely through the efforts of The Riverside Park Fund, a citizen's group. Largely through their efforts and the support of the city, much of the park has been improved. The Hudson River Greenway along the river-edge of the park is a popular route for pedestrians and bicycle commuters, and offers spectacular vistas. A dramatic improvement is the $15.7 million [...] "Riverwalk" [...] extension to the park's greenway constructed between 83rd and 91st Streets on a promenade in the river itself, completed in May 2010.|$|R

Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were very grateful for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853–1914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded. His brother, Frank Richardson preferred indexing the records after photographing on-site fingerprints. (He had been working in conjunction with the Home Office, London, for many years on experimenting to find the best method.) Alfred Richardson gave lectures locally on the differences between the Bertillon method and photographic fingerprinting.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the widely}} {{disparate}} political, cultural, artistic, and historical paradigms that {{fall under the}} portmanteau category of “postcolonial studies,” the island nation of Haiti stands alone. It is here, after all, {{and for the first}} time in humanity 2 ̆ 7 s history, that an army of ill-equipped, undernourished, and untrained slaves successfully prosecuted a revolutionary war, and did so against the most powerful military machine then in existence. Haiti was likewise the world 2 ̆ 7 s first black republic, the first modern nation to abolish slavery definitively, invented guerrilla warfare as we know it today, and according to the Haiti scholar Nick Nesbitt, Haitians even “invented the process of decolonization that would only take hold in the majority of European colonies a century and a half later” (Reading Revolution 28). The facts I have listed thus far are incontrovertible. In the present study it is my intention to examine the representational and discursive strategies that would seek to expunge—and for quite some time, successfully—the Haitian Revolution from the historical record, to determine how they operated, when, and why. What I plan to examine here is not, however, merely the fact that Haiti 2 ̆ 7 s remarkable revolution has been given <b>short</b> historical <b>shrift,</b> but rather, in a much broader context, how a historically, factually unique event such as the Haitian Revolution is metabolized by the various discourses—European, American, Carribean—which did not quite know what to make of it. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the verbal surface of The Faerie Queene, exploring {{the ways in which}} its diction and imagery create an allusive and self-defining poetic medium through which are projected the 'historical fiction' and qualifying perspectives upon it. Special consideration is given to the rhetoric of the poem's voice and its establishment of a complex narrator's persona. Imagery is approached first through an examination of the formal and material contributions to the narration made by simile. A characteristic circular exchange is observed in the relationship of patterns of motif in simile to the larger images of the allegorical narrative, paralleled in a similar interaction between personification at the narrative level and metaphor on the verbal surface. The 'visual' quality of the language of description and its modifications are discussed both as technical and thematic principles. Finally, the ways in which linguistic surface in vocabulary, syntax and imagery reflects and reinforces thematic ambiguities are explored, and it is suggested that ambiguity, rather than being a disease of the allegory, is a condition of its poetic breadth and didactic force. In a long allegorical poem language is likely to get <b>short</b> critical <b>shrift,</b> to be treated apart from the allegory or dipped into now and again to support allegorical explication; this study attempts to show how in The Faerie Queene, functioning as both object and sign, diction and imagery form the warp and woof of allegory. <p...|$|R

(1) brings {{some long}} overdue rigor to the epidemiology {{of what has}} come to be called multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). It also provides an opportunity to highlight work important to public health in an overlooked field, that of medically unexplained somatic symptoms. MCS along with other syndromes associated with unexplained somatic symptoms often receives rela-tively <b>short</b> scientific <b>shrift.</b> Symptoms (e. g., headache, fatigue, trouble concen-trating) account for a high proportion of medical encounters, and a surprising majority are not explained by pathologic medical conditions (2, 3). Rather than simply dismiss these "unexplained symptoms, " over at least the past two decades, practitioners and patients have coalesced these symptoms into syndromes including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyal-gia (FM), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), atypical connective tissue disease after silicone breast implants, chronic hypoglycemia, sick building syndrome (non-specific building related illness), MCS, and, most recently, Gulf War Illness. Some of the names, such as CFS, do not imply etiology or pathophysiology, while others, such as MCS, invoke chemical triggering of symptomatic episodes as well as the often implied chemical initiation of the sensitivity. Investigators have pointed out the substantial overlap between one unexplained symptom classification and another, such that 30 - 50 percent of individuals with CFS, FM, and MCS qualify (based on self-report of symptoms) for at least one of the other diagnoses (4, 5).
