The purposes of the study were to increase the knowledge of decision making for first-time <b>special</b> education <b>placements</b> of students and to identify selected factors which affect such placement decisions in regular Chicago public elementary schools. More specifically, this study determined whether or not first-time, high-incidence <b>special</b> education <b>placements</b> in multidisciplinary teams were affected by: (a) gender, (b) highest degree attained, (c) number of years in current position, (d) number of staffings, (e) climate, (f) degree of controversy, (g) decision modes, (h) appropriateness of decisions, (i) satisfaction with decisions, (j) power as good, (k) power as resource dependency, (l) power as instinctive drive, (m) power as political, (n) power as charisma, (o) power as control and autonomy. Four null hypotheses were developed and tested for statistical significance. A survey instrument containing 53 items was developed and validated. Reliability was established by means of a test-retest pilot study. Twenty subdistricts in the Chicago Public School System were asked {{to participate in the study}} and 17 agreed to be involved. A total of 137 principals, 89 regular education teachers, and 138 special education teachers provided the data for the study. The chi-square test was used to produce the frequency distribution and percentage of responses to each item on the questionnaire. The data for each part of the hypothesis was submitted to chi-square analysis via the CROSSTABS subprogram of SPSS. Each null hypothesis was tested at the. 05 level of significance. The findings of this study indicated that the special education teachers had different perceptions of the impact of the psychologists' influences on decision making in first-time <b>special</b> education <b>placements</b> than the principals and regular education teachers.

40|$|Upon {{kindergarten}} entry, {{teachers have}} {{a unique opportunity to}} compare a range of children from different backgrounds on common metrics. While some children will clearly express the skills necessary for learning at grade level, other children will be flagged for potential learning problems. For some children, this means a standardized academic track. For other students, time-limited special education will assist them with age appropriate tests and tasks. For another subgroup of children, special education services will define their learning careers, with part- or full-time <b>special</b> education <b>placements</b> outside of the regular education classroom. The goal of all of these educational placements is to provide high quality services to all children regardless of their learning abilities. The concern, however, is that some children, specifically minority and low-income children, will be flagged for services they do not need or services that will not benefit them. This study explores several predictors of special education, specifically the contribution of race, class, and gender on a child’s initial <b>placement</b> into <b>special</b> education. In the present study discrete-time survival analysis is utilized to explore the patterns of <b>placement</b> to <b>special</b> education in elementary school. In addition, the role of child gender, race/ethnicity, economic status and early cognitive skills on initial <b>special</b> education <b>placements</b> between kindergarten and 6 th grade is examined.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that Old English personal pronouns often {{turn up in}} ‘special’ positions, i. e. positions in which functionally equivalent nominals rarely, if ever, appear. Leading theories of Old English syntax (e. g. van Kemenade 1987, Pintzuk 1991, 1996, Hulk & van Kemenade 1997, Kroch & Taylor 1997) account for the syntax of specially placed pronouns in different ways, but all treat <b>special</b> <b>placement</b> as a freely available option. Focusing on pronominal objects of prepositions in particular, this thesis shows, firstly, that current theories fail {{to account for the}} variety of special positions in which these pronouns appear and argues that at least three special positions must be recognised. The central concern of this thesis, however, is whether <b>special</b> <b>placement</b> is the freely available option that leading theories assume. Drawing on evidence from a number of descriptive studies of the syntax of pronominal objects of prepositions (e. g. Wende 1915, Taylor 2008, Alcorn 2009), statistical evidence is presented to show that, in a number of contexts, the probability of <b>special</b> <b>placement</b> is either too high or else too low to be plausibly ascribed to free variation. The thesis explores the linguistic basis of each of the statistically significant parameters identified, finding answers in some cases and intriguing puzzles in others.

40|$|Many {{children}} with learning disabilities experience low social status, low self-concept, and have significant difficulties in their behavioral conduct. These deficits could either be primary or secondary to their problems. Unfortunately, {{it is difficult to know}} just how many of these significant problems are a function of the class placement, or are due to other extraneous factors. Utilizing hypotheses adduced from social comparison theory and group reference theory, this study was designed to evaluate the impact of <b>special</b> <b>placement</b> upon the socio-emotional factors of academically handicapped students. The subjects were 36 high school male students, ranging in age from 16 to 18 years of age, who have been referred to the Committee on Special Education (CSE). The CSE is a school based multi-disciplinary team that coordinates evaluations and recommends placements (i. e., self-contained, resource room) and services for {{children with}} handicapping conditions. During the first 3 weeks of their initial placement, each student (along with his current teacher) was asked to complete a questionnaire, the Behavior Assessment for Children (BASC). The student and his current teacher were then given a second administration of the questionnaire after the student had been in his placement for 6 months. All students in the <b>special</b> <b>placement</b> were compared to a mainstream comparison group on the (BASC). ^ Data analysis, utilizing a 3 x 2 repeated measures MANOVA, indicated that a significant interaction effect (placement x time) was apparent for the 3 placement groups on their academic grades, as well as the Clinical Maladjustment and Externalizing Problems scale of the (BASC).

Family socio-economic risk at birth was a significant predictor of the need for remedial services. We also assessed whether a high-quality preschool program offered at ages 3 and 4 can reduce the negative effects of low family SES and birth weight on the need for special education and grade retention. Preschool participation in the Child-Parent Centers was found to reduce the likelihood of school remediation. The effects of preschool were greater for children from families with higher levels of socio-economic disadvantage.
