25|$|The poem {{is about}} a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of his brow and does not owe anyone anything. Children coming home from school stop to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as he works, {{impressed}} by the roaring bellows and burning sparks. On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father {{after the death of}} his wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night. The narrator concludes by thanking the blacksmith for the lessons he can teach.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Gold {{receives}} {{a visit from}} The Snow Queen, who is {{ready to make a}} deal with him, as she has now figured out what his plan is. The Snow Queen knows that Gold wants to leave Storybrooke with Belle and to be free of the Dagger of Kris, while the Snow Queen wants Storybrooke all to herself, and she says that she has the secret to the missing ingredient he needs. She then asks for the ribbons, and as he gives them to her, the Snow Queen whispers the secret into his ear. Then, Mr. Gold says that he will obtain the final ingredient with great pleasure, causing the Snow Queen to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a shocked expression.|$|E
500|$|A humiliated Carrier {{wears the}} sweater to the rink where his peers <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in his blue sweater. His coach removes {{him from his}} usual forward position, holding him back as a reserve on defence. By the third period, he still has not played {{when one of his}} team's defencemen is struck with a stick. Believing his chance had finally come, Carrier jumps onto the ice, only to be given an {{immediate}} penalty by the parish priest acting as referee. The priest claims Carrier's substitution is illegal as there are already five players on the ice. Carrier is so angry that he smashes his stick on the ice in frustration, for which the priest scolds him: [...] "just because you're wearing a new Toronto Maple Leafs sweater unlike the others, it doesn't mean you're going to make the laws around here." [...] The priest sends Carrier to the church to pray for forgiveness, where Carrier instead asks God to send [...] "a hundred million moths" [...] to eat his Toronto Maple Leafs sweater.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} a musical number in which the members of Quahog sing about what they want for Christmas. Peter wishes to have actress and models Jessica Biel and Megan Fox. He also wishes {{to have lunch with}} Michael Landon's ghost and wants twelve kegs of beer. Lois wishes to visit the Spanish coasts, and [...] "Mexico, [...] with two black guys and some blow". Chris wishes for Jennifer Garner and Meg wishes for a Lexus. The neighbors of Quahog also wish for gifts: Herbert wishes for a drummer boy (there is a picture of singer Nick Jonas on the wall while he wishes for this), Mayor Adam West wishes for a tinkertoy, Carl wishes for a Blu-ray version of The Wiz and Consuela wishes for more Lemon Pledge. Continuing with the song, Jillian Russell wishes for Easter eggs, Joe wishes for one day when kids don't <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> Bonnie wants platinum-plated silverware, Quagmire wants [...] "Japanese girls of no restraint" [...] to choke him and then whip him and Mort (who is Jewish) says he will sue if they put a Christmas tree in the airport. The song ends with various {{characters}} appearing in an advent calendar.|$|E
2500|$|Incidents of anti-Semitism Greenberg faced {{included}} having players <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{and having}} racial slurs thrown at him by spectators and sometimes opposing players. [...] Examples of these imprecations were: [...] "Hey Mo!" [...] (referring to the Jewish prophet Moses) and [...] "Throw a pork chop—he can't hit that!" [...] (a reference to Judaic kosher laws). In the 1935 World Series umpire George Moriarty warned some Chicago Cubs players to stop yelling anti-Semitic slurs at Greenberg and eventually cleared the {{players from the}} Cubs bench. Moriarty was disciplined for this action by then-commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.|$|E
2500|$|In the Third Test at Melbourne Bill Edrich {{was given}} out lbw to Ray Lindwall by Umpire Scott after {{he hit the}} ball onto his pads with his bat. The bowler wrote [...] "Bill {{genuinely}} thought he hit the ball onto his pad...I saw no deviation of the ball after it pitched and I heard no click". A few minutes later he gave Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in disbelief before his walked off. Lindwall wrote that Compton [...] "made no stroke at a ball he thought had pitched outside his leg-stump, but which umpire and bowler declared pitched on {{the line of the}} leg stump", which would make Compton out. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland. Cyril Washbrook was out soon after and England collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Scott was angry with the English pressmen who accused him of making the wrong decisions, saying Edrich had not hit the ball with his bat and Washbrook had thought Compton was out (though Washbrook was several yards {{to the right of the}} umpire and so unable to judge the line of the ball).|$|E

60|$|She swung {{about with}} a start, her music {{dropping}} to the floor, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Her tattered blue kimono fell away at her elbows, her full throat was bare, and a slipper she had kicked off {{lay on the}} floor beside her.

2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
