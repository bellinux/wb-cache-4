The amounts of the credit are $30 for a person filing a return with one exemption, $40 for two exemptions, $50 for three exemptions, and $60 for four or more exemptions. This amount includes interest and is {{based on the}} tax paid by an average American household during the lookback period.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to fill the aircraft with one gallon of fuel and see how far they got. Seeing that this would lead to aircraft retrieval problems, the organisers decided that all flights must begin and end at Lypmne. Instead, each was fuelled over a gallon by a <b>standard</b> <b>amount,</b> landing when they judged they had insufficient fuel for another 12.5 miles. If they had used more than one gallon, the calculated consumption was pro rata; if they had used less than one gallon the consumption was nevertheless based on one gallon used.|$|E

Drunk-driving is strictly illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many expats have been sentenced to 80 lashes for drunk-driving. In Abu Dhabi, a man has been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public. Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.|$|E
500|$|On the Who's early US {{package tour}} at the RKO Theatre in New York in March and April 1967 Moon {{performed}} five shows a day, kicking over his drum kit after every show.

5000|$|In {{the typical}} case, the single {{functional}} allele makes sufficient protein {{to produce a}} phenotype identical {{to that of the}} homozygote: this is called haplosufficiency. For example, suppose the <b>standard</b> <b>amount</b> of enzyme produced in the functional homozygote is 100%, with the two functional alleles contributing 50% each. The single functional allele in the heterozygote produces 50% of the <b>standard</b> <b>amount</b> of enzyme, which is sufficient to produce the standard phenotype. If the heterozygote and the functional-allele homozygote have identical phenotypes, the functional allele is dominant to the non-functional allele. This occurs at the albino gene locus: the heterozygote produces sufficient enzyme to convert the pigment precursor to melanin, and the individual has standard pigmentation.|$|E
