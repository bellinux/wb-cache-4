60|$|She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her, <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the cheek: a {{stinging}} blow that filled both eyes with water.|$|E
6000|$|He said--"It's {{all right}} in summer, and it's good enough in winter--WHILE IT LASTS. You {{make the most of}} it, young 'un;" [...] and he <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the back and laughed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{distress}} yourself," [...] {{he burst}} out. [...] "You <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> before--once, years ago--for kissing you. I--I apologize for saying you lied. You're only {{out of your}} head. So am I." ...|$|E
60|$|We stopped {{long enough}} to give father a {{detailed}} account of our adventures, and by the way he <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the back after the story was brought to an end, I knew that he felt right well pleased because I had begun serving my country in such a satisfactory manner.|$|E
60|$|North {{came to see}} me in {{my three}} rooms and bath, extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night. He <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the back (I would rather have my shins kicked any day), and greeted me with out-door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits. He was insolently brown and healthy-looking, and offensively well dressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "This I know," [...] {{says her}} father, <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> on the shoulder, [...] "this I know, {{that you are}} content to see Richard without primping." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} avoid {{acknowledging}} the watch, and was rising in great confusion, when a boisterous old squire who sat beside <b>me,</b> exclaimed, <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> on the shoulder, [...] "'Sblood, lad! thou'rt {{the man as}} has seen the ghost!" ...|$|R
6000|$|From this delectable reverie, I {{was startled}} by my father's <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> on the shoulder. [...] "What {{possesses}} the lad?" [...] cried he; [...] "here have I been speaking to you half a dozen times, without receiving an answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even {{the very}} persons themselves--real live young men--we fixed on sometimes," [...] said Dot. [...] "We little thought how things would come about. I never fixed on John, I'm sure; I never {{so much as}} thought of him. And, if I had told you you were ever {{to be married to}} Mr. Tackleton, why, you'd have <b>slapped</b> <b>me.</b> Wouldn't you, May?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did. He <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> in the face. That angered me so greatly that I pitched {{into him}} without {{thinking}} twice. It was all {{done in a}} few seconds. But I guess I'd do it again," [...] added Jack. [...] "I wouldn't let anybody slap me without getting back at him. I guess if I did that I'd make a mighty poor soldier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, {{some years}} ago I was visited by a {{grinning}} son-of-a-gun from New York--no other than the great T.R. I took him around. He was most interested in my troops. After he had inspected them, and particularly the Imperial Guard, he <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> {{on the back and}} shouted, [...] "Bill, you could lick the world!" ... And, my son, I fell for it!'" ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. I don't {{hate and}} despise them. I think that's odious. But {{sometimes}} they're not very tactful. I don't know that I much {{want one of}} my clerks to come and <b>slap</b> <b>me</b> on the back {{in the office and}} call me old chap.|$|R
6000|$|... "My good Ulysses," [...] said Goodloe, <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> on the {{shoulder}} while I was washing the tin breakfast-plates, [...] "let me see the enchanted document once more. I believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack-saddle. I never saw a pack-saddle. What is it like, Jim?" ...|$|R
50|$|This album {{features}} Christian's vocals on I Refuse and Joakim's vocals on <b>Slap</b> <b>Me</b> In The Face (his lead vocal debut). This was Christian's and Joakim's last {{album with}} the band; they left {{shortly after the}} recordings. Their replacements - Christer Örtefors and Björn Fryklund - are both currently in the band.|$|R
6000|$|The sudden exultation {{with which}} he <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the knee, {{and leaned back in}} his chair, with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could {{possibly}} lift them, made me think him farther out of his wits than ever. He became as suddenly grave again, and leaning forward as before, said--first respectfully taking out his pocket-handkerchief, as if it really did represent my aunt: ...|$|E
6000|$|No matter {{whatever}} happened, it {{was laid}} {{at the door}} of that cat. [...] Why, once when I tore my apron,--she was wrapped in it, and I called [...] "Rat!"-- [...] Why, they blamed that on HER. I shall never--no, not to my dying [...] day-- [...] Forget the pained look that she gave me when they <b>slapped</b> <b>ME</b> and [...] took me away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, a fig for the land," [...] {{answered}} Nick; [...] "as soon as Nollichucky Jack is safe I'll {{follow you}} into Kentucky." [...] He <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the knee. [...] "Egad, Davy, {{it seems like}} a fairy tale. We always {{said we were going to}} Kentucky, didn't we? What is the name of the place you are to startle with your learning and calm by your example?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A summons. Her {{father and}} mother {{are going to the}} Bertrands' to-night, and I have written her a note to meet me in the garden. And you," [...] he cried, rising and <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> between the shoulders, [...] "you are to keep watch, like the dear, careful, canny, sly rascal you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't got any {{teeth to}} hurt. They have all come out. I have only got seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out right afterward. She said she'd <b>slap</b> <b>me</b> if any more came out. I can't help it. It's this old Europe. It's the climate {{that makes them}} come out. In America they didn't come out. It's these hotels." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{felt like}} I {{was happy to}} be on, of course. It took me a minute to latch on to the {{business}} side of things, 'cause it was just a happy-go-lucky time. And then eventually, as time went on, it started to <b>slap</b> <b>me</b> in my face. But as far as record labels, or whoever, they're not gonna do us right... As far as our label, I really have no comment, duke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word an' honor!" [...] ejaculated Mrs. Robinson, [...] "if {{that old}} French slop-cook hasn't lied to me, wus than Satan could do hisself! If them two ain't lovers, {{there never was}} none, an' that old heathen sinner thought she could clap a coffee bag over my head so that I couldn't see nothin' nor tell nothin'. She might as well a' <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> in the face, the sarpent!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When the Basuto dogs {{had tied}} me they mocked me, calling me foul names {{and saying that}} I might stop and starve with the white fools, my masters, who always dug for yellow iron and found so little, being fools. Then they got {{together}} everything of value, yes, down to the kettle, and made ready to go, {{and each of them}} came and <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the face, and one burnt me here upon the nose with a hot brand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ef she'd up an' <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> in the face, I shouldn't hev ben more throwed aback, fer I never mistrusted {{she cared}} two chips for me. I jest set an' gawped; fer she was solemn trew, I see that with half an eye, an' it kinder took my breath away. Bewlah drawed the grewel off the fire, wiped her hands, an' stood lookin' at me a minnet, then she sez, slow an' quiet, but tremblin' a little, as women hev a way er doin', when they've consid'able steam aboard,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The dolls' {{dressmaker}} {{looked on}} until he rolled {{himself into a}} corner with his Turkish slippers uppermost, and then, resolving {{in the first place}} to address her ministration to the salt and snuff, gave him more water and slapped his back. But, the latter application was by no means a success, causing Mr Fledgeby to scream, and to cry out, 'Oh my eye! don't <b>slap</b> <b>me!</b> I'm covered with weales and I smart so!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} silence {{was that the}} second Ku Klux Klan began to be active in Arkansas in 1921, concentrating in black-majority areas. It used {{intimidation}} and attacks to keep blacks suppressed. Author Richard Wright grew up in Phillips County and discusses it in his autobiography Black Boy. He wrote that when he questioned his mother about why their people didn’t fight back, [...] "the fear that was in her made her <b>slap</b> <b>me</b> into silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Scroope made <b>me</b> angry by <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> so hard {{upon the}} back that it hurt, and nearly {{caused me to}} let off the other barrel of the gun. Charles seemed to become one great grin, and Lord Ragnall, with a brief congratulatory [...] "Never enjoyed a shoot so much in my life," [...] called {{to the men who}} were posted behind us to pick up all the dead pheasants, being careful to keep mine apart from those of Sir Junius Fortescue.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} brought remorse. I {{did not feel}} well. I had pains, {{physical}} and mental. But I could not go back now. I {{was too weak to}} dispense with my popularity. I was only a boy, and on the previous evening the captain of the Checkers Club, to whom I looked up with an almost worshipping reverence, had <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the back and told me that I was a corker. I felt that nothing could be excessive payment for such an honor. That night I gave a party at which orange phosphate flowed like water. It was the turning point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remarkable!" [...] Lloyd <b>slapped</b> <b>me</b> on the shoulder. [...] "I {{should say}} so. Why, old chap, to coat myself {{with such a}} paint would be to put the world at my feet. The secrets of kings and courts would be mine, the machinations of diplomats and politicians, the play of stock-gamblers, the plans of trusts and corporations. I could keep {{my hand on the}} inner pulse of things and become the {{greatest}} power in the world. And I--" [...] He broke off shortly, then added, [...] "Well, I have begun my experiments, and I don't mind telling you that I'm right in line for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bein' riled myself didn't mend matters, {{and so we}} fell to hectorin' {{one another}} right smart. He said somethin' that dreened my last drop of patience; I give a sharp answer, and fust thing I knew he up with his hand and <b>slapped</b> <b>me.</b> It warn't a hard blow by no means, only {{a kind of a}} wet spat side of the head; but I thought I should have flew, and was as mad as ef I'd been knocked down. You never see a man look so 'shamed as Lisha did, and ef I'd been wise I should have made up the quarrel then. But I was a fool. I jest flung fork, dish, pertaters and all into the pot, and says, as ferce as you please: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know Steve Merrill better'n I know you," [...] said Mr. Bixby, [...] "and {{he knows}} me. Whenever {{he sees me}} at the state capital he says, 'How be you, Bije?' just as natural as if I was a {{railroad}} president, and <b>slaps</b> <b>me</b> on the back. When be you goin' to the capital, Will? You'd ought {{to come down and}} be thar with the boys on this Truro Bill. You could reach some on 'em the rest of us couldn't git at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} wait till he gets old enough to talk," [...] sighed Diana. [...] "I just long to hear him say 'mother.' And oh, I'm {{determined}} that his first memory of me shall be a nice one. The first memory I have of my mother is of her <b>slapping</b> <b>me</b> for something I had done. I am sure I deserved it, and mother was always a good mother and I love her dearly. But I do wish my first memory of her was nicer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Referring to {{the scene}} Poitier said, [...] "scene was almost not there. I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie {{for you if you}} give me your {{absolute}} guarantee when he <b>slaps</b> <b>me</b> I <b>slap</b> him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to do things that are against nature." [...] However, Poitier's version of the story is contradicted by Mark Harris in his book, Pictures at a Revolution. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.|$|R
