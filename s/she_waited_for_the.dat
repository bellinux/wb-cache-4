5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
500|$|... {{prominent}} Democratic {{politicians and}} advisors, including New York Representative Charles Rangel, urged First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton {{to run for}} the New York Senate seat. An unprecedented action if she did it, Clinton spent considerable time mulling over the idea while Lowey waited in the wings. Her political advisors told her the race would be difficult and some of them told her she would lose. [...] <b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> impeachment proceedings of Bill Clinton to conclude, which it did with his acquittal on February 12, 1999.|$|E
2500|$|After {{waiting in}} Hakodate {{for the flight}} to {{approach}} Japan, Thiepval {{headed back to the}} Soviet Union, where <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aircraft and its crew in Petropavlovsk. After arriving on 24 July, the flight was delayed by bad weather until 4 August, when it departed on its next leg. Heavy fog forced an emergency landing at sea, where the aircraft was badly damaged by waves before coming ashore at Nikolskoye, on Bering Island. Thiepval, steaming through the night, rescued the flyers and salvaged the wreckage of their aircraft before sailing for Vancouver. During their stay in Hakodate, Thiepvals crew acquired a brown bear, which they brought back to Esquimalt as a mascot. Called Bruno, or sometimes [...] "Haca-Daddy", the bear became addicted to the alcohol given to him by sailors, who also took him along when they went drinking in local taverns. Bruno ultimately died after eating poisonous dockyard supplies.|$|E

5000|$|The story {{ends with}} Min-jung booking {{a flight to}} Buenos Aires {{to start a new}} life. While <b>she's</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> plane, Hyun calls and asks her to work with him, and after telling him to deposit money, he threatens her by saying he could expose the secret, having Min-jung tell him: [...] "Just wait, I'll kill you".|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him again in silence, and the line of her lips got a little straighter, as <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Judge to go on.|$|E
60|$|The smile {{suddenly}} {{left her}} face. She put another question--without quite concealing {{the effort that}} it cost her, or the anxiety with which <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reply.|$|E
60|$|What of {{her anger}} and pent feelings, her lungs were irritated into the dry, hacking cough, and with blood-suffused face and one hand clenched against her chest, <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{paroxysm}} to pass.|$|E
50|$|A {{woman who}} has reached 42 weeks of {{pregnancy}} {{is likely to be}} offered induction of labour. Alternatively, she can choose expectant management, that is, <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> natural onset of labour. Women opting for expectant management may also choose to carry on with additional monitoring of their baby, with regular CTG, ultrasound, and biophysical profile. Risks of expectant management vary between studies.|$|R
5000|$|In Tennessee, she met KC Groves, {{one of the}} {{founding}} members of the band Uncle Earl, and she went on to spend five years touring with the band. The [...] "all G'earl" [...] group has released two records on the Rounder Records record label, <b>She</b> <b>Waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Night (2005) and Waterloo, TN (2007), which was produced by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin.|$|R
5000|$|Jo Atkison from Western Mail {{talked about}} the Kate/Phil/Marsden storyline saying, [...] "Betrayal with a capital B is {{the order of the}} day in the Square this week.

6000|$|On {{the table}} there stood a wooden bowl filled with roses. Emlyn drew it to her, {{and taking the}} roses into her hands, threw them to the floor. Then <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> water to steady, saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|A man {{advanced}} {{lifting his}} sword, and Miriam, thinking {{that all was}} over, hid her eyes while <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> blow. Before it fell, however, Caleb whispered something to the officer which caused him to change his mind.|$|E
5000|$|BURNSIDE: How many {{absences}} Mr. Stewart? Only one? Ah - Cleopatra Cassidy again! Wonder {{what the}} excuse will be this time.

60|$|Goblin's finger is lifted; and she steals out again, {{into the}} Chapel of the Holy Office. She {{stops at a}} certain part of the flooring. Her great effect is at hand. <b>She</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest. <b>She</b> darts at the brave Courier, who is {{explaining}} something; hits him a sounding rap on the hat with the largest key; and bids him be silent. She assembles us all, round a little trap-door in the floor, as round a grave.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but she will, I fear. Look, Mr. Buchanan, if she hasn't {{given him}} her flowers to carry {{to the house}} while <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> here <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Captain!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{fastened}} {{the paper}} to the thread again, {{and gave it a}} little twitch. <b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> low note of laughter which did not fail to flutter down from above; then she threw herself upon the bed, and fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reply. For a moment, {{and only}} for a moment, Louisa hesitated. The girl's nature was weak, but not depraved. She was {{honestly}} attached to her mistress; and she spoke with a courage which Magdalen had not expected from her.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Pipchin hovered {{behind the}} victim, with her sable plumage and her hooked beak, {{like a bird}} of ill-omen. She was out of breath--for Mr Dombey, full of great thoughts, had walked fast--and she croaked hoarsely as <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opening of the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Wheelock drowsily; [...] "but {{unless you}} know enough to stop him he's going to.

Couldn't worry through without your mother. Never was smart at business--I am a sailorman. It was she who made me boss of the Wheelock fleet, and now I guess <b>she's</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> old and broken man." ...|$|R

5000|$|While not a booth, suicide {{chambers}} {{are used}} {{to allow people to}} choose a pleasant form of euthanasia in the movie Soylent Green. The character Sol Roth (Edward G.

Music and a video chosen by the client are played while he or <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> drugs to take their fatal effect. Roth chooses Ludwig van Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony and a video of Earth's natural wonders and scenes of pastoral beauty.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dame de compagnie to {{make room}} for her exit; but the woman {{appeared}} lost in the contemplation of sunshine and shadows, sharing between themselves the stillness of the deserted grounds.

6000|$|... "I'm {{so glad to}} get {{a chance}} to speak to you alone," [...] he said at once; and while <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next word he made a pause, and then said, desperately, [...] "I want you to help me; and if you can't help me, there's no help for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try to walk or run about, my dear. Sit on {{the piazza}} {{if you get}} tired of this, and amuse {{yourself}} quietly till I come back.

60|$|Skrebensky <b>waited,</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited,</b> {{everybody}} <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decision. When Anton {{talked to}} her, and seemed insidiously to suggest {{himself as a}} husband to her, she knew how utterly locked out he was. On the other hand, when she saw Dorothy, and discussed the matter, she felt she would marry him promptly, at once, as a sharp disavowal of adherence with Dorothy's views.|$|R
50|$|M3LL155X was {{completed}} by November 2014, and <b>she</b> was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> end of her LP1 tour before releasing any material. She had also {{been working on a}} music video for every song, which delayed the release.|$|R

60|$|Surgeons {{were sent}} for, {{and she sat}} {{supporting}} his head.

60|$|Old Granny Fox saw the gun of Farmer Brown's boy pointed {{right at}} Reddy and she clapped both {{hands over her}} eyes to shut out the dreadful sight.

Farmer Brown's boy was still there, but Reddy Fox had {{disappeared}} inside the house.|$|E
