The spacecraft, a Venera 3MV-1, was launched on April 2, 1964 from Tyuratam {{and this time the}} launch vehicle performed flawlessly. During the cruise phase, a slow leak from a cracked <b>sensor</b> <b>window</b> caused the electronics compartment to lose air pressure. This was a serious problem as Soviet electronics relied on vacuum tubes which would overheat without cooling air. An ill-timed command from ground control turned on its radio system while there was still a rarefied atmosphere inside, causing the electronics to short out by corona discharge. Since the mission could not succeed, it was unacceptable to give it a Venera designation, but as the probe had exited Earth orbit, it also could not be given the Kosmos cover name, so Soviet authorities instead announced the probe as [...] "Zond" [...] and claimed that it was designed to [...] "stress-test components in deep space". Chief Designer Sergei Korolev was upset at the failure of the mission and demanded higher quality control from the OKB-1 Bureau, including X-rays to test for pressure leaks.|$|E

In this paper we propose and evaluate a sliding window based approach to perform activity recognition in an on line or streaming fashion; recognizing activities as and when new sensor events are recorded. To account for the fact that different activities can be best characterized by different window lengths of sensor events, we incorporate the time decay and mutual information based weighting of sensor events within a window. Additional contextual information {{in the form of the}} previous activity and the activity of the previous window is also appended to the feature describing a <b>sensor</b> <b>window.</b> The experiments conducted to evaluate these techniques on real-world smart home datasets suggests that combining mutual information based weighting of sensor events and adding past contextual information into the feature leads to best performance for streaming activity recognition...|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{and design of}} a spiral-shaped Mach-Zehnder Interferometric sensor (sMZI sensor) for refractive index sensing of watery solutions is presented. The goal of the running project is to realise a multi-sensing array by placing multiple sMZIs in series to form a sensing branch, and to place several sensing branches in parallel. In such an arrangment {{it is possible to}} use a single light source for several sensors. Each sensor will contain an electro-optical modulator, which makes it possible to separately interrogate and accurately read-out each sensor in the same sensing branch. One of the novelties in this project is the spiral-shaped layout of the MZI, which has several advantages: a long <b>sensor</b> <b>window</b> length can be placed in a compact sensor chip: within an area of 1 × 1 cm 2 lengths of several tens of cm are feasible. Another advantage of the spiral shape is that if both MZI branches are identical (except for the sensor layer) the sensor should be very insensitive to fluctuations in temperature and even to temperature gradients across the chip. Beside robustness, the spiral shape also allows cascading of several sensors. A parametrised sMZI has been designed such that the position, slope, and curvature are continuous. The sensors can each be coated with e. g. a specific immunolayer to be able to detect changes in concentration of viri, bacteria or enzymes. In this project, technology is being developed for the immobilisation and photolithographical patterning of such immunolayers, which should result in a demonstrator to monitor the ripening process of cheese by measuring changes in the concentration of several different enzymes involved in this process...|$|E
40|$|The Lasentec M 600 in-line {{particle}} size analyzer was installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in August 1998 to support retrieval of the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT). Before installation at ORNL, the sensor underwent validation testing at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Instrument Validation facility. Mechanically, the instrument worked well during validation testing and met all expectations. Operationally, much was learned about optimum ways to display and interpret the data. Slurry samples taken during the in-line tests at PNNL were shipped to the vendor for analysis with a benchtop Lasentec sensor. These experiments were performed to determine if off-line analyses yield {{particle size}} distributions similar to those generated by the in-line sensor. It was determined that the Lasentec sensor measures repeatable chord lengths as long as particles are ''presenter'' to the <b>sensor</b> <b>window</b> the same way. After the initial non-radioactive simulant testing at PNNL, the instrument was shipped for radioactive validation and acceptance testing in the Slurry Monitoring Test System (SMTS) connected to the Tank W- 9 of the GAATs at ORNL. For all acceptance tests conducted at ORNL, the variation in the chord length distribution and the total particle count corresponded very well with the slurry density data as determined using an in-line Promass 63 M Coriolis meter. Based on the performance results obtained, the Lasentec M 600 P FBRM is expected {{to meet the requirements}} for measuring the particle size distribution during the slurry transfer operations at Hanford and the Oak Ridge GAAT remediation project. The Red Valve pressure sensor was endorsed at the Hanford Site following instrument validation tests at PNNL and is currently in operation in the Tank 241 -C- 106 pump pit. While this instrument measures pressure within a transfer line, this type of pressure sensor could be configured to measure pressure drop over time. In turn, the status of a slurry transfer could be inferred from the pressure-drop measurement. In 1998, four Red Valve pressure sensors (with Sensotech Model AE- 213 pressure transducers) were installed before and after the booster pumps of the 4 -in. slurry (SL- 200) and supernatant (SN- 200) transfer lines between Tank 241 -C- 106 and Tank 241 -AY- 1 02. These pressure sensors have been in operation for over 1 year, and to date, the sensors have been trouble-flee according to the operators involved with slurry and supernatant transfer operations.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} the use of instrumentation amplifiers (IAs) for sensor applications. It highlights system challenges and implementation choices, describes new architectures for integrated-circuit IAs, and outlines applications such as ratiometric bridges and low-side current sensing. A similar article appeared in February 28, 2008 edition of Electronic Design. Sensor measurements typically translate physical phenomena of interest into electronic-circuit parameters such as resistance and capacitance, which can then be read with a bridge circuit. Bridge circuits produce an output voltage or current signal that is ratiometric with respect to temperature and power-supply voltages, thereby enabling the measurement system to selfcompensate for these variables. Sensor examples include: Thermistors for temperature sensing Resistive/capacitive strain gauges for pressure sensing Magneto-resistive sensors for direction/position sensing Sensors that produce a signal voltage or current directly do not require a bridge circuit to transform the physical variables. Examples include thermocouples, ECG-based medical instrumentation, and voltage across the current-sense resistor in a powermonitoring circuit. Today's sensor applications range from consumer electronics (thermometers, pressure scales, GPS systems), to automotive equipment (fuel sensors, knock <b>sensors,</b> brake-line <b>sensors,</b> <b>window</b> pinch control), to industrial and medical instrumentation (valve-position sensing, temperature-based system calibration and alarm, and ECG).
