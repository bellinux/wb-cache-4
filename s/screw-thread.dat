40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} bone remodeling around prostheses, a segmental replacement for the goat tibia was designed, using a conical, <b>screw-threaded,</b> hydroxyapatite-coated stem for fixation. Eight goats were provided with the implant, seven of which loosened within 10 days post-operatively, displaying progressive radiolucency and gross rotational motion. The eighth one also loosened radiographically, but developed a stabilizing callus bridge to prevent motion. A second design of similar shape and coating, but lacking the screw threads, was designed and also applied in eight animals. In this case, no loosening occurred in the first 6 weeks post-operatively. It is concluded that the application of screwed intramedullary stems for prosthetic fixation is not a viable concept, because the threads prevent the stem from subsiding and restabilizing when minor initial interface stress-relaxation and remodeling has occurred...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from the}} study of O-minimal {{structures}} are used to formalise fundamental objects and operations for geometric modelling kernels. O-minimal structures provide amore general setting than the traditional semialgebraic sets; they allow semianalytic sets such as <b>screw-threads</b> to be modelled accurately. O-minimality constrains the class of sets to ensure the retention of the key finitary properties necessary for many geometric operations. The formalism is independent of internal representations and implementations, {{in the spirit of the}} mixed-dimension cellular objects of the Djinn API (Application Programming Interface) [2]. Topological stratification is used to provide an object with a cellular structure consisting of a finite set of piecewise-smooth manifold cells. The main contribution of the paper is an existence proof for least stratifications (of sets in O-minimal structures). Set-like combination of two cell-structured objects requires a common partition of space from which a cell-structured result can be obtained. The existence of least stratifications facilitates the definition of combination operators that provide unique results...|$|R

50|$|The major {{breakthroughs}} {{in this period}} were {{to do with the}} technology of conversion. Water mills in most of western Europe were used to saw timber and convert trees into planks. Bricks were used in ever increasing quantities. In Italy the brickmakers were organised into guilds although the kilns were mostly in rural areas because of the risk of fire and easy availability of firewood and brickearth. Brickmakers were typically paid by the brick, which gave them an incentive to make them too small. As a result, legislation was laid down regulating the minimum sizes and each town kept measures against which bricks had to be compared. An increasing amount of ironwork was used in roof carpentry for straps and tension members. The iron was fixed using forelock bolts. The <b>screw-threaded</b> bolt (and nut) could be made and are found in clockmaking in this period, but they were labour-intensive and thus not used on large structures. Roofing was typically of terracotta roof tiles. In Italy they followed Roman precedents. In northern Europe plain tiles were used. Stone, where available, remained the material of choice for prestige buildings.|$|R
40|$|Transition metal {{nitrides}} (say TiN and CrN) have widespread {{industrial applications}} as they provide wear protection, high temperature and corrosion resistance, good adhesion and very high hardness. Over {{the past few}} years, CrNs {{have been used in}} cutting, milling and <b>screw-threading</b> tools due to their better thermal stability, corrosion and wear resistances. In this work, Al doped CrN superhard coatings are studied for their thermal stability. Surface and cross sectional morphology of the coating was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detector. Synchrotron radiation powder diffraction beamline was used to investigate the microstructure and phase transition of the coating layers within temperature range of 25 ˚C to 700 ˚C in steps of 100 ˚C. SEM study revealed interesting elemental distribution over the coating layers. Results indicated that CrN and Cr 2 N are the main structural phases at 25 ˚C and 700 ˚C, respectively. Dominant structural changes during annealing results in the gradual transformation of cubic CrN phase to the hexagonal Cr 2 N phase. In addition, recrystallization of CrN and Cr 2 N phases with preferential growth directions were observed. As the temperature increased the width of the peaks were reduced while their increased intensity indicate the grain growth in the coating layers...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{three-dimensional}} {{data about}} the bone response to oral implants {{can be obtained by}} using microfocus computer tomography. However, a disadvantage is that metallic implants cause streaking artifacts due to scattering of X-rays, which prevents an accurate evaluation of the interfacial bone-to-implant contact. It has been suggested that the use of thin titanium coatings deposited on polymeric implants can offer an alternative option for analyzing bone contact using micro-CT imaging. Consequently, the aim of the current study was to investigate bone behavior to titanium-coated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implants by micro-CT and histological evaluation. For the experiment titanium-coated PMMA implants were used. The implants had a machined threaded appearance and were provided with a 400 - 500 nm thick titanium coating. The implants were inserted in the right or left tibia of 10 goats. After an implantation period of 12 weeks the implants were retrieved and prepared for micro-computer tomography (microCT), light microscopy, and X-ray microanalysis. The micro-CT showed that the <b>screw-threads</b> and typical implant configuration were well maintained through the installation procedure. Overall, histological responses showed that the titanium-coated implants were well tolerated and caused no atypical tissue response. In addition, the bone was seen in direct contact with the titanium-coated layer. The X-ray microanalysis results confirmed the light microscopical data. In conclusion, the obtained results proof the final use of titanium-coated PMMA implants for evaluation of the bone-implant response using microCT. However, this study also confirms that for a proper analysis of the bone-implant interface the additional use of microscopical techniques is still required...|$|R

40|$|Shortening of {{the healing}} time before loading risks impeding {{successful}} titanium implant anchorage into compromised bone. A thorough understanding at the genetic scale of the early phases of bone regeneration at the implant interface is required before the development of strategies to enhance implant osseointegration. In this study a new in vivo implant model to explore the mechanism by which titanium implant osseointegration {{is affected by the}} host bone properties is presented. An implant was conceptualized enabling standardized harvesting of peri-implant tissue for quantitative molecular analysis while preserving the mimicking of the clinical setting. The implant is partly indented to provide a well-defined healing compartment from where tissue differentiation and de novo bone formation can be investigated and partly <b>screw-threaded</b> to provide a good implant anchorage into the bone. The feasibility of the implant design was assessed in osteopenic bone conditions, evoked by simulated weightlessness. Wistar rats were either hindlimb unloaded by tail suspension (HU) for 9 days or acted as controls (CTL). The status of compromised bone tissue through 9 -days HU was confirmed by micro-X-ray computed tomography. The implant was installed in the proximal tibial bone 7 days after the onset of HU or CTL. Two days postimplantation, the peri-implant regenerating tissue responses were recorded by measuring expression of inflammatory, angiogenic, and bone resorption parameters (hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit; vascular endothelial growth factor A; angiopoietin 1; endothelial PAS domain protein 1; fibroblast growth factor 2; tumor necrosis factor; interleukin 11; acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant; tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11 /RANKL). We successfully demonstrated that HU-associated bone conditions evoked a significant alteration of expression of the angiogenic markers in the peri-implant regenerative tissue during initial implant osseointegration, whereas the expression levels of the inflammatory and bone resorption parameters remained unchanged. We concluded that this in vivo implant model provides a well-designed and controlled method to examine molecular responses in implant osseointegration to impaired bone conditions. This model may serve to explore the application of anabolic strategies in peri-implant osteogenesis. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Allied forces {{developed}} their own designs of anti-handling devices during World War II. For example, the American M123A1, M124A1, M125 and M131 series of chemical long delay tail-fuzes which were used in air-dropped bombs, starting around late 1942 and remaining in service until the 1960s. Frequently fitted to M64 (500 lb), M65 (1000 lb) and M66 (2000 lb) general-purpose bombs, these fuzes were primarily designed to operate as chemical long-delay fuzes, with settings ranging between 15 minutes and 144 hours. The time delay mechanism was simple but effective: after being dropped from the aircraft a small propellor {{at the rear of}} the bomb revolved, gradually screwing a metal rod into the fuze, crushing an ampoule of acetone solvent contained within it. When this happened the fuze was fully armed and the timer countdown had started. The acetone soaked into an absorbent pad next to a celluloid disk which held back a spring-loaded firing pin from a percussion cap connected to an adjacent detonator. Acetone slowly dissolved the celluloid disk, gradually weakening it until the cocked firing pin was released and the bomb detonated. The time delay of the fuze varied according to the acetone concentration and the thickness of the celluloid disk. Removing a chemical long delay fuze from a bomb after it had been dropped would have been a straightforward process had it not been for the fact that there was an integral anti-withdrawal mechanism designed to kill anyone who tried to render the bomb safe. Fuzes such as the M123 (and its derivatives) contained two small ball-bearings at the lower end which slid out of recesses when the fuze was screwed into the bomb by aircraft armorers. The ball-bearings jammed into the <b>screw-threads</b> inside the fuze well, preventing the fuze from being removed. Because the lower end of the fuze was locked in place deep inside the bomb (where it was hard to get at) this posed major problems for enemy EOD personnel. Attempting to unscrew a fully armed chemical long-delay fuze caused it to split into two separate fuze assemblies. This action automatically triggered detonation by releasing the cocked firing pin in the lower fuze assembly, with lethal results for anyone nearby.|$|R
