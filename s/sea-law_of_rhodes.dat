5000|$|Welwod wrote a Scots {{language}} {{treatise on}} the law of the sea, The <b>sea-law</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, published in 1590 by Robert Waldegrave — 'the earliest book of maritime jurisprudence'. Welwod stated in the preface that the book was aimed at Scottish mariners and merchants. It was written in a vernacular style, and presented the sea law in the form of simple rules. Welwod later reworked The <b>sea-law</b> <b>of</b> Scotland into An Abridgement of All Sea-Lawes (1613), which included a chapter arguing against Hugo Grotius' Mare Liberum. He later expanded this chapter, [...] "Of the Community and Propriety of the Seas", into a full work entitled De dominio maris (1615).|$|R
5000|$|From {{that point}} {{until his death}} in 1603-4, Waldegrave printed over 100 works, [...] "making him the most {{prolific}} Scottish printer of the sixteenth century". His output consisted principally of religious works, but also included William Welwood's The <b>Sea-Law</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, a pirated edition of Sir Philip Sidney's The Arcadia, and three works by King James: the Poetical Exercises (1591), the Daemonologie, The Trew Law, and Basilikon Doron.|$|R

We moderns, {{who may be}} landsmen, may justly {{boast of}} civil immunities not possessed by our forefathers; but our remoter forefathers who {{happened}} to be mariners may straighten themselves even in their ashes to think that their lawgivers were wiser and more humane in their generation than our lawgivers in ours. Compare the <b>sea-laws</b> <b>of</b> our Navy with the Roman and Rhodian ocean ordinances; compare them with the [...] "Consulate of the Sea;" [...] compare them with the Laws of the Hanse Towns; compare them with the ancient Wisbury laws. In the last we find that they were ocean democrats in those days. [...] "If he strikes, he ought to receive blow for blow." [...] Thus speak out the Wisbury laws concerning a Gothland sea-captain.|$|R
