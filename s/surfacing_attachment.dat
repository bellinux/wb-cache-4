This model thus ignores the <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> kinetics. On the other hand, a phase field model of type C {{is able to}} account for the <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> kinetics via the extra Allen-Cahn equation, which ensures non-negative interfacial entropy production associated with the interface motion. Therefore, for constructing models of voids/bubbles growth and coarsening, phase field models of type C must be used.|$|R
30|$|In parallel, {{to better}} {{understand}} the putative functional role of VB 6 and L-Trp, yfiB was deleted in a PAO 1 wild-type strain, and a construct expressing the YfiBL 43 P mutant was transformed into the PAO 1 ΔyfiB strain to trigger YfiBL 43 P-induced biofilm formation. Growth and <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> assays were carried out for the yfiB-L 43 P strain in the presence of increasing concentrations of VB 6 or L-Trp. As shown in Fig.  6 A and 6 B, the over-expression of YfiBL 43 P induced strong <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> and much slower growth of the yfiB-L 43 P strain, and as expected, a certain amount of VB 6 or L-Trp (4 – 6 mmol/L for VB 6 and 6 – 10 mmol/L for L-Trp) could reduce the <b>surface</b> <b>attachment.</b> Interestingly, at a concentration higher than 8 mmol/L, VB 6 lost its ability to inhibit biofilm formation, implying that the VB 6 -involving regulatory mechanism is highly complicated and remains to be further investigated.|$|R

The results show that initial edge stress and energy are dependent on the edge configurations. It is confirmed that pre-strain on the free edges is a possible way to limit the random shape transition of GNRs. In addition, the influence of <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> on the shape transition is also investigated in this work.

The <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> approach yielded stable, soluble complexes which were able to selectively target cancer cells and did not prematurely release their cargo. Drug release {{in the case of the}} inclusion complex could be explained by the protonation of surface and interior amines under biological conditions, leading to unpacking of the dendrimer conformation and consequent release of the inner cargo. A similar phenomenon was observed with complexes of PAMAM and cisplatin.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the first example}} of reversible photoregulation of the binding of a protease, α-chymotrypsin, to a surface. A modular approach is used involving the azobenzene photoswitch group, a surface linker and an enzyme binding group. This approach {{is designed to be}} easily extended to the photoregulation of binding of other proteases to surfaces by use of enzyme binding groups selective to these proteases. Chapter one gives a brief outline of some of the important areas involved in to this work, including molecular switches, proteases and surface modification. Chapter two describes the synthesis of azobenzene-containing boronate esters designed as photoswitch inhibitors of α-chymotrypsin. Boronate esters were prepared containing the aminophenylboronate group or the peptidomimetic borophenylalanine group for enzyme binding and a range of substituents designed for enzyme affinity and/or <b>surface</b> <b>attachment.</b> Syntheses primarily involved peptide coupling reactions and azobenzene formation by condensation of nitrosobenzenes and anilines. Coupling reactions were successfully carried out using EDCI or isobutyl chlorofomate in several cases where other reagents gave unacceptable decomposition. Chapter three describes the syntheses and HPLC stability studies of derivatives of a noncovalent α-chymotrypsin inhibitor. Several dipeptide-based compounds containing either an amide group for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> or an azobenzene group for photoswitching were prepared, primarily using peptide coupling reactions. Each compound was incubated with α-chymotrypsin to assess its stability, and all were found by HPLC monitoring to be stable to α-chymotrypsin catalysed hydrolysis. Chapter four describes syntheses of azobenzene-containing trifluoromethylketones and α-ketoesters designed as photoswitch inhibitors of α-chymotrypsin. Trifluoromethylketones/α-ketoesters containing amine groups for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> were prepared, primarily using peptide coupling reactions, but could not be isolated due to the incompatibility of the electrophilic ketone and primary amine groups. Trifluoromethylketones/α-ketoesters containing terminal alkynes for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> were prepared either by the attachment of an alkyne substituent group to a symmetrical azobenzene core or by Pd-catalysed reaction of a protected alkyne with an azobenzene having a halide substitutent. Chapter five describes syntheses of sulfur-containing surface linkers for use in <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of the photoswitch inhibitors described in chapters 2 - 4. A range of compounds containing disulfide or protected thiol groups for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> and azide or carboxylic acid groups for inhibitor attachment were prepared. Syntheses primarily involved coupling of functionalised alcohols/amides to carboxylic acid-containing disulfides/thioacetates. Selected linkers were attached to azobenzenes by amide coupling or azide-alkyne cycloaddition for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment,</b> photoswitching and/or enzyme assay. Azide-alkyne cycloaddition yields were initially poor, but were improved by use of stoichiometric amounts of copper catalyst. Chapter six describes UV/vis photoisomerisation studies and enzyme assays carried out to assess enzyme photoswitching of the compounds described in chapters 2 - 5. The trifluoromethylketones and α-ketoesters described in chapter 4 gave the best results, with moderate inhibition of α-chymotrypsin (µM affinity constants) and up to 5. 3 fold changes in inhibition on UV/vis irradiation. Many of the boronate esters described in chapter 2 were found to inhibit α-chymotrypsin, but were somewhat unstable to irradiation. The dipeptide-based compounds described in chapter 3 were inactive against α-chymotrypsin. Good photoisomerisation was obtained for an azobenzene containing a symmetrical disulfide surface linker and poor photoisomerisation was obtained for an azobenzene containing a lipoic acid surface linker. Chapter seven describes <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of selected photoswitch inhibitors and studies of photoregulated enzyme binding to the resultant functional surfaces. Self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of disulfides were formed on gold surfaces and characterised by electrochemistry and contact angle measurements. Binding of α-chymotrypsin to SAMs containing a photoswitch inhibitor was detected by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), but was found to be largely irreversible. An alkyne-containing photoswitch inhibitor was attached to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip in a two step procedure involving generation of an azide modified surface followed by azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Binding of α-chymotrypsin to the resultant modified surface was detected by SPR and successfully regulated by UV/vis irradiation. Chapter eight provides conclusions for the work described in this thesis and suggests future directions. Chapter nine gives experimental details for the work described in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|P>The chaplin {{proteins}} ChpA-H {{enable the}} filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor to form reproductive aerial structures by assembling into surface-active amyloid-like fibrils. We here demonstrate that chaplins also mediate attachment of S. coelicolor to <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Attachment</b> {{coincides with the}} formation of fimbriae, which are connected to the cell surface via spike-shaped protrusions. Mass spectrometry, electron microscopy and Congo red treatment showed that these fimbriae are composed of bundled amyloid fibrils of chaplins. Attachment and fimbriae formation were abolished in a strain in which the chaplin genes chpA-H were inactivated. Instead, very thin fibrils emerged from the spike-shaped protrusions in this mutant. These fibrils were susceptible to cellulase treatment. This enzymatic treatment also released wild-type fimbriae from the cell <b>surface,</b> thereby abolishing <b>attachment.</b> The reduced attachment of a strain in which the gene of a predicted cellulose synthase was inactivated also indicates a role of cellulose in <b>surface</b> <b>attachment.</b> We propose that the mechanism of attachment via cellulose-anchored amyloidal fimbriae is widespread in bacteria and may function in initiation of infection and in formation of biofilms...|$|R

These results are a substantial improvement over previous work, and we present an analysis showing that the inconsistencies seen in prior measurements could be explained by systematic errors associated with diffusion effects and substrate interactions. These data provide new insights into the <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> kinetics governing ice crystal growth, and they suggest new avenues for examining ice growth behavior using molecular dynamics simulations.

40|$|The second {{messenger}} cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) regulates <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> and biofilm formation by many bacteria. For Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf 0 – 1, c-di-GMP impacts the secretion and localization of the adhesin LapA, which is absolutely required for stable <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> and biofilm formation by this bacterium. In {{this study we}} characterize LapD, a unique c-di-GMP effector protein that controls biofilm formation by communicating intracellular c-di-GMP levels to the membrane-localized attachment machinery via its periplasmic domain. LapD contains degenerate and enzymatically inactive diguanylate cyclase and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (EAL) domains and binds to c-di-GMP through a degenerate EAL domain. We present evidence that LapD utilizes an inside-out signaling mechanism: binding c-di-GMP in the cytoplasm and communicating this signal to the periplasm via its periplasmic domain. Furthermore, we show that LapD serves as the c-di-GMP receptor connecting environmental modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP levels by inorganic phosphate to regulation of LapA localization and thus surface commitment by P. fluorescens...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} effects of chain {{stiffness}} and <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> on the effective interactions between polyelectrolyte-grafted colloidal particles in monovalent salt obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach involves computation of the distance-dependent potential of mean force between two polyelectrolyte-grafted colloidal particles treated at a coarse-grained resolution. Two chain stiffnesses, flexible and stiff, and two <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> modes, free and constrained, at low grafting densities are examined. PMF calculations {{across a range of}} surface and polyelectrolyte charge allows us to map out the strength and extent of the attractive and repulsive regime in the two-dimensional charge space. We observe striking differences in {{the effects of}} chain stiffness between the two modes of attachment. When the chains are freely attached, the stiff-chains colloids exhibit a marginal reduction in the attraction compared to their flexible-chain counterparts. In contrast, when the chains are attached in a constrained manner, the colloids with stiff chains exhibit a significantly stronger attraction and a broader attractive regime compared to flexible-chain colloids. These differences in the effects of stiffness between the two attachment modes are explained in terms of differences in the energetic and entropic forces balancing adsorption of chains at their own surface versus chain extension to mediate bridging interactions across two particles. Our results thus underscore the importance of <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of chains and its proper accounting in computational and experimental studies and suggests the mode of chain attachment as an additional control parameter for modulating intercolloid interactions for applications such as stabilization of colloidal systems and bottom-up self-assembly of nanostructures. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany {{processes}} in eukaryotic cells, including the crawling {{motion of the}} whole cell, rely on the growth of branched actin networks from surfaces. In addition to their well-known role in generating propulsive forces, actin networks can also sustain substantial pulling loads thanks to their persistent <b>attachment</b> to the <b>surface</b> from which they grow. The simultaneous network elongation and <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> inevitably generate a force that opposes network growth. Here, we study the local dynamics of a growing actin network, accounting for simultaneous network elongation and <b>surface</b> <b>attachment,</b> and show that there exist several dynamical regimes that depend on both network elasticity and the kinetic parameters of actin polymerization. We characterize {{this in terms of}} a phase diagram and provide a connection between mesoscopic theories and the microscopic dynamics of an actin network at a surface. Our framework predicts the onset of instabilities that lead to the local detachment of the network and translate to oscillatory behavior and waves, as observed in many cellular phenomena and in vitro systems involving actin network growth, such as the saltatory dynamics of actin-propelled oil drops...|$|R

40|$|For many {{pathogenic}} bacteria <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> is {{a required}} first step during host interactions. Attachment can proceed to invasion of host tissue or cells or to {{establishment of a}} multicellular bacterial community known as a biofilm. The transition from a unicellular, often motile, state to a sessile, multicellular, biofilm-associated state {{is one of the}} most important developmental decisions for bacteria. Agrobacterium tumefaciens genetically transforms plant cells by transfer and integration of a segment of plasmid-encoded transferred DNA (T-DNA) into the host genome, and has also been a valuable tool for plant geneticists. A. tumefaciens attaches to and forms a complex biofilm on a variety of biotic and abiotic substrates in vitro. Although rarely studied in situ, it is hypothesized that the biofilm state plays an important functional role in the ecology of this organism. <b>Surface</b> <b>attachment,</b> motility, and cell division are coordinated through a complex regulatory network that imparts an unexpected asymmetry to the A. tumefaciens life cycle. In this review we describe the mechanisms by which A. tumefaciens associates with surfaces, and regulation of this process. We focus on the transition between flagellar-based motility and <b>surface</b> <b>attachment,</b> and on the composition, production, and secretion of multiple extracellular components that contribute to the biofilm matrix. Biofilm formation by A. tumefaciens is linked with virulence both mechanistically and through shared regulatory molecules. We detail our current understanding of these and other regulatory schemes, as well as the internal and external (environmental) cues mediating development of the biofilm state, including the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP, nutrient levels, and the role of the plant host in influencing attachment and biofilm formation.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Nisin, an {{antibacterial}} peptide {{proven to be}} an effective inhibitor of Gram-positive bacteria, was incorporated into novel block copolymer constructs and tested for retained antibacterial activity. Covalent coupling was achieved by chemical modification of the N-terminal isoleucine to introduce a thiol group. Thiolated nisin derivatives were then linked to poly[ethylene oxide]-poly[propylene oxide]-poly[ethylene oxide] (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblocks that had been end-activated such that terminal hydroxyl groups of the PEO chains were replaced with pyridyl disulfide moieties. The nisin-containing block copolymers were separated from unreacted nisin by dialysis, and showed antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive indicator strain Pediococcus pentosaceus. Antimicrobial activity was determined to be due to a combination of disulfide-linked nisin, and nisin that was not covalently associated with the PEO-PPO-PEO triblocks. While the extent to which nisin retained antimicrobial activity in its disulfide-linked, copolymer form is not clear, reduction of the nisin-containing copolymer constructs with dithiothreitol demonstrated that nisin released from the copolymer constructs did show antimicrobial activity. Thiol groups were also introduced to unfractionated heparin, an anticoagulant glycosaminoglycan, by reaction of carboxyl groups in its iduronic residues with 3, 3 ’dithiobis (propanoic) hydrazide. Thiolated heparin derivatives were then linked to pyridyl disulfide-activated PEO-PPO-PEO triblocks which had previously been coated onto the surfaces of polystyrene microspheres (1 m diameter). In addition to monitoring the heparin linking reaction spectrophotometrically, the zeta potential of uncoated, triblock-coated, and heparin-containing microsphere suspensions was recorded to provide an indication of the successful <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of heparin. While the <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of heparin in this manner significantly increased the anticoagulant activity of the microsphere suspensions as determined by the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) assay, this result was not fully reproducible due to the random nature of the thiol-modification process, which, after heparin <b>surface</b> <b>attachment,</b> may interfere with heparin function...|$|R
