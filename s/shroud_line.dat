5000|$|Unlike {{nearly all}} other firearms, {{there is no}} [...] "furniture" [...] on the M6 Scout like a butt stock or a forearm—the only parts which are not steel are the rubber butt plate and cheek rest. The M6 stock is stamped sheet steel, while the {{removable}} barrel assembly is forged steel. The stock holds four [...]410 shells and 15 [...]22 LR cartridges in the civilian version. The stock of the commercial version in [...]22 Hornet stores 12 rifle rounds and 4 shotgun shells. The original military stock held 9 [...]22 Hornet shells and 4 [...]410 shells. Aircrew who were issued the M6 were instructed on {{a way to make}} a field expedient forestock by wrapping the barrels with a length of <b>shroud</b> <b>line</b> from their parachute.|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} {{of the development}} and testing of a parachute central load core, an adaptive device whose primary function is to minimize parachute stored elastic energy while providing adequate rotational stiffness to prevent <b>shroud</b> <b>line</b> fouling from twisting and sufficient resistive torque for any balloon gondola positioning requirements. Empirical relations are given for the uninhibited drag area growth which are derived in the classical nondimensional form. Attention is given to development considerations and design along with model simulations, small and midscale drop test data, full-scale flight data, and instrumentation applications...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{wind tunnel}} test trials were {{conducted}} on a 30 degree conical ribbon parachute with porosities of 30, 27, and 24 percent. Variables were Mach number, dynamic pressure, towline length, and coefficient of drag. A Rotofoil parachute having a porosity of approximately 24 percent was tested, but failed after about 30 seconds of operation at a Mach number of 1. 8 All of the parachutes had a nominal diameter and <b>shroud</b> <b>line</b> length of 10 inches. Drag coefficients {{were based on the}} area of a circle having a diameter two-thirds of the nominal parachute diameter...|$|E
50|$|In parachuting, {{the term}} <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> {{is an old}} name for {{suspension}} lines. Such lines are thin cords which attach the canopy to the risers.|$|R
50|$|The {{recovery}} {{forces in}} the area reported that {{only two of the}} main parachutes had inflated. Worden said after splashdown that all three parachutes did inflate properly at first but after dumping the RCS fuel (highly toxic hydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide), he noticed that one was not inflated anymore. Post flight analysis would find that two or three of the six <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> on the failed parachute were missing. Although no conclusive cause was found it is thought that the loss of the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> was due to the RCS fuel dump.|$|R
5000|$|The {{kite balloon}} pilot had a {{parachute}} {{in a flat}} container attached to the observation basket suspended from the kite balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> from the harness attached to the main parachute in the container. When the balloonist jumped, {{the main part of}} the parachute was pulled from the container, with the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> first, followed by the main canopy. [...] A similar parachute system for the entire observation basket was tested at Rockaway Naval Air Station, but it was not widely used.|$|R
50|$|Fourragères {{are often}} worn as {{decorative}} items to liven up ceremonial uniforms in military, police, and cadet organisations. Members of the United States and Canadian 1st Special Service Force wore a red, white, and blue fourragère {{made out of}} parachute <b>shroud</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some gaff {{and some}} junk rigs {{get in the}} way of <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> strung between the mast and hull. If the mast cannot be held up by shrouds, it must stand up by itself, which makes it heavier, {{especially}} on a large boat.|$|R
50|$|Parachutes {{have very}} low mass, but a {{parachute}} {{is not a}} workable configuration for a solar sail. Analysis shows that a parachute configuration would collapse from the forces exerted by <b>shroud</b> <b>lines,</b> since radiation pressure does not behave like aerodynamic pressure, and would not act to keep the parachute open.|$|R
40|$|Nylon shock {{absorbers}} reduce the canopy-opening shock of a parachute {{to a level}} that protects the wearer from injury. A shock absorber is mounted {{on each of the}} four risers between the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> and the harness. Because of their size and location, they pose no problem in repacking the chute and harness after a jump...|$|R
5|$|Aboard the {{airliner}} FBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints, Cooper's black clip-on tie and mother-of-pearl tie clip, {{and two of}} {{the four}} parachutes, one of which had been opened and two <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> cut from its canopy. Eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper were interviewed. A series of composite sketches was developed.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{transport}} aircraft takes off without them while their sergeant, Tex (Paul Kelly), breaks up the fight. To {{keep them out}} of trouble, Tex arranges for a small observation aircraft to take them up. However, when Don jumps, his parachute becomes tangled with the tail of the aircraft. Bill crawls back and cuts the tangled <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> as Don hangs on to him.|$|R
5000|$|The {{town was}} named after Parachute Creek, that flowed into town from the northwest. According to legend, {{a member of the}} Hayden Survey in 1879 noted that the {{watershed}} patterns of the Roan Plateau, north of present-day Parachute, resembled parachute lines and chose the name [...] "Parachute" [...] for the area. On maps of the area, several streams converge on the town like the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> of a parachute, and the arc of the ridge line above the streams resembles the canopy of a parachute.|$|R
5000|$|Later U.S. Army hammocks issued {{during the}} Vietnam War, {{such as the}} M1966 Jungle Hammock, were mistakenly fitted with {{waterproof}} bottom panels, which often became filled with water overnight. [...] On the other side, North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and Viet Cong (VC) forces regularly employed jungle hammocks fabricated from scavenged or captured US parachute cloth and <b>shroud</b> <b>lines.</b> Hung well off jungle trails, the hammocks kept down the incidence of disease and illness, which NVA commanders generally regarded as a greater threat than shrapnel injuries caused by sleeping above ground.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Fallschirmjäger-Messer=== One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} gravity knives is the World War II Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger-Messer or German air force paratrooper knife, which utilizes a four-inch (100 mm) telescoping (OTF), gravity-propelled locking blade. First produced in 1937, the FJM was issued to German flight crews and paratroops, primarily {{for the purpose of}} cutting a trapped parachutist from his rigging in case he landed with a tangled parachute, or became entangled in trees with the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] Though not intended for use as a fighting knife, the FJM's blade could be and was used as a close combat weapon when necessary.|$|R
5000|$|The {{unit was}} unofficially first {{known as the}} [...] "Braves". Their {{spearhead}} shoulder insignia was chosen with this name in mind. The formation patch was a red spearhead with the words USA written horizontally and CANADA written vertically. The branch of service insignia was the crossed arrows formerly worn by the U.S. Army Indian Scouts. The unit wore red, white, and blue piping on their garrison cap and on the breast an oval (or trimming) behind their Parachutist Wings. Members of the unit also wore a red, white, and blue fourragère, lanyard, or shoulder cord made out of parachute <b>shroud</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|World War I {{observation}} {{crews were}} the first to use parachutes, long before they were adopted by fixed wing aircrews. These were a primitive type, where the main part was in a bag suspended from the balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with lines from the harness attached to the main parachute in the bag. When the balloonist jumped, {{the main part of the}} parachute was pulled from the bag, with the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> first, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted by the Germans and then later by the British and French for their observation balloon crews.|$|R
5000|$|For 1964, Breedlove faced {{competition}} from Walt Arfons' Wingfoot Express (piloted by Tom Green), {{as well as}} from brother Art in his four-wheel FIA-legal Green Monster. With more engine power, Breedlove upped the record to 468.72 mph [...] "with almost insolent ease", then to 526.28 mph. making him the first man to exceed 500 mph. This pass was not without incident, however, for one of his drogue parachute's <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> parted, and Spirit of America ran on for 5 mi before hitting a telegraph pole and coming to rest in a lake. This record stood all of twelve days before Green Monster broke it, recording a two-run average of 536.71 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{military}} use of {{the parachute}} was by artillery observers on tethered observation balloons in World War I. These were tempting targets for enemy fighter aircraft, though difficult to destroy, due to their heavy anti-aircraft defenses. Because {{it was difficult to}} escape from them, and dangerous when on fire due to their hydrogen inflation, observers would abandon them and descend by parachute as soon as enemy aircraft were seen. The ground crew would then attempt to retrieve and deflate the balloon as quickly as possible. The main part of the parachute was in a bag suspended from the balloon with the pilot wearing only a simple waist harness attached to the main parachute. When the balloon crew jumped {{the main part of the}} parachute was pulled from the bag by the crew's waist harness, first the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines,</b> followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted on a large scale for their observation balloon crews by the Germans, and then later by the British and French. While this type of unit worked well from balloons, it had mixed results when used on fixed-wing aircraft by the Germans, where the bag was stored in a compartment directly behind the pilot. In many instances where it did not work the <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> became entangled with the spinning aircraft. Although a number of famous German fighter pilots were saved by this type of parachute, including Hermann Göring, no parachutes were issued to Allied [...] "heavier-than-air" [...] aircrew, since it was thought at the time that if a pilot had a parachute he would jump from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Mynarski's descent was rapid {{due to the}} burnt {{parachute}} and <b>shroud</b> <b>lines,</b> {{resulting in}} a heavy impact on landing. He landed alive though severely burned, with his clothes still on fire. French farmers who spotted the flaming bomber found him {{and took him to}} a German field hospital but he died shortly afterwards of severe burns. He was buried in a local cemetery. Brophy remained trapped in the bomber and remained with the bomber when it crashed in a farm field. As the bomber disintegrated, and began breaking apart, Brophy survived the crash and the subsequent detonation of the bomb load. Still lodged in his turret, the crash broke the turret open with him pitched out, striking a tree and being temporarily knocked out.|$|R
40|$|A {{specially}} configured 16. 6 foot (5. 1 meter) Disc Gap Band (DGB) Spin Parachute {{has been}} designed, developed, integrated with a sounding rocket, and qualified by flight testing. Design requirements include (1) stable parachute should successfully deploy in the altitude region of 260, 000 feet (80 kilometers) from a Super Arcas launch vehicle; (2) after deployment, parachute and payload spin rate should {{be greater than}} three rpm; (3) four electric field sensors should be mounted on parachute <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> and have provisions to be electrically connected to the suspended payload; and (4) time above 100, 000 feet (30 kilometers) should exceed five minutes.

In 2008, the BBC published an article that was based on its examination of partly declassified documents obtained some years earlier, via the United States Freedom of Information Act. The documents appeared to confirm that within weeks of the accident, investigators realized only three of the weapons could be accounted for. One of the declassified documents—dated to January 1968—details a blackened section of ice which had refrozen with <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> from a weapon parachute: [...] "Speculate something melted through the ice such as burning primary or secondary."

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine the opening charac-teristics of several hemispherical parachutes at airspeeds up to 200 miles per hour and to study {{the influence of the}} parachute design variables on these opening characteristics. The effects of design variables on the drag and stability characteristics of the parachutes were also evaluated. The tests were made in the Langley 20 foot free—spinning tunnel and in the Langley 300 MPH 7 — by 10 —foot tunnel. Some of the parachutes blossomed fully when opened in the air stream. Beneficial effects on the parachute opening characteristics were obtained when longer <b>shroud</b> <b>lines</b> relative to parachute diameter were used, when the floating hem lines were tacked to prevent the hem—line loops from pulling out under load, or when a strip of low—porosity fabric was provided around the canopy in the area immediately above the hem line. The drag characteristics of the parachutes were not appreciably affected by these changes in design. The stability characteristics of the para-chutes were affected somewhat adversely by the use of the low porosity fabric just above the hem line. It was indicated that, for a given para-chute, increased airspeeds impaired opening characteristics, lowered drag coefficients, and improved stability...|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to their}} shared history, however, there are {{remarkable}} similarities as well. The boat designs are so similar that many parts (mast, boom, tiller, <b>shrouds,</b> running <b>lines)</b> are different {{only in their}} length. The rigging hardware, centerboard, and rudder are the same on both boats, and the sails are scaled versions of each other.It is sometimes possible to substitute Mutt parts for Bucc parts, and vice versa.

40|$|The opera Gawain (1991; revised 1994 and 1999) brought {{together}} Harrison Birtwistle {{and the poet}} David Harsent in a reworking of the late fourteenth-century narrative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. That Birtwistle asked Harsent to make {{a large number of}} alterations to his original libretto has already been documented. The present article, which draws on the sketching processes of both librettist and composer, reveals the nature and the ramifications of those changes. The discussion is particularly concerned with the contradictions and multiple narrative layers that resulted from the Harsent–Birtwistle collaboration, and with the composer’s suggestion that there is both a secret drama in the orchestra, and instruments that function like unheard voices. A consideration of Birtwistle’s sketches also reveals a preoccupation with line, in particular with finding different ways of shadowing vocal and instrumental parts, and ambiguously <b>shrouding</b> originary <b>lines</b> in layers of varied reflection. These musical devices represent Birtwistle’s response to Harsent’s interest in divided subjectivity, and to the idea that Gawain should develop a sense of his own identity...|$|R
5000|$|Triple deadeyes {{are used}} in pairs; a line called a lanyard is run {{back and forth between}} them, through the holes, so that they {{function}} again much as a block and tackle would. This provides a mechanical advantage, pulling harder on whatever the deadeyes are attached to. Pairs of deadeyes are placed in the <b>shrouds</b> (the <b>lines</b> that hold up the mast), where they are used to create greater tension in the shrouds. To set up the lanyards used with dead-eyes, a suitable grease such as tallow is first applied to the holes. After reeving the lanyard through the deadeyes, the end is hooked to a handy purchase in the rig above, such as the throat halyard. By hauling on the halyard the lanyard in the deadeyes is drawn up taut. A small wooden wedge is knocked into the last hole, to prevent the lanyard sliding back, and the end is unhooked from the purchase and made up on the shroud above the upper deadeye. The wedge can then be removed ready for the next shroud. As an alternative the tackle on the lanyard can be made fast to the shroud well above the upper deadeye so that it compresses the deadeyes. The last part of the lanyard can then be seized to an adjacent part between the deadeyes. When this is finished the tackle is cast off and the lanyard made off.|$|R
50|$|The rescue was {{extremely}} dangerous because the waves were breaking around the wrecked H. C. Higginson. Captain James took the Nantasket out twice. The first attempt failed after forty-five minutes of rowing {{when the boat}} hit rocks that knocked two holes in it, making it necessary to return to shore to make temporary repairs using lead patches. On the second attempt, the Nantasket was rowed {{close enough to the}} schooner for the men to throw a line on board the H. C. Higginson. The first sailor to be rescued was in the mizzen rigging; he came cautiously down the <b>shrouds,</b> tied the <b>line</b> around his body, leaped overboard into the sea, and was hauled into the surf boat. Four other sailors in the fore rigging, exhausted from their long exposure, had to work their way with great difficulty into the main rigging. There they fastened lines to themselves and in turn jumped into the breaking waters and were hauled one by one into the Nantasket. Once in the surf boat, they were taken safely to the shore, where the half-starved and half-frozen men were quickly conveyed in carriages to the home of Selectman David O. Wade of Hull. Not all of the crew of the H. C. Higginson were so fortunate. Three lost their lives: the captain and one sailor were washed overboard in the night and a third man died in the rigging from exposure.|$|R
