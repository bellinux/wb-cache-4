40|$|Sea bass (Lates calcalifer Bloch) {{is one of}} the {{economically}} important marine fishes, which is getting more important for marine-culture. This fish is categorized as a euryhaline species, i. e. has a wide salinity tolerance range. This species can live in the sea with salinity between 32 – 35 ppt, and in the river, estuarine and mangrove areas with the salinity between 0 – 25 ppt. The adult sea bass spawn in marine waters and the larvae and juvenile are mostly found in the estuarine. Estuarine is known as a good nursery and feeding ground, however it is also known as a pollutant trap. Therefore, the larvae of seabass and other euryhaline species are very susceptible to this condition Surfactant detergent Linear Alkyl-benzene Sulfonate (LAS) is a non-ionic <b>soft</b> <b>detergent,</b> which has a long straight carbon chain and a powerful cleaning capability. It is toxic to aquatic organisms, and however it is biodegradable. Therefore, it is widely used for cosmetic and household purposes. Some research found that the toxicity (LC 50 - 96 hours) of LAS detergent on invertebrate Daphnia magna was 2. 7 mg/l, on gastropods was 19. 4 mg/l and on shrimp (Panaeus japonicus) was 4. 5 mg/l. The acute and chronic effect of this detergent on tropical marine fish is not yet known. This research was done to find out the chronic effect (LC 50 - 96 hours) and acute effects, of detergent LAS on the larvae of sea bass (Lates calcaliver Bloch). A Bioassay method was applied to find out the acute toxicity, and Probit Analyses was used to find out the LC 50 - 96 hours of detergent LAS on sea bass larvae. Randomized Design was used to observe the chronic effects on the growth, survival rate of the sea bass larvae. There were six treatments applied, i. e. : treatment A (0...|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} {{camelina}} was known primarily in North America as a weed. More recently, camelina is being recognized for its value as an oilseed crop. Oil content of the seed, on a dry weight basis, is typically between 30 and 40 percent. The oil contains about 64 percent polyunsaturated, 30 percent monounsaturated, and 6 percent saturated fatty acids (McVay and Lamb 2008). Camelina oil {{can be used in}} both edible and industrial products. Historically, the seeds of camelina were crushed and boiled to release oil for food, medicinal use, and lamp oil. More recently camelina is being grown as a source of vegetable oil high in omega- 3 fatty acids. Camelina is being marketed in Europe in salad dressing and as cooking oil (it is not suitable as deep-fat fry oil). It is also used in cosmetics, skin care products, soaps, and <b>soft</b> <b>detergents</b> (Ehrensing and Guy 2008). The oil has been used successfully as an adjuvant in agricultural spraying applications, as a biodiesel, and it has been approved for use in cattle, chicken, and pig feed (Ehrensing and Guy 2008, Hulbert et al 2011). Camelina meal, the product remaining after the oil has been extracted from the seed, is similar to soybean and canola meal and contains more than Plant Guide 40 % protein and has a moderately-low glucosinolate content. Camelina seems to perform well as a companion crop (instead of oats) in establishing legumes for green manure cover and/or forage (Hunter 2010) ...|$|R
5000|$|Industrialisation, {{which had}} grown slowly after World War II through the civil war, boomed in the 1970s, despite many {{infrastructure}} constraints. Growth was particularly {{pronounced in the}} production and assembly of consumer goods, including vehicle assembly, and the manufacture of soap and <b>detergents,</b> <b>soft</b> drinks, pharmaceuticals, beer, paint, and building materials. The Obasanjo government invested strongly in infrastructure, {{and the number of}} [...] "parastatals" [...] - [...] jointly government- and privately owned companies [...] - [...] proliferated. The Nigerian Enterprises Promotion decrees of 1977 further encouraged the growth of an indigenous middle class.|$|R
40|$|Are {{brand names}} more {{valuable}} online or in traditional supermarkets? Does the increasing availability of comparative price information online make consumers more price-sensitive? We address these and related questions by first conceptualizing how different store environments (online and traditional stores) can differentially affect consumer choices. We use the liquid <b>detergent,</b> <b>soft</b> margarine spread, and paper towel categories to test our hypotheses. Our hypotheses and the empirical results from our choice models indicate that: (1) Brand names {{become more important}} online in some categories but not in others depending {{on the extent of}} information available to consumers – brand names are more valuable when information on fewer attributes is available online, (2) Sensory search attributes, particularly visual cues about the product (e. g., paper towel design), have lower impact on choices online, and factual information (i. e., non-sensory attributes, such as the fat content of margarine) have higher impact on choices online (3) Price sensitivity is higher online, but this is due to online promotions being stronger signals of price discounts. The combined effect of price and promotion on choice is weaker online than offline...|$|R
5000|$|Following the assessment, a {{treatment}} plan is developed. The treatment plan {{will depend on}} the plan or outcome of the pole such as indoor exhibition, storage our outdoor display. [...] "Decisions about appropriate treatments and methods of preservation for individual artifacts therefore should be made by a conservator in consultation with experts in the culture". Conservation goals for totem poles can include stabilization of materials such as wood, paint or loose joints, removal of biological growth, surface cleaning, application of a water or insect repellents, removal of decayed wood, stabilizing of totem at base and in some cases the removal of the totem pole. Conservators who perform treatments on a pole document any work performed via photographs or written notes. A surface cleaning is a common treatment by conservators. The surface cleaning is generally performed with a low-suction vacuum, <b>soft</b> brushes, mild <b>detergent</b> and <b>soft</b> sponges. Cleanings are important for removing any dirt, grime, grease, pollution or dust from the pole’s surface. It is recommended by conservators to start at the top and work your way down. Scaffolding or a lift is used with taller poles.|$|R
