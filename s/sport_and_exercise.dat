500|$|McFall {{spent the}} next year at home, during which he took up {{mountain}} biking and climbing {{and worked as a}} fitness instructor at his local leisure centre. He also started running in the summer of 2003 as soon as he had his prosthesis fitted: [...] "I love that sound of air rushing past your ears and the freedom of it. I missed that and I wanted to get that back." [...] After taking up his place at Swansea University to pursue a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> science, he practised on the university's running track and also trained with a local running club, the Swansea Harriers Athletic Club. However, he found running difficult and uncomfortable as his prosthesis was not designed for the purpose, and frequently got damaged. Upon making inquiries at the Federation of Disability Sport Wales (FDSW), he was introduced to carbon-fibre running [...] "blades". He graduated from university with an upper second-class honours degree in summer 2004, taking part in his first race at the Disability Sports Events (DSE) Championships in the UK the same year.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life at Winchester was arduous and austere; {{discipline}} was harsh. <b>Sport</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> were vital {{parts of}} the school day. In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were [...] "taught to be honest, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised." [...] All pupils were required to be academically competent and Jardine {{was able to get}} along without exhibiting brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football. But it was at cricket that he excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton usually held the upper hand. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. After his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{athletic}} participation {{has more}} than doubled in all major demographic groups, while simultaneously, children and adults with established heart disease desire participation in <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise.</b> Despite conferring favorable long-term effects on well-being <b>and</b> survival, <b>exercise</b> can be associated with risk of adverse events in the short term. Complex individual cardiovascular (CV) demands and adaptations imposed by exercise present distinct challenges to the cardiologist asked to evaluate athletes. Here, we describe the evolution of <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> cardiology as a unique discipline within the continuum of CV specialties, provide the rationale for tailoring of CV care to athletes <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> individuals, define the role of the CV specialist within the athlete care team, and lay the foundation for the development of <b>Sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>Exercise</b> Cardiology in the United States. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology launched the Section of <b>Sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>Exercise</b> Cardiology. Membership has grown from 150 to over 4, 000 members in just 2 short years, indicating marked interest from the CV community to advance the integration of <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> cardiology into mainstream CV care. Although the current athlete CV care model has distinct limitations, here, we have outlined a new paradigm of care for the American athlete <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> individual. By practicing and promoting this new paradigm, we believe we will enhance the CV care of athletes of all ages, and serve the greater athletic community and our nation as a whole, by allowing safest participation in <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> physical activity for all individuals who seek this lifestyle...|$|R

6000|$|The ancient castle, which {{occupies}} {{an island}} nearly in {{the centre of}} the lake, recalled to the page that of Avenel, in which he had been nurtured. But the lake was much larger, and adorned with several islets besides that on which the fortress was situated; and instead of being embosomed in hills like that of Avenel, had upon the southern side only a splendid mountainous screen, being the descent of one of the Lomond hills, and on the other was surrounded by the extensive and fertile plain of Kinross. Roland Graeme looked with some degree of dismay on the water-girdled fortress, which then, as now, consisted only of one large donjon-keep, surrounded with a court-yard, with two round flanking-towers at the angles, which contained within its circuit some other buildings of inferior importance. A few old trees, clustered together near the castle, gave some relief to the air of desolate seclusion; but yet the page, while he gazed upon a building so sequestrated, could not but feel for the situation of a captive Princess doomed to dwell there, as well as for his own. [...] "I must have been born," [...] he thought, [...] "under the star that presides over ladies and lakes of water, for I cannot by any means escape from the service of the one, or from dwelling in the other.
