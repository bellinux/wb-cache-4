25|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{nuclear reactors}} were built during World War II. These reactors {{were designed for}} the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. The only reprocessing required, therefore, was the extraction of the plutonium (free of fission-product contamination) from the spent natural uranium fuel. In 1943, several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products. The first method selected, a precipitation process called the bismuth phosphate process, was developed and tested at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the US weapons programs.

50|$|Fission of {{the nuclear}} fuel in any reactor {{produces}} neutron-absorbing fission products.

Such reprocessing-recycling programmes allow for a stabilisation of the overall <b>separated</b> <b>plutonium</b> stocks, but not for a significant reduction in the stockpile. Moreover, the quality of recycled plutonium decreases at each potential step of re-irradiation. Therefore, optimised or new ways of managing the plutonium stocks in the medium to long term are required.
