5|$|The {{final section}} to Amlwch was {{surveyed}} by the now Major Rich in January 1867. After remedial work, it opened to passengers throughout on 3 June 1867, although the first freight train to Amlwch was on 10 September 1866, according to Amlwch's first <b>stationmaster,</b> Mr O. Dew.|$|E
5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route {{and was not}} {{intended}} to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same <b>stationmaster</b> was responsible for both.|$|E

5000|$|TRA's <b>stationmasters</b> and {{conductors}} jointly manage dwell time, {{like their}} counterparts at LIRR's Jamaica. <b>Stationmasters</b> regulate trains by enforcing correct train sequences and departure times; holding to time {{is actually a}} legal requirement. At transfer locations, they manage connections.About ½-minute prior to departure, <b>stationmasters</b> sound platform bells to signal impending departure.When trains are late, bell is given sooner, shortening dwell times. Once conductors close train doors, <b>stationmasters</b> give the [...] "right away" [...] using platform-mounted equipment. After departure,stationmasters remain on platforms, visually inspecting departing trains.|$|R
5|$|Although {{situated}} in an unpopulated area, Wotton station was relatively well used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any {{station on the}} line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although the lines were not connected, a station (also named Wotton) {{was built on the}} new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a <b>stationmaster.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in the New South Wales bush town of Cobar on 8 December 1914, Toshack {{was one of}} five {{children}} born to a <b>stationmaster.</b> Orphaned {{at the age of}} six, he was raised by relatives in Lyndhurst in the northwest of the state, and played his early cricket and rugby league for Cowra. At this time, Toshack's ambition was to play rugby league for Australia. One of his childhood friends, Edgar Newham, also played both sports and wanted to play Test cricket. However, the town's doctor, a local community leader, advised that they were targeting the wrong sport, and the two boys followed his recommendation. Newham later played rugby league for Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway Act 1885 {{had given}} Watkin {{permission}} {{to extend the}} line from Chesham {{to connect with the}} LNWR at Tring. Thus, although it was the terminus of the line, Chesham station was designed with a revival of the LNWR extension scheme in mind. The small station building was set {{to one side of the}} tracks to allow for a possible extension onwards. The station had a single platform, with a run-around loop and turntable alongside, together with a coaling station and water tank. The station was lit by gas light until 1925; the local gas works, which consumed around 5,000tons of coal each year, threatened to withdraw their coal traffic from the line if the station were fitted with electric lighting. While Chalfont Road station initially served a sparsely populated rural area (the village of Little Chalfont had not yet grown around the station), Chesham station was busy, and at the time of its opening had a full staff of a <b>stationmaster,</b> two ticket inspectors, two clerks, two porters and two collectors.|$|E
50|$|Ohaupo {{railway station}} was a {{station on the}} North Island Main Trunk in New Zealand. It had a ladies' waiting room, public vestibule, ticket lobby, <b>stationmaster's</b> office, an asphalt platform, goods shed and a 7-room <b>stationmaster's</b> house.|$|R

5|$|Following the takeover, a new stationmaster's {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The <b>stationmaster</b> is {{recorded}} as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a <b>stationmaster</b> who was also responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil storage tank was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a commercial vehicle hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Stationmaster</b> and The Postmaster – Both {{officials}} {{attend the}} Gayevs' party in Act III. Although they both play minor roles (the <b>Stationmaster</b> attempts to recite a poem, and the Postmaster flirts with Dunyasha), they are mostly {{symbols of the}} deprecation of the aristocracy in 1900s Russia – Firs comments that, whereas once they had barons and lords at the ball, now it's the postman and the <b>stationmaster,</b> and even they come only to be polite.|$|E

50|$|It {{claims to}} be Britain's {{smallest}} standard-gauge railway station, although {{it is no longer}} part of the main rail network. Damems has the distinction of being a station rather than a halt because in its original form it included a <b>stationmaster's</b> house and a siding to serve the mill in the village. The <b>stationmaster's</b> house remains, and is owned by the heritage railway, although the siding has been removed. The level crossing at the station is controlled from a gate box originally from Earby on the Colne-Skipton line. The box was installed since preservation. The crossing was originally worked from a groundframe in the <b>stationmaster's</b> garden. The last crossing keeper at Damems was Annie Feather who lived in the <b>stationmaster's</b> house and received her wages which were thrown to her from the footplate of a passing locomotive.|$|R
25|$|With {{the closure}} of the lead mines, the {{population}} rapidly declined and Allendale became a popular tourist destination for Edwardian Tynesiders seeking a country escape. The railway was finally closed to passengers in 1930 and to goods in 1950 (when the local terminus was bought by the <b>stationmaster</b> and opened as a caravan park.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>stationmaster</b> at Allendale was Smith Roswell, {{a former}} {{resident}} of LaGrange, New York.
