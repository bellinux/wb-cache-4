40|$|Improvements in {{electric}} submersible pumping {{systems have}} resulted in a demonstrated downhole running life of one year for low horsepower units operating in 180 C brine. The implementation of a prototype pressurized lubrication system to prevent brine intrusion and loss of lubricating oil from the motor and protector sections has been successfully tested. Second generation pressurized lubrication systems have been designed and fabricated and will be utilized in downhole production pumping tests during FY 84. Pumping system lifetime is currently limited by available power cable designs that are degraded by high-temperature brine. A prototype metal-sheathed power cable has been designed and fabricated and is currently undergoing destructive and nondestructive laboratory testing. This cable design has the potential for eliminating brine intrusion into the power delivery system {{through the use of a}} hermatically <b>sealed</b> <b>cable</b> from the surface to the downhole motor. The two-phase flow program is directed at understanding the hydrodynamics of two-phase flows. The two-phase flow regime is characterized by a series of flow patterns that are designated as bubble, slug, churn, and annular flow. Churn flow has received very little scientific attention. This lack of attention cannot be justified because calculations predict that the churn flow pattern will exist over a substantial portion of the two-phase flow zone in producing geothermal wells. The University of Houston is experimentally investigating the dynamics of churn flow and is measuring the holdup over the full range of flow space for which churn flow exists. These experiments are being conducted in an air/water vertical two-phase flow loop. Brown University has constructed and is operating a unique two-phase flow research facility specifically designed to address flow problems of relevance to the geothermal industry. An important feature of the facility is that it is dedicated to two-phase flow of a single substance (including evaporation and condensation) as opposed to the case of a two-component two-phase flow. This facility can be operated with horizontal or vertical test sections of constant diameter or with step changes in diameter to simulate a geothermal well profile...|$|E

40|$|Two recent {{electronic}} advances at NASA-Lewis {{that meet}} the blade tip clearance needs of a wide class of fans, compressors, and turbines are described. The first is a frequency modulated (FM) oscillator that requires only a single low cost ultrahigh frequency operational amplifier. Its carrier frequency is 42. 8 MHz when used with a 61 cm long hermetically <b>sealed</b> coaxial <b>cable.</b> The oscillator can be calibrated in the static mode and has a negative peak frequency deviation of 400 kHz for a typical rotor blade. High temperature performance tests of the probe and 13 cm of the adjacent cable show good accuracy up to 600 C, the maximum which produces a clearance error of + or - 10 microns at a clearance of 500 microns. In the second advance, a guarded probe configuration allows a longer cable capacitance. The capacitance of the probe {{is part of a}} small time constant feedback in a high speed operational amplifier. The solution of the governing differential equation is applied to a ramp type of input. The results show an amplifier output that contains a term which is proportional to the derivative of the feedback capacitance. The capacitance is obtained by subtracting a balancing reference channel followed by an integration stage...|$|R

40|$|Cathodic {{delamination}} failure {{is believed to}} be caused by the production of OH- at the polymer/metal interface via oxygen reduction reactions. In cable connector assemblies, the use of manufacturing processes and materials that are resistant to cathodic {{delamination failure}}s is highly desirable. Also, {{there is a need for}} an accelerated testing regime for assessing the resistance of polymer-to-metal composites to cathodic delamination failures. Cable connector assemblies are employed in marine environments for structural terminations and circuit interconnection of electrical power and signal cabling systems. They are found on offshore sea beds, ROV’s, vessels and submarines and are prone to cathodic delamination related failures particularly when the cable assemblies are coupled to dissimilar metal appurtenances in seawater, e. g., zinc anodes. The resistance to cathodic delamination failures of selected metal substrates and polymeric materials used in the manufacture and <b>sealing</b> of <b>cable</b> connector assemblies have been investigated. Materials and methods of surface preparation by grit blasting to enhance polymer-to-metal adhesion, thus increasing the service life-time expectation of cable connector assemblies have been elucidated. Methods of accelerated testing of polymer/metal bond durability using salt spray test and the validation of the results in seawater immersion tests and potentiostatic experiments have been described. Also, a novel accelerated test chamber for cathodic delamination tests was designed and manufactured. Applied potential was observed to be the factor that had the most negative effect on test samples while silicon carbide grit was found to produce the most effective surface cleanliness and roughness combination required for durable polymer-to-metal bonds.

40|$|Introduction. To {{achieve a}} {{functional}} atraumatic cochlear implantation, intracochlear pressure changes during the procedure should be minimized. Postinsertional cable movements {{are assumed to}} induce intracochlear pressure changes. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe intracochlear pressure changes due to postinsertional cable movements. Materials and Methods. Intracochlear pressure changes were recorded in a cochlear model with a micro-pressure sensor positioned in the apical region of the cochlea model to follow the maximum amplitude and pressure gain velocity in intracochlear pressure. A temporal bone mastoid cavity was attached to the model to simulate cable positioning. The compared conditions were (1) touching the unsealed electrode, (2) touching the <b>sealed</b> electrode, (3) <b>cable</b> storage with an unfixed cable, and (4) cable storage with a fixed cable. Results. We found statistically significant differences in the occurrence of maximum amplitude and pressure gain velocity in intracochlear pressure changes under the compared conditions. Comparing the cable storage conditions, a cable fixed mode offers significantly lower maximum pressure amplitude and pressure gain velocity than the nonfixed mode. Conclusion. Postinsertional cable movement led to a significant pressure transfer into the cochlea. Before positioning the electrode cable in the mastoid cavity, fixation of the cable is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The cable {{equation}} is solved in the Laplace transform domain for arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. The cable potential is expressed directly {{in terms of}} the impedance of the terminations and the cable electrotonic length. A computer program is given to invert the transform. Numerical solutions may be obtained for any particular model by inserting expressions describing the terminations and parameter values into the program, without further computation by the modeler. For a finite length <b>cable,</b> <b>sealed</b> at one end, the solution is expressed {{in terms of the}} ratio of the termination impedance to the impedance of the finite length cable, a generalization of the steady-state conductance ratio. Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Examination of computed solutions shows that solutions which differ theoretically may be indistinguishable experimentally...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground return current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of <b>cable</b> <b>sealing</b> end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground return current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground return current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the ground return current behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of ground return current on circuit parameters (cross-bonding box resistances, substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Expanding clay/polyacrylamide {{composites}} {{have the}} capacity to absorb large amounts of water while retaining good mechanical strength and high damping characteristics, and therefore represent a new and promising class of hydrogel materials. Bentonite (montmorillonite) has been used as expanding clay mineral and a superabsorbent poly(acrylamide) -bentonite composite (SAPC) material has been prepared using electron beam and UV light irradiation. Characterization of SAPC using XRD, SEM, DSC, TGA, FTIR and NMR (27 Al, 29 Si and 12 C) showed that the structure of SAPC was that of acrylamide combined with montmorillonite in three different ways: a. AM intercalated in the lamina of montmorillonite in bimolecular layers bound by van der Waals force and hydrogen bonds; b. AM bonded to the montmorillonite surface by hydrogen bonds; c. AM in free state as a polymer string network. Experimental results of rheological, mechanical, and thermal properties of SAPC showed a fully cross-linked structure and higher mechanical strength and thermal stability. Application of SAPC in oilfields (enhanced oil recovery), for environmental protection (acid mine tailing abatement), agriculture (plantation, seedling), in electric industry (<b>cable</b> <b>sealing),</b> petrochemical industry (fuel dewatering), civil engineering (concrete additives) and sensor industry (sensor materials) showed a high potential of this class of materials for environmentally compatible and economically viable uses.

40|$|On-site PD {{measurements}} on HV cables have {{to concentrate on}} the cable accessories because there is a remaining risk for assembling faults on site. PD sensors with an appropriate coupling behavior to accessory-internal PD give sensitivities of a few pC or even better. Unfortunately, two main reasons prevent the general use of PD sensors in cable accessories. First of all, the costs for PD sensors have to be balanced with the costs of the accessories, importance of the cable link, consequential costs for outages etc. This is the reason why PD sensors were mainly used for EHV cable systems. The second reason is limited accessibility: the PD sensor cable at the accessory has to be connected to a PD detection unit. Accessibility is much more difficult for direct buried cable systems than for cable terminations and for tunnel-laid cable systems: the sensor cable must pass the ground and end up in a box on the surface to provide access. This solution causes additional costs and new problems like <b>sealing</b> the sensor <b>cable</b> against humidity, capability to withstand sheath testing etc. By looking for alternative access to PD signals from cable joints of long cable systems, a very simple solution proved suitable: detecting PD at the cross-bonding links. To investigate the high frequency propagation of PD pulses in cross-bonding links, computer simulations and laboratory measurements were done. On-site PD measurements at cross-bonding links of a 220 -kV-XLPE cable system showed unexpected hig...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{criminal}} activity, human bodies are sometimes dismembered and concealed within sealed, plastic waste sacks. Consequently, due to the inhibited ingress of insects and dismemberment, the rate of decomposition of the body parts within may be different to that of whole, exposed bodies. Correspondingly, once found, an estimation of the postmortem interval may be affected and lead to erroneous inferences. This study set out to determine whether insects were excluded and how rate of decomposition was affected inside such plastic sacks. The limbs, torsos and heads of 24 dismembered pigs were <b>sealed</b> using nylon <b>cable</b> ties within plastic garbage sacks, half of which were of a type claimed to repel insects. Using a body scoring scale to quantify decomposition, the body parts in the sacks were compared to those of ten exposed, whole pig carcasses. Insects {{were found to have}} entered both types of plastic sack. There was no difference in rate of decomposition in the two types of sack (F 1, 65 = 1. 78, p = 0. 19), but this was considerably slower than those of whole carcasses (F 1, 408 = 1453, p < 0. 001), with heads showing the largest differences. As well as a slower decomposition, sacks resulted in formation of some adipocere tissue as {{a result of}} high humidity within. Based upon existing methods, postmortem intervals for body parts within sealed sacks would be significantly underestimated...|$|R
