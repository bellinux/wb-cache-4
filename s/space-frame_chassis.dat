25|$|As {{with the}} Lotus Six before it, the {{original}} Lotus Seven used an extremely light <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> with stressed aluminium body panels. Although the chassis has had numerous modifications to strengthen it and accommodate the various engine and suspension setups (and {{to try to}} find more cockpit space for the occupants), this basic formula has remained essentially the same throughout the Seven's life (with the exception of the Series 4, which used steel for the cockpit and engine bay and glassfibre for the bodywork). Early cars used a live rear axle, initially from various Fords, later from the Morris Ital. De Dion rear suspension was introduced in the mid-1980s and both geometries were on offer until 2002 when the live-axle option was phased out. The modern Superlight employs adjustable double-wishbone suspension with front anti-roll bar and a de-dion rear axle, located by an A-frame and Watt's linkage.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 von Eberhorst, {{working for}} ERA, {{designed}} the <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> for the Jowett Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|Bernie Rodger {{restarted}} {{production of}} the car as the Warwick with {{minor changes to the}} appearance, a one-piece forward hingeing front end, a stiffer <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> and a revised dashboard. Although listed from 1960-62, only about 40 are thought to have been produced.|$|E
50|$|The car {{features}} AP racing 6-pot (front) and 4-pot (rear) main {{braking system}} with ventilated and cross drilled race spec discs, an independent handbrake system by Brembo, fully adjustable shock absorbers with double-wishbone race suspension, a BTR Hydratrak limited-slip race differential, 50/50 weight distribution and a tubular <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> and rollcage.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 Chevron began {{developing}} a new road/race version of the Cypher. The Cypher has a carbon fibre-kevlar composite chassis and a fuel-injected lightweight 4.4 litre V8 multi-valve engine. It is offered in two forms: a touring version for road, and a race version with a turbocharged fuel-injected engine, <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis,</b> and unitary body.|$|E
50|$|The 288 GTO {{introduced}} in 1984 is considered {{as the first}} Ferrari supercar. The 288 borrowed much of the styling from the European 308 GTB QV of the previous year, 1983: it is also powered by a similar debored 2.8-litre V8 (but with turbochargers), it retained the general bodywork lines with extended wheelarches, different side air vents, and bigger rear spoiler, longer (5 inch) wheelbase, and the central tubular <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{its first}} racing season the team bought {{the most modern}} Italian-made race car Dallara F399. Team’s first driver Fabio Babini already had {{experience}} of participating in Russian Formula 3 series {{at the wheel of}} Russian-made open-wheeler Astrada, a car with a tubular <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis.</b> Rally driver from St-Petersburg Alexander Antonov became Babini’s teammate, after 2-years driving of Formula 3 car “JAK-26” for Rothmans-ASPAS team. On the 4th stage of Russian Championship, Babini got the first pole and won the race, thus interrupting series of wins of his compatriot Alberto Pedemonte from Lukoil Racing.|$|E
50|$|Pininfarina's {{bodywork}} was {{manufactured by}} Ferrari's regular coachbuilder Carrozzeria Scaglietti. Its structure conformed with Ferrari's {{practice at the}} time, with outer body panels fitted onto a separate <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> constructed from tubular box or oval-shaped steel sections. While most body panels are steel pressings, the front lid and rear engine cover of the Mondial 8 and QV models are from aluminium. Full-width aluminium louvre panels across the front lid and engine cover form a distinctive feature of all Mondials, and provide for improved airflow through the front-mounted radiators and engine bay respectively.|$|E
5000|$|The Italian term Superleggera (meaning [...] "super-light") was trademarked by Carrozzeria Touring for {{lightweight}} sports-car {{body construction}} that only resembles a <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis.</b> Using a three-dimensional frame {{that consists of}} a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the radiator, cowl, and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure. A skin {{is attached to the}} outside of the frame and is often made of aluminium. This body construction is however not stress-bearing, and still requires the addition of a chassis.|$|E
50|$|The Fiat {{frame was}} {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} a new <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> built by Devin that weighed just 40 lb. This frame duplicated the locations of the original unit's suspension mounting points, allowing the original Fiat front and rear suspension to be reused. That suspension was a transverse leaf spring with A-arms and tube-shocks in front and semi-trailing arms with coil springs and tube-shocks in the rear. The stock drum brakes were replaced by 12 in disks made by Cagle. The engine was rotated 180 degrees from its rear-engine location in the original car to a mid-engine layout in the Roosevelt-Devin. The Fiat 600 transaxle also received a set of Harley Klentz Quick Change Gears.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrari {{partnered with}} Alcoa {{to produce an}} entirely new all {{aluminium}} <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> that was 40% stiffer than the F355 which had utilized steel. The design was 28% lighter despite a 10% increase in overall dimensions. Along with a lightweight frame the new Pininfarina body styling deviated from traditions of the previous decade's sharp angles and flip-up headlights. The new V8 engine, common to all versions, utilizes a 3.6 litre capacity, flat plane crankshaft, titanium connecting rods and generates 395 bhp (294 kW, 400 PS). Despite what looks like on paper modest gains in reality the {{power to weight ratio}} was significantly improved on over the F355, this was due to the combination of both a lighter car and more power. According to Ferrari weight was reduced by 60 kg and the 0 to 100 km/h acceleration performance improved from 4.7 to 4.5 seconds. The 360 Modena press car was [...] "ludicrously quick and sounded more like Schumacher's weekend wheels than a street car." [...] But the other cars were different. When Car and Driver tested a F360 it proved heavier and slower than its predecessor five years before.|$|E
50|$|The new {{firm has}} shown several notable projects. At the 2008 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, Touring debuted the Bellagio Fastback Touring, {{based on the}} Maserati Quattroporte and the A8 GCS Berlinetta Touring, a concept car powered by a Maserati drivetrain. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Touring Bentley Continental Flying Star premiered: a shooting-brake model based on the Bentley Continental GTC, coach built in limited series, with the {{endorsement}} of Bentley.In 2011, {{it was followed by}} Gumpert Tornante by Touring, a superfast Grand Tourer commissioned by the German sports car manufacturer.On the stage of 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Touring Superleggera showcased a static style model based on the <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> of the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione. It was a tribute to the C52 Disco Volante, a racing car with Touring Superleggera design body introduced in 1952. The name in Italian stands for “Flying Saucer”. It represents one of the most iconic cars of the history of automobile. The Disco Volante was very streamlined, windtunnel tested and with the body built on a tubular space frame. The C52 Alfa Romeo Disco Volante shocked the crowd for its utterly out-of-the-ordinary design, influencing the automobile design for decades.The style model gave birth, in 2013 to the Alfa Romeo Disco Volante by Touring, a bespoke car limited-series of eight units that won the Design Award at Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este the very same year.|$|E
5000|$|Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, {{said when}} {{designing}} his new Murray T.25 city car:"I discovered why people didn't make {{what they call}} 'Sub A' segment cars, small city cars - you don't make any money on them. Because the tooling and development cost for a small car is almost {{the same as for}} a bigger car. So people would rather build larger cars and make more profit. That's when I started thinking, that {{if this is going to}} work there needs to be a new way of making the cars, that is cost effective. That high capital pressed components using low labour cost countries a long distance from developed world markets has a large environmental cost. Car manufacturers say that production emissions are small compared to tailpipe emissions, but in fact they are a very significant proportion of total emissions. We need to re-think the Henry Ford design of mass production." [...] Murray's solution is a laser cut tubular steel <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> built with an automated tube mill, braced with bonded low-cost composite sheets that would be a cheaper and greener means of production. Murray's 'iStream' simplifies each process with an eighty percent smaller factory with lower cost production, making light weight efficient cars. There are no sheet metal presses, spot welders or paint plants. It would be built local to its market. Murray is currently negotiating production licences. The T25 and T27 were expected to be available in 2016.|$|E
40|$|Road vehicle {{homologation}} {{has become more}} and more challenging due to the introduction of stringent regulations regarding pollutant emissions. In order to fulfil these requirements, the focus in automotive industry mainly settled on the improvement of the engine performance in terms of fuel consumption. Another design approach aims at the vehicle lightening, yet in the respect of the safety standards. In the present work a methodology for preliminary <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis</b> design for rear-central engine sport cars is proposed. The purpose is to design a chassis able to attain given performance goals in view of weight reduction. The design problem is faced using finite element analysis. The chassis numerical model is made of shell elements and is split into three sub-models: front, central, and rear. This allows the parallelization of the work among different teams. The sub-models undergo topometry and size optimizations in order to asses the optimal shell thickness distribution...|$|E
40|$|The project “Bizzarrini P 538 Eco Targa” {{has been}} {{developed}} by the INFOCOM department of " Sapienza" University of Rome. The project consisted {{in the design and}} construction of a replica of a historic Italian car, updated with LPG fuel and with modern parallel hybrid-type plug-in technologies, with a start and stop system, and a Lithiumpolymer battery storage system. The research aimed at undertaking practical experimentation on parallel hybrid vehicles, with a special focus on the problems related to the construction and optimization of hybrid propulsion systems. The prototype constructed is made of a <b>space-frame</b> <b>chassis,</b> which is composed of tubular sections of various thicknesses and Fe 360 material, with double wishbone with push rod as suspension system. The internal combustion engine is mounted at the rear axle. It is petrol engine 2. 2 JTS with direct injection with 185 Hp and 225 Nm. The electric motor, together with its electronic control, is at the front axle, and the motor is a brushless type with 22 kW of power rating and 45 kW of peak power. The electric motor is powered to 222 Vdc from a storage system made of lithium polymer batteries produced by Kokam, with 6. 68 kWh of stored energy. A PC/ 104 embedded pc type has been used as main controller of the hybrid system. The control unit not only supervises and controls the hybrid traction, but enables the display of all operational information of the prototype on a screen positioned within the prototype itself. The simulation model was obtained by coupling the simulation software vehicle dynamics GT-Drive with the Matlab / Simulink environment, to optimize control strategy of the prototype...|$|E
