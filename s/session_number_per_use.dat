40|$|Spawning {{location}} and timing {{are critical for}} understanding fish larval survival. The impact of a changing environment on spawning patterns is, however, poorly understood. A novel approach is to consider {{the impact of the}} environment on individual life histories and subsequent spawnings. In the present work, we extend the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory to investigate how environment variability impacts the spawning timing and duration of a multiple-batch spawning species. The model is successfully applied to reproduce the growth and reproduction of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The model captures realistically the start and ending of the spawning season, including the timing of the spawning events, and the change in egg <b>number</b> <b>per</b> batch. <b>Using</b> a realistic seasonal forcing of temperature and food availability derived from a bio-physical model, our simulation results show that two thirds of the total spawned mass already accumulates {{before the start of the}} spawning season and that the condition factor increases with body length. These simulation results are in accordance with previous estimations and observations on growth and reproduction of anchovy. Furthermore, we show how individuals of equal length can differ in reproductive performance according to the environmental conditions they encounter prior to the spawning season. Hatch date turns out to be key for fecundity at age- 1 as it partly controls the ability to build up reserves allocated to reproduction. We suggest the model can be used to realistically predict spawning in spatially and temporally varying environments and provide initial conditions for bio-physical models used to predict larval survival. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background: Human {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors in cervical cancer. Viral sequences are integrated into the host cell genome. In mild cases the virus causes skin damages, in severe cases it leads to cancer. Like many other cancers, telomerase gene expression was increased in cervical cancer. This enzyme is a reverse transcriptase that contains two common subunits: i) catalytic protein called human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and, ii) RNA sequence called hTR. hTERT expression is hardly found in any somatic tissues. Detection of high telomerase activity in human cells, lead to tumor genesis. So hTERT can be used as a diagnostic tool in cancer detection. Methods: This experimental study was carried out from May 2013 to April 2014 in Nanobiotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran. Caski and Hela cancer cell lines were used which contain HPV 16 and HPV 18 respectively. Cell lines were cultured and total RNA was extracted. Following normalization agent glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), hTERT expression level was determining by real-time PCR method. For each sample, the expression level of hTERT and GAPDH were quantified as copy <b>numbers</b> (<b>per</b> reaction) <b>using</b> the standard curve. Finally, hTERT levels in Hela and Caski cell lines were compared quantitatively by t-test using GraphPad statistic software version 5 (San Diego, CA, USA). Results: According to the charts real-time PCR, hTERT gene expression in Hela and Caski cancer cell lines is significantly different (t= 0. 0319). Conclusion: All results confirm that hTERT expression levels in Hela and Caski cell lines are significantly different and the level of hTERT expression in the Caski cell line was slightly higher than that of Hela cell line. The significant difference between hTERT mRNA expression levels reported here could be used as a tumor marker for HPV 16 and HPV 18 in cervical cancer...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of N {{fertilizer}} rates on morphological traits, yield and yield components of rice cultivars, a study {{was carried out in}} Rice Research Institute of Rasht, Iran during 2009. It was a two-variable factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design with three replications. The first factor was nitrogen fertilization at four rates of 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha- 1 and the second factor was rice cultivar at three levels of Hashemi, Ali-Kazemi and Khazar. The results of analysis of variance showed that N fertilizer rates did not significantly affect on panicle length, grain <b>number</b> <b>per</b> panicle, 1000 - grain weight and harvest index but significantly affected plant height, tiller <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, panicle <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, grain yield and biological yield. Means comparison showed that as N rate was increased from 0 to 90 kg ha- 1, plant height, tiller <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, panicle <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, grain yield and biological yield increased by 12. 7, 27. 6, 32. 6, 84. 5 and 61. 6 %, respectively. The cultivar significantly affected morphological traits, panicle <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, grain <b>number</b> <b>per</b> panicle, 1000 -grain weight, grain yield and biological yield. The results indicated that cultivar of Khazar had the highest potential of grain yield (3424. 5 kg ha- 1). In total, application of 90 kg N ha- 1 and cultivar of Khazar treatment was better for having the maximum production under the conditions of the current study...|$|R
