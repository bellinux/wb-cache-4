40|$|Compressor {{play the}} {{prominent}} {{role of the}} compressed air system. If The compressor find the trouble itself, then air supply to production line will be terminated. One of the big problem of Compressor ZR 5 take place on intercooler. Intercooler is the compressor component which function to cool compressed air inside the compressor so that the compressor will not be overheated. If overheated happens,then the alarm on compressor display will show “High Air Temperature on LP Element Outlet”. Consequently, the compressor will shut down automatically & must be replaced by other standby compressor. Even intercooler routine maintenance is already performed periodically refer to maintenance manual itself, (running hour/time based), however this alarm indication frequently shown pior to entering next period of maintenance schedule. PM Analysis (field observation) & root cause Analysis implementation lead {{to the cause of}} the alarm indication. They consist of: low flow rate of cooling water that caused by stuck <b>strainer</b> (<b>filter)</b> on the pipe line, imperfect contact between cooling water and compressed air due to poor quality of cooling water, Delay on Detection problem and lack of skill to analyse alarm trouble data. The proposed countermeasure will be provided as follows : relocate strainer position so that easy maintenance could be executed, to modify new pipe line with new cooling water source (from treated reuse water to public water) with more compliance to water requirement, Introduction of stochastic method (replacement & inspection model) to predict effective inspection, cleaning and replacement of intercooler, maintenance management training provision including diagnostic problem and water cooling system maintenance of compressor. However, the countermeasure mentioned above only to encounter abnormality found at the time of observation to compressor cooling water system. By applying combined RCM & RBI method, other potential cause that might result in the same problem could be identified, so that the problem will not be recurrence. The countermeasure (corrective action) & preventive action need should be analised for the pros & cons (cost & benefit analysis) so that this activity will provide important information for management. Based on the CBA, this activity will provide payback period for 3 months. The activity will involve external party (contractor) to perform corrective action & internal party (operator member) to conduct maintenance task as already scheduled...|$|E

50|$|As the {{pipeline}} enters the compressor station {{the natural gas}} passes through scrubbers, <b>strainers</b> or <b>filter</b> separators. These are vessels designed to remove any free liquids or dirt particles from the gas before it enters the compressors. Though {{the pipeline}} is carrying “dry gas,” some water and hydrocarbon liquids may condense out of the gas stream as the gas cools and moves through the pipeline. Any liquids that may be produced are collected and stored for sale or disposal. A piping system directs the gas from the separators to the gas compressor for compression.|$|R
50|$|Some {{industrial}} strainers available are simplex basket strainers, duplex basket strainers, and Y strainers. Simple basket strainers {{are used}} to protect valuable or sensitive equipment in systems that {{are meant to be}} shut down temporarily. Some commonly used strainers are bell mouth strainers, foot valve strainers, basket strainers. Most processing industries (mainly pharmaceutical, coatings and liquid food industries) will opt for a self-cleaning strainer instead of a basket strainer or a simplex strainer due to limitations of simple filtration systems. The self-cleaning <b>strainers</b> or <b>filters</b> are more efficient and provide an automatic filtration solution.|$|R

40|$|During a LOCA in a LWR, a containment-sump <b>strainer</b> <b>filters</b> debris, {{generated}} from fibrous thermal insulation, {{from the water}} collected in the containment sump. The buildup of debris on the strainer and the bypass of debris through the strainer lead to upstream and downstream effects, respectively. The objective {{of this research was}} to create a methodology for obtaining PSDs for this debris upstream and downstream of a sump strainer in multiple size ranges. Fibrous debris was injected into an experimental facility which simulated the conditions in a LWR containment sump. Samples were taken downstream of the strainer during the experiment. Using a NanoSight LM 10 and two optical microscope systems, size measurements of particles were made. The fractional number of particles between 55 - 188 nm increased from 0. 591 to 0. 734 upstream to downstream; the number of all other particle sizes decreased. This trend is consistent with Hutten?s [8] statements about the MPPS. For AMIS- 1, from upstream to downstream, the fraction of particles smaller than 55 ?m increased from 0. 77 to 0. 89; almost all of the larger particles sizes decreased in number. This demonstrates larger particles being more efficiently filtered. For AMIS- 2, from upstream to downstream, the fraction of particles smaller than 340 ?m increased from 0. 536 to 0. 668; all of the larger particle sizes decreased in number. This again demonstrates higher filtration efficiency for larger particles. Different PDFs provided the best fit for the PSDs in each of the size ranges measured. For the nanometer range, the Johnson?s SB function provided the best fit. For the 10 - 500 ?m range, the upstream and downstream results were fit best with the log-logistic and lognormal functions, respectively. For the 100 - 2500 ?m size range, the Weibull distribution was found to fit best. Changes in the PDFs fit to the upstream and downstream PSDs were similar to what was found when comparing the upstream and downstream PSD histograms. Size distributions for spherical (tin powder) and angular (SiC F 600) particles were easily obtained using the Coulter Counter, however, it didn?t provide reliable results for fibrous debris...|$|R
40|$|Tenom Pangi Hydro Power Plant (HPP) is {{the most}} {{economical}} power plant for Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB) and also the largest hydro station in Sabah, Malaysia with installed capacity of 3 units of 22 MW each. Due to degrading river water quality, the previous duplex <b>strainers</b> or <b>filters</b> with manual backwash of the plant cooling water system (CWS) were not practically efficient to remove the accumulated trash load. The cause of the repeatable failure from the substituted auto-backwash strainers was thoroughly investigated, and {{it was found that}} the failure was due to the trapped trash and/or the sediment trapped in the autobackwash filters which ultimately clogged the filter discharge. Several technical solutions were proposed to rectify the problem, but the open canal with auto-strainer system was the optimum solution. The canal solution was selected base on the system reliability, cost benefit, and future water quality of Padas River. Analytical and CFD solution using commercial CFD software were used to design the system. The open canal with auto-strainer system was installed and it was found that a significant amount of sediment and trash have been separated from the river water. This dramatically improves the operational reliability of the station cooling water system while maintains sufficient water flow rate and pressures...|$|R

50|$|Typically fresh {{wastewater}} has a musty odor and is cloudy with a grayish coloration as it {{is fresh}} and untreated. When deprived of oxygen the water becomes black from further with a foul odor. The odor is that of rotten eggs and the water becomes corrosive inviting problems to form in the pipes, so usually treatment workers {{try to keep it}} from getting too oxygen deprived while in pipes. Temperature can be anywhere between 45-75 F, but the temperature of water entering the system usually does not affect the pond, because it is designed to handle a variety of temperatures. The pH of the system is a huge factor in pond water characteristics with the water either being acidic 0.0-7.0 or basic 7.0-14.0. The pH levels are monitored {{to make sure that the}} water does not get too acidic and start to corrode the pipes. It is most desirable for the water to be more basic so as to prevent corrosion from the acid. Another set of characteristics is the contents of the water, like solids, suspended solids and dissolved solids. Dissolved solids are able to pass through most filters whereas suspended solids are just particles suspended in the water column easily caught in <b>strainers</b> or <b>filters.</b> Solids is just a general term for what would remain if all of the water was evaporated from a sample of the wastewater. To get into more technical terms colloidal solids are particles that are so small that they will not settle by gravity on their own. Settleable solids are pretty much self-explanatory as they are the solids that will settle on their own in a given period of time.|$|R
40|$|During the Fall of 2010, I {{spent my}} time at NASA White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, NM as an Undergraduate Student Research Program (USRP) Intern. During that time, I was given three {{projects}} to work on: Large Altitude Simulation System (LASS) basket strainer, log books, {{and the design}} of a case for touch screen monitors used for simulations. I spent most of my time on the LASS basket strainer. The LASS system has a water feed line with a basket <b>strainer</b> that <b>filters</b> out rust. In 2009, there were three misfires which cost approximately $ 27, 000 and about 8 % of the allotted time. The strainer was getting a large change in pressure that would result in a shutdown of the system. I have designed a new basket that will eliminate the large pressure change and it can be used with the old basket strainer housing. The LASS system has three steam generators (modules). Documents pertaining to these modules are stored electronically, and the majority of the documents are not able to be searched with keywords, so they have to be gone through one by one. I have come up with an idea on how to organize these files so that the Propulsion Department may efficiently search through the documents needed. Propulsion also has a LASS simulator that incorporates two touch screen monitors. Currently these monitors are in six foot by two foot metal cabinet on wheels. During simulation these monitors are used in the block house and need to be taken out of the block house when not in use. I have designed different options for hand held cases for storing and transporting the monitors {{in and out of the}} block house. The three projects previously mentioned demonstrate my contributions to the Propulsion Department and have taught me real world experience that is essential in becoming a productive engineer...|$|R
5000|$|Ibarra {{was also}} known for {{creating}} his own paper. Creating different mottled paper grades depends {{on the way in}} which colors are deposited and manipulated. His technique consisted of preparing paper in a rubber bath which served as background. It was necessary to prepare this in one or two liters of cold water with about 50 grams of “Alquitira” rubber (Tragacanto), stirred at intervals while adding up to six liters of water as the rubber is undoing the process (which usually takes up to three days), then passing it through a <b>filter,</b> <b>strainer,</b> or cheesecloth. Once he had a proper background, he prepared the colors, which are pigments found in vegetables, and poured them into the bath, where they rushed to the bottom instead of floating as needed. The colors were mixed on a smooth surface with a creamy mass binding. [...] Then he would stir it with a spatula. The densities of the mixture of colors allowed him to control the colors being added (he used drops of ox gall was when he preferred a smoother finish). If the color of the pigment was too creamy, he added contrast. Once the colors were prepared and spread, he manipulated them with sticks, needles, combs, etc., to form the drawings.|$|R
