500|$|In a 1954 article, {{sports writer}} Dave Lewis wrote that Penn {{assigned}} five players {{to the task}} of mowing down Schulz. [...] Lewis quoted Schulz as having said: [...] "I can still see those five pairs of eyes <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> every time we lined up... ready to tear me apart". [...] According to Lewis, all five men piled on Schulz every play, and Schulz held Penn scoreless for 50minutes before they [...] "finally knocked him out". [...] Lewis concluded: [...] "Never before or since has there been such a one-man show of defensive football as Schulz displayed against Penn".|$|E
500|$|... "Conflict Resolution" [...] was {{the fifth}} episode of the series written by Greg Daniels, {{who is also the}} {{executive}} producer and show runner for The Office. The episode was the third of the series directed by Charles McDougall; he had previously directed the earlier season two episodes [...] "Christmas Party" [...] and [...] "Dwight's Speech". The episode features Angela and Oscar arguing over Angela's poster of two babies playing saxophones. [...] Jenna Fischer said that [...] "As a cast, the baby poster is one of our favorite props... Angela received the poster from her Secret Santa in the Christmas episode." [...] Fischer {{went on to say that}} [...] "I had to stand in between Angela and Oscar as they bicker about the poster while Michael tries to mediate the situation. The whole time, the cute jazz babies are <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the poster. It was hilarious!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My father... {{took us to}} see one of {{the first}} talking pictures, The Singing Fool, in which Al Jolson sang [...] "Sonny Boy". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
60|$|I sat down, rather uncomfortably, but Nick took a {{stand and}} stood <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with folded arms.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{movement}} and an exclamation from my right, and {{peering through the}} gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, <b>staring</b> out <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|But the fan dropped: {{her arms}} lay limp in her lap; {{and she was}} <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> piteously, with a world of self-reproach in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Between 1872 and 1885, the King had 209 private {{performances}} (Separatvorstellungen) {{given for}} himself {{alone or with}} a guest, in the two court theaters, comprising 44 operas (28 by Wagner, including eight of Parsifal), 11 ballets, and 154 plays (the principal theme being Bourbon France) {{at a cost of}} 97,300 marks. This was not due so much to misanthropy but, as the King complained to the theatre actor-manager Ernst Possart: [...] "I can get no sense of illusion in the theatre so long as people keep <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and follow my every expression through their opera-glasses. I want to look myself, not to be a spectacle for the masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{last meeting}} with Abdus Salam {{was only three}} months ago. His disease had taken its toll and {{he was unable to}} talk. Yet he {{understood}} what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings {{as if he wanted to}} thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{nine o'clock}} that night, {{when we came}} out through {{the gates of the}} big, noisy station, the {{children}} were awaiting us. They had changed, they had grown. Biddy kissed me shyly, and stood <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "So you've {{found that}} out at last, Una!" [...] he exclaimed, <b>staring</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Then you {{remember}} me after all, darling! You know who I am. You haven't quite forgotten me. And you recall what has gone, do you?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} she sat <b>staring</b> fixedly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> then, flinging my hand from her, covered her face. Presently she {{uncovered}} it again, for shame was overcome and cast out by anger. She rose {{and stood up}} before me, her face very white.|$|R
60|$|Ballantrae {{never moved}} a muscle, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like an image in a pagoda.|$|E
60|$|He turned round quickly, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with a face}} of mingled {{fury and}} dismay.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} everything. When I had {{finished}} he sat <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{like a man}} stupefied.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I cannot explain, or, at any rate, I {{will not}} try," [...] he answered, also <b>staring</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Whatever she believed, {{or did not}} believe, and {{whatever}} would or would not have happened, {{she was a great}} and wonderful woman whose memory I worship." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "One day a big, tall German {{army officer}} spotted <b>me</b> and kept <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me...He {{followed}} <b>me</b> {{and then walked}} {{up to me and}} I thought, well, this is it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{not in the}} least!" [...] {{said the}} {{youngest}} young man affably. [...] "We can quite understand," [...] and <b>staring</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me</b> all the time, he heeled his chair back until it very nearly upset, and recovered with some exertion. [...] "Not a bit of it," [...] said the fat young man.|$|R
60|$|She took it, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with eyes}} wide with wonder, and then she opened it mechanically.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} his evident anguish, I was seized with a convulsive laughter. Tom stood <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> moodily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A leddy!'--said the dyer, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with his}} rainbow countenance. 'Mr. Alan, what takes you out, rinning like daft, without your hat?' ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the gate, just {{opposite}} my face, there was a small sliding panel, not more than a few inches long; this was presently pushed aside from within. I saw, through a bit of iron grating, two dull, light gray eyes <b>staring</b> vacantly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and heard a feeble husky voice saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, as it seemed, {{the heavens}} and the earth rushed back upon me. I saw the people near <b>staring</b> in {{surprise}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and wondering if I was in my right mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> us. Tell <b>me</b> {{what you are going}} to do when you leave here. You can ask me--what you were going to, afterwards." ...|$|R
60|$|The man, toward whom I had {{immediately}} turned after firing, lest {{he should}} pursue his threatened attack, stood <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in amazement and admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit {{down and}} I'll tell you." [...] And {{he sat there}} beside the candle, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "There was a man always there--Count Camerino." ...|$|E
60|$|The rod {{dropped from}} the relaxed fingers of my under-study, and he stood blankly <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and waiting for an explanation. I gave it.|$|E
5000|$|She was <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "He's {{burning up}} a dictionary?""Right. That's nothing. Once he burned up a {{cookbook}} because it said {{to remove the}} hide from a ham end before putting it in the pot with lima beans. Which he loves most, food or words, is a tossup."

6000|$|... "A {{thousand}} thanks, Senor. Who knows? But I {{shall have}} warning when it falls. A {{day or two}} before the awful invader arrives, a coyote suddenly appears in broad daylight, mysteriously, near the casa. This midnight marauder, now banished to the thickest canyon, comes again to prowl around {{the home of his}} ancestors. Caramba! Senor Captain, what are you <b>staring</b> <b>at?</b> You frighten <b>me!</b> Stop it, I say!" ...|$|R
60|$|While I was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> this {{sign and}} {{wondering}} emptily {{what kind of}} a boat it was and of what nation were the folk who had sailed in her, a man came down the garden path and leaned upon the gate, <b>staring</b> in turn <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> He was old and strange-looking, being clad in a rusty gown with a hood to it that was pulled over his head, so that I could only see a white, peaked beard and a pair of brilliant black eyes which seemed to pierce me as a shoemaker's awl pierces leather.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} room, {{only to return}} once more. His head appeared, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> round the door, in a disembodied way, like the Cheshire Cat.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, as I was saying, I {{walked away}} when Jimmy Hedgehog {{began to make}} so much foolish talk, and just for the moment had {{forgotten}} all about that miserable fox, when whom should I see <b>staring</b> straight <b>at</b> <b>me</b> but the old fellow himself, {{and by the way}} he was licking his chops I knew he felt certain I was his meat at last. But the matter wasn't settled by considerable, for he was on one side of a barbed-wire fence and I on the other, so there was something to be done before he could put me into a pie.|$|R
40|$|I {{have never}} {{finished}} reading The Lord of the Rings. I have tried, several times, but each time, I'd {{get past the}} destruction of the ring, see another hundred pages of Tolkien's fairly leaden prose <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and put the book down. Mostly, this makes me feel guilty. There is a unfair and unreasonable fixation on finishing things in contemporary culture. Even the idea of cultural consumption, of consumers, is inextricably linked with the idea of completion: to truly appreciate a work, we must use it up in its entirety, depleting it of all possibility. A task left unfinished is no task at all...|$|R
5000|$|Lorna Bradbury, Deputy Literary Editor for The Daily Telegraph, {{listed the}} {{collection}} {{as one of}} [...] "25 Classic Novels for Teenagers." [...] Zoe Chace of NPR told interviewer Cara Philbin her reactions during reading the collection as a child: [...] "Kiss Kiss is for grown-ups... It was actually the marriages that I remember feeling the worst about... Reading Kiss Kiss {{is one of the}} first times I can remember a real-life truth <b>staring</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from a book. I hadn't yet thought about the nasty tricks adults play on each other just to hurt each other. Particularly, married adults who aren't in love and who might know the others weakness best. My imagination matured." ...|$|R
