25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
2500|$|Murasaki {{suffered}} overwhelming loneliness, {{had her own}} {{concerns about}} aging, and was not happy living at court. She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: [...] "Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am.... too has often remarked that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not the kind of}} person with whom one could ever relax.... I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E
60|$|Minnie {{looked at}} me, smiling. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{asking for a}} very {{different}} reason.|$|E
30|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a man.|$|R
6000|$|Not unwelcome to {{the ears}} of Una was this praise, but she was {{properly}} deprecatory: [...] "Why, <b>she</b> probably <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just a stuffy, stupid, ugly old thing, as old as--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, don't take it {{too much}} to heart," [...] said Lapham, alarmed at the feeling he had excited; [...] "I don't say <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to guess--trying to----" ...|$|R
6000|$|He cast {{a curious}} sidewise glance. [...] "Well, I'm not pretty to look at, and then, I reckon <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{investigating}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. When I told her, I did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just mad at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|I verily {{believed}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drunk. I {{must have}} looked pretty hard and fierce, bursting into her room with that big gun in hand. My first action then was to lay the gun on her bureau.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I've {{no doubt}} of that, Miss MacPherson," [...] said Mrs. Allan amiably. It was a fib for her, minister's wife though she was. She HAD doubt. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> a dismal failure as teacher of a boys' class.|$|R
60|$|There {{were a few}} persons present whom <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{interested}} to know,--a Miss Goldsmid, daughter of Baron Goldsmid, and Lord Ockham, her grandson, eldest son and heir of the Earl of Lovelace, to whom she introduced my son.|$|R
6000|$|Oh Fame!--if I e'er took {{delight in}} thy praises, [...] 'Twas less {{for the sake}} of thy high-sounding phrases, [...] Than to see the bright eyes of the dear One discover, [...] <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not unworthy to love her.|$|R
60|$|She started, and cry'd {{out most}} horribly, and told me, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{more of a}} Devil than she, for that she knew nothing of all those Tricks, and I did it to fright her, she believ'd I had rais'd the Devil.|$|E
6000|$|This {{inapplicable}} answer {{might have}} been {{too much for the}} comprehension of many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment's consideration, she said, in a whisper to Catherine, [...] "I dare say <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> speaking of her son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thirty-eight, he said yesterday, and {{he married}} very early. I asked Albinia if her son {{would be in}} tail-coats; but <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{laughing}} at her, and would not say. She is quite eager {{at the notion of}} being governess to the girls.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} she had {{forgotten}} the great sum of the principal, or that, through lifelong training and association, it was so sacred {{to her that she}} did not even dream of touching it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> silent, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> persuaded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather a coincidence," [...] he observed. [...] "Seems <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to}} see you to-night at dinner. That was Miss Geraldine Conyers who just rang up--asked me if I'd like to meet her brother again before he goes off. He is {{spending}} the afternoon at the Admiralty and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> interested." ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2006, Smirnov {{teamed up}} with Japanese skater Yuko Kavaguti to compete for Russia. He said, [...] "We often trained at the same rink and I could see how hard <b>she</b> works. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a hard worker but after {{watching}} her <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really amazed by her work level." [...] They train at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. They initially worked with Velikov but Kavaguti had been training with Tamara Moskvina since 1998 and preferred to stay with her. They began training with Moskvina in September 2006.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, it’s this way," [...] {{said the}} master of the Frolic, {{dropping}} his voice. [...] "I’ve been taking a little too much notice of a little craft down Battersea way—nice little thing, an’ <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a single man, dy’e see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|RANSOM: [...] "I {{told her}} that if it amused her, to keep on; I would be only too glad to give her all--the hints I could, but that I oughtn't to {{encourage}} her. She seemed a good deal hurt. I fancied {{at the time that}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tired of having her with me so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{time the}} hounds; {{to see how}} long they'll be before they find. It's very pretty work in a small gorse, but in a great wood like this I don't care much for being so accurate. But for heaven's sake don't tell Julia Tristram; I should not have a chance if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so slack." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} chin till it hid the little, dimple-like {{depression}} below her throat, {{which was one}} of her charms, and began not to look at, but to study me, seeing which I shut my eyes tight and waited. Evidently <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still in my swoon, for now she spoke to herself in a low voice that was soft and sweet as honey.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> hesitated; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> perhaps {{going to}} say that we had been very base. But she remarked after a moment, in a candid, {{wondering}} way, [...] "How much you must want them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at home,' <b>she</b> sighed. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{lying in}} my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I'm weak, my brain got confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don't say anything; but stay with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good; you are kinder than I have any right," [...] said Florida, smiling piteously. [...] "I only mean, don't {{speak of it}} to my mother. Not," [...] she added, [...] "but what I {{want her to know}} {{everything}} I do; but it would worry her if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anxious about her. Oh! I wish I wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{charming and}} royal young widow was bright, intelligent, {{and had a}} mind of her own; {{it was easy to}} see that. She had formed a scheme for her deliverance, and she had been waiting to find some one to help her carry it out. Now, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the man she had been looking for. I was elderly, {{apparently}} respectable, and she had to trust somebody.|$|E
6000|$|And then we {{were friends}} from that moment, for I knew that she told [...] Kitty Sage,-- [...] And she wasn't a girl that would flatter--"that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> [...] tall for my age." [...] And I gave her four apples that evening, and took her to ride on my [...] sled, [...] And-- [...] "What am I telling you this for?" [...] Why, Papa, my {{neighbor}} is [...] DEAD! ...|$|E
5000|$|Kavaguti {{teamed up}} with Alexander Smirnov to compete for Russia in May 2006. She {{accepted}} to skate for another country due to the difficulty in finding a good partner. Smirnov said, [...] "We often trained at the same rink and I could see how hard <b>she</b> works. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a hard worker but after watching her <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really amazed by her work level." [...] They train at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. They initially worked with Nikolai Velikov but Kavaguti had been training with Tamara Moskvina since 1998 and preferred to stay with her. They began training with Moskvina in August 2006.|$|R
60|$|Balkis the Most Beautiful {{stood up}} behind the tree among the red lilies and smiled to herself, for she had heard all this talk. <b>She</b> <b>thought,</b> 'If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wise <b>I</b> can yet save my Lord from the persecutions of these quarrelsome Queens,' and {{she held out her}} finger and whispered softly to the Butterfly's Wife, 'Little woman, come here.' Up flew the Butterfly's Wife, very frightened, and clung to Balkis's white hand.|$|R
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} this, as if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> joking. [...] "It would be droll, wouldn't it, to have Tammany appointees {{teaching}} Altrurianism?" [...] Then she said, {{after a moment}} of reflection: [...] "Why not? It needn't {{be in the hands of}} Tammany. It could be in the hands of the United States; I will ask my lawyer if it couldn't; and I will endow it with money enough to support the school handsomely. Aristide, you have hit it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; you're one of old Bunker's dogs kicked {{overboard}} by Perkins. I'm one of Perkins' dogs gone mad, {{and locked}} up by Perkins! Ha, ha! But I got out! Hush! SHE let me out. <b>SHE</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to see}} the boys at San Antonio. But I'm going off to see the old barque out there in the fog. I'm going to chuck Perkins overboard and the two mates. Let me go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Libby, [...] "that's what I thought. Better {{take my hand}} again," [...] and he secured that of Mrs. Maynard, who {{continued}} her descent. [...] "I suppose I don't understand her exactly. Perhaps {{she did n't like}} my not calling her Doctor. I did n't call her anything. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dodging it. I was. I should have had to call her Miss Breen, if I called her anything." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{whether she}} knew that I was growing rich, or whether <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{becoming}} poorer and poorer, I thought only {{of the day when}} I could go to her father and tell him that I was able to take his daughter and place her in a home as beautiful as that in which she now lived, and maintain her with all the comforts and luxuries which he could give her.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, now I learned for {{the first}} time how high a princess she was, since when her litter passed, these folk prostrated themselves, kissing the air and the dust. Moreover, as soon as she came among them Quilla's bearing changed, for her {{carriage}} grew more haughty and her words fewer. Now she seldom spoke save to issue a command, not even to myself, although I noted that she studied me with her eyes when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not observing her.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{when is it}} to be?" [...] said Sophy. [...] "She's of age now, isn't <b>she?</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you <b>were</b> only {{waiting for}} that. I'm sure we shall like her; come, Frank, do tell us--when are we to see Lady Ballindine?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stepped inside}} the wicket--backwards--and then I slammed {{it in their}} faces, and putting the key in my pocket, walked up the wharf. <b>I</b> knew it <b>was</b> no good {{standing}} out there argufying. I felt sorry for the pore thing in a way. If <b>she</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> her 'usband, and she 'ad lost me---- I put one or two things straight and then, {{for the sake of}} distracting my mind, I 'ad a word or two with the skipper of the John Henry, who was leaning against the side of his ship, smoking.|$|R
