40|$|Inadequate iodine intake {{may result}} in iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD). Thus, for more than 50 years, policies for the regulation of <b>salt</b> <b>fortification</b> with iodine have existed in Brazil. In 2003, a study on 6 - 14 -year-old schoolchildren from regions {{of the state of}} So Paulo showed a median urinary iodine concentration of 360 mu g/L. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the iodine nutrition status among schoolchildren. The study was conducted on 828 schoolchildren aged 4 - 13 years from eight schools in the interior of the state of So Paulo. A casual urine sample was collected from each volunteer for iodine determination by the adapted method of Sandell-Kalthoff. Only 1. 9 % (n = 16) of the children evaluated had low values of urinary iodine ( 300 mu g/L. The results show that the iodine nutritional status of the schoolchildren studied is characterized by a high urinary iodine excretion, which might reveal an increase in iodine consumption by this population...|$|E
40|$|High dietary salt is a {{major cause}} of {{increased}} blood pressure, the leading risk for death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that salt intake be less than 5 g/day, a goal that only a small proportion of people achieve. Iodine deficiency can cause cognitive and motor impairment and, if severe, hypothyroidism with serious mental and growth retardation. More than 2 billion people worldwide are at risk of iodine deficiency. Preventing iodine deficiency by using salt fortified with iodine {{is a major}} global public health success. Programs to reduce dietary salt are technically compatible with programs to prevent iodine deficiency through <b>salt</b> <b>fortification.</b> However, for populations to fully benefit from optimum intake of salt and iodine, the programs must be integrated. This review summarizes the scientific basis for salt reduction and iodine fortification programs, the compatibility of the programs, and the steps that need to be taken by the WHO, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations to ensure that populations fully benefit from optimal intake of salt and iodine. Specifically, expert groups must be convened to help countries implement integrated programs and context-specific case studies of successfully integrated programs; lessons learned need to be compiled and disseminated. Integrated surveillance programs will be more efficient and will enhance current efforts to optimize intake of iodine and salt. For populations to fully benefit, governments need to place a high priority on integrating these two important public health programs. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Adequate iodine {{nutrition}} {{is dependent}} on ground water content, seafood, and, as many countries use iodized cow fodder, dairy products. In most countries, <b>salt</b> <b>fortification</b> programs are needed to assure adequate iodine intake. Objectives: The objectives are threefold: 1) to describe {{the past and present}} iodine situation in the Nordic countries, 2) to identify important gaps of knowledge, and 3) to highlight differences among the Nordic countries’ iodine biomonitoring and fortification policies. Design: Historical data are compared with the current situation. The Nordic countries’ strategies to achieve recommended intake and urine iodine levels and their respective success rates are evaluated. Results: In the past, the iodine situation ranged from excellent in Iceland to widespread goiter and cretinism in large areas of Sweden. The situation was less severe in Norway and Finland. According to a 1960 World Health Organization (WHO) report, there were then no observations of iodine deficiency in Denmark. In Sweden and Finland, the fortification of table salt was introduced 50 – 75 years ago, and in Norway and Finland, the fortification of cow fodder starting in the 1950 s helped improve the population’s iodine status due to the high intake of milk. In Denmark, iodine has been added to household salt and salt in bread for the past 15 years. The Nordic countries differ with regard to regulations and degree of governmental involvement. There are indications that pregnant and lactating women, the two most vulnerable groups, are mildly deficient in iodine in several of the Nordic countries. Conclusion: The Nordic countries employ different strategies to attain adequate iodine nutrition. The situation is not optimal and is in need of re-evaluation. Iodine researchers, Nordic national food administrations, and Nordic governmental institutions would benefit from collaboration to attain a broader approach and guarantee good iodine health for all...|$|E

40|$|Fortification of {{food with}} micronutrients such as {{vitamins}} and minerals {{is one of the}} main strategies used to combat micronutrient deficiencies. Fortification in common salt is a fruitful strategy because of the daily consumption of 5 - 12 g salt per person globally. Therefore double fortification of salt with iodine and iron could be a reasonable approach to prevent both iodine and iron deficiencies. It is reckoned that about two billion people are iodine-deficient worldwide. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy may affect the health status of both mother and fetus and increase infant mortality. Deficiencies of both these micronutrients during childhood affect somatic growth and cognitive and neurological function. Thyroid metabolism is negatively affected by iron deficiency and reduced effectiveness of iodine prophylaxis in areas of endemic goiter. High prevalence of iron deficiency among children may be reduced by the application of effective iodized salt programs. However, ensuring the stability and bioavailability of both iron and iodine as double-fortified salt is difficult. Iodine present in iodide or iodate form in dual-fortified salt is oxidized to free iodine in the presence of ferrous ions and oxygen and consequently loses its characteristics. Moreover, ferrous iron is more bioavailable but is readily oxidized to the less bioavailable ferric form. However, both forms of iron may lead to discoloration of the final product, which can be reduced by providing a physical barrier around the iron. Salt encapsulation is one of the best tools to provide a physical barrier for undesirable reactions and interactions during storage. In this review the concept of dual <b>salt</b> <b>fortification,</b> the impact of fortification on curing various life-threatening maladies, latest assessments of mineral deficiencies and the choice of fortificants are discussed...|$|E

After series of health promotion activities, this survey was conducted to evaluate the extent to which USI was achieved. Cross-sectional survey was conducted in 1, 961 households and 350 markets to estimate the iodine levels of salt consumed or sold. Three degrees of iodization were estimated from fine, coarse and granular texture salt using MBI rapid field test kits. Differences in iodization levels were determined using Bonferroni test in STATA. Determinants for household utilization of AIS were identified using regression analysis and reported as odds ratio (OR). Availability of AIS in households (24. 5 %) and markets (30. 9 %) was far below the 90 % recommendation. No differences where observed in urban (26. 8 %) and rural (24. 1 %) households. Households that used fine-texture salt (OR: 40. 13; CI: 30. 1 - 53. 4) or stored salt in original packs (OR: 8. 02; CI: 6. 01 - 10. 70) were more likely to consume AIS. Across districts, highest household availability of AIS was 51. 7 % while the least was 7. 5 %. The district with the highest market availability of AIS was 85. 7 % while the least was 8. 3 %. Almost 32 % of the traders were aware that selling non-iodized salt was unauthorized but out of this, only 12 % sold AIS. Public education should emphasis appropriate handling and storage of salt throughout the supply chain.

40|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) including goiter {{is still}} considered {{as one of the}} major nutritional problems in Indonesia, including in Central Java. Theoritically, IDD is usually and widely reported to be found in high mountain areas, where the iodine content in soil and water usually low. Eventhough iodine supplementation and <b>salt</b> <b>fortification</b> with iodine program have been done widely, the result of the program has not shown to be optimum. But, in fact, {{it has been reported that}} endemic goiter areas have spreaded widely into low land and coastal areas. The importance of iodine deficiency in goitrogenesis and the prevention and treatment of endemic goiter by iodine supplementation are firmly established. However, epidemiologic and experimental evidence revealed that environmental phenomenons may be responsible for many goiters. Several categories of naturally occurring and anthropogenic antithyroid agents may enter the water, air, and food exposure pathways, becoming important environmental goitrogenic factors in areas. Their effects may be additive to those of iodine deficiency, making the intensity of the manifestations of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) more severe. Their presence should be considered particularly in areas where the features of IDD persist despite adequate iodine prophylaxis. The primary objective of this report was to determine and summarize if the prevalence of goiter in low land and coastal areas has changes over the period 1995 - 1996 to 2003. The prevalence tended to be higher and a new "endemic goiter area" was found. Goiter appears to be a mild to moderate public health problem in low land as well as costal areas. The prevalence and severity of goiter was more severe compared to the previous decade. The change may be due to ecological phenomenon like eroded flood,which may have potentially goitrogenic and adverse effect on the imbalancy of macro-micro elements in soils. In order to have an effective program, the regular monitoring of iodine content and other macro and micronutrient (such as selenium and plumbum) content in the environment (soil, water, food) is essential. ...|$|E
40|$|In present investigation, {{apricots}} from {{locally grown}} â€˜Sufedaâ€™ variety {{were treated with}} edible coatings; chitosan and alginate @ 1 and 2 % levels along with zinc <b>salts</b> <b>fortification</b> i. e. zinc sulfate and zinc chloride @ 30 and 50 ppm concentration. The compositional analysis showed that apricot is {{a good source of}} protein, fiber, calcium and potassium. The zinc fortified chitosan coated apricots showed better control over weight & moisture loss, TSS contents, pH & acidity, organic acids and sugars as compared to alginate based coatings. Similarly, chitosan coatings were efficient in the distribution and adsorption of zinc to the apricot surface as contrast to alginate ones. The edible coated zinc fortified apricots were affected significantly during storage as exhibited by their physico-chemical analyses. The results depicted that the maximum zinc contents of fortified coated apricot was noticed in T 12 (2 % chitosan containing with 50 ppm ZnSO 4) 4. 83 Â± 0. 24 mg/ 100 g followed by T 16 (2 % chitosan containing with 50 ppm ZnCl 2) 4. 82 Â± 0. 21 mg/ 100 g, T 4 (2 % alginate containing with 50 ppm ZnSO 4) 4. 78 Â± 0. 23 mg/ 100 g and T 8 (2 % alginate containing with 50 ppm ZnCl 2) 4. 77 Â± 0. 12 mg/ 100 g, respectively as contrast to T 0 (control) 0. 26 Â± 0. 02 mg/ 100 g. The sensory response of the fortified edible coated apricots was remained within range during storage. Afterwards, efficacy study was carried out in rabbits through two consecutive trials I & II for the validity of results. On the basis of in vitro analysis, HPLC characterization (citric & ascorbic acid and sugars) and zinc contents in edible coated zinc fortified apricots, four best treatments two from each coatings having different zinc salts T 4, T 8, T 12 and T 16 alongside control (unfortified apricots) were selected for the bio-evaluation trial. The consumption of zinc fortified chitosan and alginate coated apricots imparted substantial effect on feed & drink intake and body & organs weights during entire study. Likewise, serum and organs zinc contents of experimental rabbits were significantly improved by the provision of zinc fortified apricots with maximum serum zinc was observed in G 3 (apricot containing 2 % chitosan coating with 50 ppm ZnSO 4), G 1 (apricot containing 2 % alginate coating with 50 ppm ZnSO 4) G 4 (apricot containing 2 % chitosan coating with 50 ppm ZnCl 2) and G 2 (apricot containing 2 % alginate coating with 50 ppm ZnCl 2) as 89. 71 Â± 2. 26, 87. 43 Â± 2. 14, 83. 51 Â± 2. 41 and 81. 49 Â± 2. 46 Ã¬g/dL, respectively as comparison to G 0 as 72. 56 Â± 2. 85 Ã¬g/dL. The percent increase in serum zinc was 24. 63, 20. 50, 15. 09 and 12. 31 % in G 3, G 1, G 4 and G 2, respectively as comparison to G 0. Similarly, liver zinc was noticed as 23. 97 Â± 1. 41, 23. 71 Â± 1. 15, 23. 53 Â± 1. 28 and 23. 36 Â± 1. 45 Ã¬g/g in G 3, G 1, G 4 and G 2 as contrast to G 0 by 22. 42 Â± 1. 36 Ã¬g/g.

Whereas in kidney, zinc contents in G 3, G 1, G 4 and G 2 were noticed as 25. 18 Â± 1. 23, 24. 97 Â± 1. 56, 24. 65 Â± 1. 11 and 24. 40 Â± 1. 30 Ã¬g/g in association to G 0 23. 53 Â± 1. 47 Ã¬g/g. Results showed that percent increase in liver, heart and kidney zinc were 6. 91, 2. 84, 7. 03 (G 3); 5. 72, 2. 08, 6. 12 (G 1); 4. 95, 0. 66, 4. 76 (G 4) and 4. 19, 0. 43, 3. 68 % (G 2), respectively compared to G 0. The attenuation in serum glucose of rabbits is an indicator for the positive impact of zinc <b>salts</b> <b>fortification</b> on this trait. The lowest serum glucose was 111. 79 Â± 4. 48 mg/dL in G 3 nevertheless, maximum serum insulin 9. 38 Â± 0. 51 Ã¬U/mL was observed in the same group. Similarly, the values for liver and kidney functions tests were within the normal range showing the safety of zinc fortified edible coated apricots. The hematological traits of rabbitâ€™s blood also demonstrated normal values for red & white blood cell indices. From instant exploration, it is deduced that zinc fortification through edible coating is a pragmatic choice to overcome hidden hunger with special reference to zinc...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Iodine {{deficiency}} has severe pathological repercussions. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate iodine intake and status in adults in Benin, West Africa. METHODS: We randomly selected 420 participants ages 25 to 64  y and free of visible goiter from urban and rural settings of South Benin. The participants had a diet based on carbohydrates and fish. Urine was collected over a 24 -h period and samples were assayed for iodine analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We studied 401 urinary iodine samples. The overall median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in 24 -h urine was 62. 9  μg/L (interquartile range: 40 - 96. 2  μg/L). UIC was significantly lower in women than men (56. 5 versus 78. 6  μg/L; P <  0. 001) and in rural versus urban areas (54. 7 versus 77. 8  μg/L; P <  0. 001). In multivariate analysis, low UIC (< 100  μg/L) was positively associated with women (odds ratio, 2. 48; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 44 - 4. 26; P =  0. 001) and body mass index < 25  kg/m(2) (odds ratio, 2. 06; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 20 - 3. 54; P =  0. 008). CONCLUSION: Iodine intake appeared to be fairly low in the Beninese population, according to World Health Organization criteria, and factors associated with low iodine intake were identified.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the estimated dietary intake of children at population level who consume fortified staple foods. Methods: In this study, a secondary data {{analysis of the}} database of the National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS; 1999) on dietary data of a nationally representative sample of children (n = 2 200) in South Africa was performed. Prior to 2003 there was no mandatory fortification of staple foods, {{with the exception of}} iodine added to <b>salt.</b> Mandatory <b>fortification</b> of maize and wheat flour was introduced in October 2003. Micronutrient values of fortified wheat and maize food sources were determined by chemical analyses of these foods. These values were then interpolated in the original staple food nutrient analysis determined in the primary analysis of the NFCS database. Findings: The findings of the present study indicated that the addition of micronutrients to staple foods made a significant difference to the intake of vitamin A, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B 6, folic acid and iron. These improvements were particularly important in rural areas where children have the lowest mean dietary micronutrient intake. Conclusions: Based on the results of the secondary data analysis of the national dietary data together with the chemical analyses of fortified foods, it would appear that fortification of two of the most commonly eaten staple foods in the country will significantly improve the micronutrient intake of children under nine years of age and will improve the overall micronutrient density of their diets. It is recommended that appropriate educational messages on the fortification of staple foods in the country should be utilised to improve children's dietary intake at population level, provided such messages facilitate the consumption of the fortified staples by children.

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) is a {{major public}} health problem worldwide, {{in which more than}} two billion people have insufficient iodine intake, including 285 million school-age children. In Tanzania, 41 % of the population is at risk of IDD and 30 % of perinatal mortality is estimated to be attributable to iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency is the number one cause of preventable brain damage in children and an important cause of infant deaths. The most cost-effective health intervention to correct IDD is universal salt iodation (USI). Tanzania has adopted USI since the early 1990 s, but not much is known about its impact on the population and the challenges that were met in implementing this programme in the developing world. Objective: The iodine status of the population following iodine supplementation and <b>salt</b> <b>fortification</b> interventions, and performance of salt iodation technologies used to optimise intervention strategies for sustainable elimination of IDD in Tanzania, have been investigated. Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were carried out in: a) the most iodine deficient areas in 1999; b) low priority intervening areas of Zanzibar islands in 2001; c) a national survey in mainland Tanzania in 2004. These involved testing of salt consumed in the households, analysis of urinary iodine, and goitre assessment in > 160 000 school-age children, and d) another survey in mainland Tanzania, which investigated the status of the salt iodation machines {{and the quality of the}} product at salt factories. An experimental study was also carried out to improve the local technologies for salt iodation. Results: In the most IDD affected areas in Tanzania, total goitre prevalence (TGP) dropped from 65 % in 1980 s to 24 % in 1999, with 83 % of households consuming iodated salt. In Zanzibar islands where there was no intervention, TGP was 25. 6 %. Pemba Island had a higher TGP of 32 % with almost no iodated salt consumed in the households. In mainland Tanzania, a marked improvement was observed in the national survey with a drop of 25 % in TGP in school-age children in 1980 s to 6. 9 % in 2004, and currently 94. 5 % of school children aged 6 - 12 years have no goitre countrywide. However, excessive iodine intake (> 300 μg/l) was found in 35 % of the urine samples, raising concern as to the effectiveness of quality control at the salt production factories. Interviews with salt workers indicated that the standard iodation machines previously serving 140 salt works had been abandoned due to high running costs. Instead, simple iodation techniques using sprayers and sprinklers had been adapted to iodinate the salt. However, 24 % and 69 % of the salt samples analysed from these local technologies were over-iodinated or under-iodinated. The local technologies needed to be evaluated if they were to sustain USI. Improved local iodation methods and procedures, achieved homogenous iodine concentrations with 96 % of the salt samples falling within the recommended iodine level of 40 - 80 ppm. Discussion: It has been demonstrated that a huge improvement in iodine status of large Tanzanian population has resulted from the USI. This might have prevented thousands of child deaths in the country and spared millions of school children from substandard IQ levels, which were both the correct policies. USI has to be extended to cover the Islands of Zanzibar. Locally adopted salt iodation methods with low running costs need to be introduced and maintained in for sustainable IDD elimination. Efforts to enforce salt law and monitor the production and sales of iodated salt have to be stepped up throughout the country for each household to benefit from this cost-effective intervention...|$|E
40|$|Birth defects (structural, {{functional}} and metabolic disorder present from birth, may be diagnosed later) rising {{up as an}} important cause of infant mortality even in developing countries where infant mortality {{has been reduced to}} much extent. Seventy percent of birth defects are preventable through the application of various cost effective community genetic services. Indian people are living in the midst of risk factors for birth defects, e. g., universality of marriage, high fertility, large number of unplanned pregnancies, poor coverage of antenatal care, poor maternal nutritional status, high consanguineous marriages rate, and high carrier rate for hemoglobinopathies. India being the second most populous country with a large number infant born annually with birth defects should focus its attention on strategies for control of birth defects. Many population based strategies such as iodization, double <b>fortification</b> of <b>salt,</b> flour <b>fortification</b> with multivitamins, folic acid supplementation, periconceptional care, carrier screening and prenatal screening are some of proven strategies for control of birth defects. Strategies such as iodization of salt in spite of being initiated {{for a long time in}} the past do have a very little impact on its consumption (only 50 % were using iodized salt). Community genetic services for control of birth defects can be easily flourished and integrated with primary health care in India because of its well established infrastructure and personnel in the field of maternal and child health care. As there is wide variation for infant mortality rate (IMR) in different states in India, so there is a need of deferential approach to implement community genetic services in states those had already achieved national goal of IMR. On the other hand, states those have not achieved the national goal on IMR priority should be given to management of other causes of infant mortality...|$|R

A cross-sectional survey of children 0 - 35 months of age residing in the catchment areas of anganwadi centers {{in the state of}} Telangana was conducted to assess the coverage of adequately iodized salt and the potential for rice <b>fortification.</b> <b>Salt</b> samples were collected and tested for iodine concentration using iodometric titration. Information on demographics, household rice consumption, and Telangana's rice sector was collected and interpreted. In households of selected children, 79 % of salt samples were found to be adequately iodized. Salt brand and district were significant predictors of inadequately iodized salt. Daily rice consumption among children and women averaged 122 grams and 321 grams per day, respectively. Approximately 28 % of households reported consuming rice produced themselves or purchased from a local farmer, 65 % purchased rice from a market or shop, 6 % got rice from a public distribution system site, and 2 % obtained it from a rice mill. In the catchment areas of Telangana's anganwadi centers, there is significant variation in the coverage of adequately iodized salt by district. Future surveys in Telangana should measure the coverage of salt iodization in the general population using quantitative methods. Nonetheless, increasing the adequacy of iodization of smaller salt manufacturers would help achieve universal salt iodization in Telangana. Despite high consumption of rice, our findings suggest that large-scale market-based rice fortification is not feasible in Telangana due to a large proportion of households producing their own rice and highly fragmented rice distribution. Distributing fortified rice via Telangana's public distribution system may be a viable approach to target low-income households, but would only reach a small proportion of the population in Telangana...|$|R
