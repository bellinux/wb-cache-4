5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and {{supervisors}} will make themselves available for employment. Agents {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to buy new technologies as needed. Multiplayer is available over an IPX network with TetraCorp being the only playable race.|$|E

25|$|For testing purposes, {{satellites}} in low {{earth orbit}} have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth. Russia, the United States and China have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites. In 2007 the Chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite, followed by the US Navy shooting down a defunct <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> in February 2008.|$|E
25|$|India and Israel enjoy strong {{military}} and strategic ties. Israeli authorities consider Indian citizens {{to be the}} most pro-Israel people in the world. Apart from being Israel's second-largest economic partner in Asia, India is also the largest customer of Israeli arms in the world. In 2006, annual military sales between India and Israel stood at US$900 million. Israeli defense firms had the largest exhibition at the 2009 Aero India show, during which Israel offered several state-of-the art weapons to India. The first major military deal between the two countries was the sale of Israeli EL/W-2090 AEW radars to the Indian Air Force in 2004. In March 2009, India and Israel signed a US$1.4 billion deal under which Israel would sell India an advanced air-defense system. India and Israel have also embarked on extensive space cooperation. In 2008, India's ISRO launched Israel's most technologically advanced <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> TecSAR. In 2009, India reportedly developed a high-tech <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> RISAT-2 with significant assistance from Israel. The satellite was successfully launched by India in April 2009.|$|E
25|$|The United States of America had not tested an {{anti-satellite weapon}} since 1985. In February 2008 the US {{launched}} its own strike {{to destroy a}} non-functioning US satellite, which demonstrated the capability to strike in space, though {{at a much lower}} altitude than the Chinese test. The US claims that the strike was not a military test but a necessary mission to remove the threat posed by the decaying orbit of a faulty <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> with a full tank of hydrazine fuel.|$|E

25|$|Various {{theories}} were disseminated in Russian mass media.

Many other Russian media reprinted the photo. The authenticity of the photo was questioned by online commentators. The photo had been emailed to the Vice-President of the Russian Union of Engineers by a self-described aviation expert who had found it on a Russian online forum. The aviation expert later apologised, {{saying that he was}} unhappy with how the information had been used.|$|E

Israel's Minister for Science and Technology has expressed interest in collaborating with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) towards using satellites to better manage land and other resources. Israel has also expressed interest in participating in ISRO's Chandrayaan Mission involving an unmanned mission to the moon. On 21 January 2008, India successfully launched an Israeli <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> into orbit from Sriharikota space station in southern India.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, both {{countries}} regularly deployed <b>satellites.</b> <b>Spy</b> <b>satellites</b> were used by militaries to take accurate pictures of their rivals' military installations. As time passed the resolution and accuracy of orbital reconnaissance alarmed both sides of the iron curtain. Both the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop anti-satellite weapons to blind or destroy each other's satellites. Laser weapons, kamikaze style satellites, as well as orbital nuclear explosion were researched with varying levels of success. <b>Spy</b> <b>satellites</b> were, and continue to be, used to monitor the dismantling of military assets in accordance with arms control treaties signed between the two superpowers. To use <b>spy</b> <b>satellites</b> in such a manner is often referred to in treaties as [...] "national technical means of verification".|$|R

The C-119s performed aerial recovery of high-altitude balloon-borne instrument packages. C-119s from the 6593rd Test Squadron based at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii performed several aerial recoveries of film-return capsules {{during the early years of}} the Corona <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> program. On 19 August 1960, the recovery by a C-119 of film from the Corona mission code-named Discoverer 14 was the first successful recovery of film from an orbiting satellite and the first aerial recovery of an object returning from Earth orbit.|$|E

2500|$|The ASM-135 missile was {{designed}} to be a standoff anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, with the F-15 acting as a first stage. The Soviet Union could correlate a U.S. rocket launch with a <b>spy</b> <b>satellite</b> loss, but an F-15 carrying an ASAT would blend in among hundreds of F-15 flights. From January 1984 to September 1986, two F-15As were used as launch platforms for the ASAT missile. The F-15As were modified to carry one ASM-135 on the centerline station with extra equipment within a special centerline pylon. The launch aircraft executed a Mach 1.22, 3.8 g climb at 65Â° to release the ASAT missile at an altitude of [...] The flight computer was updated to control the zoom-climb and missile release.|$|E
2500|$|On October 10, 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that the Israelis had shared the Syrian strike dossier with Turkey.
