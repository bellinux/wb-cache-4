Also {{they are used}} to produce gels and to act as flocculates, binders, lubricants, to serve as modifiers of film properties, and have a function as adjusters of rheological parameters. Surfactants, on the other hand, perform numerous functions acting as dispersants, wetting agents, emulsifiers and antifoaming agents. The rheological properties of polysaccharide thickeners (guar gums with different substitution levels and different producers) at different concentrations and temperatures and, second,the effects produced by the addition of nonionic surfactants (polyoxyethylene <b>stearyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> with different numbers of EO groups) have been studied under linear and nonlinear shear conditions. Experimental data have been correlated with the different modelsČ flow curves with the Cross, Carreau and Meter-Bird model, and mechanical spectra with the generalized Maxwell model and Friedrich-Braun model.

5000|$|Fatty {{alcohols}} (or long-chain alcohols) {{are usually}} high-molecular-weight, straight-chain primary alcohols, {{but can also}} range from as few as 4-6 carbons {{to as many as}} 22-26, derived from natural fats and oils.

Some commercially important fatty <b>alcohols</b> are lauryl, <b>stearyl,</b> and oleyl <b>alcohols.</b> They are colourless oily liquids (for smaller carbon numbers) or waxy solids, although impure samples may appear yellow. Fatty alcohols usually have an even number of carbon atoms and a single alcohol group (-OH) attached to the terminal carbon. Some are unsaturated and some are branched.

50|$|Shampoo {{intended}} for animals may contain insecticides or other medications {{for treatment of}} skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special {{care must be taken}} not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended {{to do more than just}} clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas.The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur.Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, <b>stearyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos.Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.|$|E

40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the inhibitory activity of long-chain alcohols on the growth of Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Peak inhibition was recorded with saturated primary alcohols (64 microM) varying in chain length from 16 to 19 carbon atoms. The unsaturated alcohols (oleyl, linoleyl, and linolenyl) and the secondary alcohol (pentadecan- 2 -ol), when employed in the same test conditions, were considerably less effective growth inhibitors than the primary saturated alcohols. Stearic and palmitic acids were also ineffective as growth inhibitors of M. pneumoniae and M. gallisepticum at a 128 microM concentration. Because these antimycoplasma agents are fatty alcohols and cholesterol {{is known to be}} required for the growth of some mycoplasmas, additional cholesterol was added in an attempt to reverse the inhibition observed with these agents. Cholesterol at a 128 microM concentration did not significantly relieve the growth inhibition observed with <b>stearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> at a 48 microM concentration.

40|$|Measurements were {{obtained}} of the interfacial resistance due to thin films of straight-chain higher alcohols and {{their effect on}} the evaporation of water. This was done by passing preheated dry air at a constant rate over water in a beaker. Unlike previous studies both phases were stitted.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of the Ru/Sn ratio on the catalytic hydrogenation of methyl oleate to oleyl alcohol using Ru-Sn-B catalysts, notably on the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The catalyst with the highest activity and selectivity towards oleyl alcohol is Ru(1 %) -Sn(2 %) -B/Al 2 O 3. At a low Sn loading (0. 5 %) the catalyst has high activity for hydrogenation of the carbonyl group and the carbon-carbon double bond.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{successful}} incorporation of a highly soluble drug, procaine HCl, in a programmed-release megaloporous system.

Carnauba wax, <b>stearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and carboxyvinyl polymer were used to constitute the restraining matrix granules. The effects of various parameters on drug release rate were investigated. A higher percentage of either carboxyvinyl polymer or drug in the restraining matrix granules both induced increased drug release rates.
