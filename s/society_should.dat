5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law <b>Society</b> <b>should</b> transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law <b>Society</b> <b>should</b> be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic <b>society</b> <b>should</b> be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{say they}} {{encourage}} adult homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual relationships and that <b>society</b> <b>should</b> recognize them legally. Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with {{a fear that}} Raëlians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They express the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.|$|E

5|$|The Qur'an is {{the first}} and most {{important}} source of Islamic law. Believed to be the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad through angel Gabriel in Mecca and Medina, the scripture specifies the moral, philosophical, social, political and economic basis on which a <b>society</b> <b>should</b> be constructed. The verses revealed in Mecca deal with philosophical and theological issues, whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio-economic laws. The Qur'an was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad, and compiled soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the <b>Society</b> <b>should</b> give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people have}} opposed {{feminism}} {{on the grounds}} that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in <b>society</b> <b>should</b> be maintained. mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | page = 10 | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781581345704 | quote = The feminist assault on traditional gender roles and families began in earnest in the 1960s and increasingly turned radical in the 1970s. }} Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.|$|E
25|$|Co-operative Federalism is {{the school}} of thought favouring {{consumer}} co-operative societies. Historically, its proponents have included JTW Mitchell and Charles Gide, as well as Paul Lambart and Beatrice Webb. The co-operative federalists argue that consumers should form co-operative wholesale societies (Co-operative Federations in which all members are co-operators, the best historical example of which being CWS in the United Kingdom), and that these co-operative wholesale <b>societies</b> <b>should</b> undertake purchasing farms or factories. They argue that profits (or surpluses) from these co-operative wholesale <b>societies</b> <b>should</b> be paid as dividends to the member co-operators, rather than to their workers.|$|R

The two factions handling reconstruction in city enclaves are a future version of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which builds and maintains the emergent city states, acting as the defacto government body; and the Order, a religion combining concepts from multiple faiths which has gained support from people outside the enclaves and is opposed to the WTO's policies. Both the Order and the WTO are puppet organizations of the Illuminati, respectively led by Illuminati members Nicolette DuClare and Chad Dumier, the latter {{a veteran of the}} war against Majestic 12. Two other factions are the Knights Templar, a group led by former Order leader Saman that makes militant strikes against groups espousing biomod use; and the Omar, a cult of cybernetically-enhanced humans who share a hive mind.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} aggregative {{democracy}} {{claims that the}} aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens' preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies <b>society</b> <b>should</b> adopt.

25|$|Professor John Bellamy Foster, a sociologist, {{questioned}} whether the resurgence had been truly Keynesian in character.

40|$|This article {{asks whether}} Central and Eastern European <b>societies</b> <b>should</b> {{be seen as}} fully {{consolidated}} democracies or whether they should still be considered as democracies at risk. Using the concept of embedded democracy developed by Wolfgang Merkel {{and the members of}} the project on Defective Democracies, this paper argues that Central and Eastern European <b>societies</b> <b>should</b> be defined as semi-consolidated democracies, since one of the three rings of external embeddedness (the ring concerning the social and economic requisites of democracy) still shows significant deficiencies. The main argument is that due to the presence of shortcomings in the socio-economic environment, the process of democratic stabilization in the region is still far from finished. This is primarily reflected in the attitudes of Eastern European citizens towards non-democratic forms of government. Due to the important democratizing role of welfare institutions, this paper also proposes the inclusion of welfare state efficiency as a key element in the measurement of democratic consolidation.
