This project conducted interviews with 45 women about their experiences as workers in the shipbuilding and <b>ship-repair</b> <b>yards</b> of the North-East of England during the Second World War. The project explored the women's experience of work within a very traditional male dominated occupational world. The primary aim was to secure an oral history record and to establish a resource for future researchers. In addition, the interviews contributed to contemporary historical reassessments, which aimed to accord a proper place to women's work and roles. The data from the interviews illuminated aspects of the changing division of labour and organisation of work in shipbuilding, contributing to debates {{about the nature of}} skill and patterns of autonomy of industrial work.
