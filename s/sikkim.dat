5|$|Historically, <b>Sikkim</b> was a British dependency, with {{a status}} {{similar to that}} of the other princely states, and was {{therefore}} considered to be within the frontiers of India in the colonial period. On independence, however, the Chogyal of <b>Sikkim</b> resisted full integration into India. Given the region's strategic importance to India, the Government of India signed first a Standstill Agreement and then in 1950 a full treaty with the Chogyal of <b>Sikkim</b> which in effect made it a protectorate which was no longer part of India. India had responsibility for defence, external affairs and communications, and ultimate responsibility for law and order, but <b>Sikkim</b> was otherwise given full internal autonomy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, supported by the minority Bhutia and Lepcha upper classes, attempted to negotiate greater powers, particularly over external affairs, to give <b>Sikkim</b> more of an international personality. These policies were opposed by Kazi Lhendup Dorji and the <b>Sikkim</b> State Congress, who represented the ethnic Nepali middle classes and took a more pro-Indian view.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 and 1948, {{a popular}} vote for <b>Sikkim</b> to join newly {{independent}} India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru {{agreed to a}} special protectorate status for <b>Sikkim.</b> <b>Sikkim</b> agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.|$|E
5|$|More than 50 {{newspapers}} are published in <b>Sikkim.</b> Multiple local Nepali and English {{newspapers are}} published, whereas {{regional and national}} Hindi and English newspapers, printed elsewhere in India, are also circulated.

5|$|As the {{headquarters}} of East <b>Sikkim</b> district, Gangtok houses {{the offices of the}} district collector, an administrator appointed by the Union Government of India. Gangtok is also the seat of the <b>Sikkim</b> High Court, which is India's smallest High Court in terms of area and population of jurisdiction. Gangtok does not have its own police commissionerate like other major cities in India. Instead, it comes {{under the jurisdiction of the}} state police, which is headed by a Director General of Police, although an Inspector General of Police oversees the town. <b>Sikkim</b> is known for its very low crime rate. Rongyek jail in Gangtok is Sikkim's only central jail.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok's economy {{does not}} have a large {{manufacturing}} base, but has a thriving Cottage industry in watch-making, country-made alcohol and handicrafts. Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibres or cotton rags. The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state's rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons. The majority of the private business community is made up of Marwaris and Biharis. As part of <b>Sikkim,</b> Gangtok enjoys the status of being an income-tax free region as per the state's 1948 Income tax law. As <b>Sikkim</b> is a frontier state, the Indian army maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok. This leads to a population of semi-permanent residents who bring money into the local economy. The <b>Sikkim</b> government started India's first online lottery Playwin to boost government income, but this was later closed by a ruling from the <b>Sikkim</b> High Court.|$|E
5|$|Hinduism and Buddhism are {{the most}} {{significant}} religions in Gangtok. Gangtok also has a sizeable Christian population and a small Muslim minority.

Other languages spoken in Gangtok include Bhutia (Sikkimese), Tibetan and Lepcha.|$|E
5|$|In April 1973, anti-Chogyal {{agitation}} {{broke out}} and protestors demanded popular elections. The <b>Sikkim</b> police {{were unable to}} control the demonstrations, and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene. India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji, and produced an agreement, which envisaged {{the reduction of the}} Chogyal to the role of a constitutional monarch and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power-sharing formula. The Chogyal's opponents won an overwhelming victory, and a new Constitution was drafted providing for <b>Sikkim</b> {{to be associated with the}} Republic of India. On 10 April 1975, the <b>Sikkim</b> Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India. This resolution was endorsed by 97 percent of the vote in a referendum held on 14 April 1975, following which the Indian Parliament amended the constitution to admit <b>Sikkim</b> into India as its 22nd state.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} was {{recognized}} as the state animal of <b>Sikkim</b> in the early 1990s, and was the mascot of the Darjeeling Tea Festival.|$|E
5|$|Western {{red panda}} A. f. fulgens (Cuvier, 1825) {{lives in the}} western part of its range, in Nepal, Assam, <b>Sikkim,</b> and Bhutan.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{contributor to}} the town's economy is education sector. The schools of Kalimpong, besides imparting education to the locals, attract {{a significant number of}} students from the plains, the neighbouring state of <b>Sikkim</b> and countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok is {{the main}} base for <b>Sikkim</b> tourism. Summer and spring seasons {{are the most popular}} tourist seasons. Many of Gangtok's {{residents}} are employed directly and indirectly in the tourism industry, with many residents owning and working in hotels and restaurants.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the rest}} of <b>Sikkim,</b> not much {{is known about the}} early history of Gangtok. The {{earliest}} records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of <b>Sikkim</b> after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time.|$|E
5|$|Residents of <b>Sikkim</b> are {{music lovers}} {{and it is}} common to hear Western rock music being played in homes and restaurants. Hindi pop songs are also common. Indigenous Nepali rock, music suffused with a western rock beat and Nepali lyrics, is {{particularly}} popular.|$|E

5|$|West Bengal is {{bordered by}} three countries: Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh; and five Indian states: <b>Sikkim,</b> Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Assam. <b>Sikkim</b> and Bhutan are located {{to the north}} of the state, Nepal to the northwest, Bihar and Jharkhand in the west, Odisha in the southwest, the Bay of Bengal to the south, and Bangladesh and Assam are in the east. West Bengal is the only state of India that has both the Himalayas in the north and the Bay of Bengal at the south. In between them, the river Ganga enters the state from west, before it {{branches}} off into its main distributaries: the Hooghly River, which flows southwards to reach the Bay of Bengal, and the Padma River, which flows eastwards into Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, {{shifted the}} capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, {{increasing}} the city's importance. A new grand palace {{along with other}} state buildings {{was built in the}} new capital. Following India's independence in 1947, <b>Sikkim</b> became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. <b>Sikkim</b> came under the suzerainty of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business. The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{after years}} of {{political}} uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and <b>Sikkim</b> became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum. Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Many establishments {{cater to}} the Indian army bases near the town, {{providing}} it with essential supplies. Small contributions to the economy come by {{the way of the}} sale of traditional arts and crafts of <b>Sikkim</b> and Tibet. Government efforts related to sericulture, seismology, and fisheries provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents.|$|E
5|$|On the Indian side, only {{citizens}} of India {{can visit the}} pass on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, after obtaining permits one day in advance in Gangtok. The pass is particularly useful for pilgrims visiting monasteries in <b>Sikkim</b> such as Rumtek, one of the holiest shrines in Buddhism. For Hindus, the pass reduces the journey time to Mansarovar Lake from fifteen days to two days.|$|E
5|$|Swadweep – The {{empire of}} the Chandravanshis, {{also known as}} the island of the individual.

5|$|The {{cultural}} centres in Kalimpong include, the Lepcha Museum and the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang monastery. The Lepcha Museum, a kilometre {{away from}} the town centre, showcases {{the culture of the}} Lepcha community, the indigenous peoples of <b>Sikkim.</b> The Zang Dhok Palri Phodong monastery has 108 volumes of the Kangyur, and belongs to the Gelug of Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, {{used this}} pass {{to travel to}} India for the 2,500th {{birthday}} celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957. Later, on 1 September 1958, Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, and Palden Thondup Namgyal (son of—and internal affairs adviser to—Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of <b>Sikkim)</b> used this pass to travel to nearby Bhutan.|$|E
5|$|According to the Provisional Population Totals 2011 {{census of}} India, the {{population}} of Gangtok Municipal Corporation has been estimated to be 98,658. Males constituted 53% {{of the population and}} females 47%. The Gangtok subdivision of the East <b>Sikkim</b> district had a population of 281,293, Gangtok has an average literacy rate of 82.17%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 85.33%, and female literacy is 78.68. About 8% of Gangtok's population live in the nine notified slums and squatter settlements, all on Government land. More people live in areas that depict slum-like characteristics but have not been notified as slums yet because they have developed on private land. Of the total urban population of <b>Sikkim,</b> Gangtok Municipal Corporation has a share of 55.5%. Including Gangtok, East District has a share of 88% of the total urban population. The quality of life, the pace of development and availability of basic infrastructure and employment prospects has been the major cause for rapid migration to the city. With this migration, the urban services are under pressure, intensified by the lack of availability of suitable land for infrastructure development.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok rose to {{prominence}} {{as a popular}} Buddhist pilgrimage site after {{the construction of the}} Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won its independence from Britain in 1947, <b>Sikkim</b> chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rammed earth}} walls were {{built by the}} Longshan people in 2600–1900 BC, during the period when cities first {{appeared}} in the region. Thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as <b>Sikkim.</b> The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of Carthage was built of rammed earth. From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La {{played a}} vital role in the 1903–1904 British {{expedition}} to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between <b>Sikkim</b> and Tibet.|$|E
5|$|The red panda's local names {{differ from}} place to place. The Lepcha people call it sak nam. In Nepal, the species is called bhalu biralo (bear-cat) and habre. The Sherpa people of Nepal and <b>Sikkim</b> call it ye niglva ponva and wah donka. The word wậː is Sunuwari meaning bear; in Tamang language, a small, red bear is called tāwām. In the Kanchenjunga region of eastern Nepal, the Limbus know red pandas as kaala, which {{literally}} means dark because of their underside pelage; villagers of Tibetan origin call them hoptongar.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow {{is found}} in parts of eastern Asia and in the Himalayas. It is not known whether its {{distribution}} is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the Brahmaputra River's valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists. In the Himalayas the russet sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern Tibet, Bhutan, <b>Sikkim,</b> Nepal, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir and Nuristan in Afghanistan. Here, the russet sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between November and April in many areas.|$|E
5|$|There were fears {{among some}} traders in India that Indian goods {{would find a}} limited outlet in Tibet, while China would {{have access to a}} ready market in <b>Sikkim</b> and West Bengal. The reopening of the pass was {{expected}} to stimulate the economy of the region and bolster Indo-Chinese trade, but this has not happened. Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006, only US$186,250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong {{is a major}} ginger {{growing area}} of India. Kalimpong {{and the state of}} <b>Sikkim</b> {{together}} contribute 15 percent of ginger produced in India. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is internationally famous for its tea industry. However, most of the tea gardens are on the western side of Teesta river (towards the town of Darjeeling) and so tea gardens near Kalimpong contribute only 4percent of total tea production of the region. In Kalimpong division, 90percent of land is cultivable but only 10percent is used for tea production. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry—especially for its wide array of indigenous orchids and gladioli.|$|E
5|$|Other {{options were}} explored, {{including}} the Kalmyk Project, a Soviet plan {{to launch a}} surprise attack on the north-west frontier of India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states such as Bhutan, <b>Sikkim,</b> Nepal, Thailand, and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyk people. The intention was to use these places as a staging ground for revolution in India, as they offered the shortest route to the revolutionary heartland of Bengal. Historians suggest that the plan may have been prompted by Mahendra Pratap's efforts and advice to the Soviet leadership in 1919 when—along with other Indian revolutionaries—he pressed for a joint Soviet-Afghan campaign into India. Under {{the cover of a}} scientific expedition to Tibet headed by Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, the plan was to arm the indigenous people in the North-East Indian region with modern weaponry. The project had the approval of Lenin.|$|E
