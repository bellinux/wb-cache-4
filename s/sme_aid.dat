40|$|Building {{and using}} {{agent-based}} models is often impractical, {{in part due}} to the cost of including expensive subject matter experts (SMEs) in the development process. In this paper, we describe a method for “bootstrapping ” model building to lower the cost of overall model development. The models we are interested in here capture dynamic phenomena related to international and subnational conflict. The method of acquiring these models begins with event data drawn from news reports about a conflict region, and infers model characteristics particular to a conflict modeling framework called the Power Structure Toolkit (PSTK). We describe the toolkit and how it has been used prior to this work. We then describe the current problem of modeling conflict and the empirical data available to learn models, and extensions to the PSTK for model generation from this data. We also describe a formative evaluation of the system that compares the performance and costs of models built entirely by an SME against models built with an <b>SME</b> <b>aided</b> by the automated model generation process. Early results indicate at least equivalent prediction rates with significant savings in model generation costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{economies are}} seeking to promote {{financial}} inclusion, i. e., greater access to financial services for low-income households and firms, {{as part of their}} overall strategies for economic and financial development. This {{raises the question of whether}} financial stability and financial inclusion are, broadly speaking, substitutes or complements. In other words, does the move toward greater financial inclusion tend to increase or decrease financial stability? A number of studies have suggested both positive and negative ways in which financial inclusion could affect financial stability, but very few empirical studies have been made of their relationship. This partly reflects the scarcity and relative newness of data on financial inclusion. This study contributes to the literature on this subject by estimating the effects of various measures of financial inclusion (together with some control variables) on some measures of financial stability, including bank non-performing loans and bank Z-scores. We find some evidence that an increased share of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (<b>SMEs)</b> <b>aids</b> financial stability, mainly by reducing non-performing loans (NPLs) and the probability of default by financial institutions. This suggests that policy measures to increase financial inclusion, at least by SMEs, would have the side-benefit of contributing to financial stability as well...|$|R
40|$|Small and Medium size Enterprises (SME) are {{considered}} as a backbone of many developing and developed economies of the world; they are the driving force to any major economy across the globe. Through Cloud Computing firms outsource their entire information technology (IT) process while concentrating more on their core business. It allows businesses to cut down heavy cost incurred over IT infrastructure without losing focus on customer needs. However, Cloud industry to an extent has struggled to grow among SMEs due to the reluctance and concerns expressed by them. Throughout {{the course of this}} study several interviews were conducted and the literature was reviewed to understand how cloud providers offer services and what challenges SMEs are facing. The study identified issues like cloud knowledge, interoperability, security and contractual concerns to be hindering SMEs adoption of cloud services. From the interviews common practices followed by cloud vendors and what concerns SMEs have were identified as a basis for a cloud framework which will bridge gaps between cloud vendors and SMEs. A stepwise framework for cloud adoption is formulated which identifies and provides recommendation to four most predominant challenges which are hurting cloud industry and taking SMEs away from cloud computing, as well as guide <b>SMEs</b> <b>aiding</b> in successful cloud adoption. Moreover, this framework streamlines the cloud adoption process for SMEs by removing ambiguity in regards to fundamentals associated with their organisation and cloud adoption process.

It was found that SMEs mainly requested support with specific product related problems and tasks, rather than improvements to process or practice. It was also found that university faculty members have little time or incentive to provide such support which may not directly progress a research portfolio. However, with the aid of available government funding, researchers could benefit from undertaking such support work to fill gaps between fixed term research contracts; though administering short term irregular contracts proved a major unresolved barrier. It is recommended that engineering design researchers work as projects managers to provide technology and knowledge transfer, drawing further expertise from researchers within their universities.

The empirical results show that Luxembourg, Sweden and, in particular, the Baltic States can serve as a good benchmark for transforming a relatively favourable environment of public administration excellence into SME indicator growth. On the other hand, Denmark and the UK, despite their top ease-of-doing-business rankings could not significantly spur SME growth in the considered period.

40|$|Confronted by {{the current}} global {{economic}} crisis, Taipei, China's economy has suffered much like its neighbors. However, Taipei, China is different from other East Asia economies in several aspects. First, Taipei, China's industrial organization is dominated by {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), unlike the chaebols of the Republic of Korea or the Japanese Kabushiki-gaish. Second, Taipei, China has experienced extraordinary hollowing-out of its industrial base as many firms (both large and SMEs) have moved their manufacturing operation to People's Republic of China (PRC). This is also manifested in the fact that Taipei,China {{has become one of the}} largest sources of FDI in the PRC, and Taipei, China's trade dependency with the PRC is ever rising. A silver lining is that when the sub-prime crisis hit the United States and weakened her import demand, the aforementioned hollowing-out meant less direct employment impact on Taipei, China.

40|$|Background: Globalization is {{well known}} in the {{business}} world and more and more firms, especially larger ones, are expanding into other countries. Though SMEs represent the largest share with about 99 % of firms contributing to the wealth of import or export reliant countries, the majority is not taking the chance to grow by going international. It seems that the internationalization barriers {{play a crucial role in}} hindering this process wherefore this thesis aims at collecting possible support providers and activities which are <b>aiding</b> <b>SMEs</b> to overcome these barriers. More specifically is this thesis mainly offering an in-depth summary on major support organizations, firms and networks in Germany and Sweden including their specific activities of assistance. Purpose: The purpose of this master thesis is to describe and compare the internationalization support providers in Germany and Sweden including their respective offered activities. Method: A qualitative and inductive research approach was used in this study, following a practice-oriented, descriptive case study. Data was collected through secondary data collection and the analysis was based on content analysis including coding. Results: In Germany the main services offered are networking, market research and financing assistance, while mobility aid and training is rather rare. In Sweden in comparison training is highly provided as well as market research and networking assistance, whereas marketing and strategy enhancement plus mobility and implementation assistance are uncommon. Conclusion: Since each firm has individual needs, it was refrained from a standardized valuation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This thesis critiques the consultant-client {{relationship}} in Chinese SMEs’ lean improvement projects. SMEs, which {{are crucial to}} China’s economy, encounter many challenges during their development. Management practices, such as lean, {{have been developed to}} improve organisational performance. In their application to SMEs, resource constraints mean that business assistance from external agencies, such as management consultants, is required. Drawing on multiple theoretical lenses, including organisational learning, institutional theory and contingency theory, a research framework is established. This framework is employed to identify three research themes: organisations’ abandonment of existing practices; organisations’ learning of lean practices; and the consultant - SME client relationship during lean improvement projects. As well as the established consultants’ role, “consultants as external advisors”, a new role, “consultants in residence”, is identified. These two roles are studied through the three research themes. This thesis employs a multiple-case study approach. Consultancy-involved lean projects undertaken in five Chinese SMEs are investigated using data collection methods of semi-structured interviews, direct observation and documentation. Both within- and cross-case analyses are applied. The main contributions of this thesis are fourfold. First, it sets out the changing nature of the consultant - SME client relationship throughout the projects by comparing and contrasting the consultants’ and clients’ perspectives. Second, a framework which defines the impact of SME structural characteristics on the consultant-client relationship is developed. Thirdly, two organisational learning frameworks in relation to the two consultants’ roles are established. Furthermore, the approach employed to deinstitutionalise organisations’ existing practices is compared between the two consultants’ roles. In the conclusion, the implications of this research for academia, practitioners and policy makers are discussed. A checklist which can <b>aid</b> <b>SME</b> managers in employing consultancy services is proposed and areas for future research are identified...|$|R
40|$|Notre Dame Business {{students}} at the University’s Sydney Campus immersed themselves in Sub-Saharan African business life by developing three social enterprise business plans to promote sustainable and viable industry in poverty affected communities. As part of an assessable project for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in 2010, the students’ business plans made recommendations to improve sustainability methods in the honey production, fish farming and handcrafted shoulder bag industries in Zambia. The commodities, intended for export, are largely produced by farmers and villagers in Zambia {{and can be used}} to generate an external source of income and encourage employment opportunities in their communities. On behalf of the 2010 cohort, this year’s students presented the final business plans to Australian social entrepreneur Ashley Tuttle, co-founder of the Pakamisa Fund (which means ‘to lift up’ in Zulu), {{when he and his wife}} Tessa visited the Sydney Campus in June. The Fund links investors with entrepreneurs in the small to medium enterprise (<b>SME)</b> sector to <b>aid</b> disadvantaged communities enhance their standard of living and to release people from poverty through employment and business development. One business plan that was presented called on subsistent honey farmers to be provided with proper equipment and training by Pakamisa to develop produce suitable for the South African import market; thus generating more income for their villages. Mr Tuttle said that micro-enterprise and micro-credit were usually limited to sole trader/subsistence level businesses. However, he explained that allowing investors to take an equity position in SME businesses could increase employment and generate new income to a poor area. Lecturer at the Sydney School of Business, Mark Hornshaw, said the students found it challenging but very fulfilling to work on a ‘real life’ business for their assignment. “To have the opportunity to work on a project that had so much potential to help people in need was incredibly rewarding,” Mr Hornshaw said.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} how interventions can be carried out in order for small and medium sized companies (SMEs) to adopt new ways of working, by understanding the context, process and content of the intervention. Interventions are defined as activities aimed at introducing new ways of working through a series of focused activities in the organization. Design/methodology/approach The work was part of an EU-funded project called FutureSME aiming at <b>aiding</b> <b>SMEs</b> in becoming more competitive. This paper is based on a multiple case study of twelve SMEs from six European countries undergoing similar interventions. The empirical data has been collected through presentations by company representatives, A 3 reports including structured information about the intervention and its outcome, and case essays containing subjective descriptions of respective company’s experiences from the interventions. The material has been subject to a cross-case analysis. Findings This paper elaborates on previous research on important factors to consider in order for interventions to lead to long-term effects in SMEs. The results from this study suggest that in the design of the interventions at SMEs, one needs to carefully consider the context aspects regarding the intervention, which is seen as a deficiency in the project. It is also pointed out that not only the process or context of the intervention is of importance, but also the content. We suggest content that 1) supports the formulation of strategies, 2) encourages dialogue, and 3) uses company data. Hence, when designing an intervention in SMEs it is beneficial if the content have such characteristics, and by inclusion both short-term success and long-term sustainability are more likely as a result of the intervention. Research limitations/implications This paper does not deal with how to motivate SMEs to initiate an intervention process. Originality/value Intervention studies have mostly focused on larger companies. The special set-up with dedicated external support and a long term relationship within a large-scale project has provided access to a study of twelve SMEs across Europe and has provided a rare opportunity for research...|$|R
40|$|Effective and {{efficient}} product development (PD) {{is critical to}} the success of many firms. The market's emphasis on getting faster and cheaper products has forced firms to shift their PD practices from sequential to distributed development practices. This shift has significantly increased complexity and dynamism of PD processes, but often is not sufficiently accounted for by PD managers. Transitioning to distributed PD processes is even more challenging for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), who usually lack resources to secure external help. Furthermore, SMEs have been increasingly using distributed PD to not only cut costs but also accelerate PD processes, which adds extra complexity to the management of PD processes. The objective of this thesis is to develop a generalizable model of distributed PD to <b>aid</b> <b>SMEs</b> better manage their PD processes. First, I identified the necessary attributes that have to be captured in distributed PD process modeling within SMEs using firm interviews and academic literature. I validated the attribute list using firm surveys. Next, I developed a discrete-event simulation model that accounted for task structure, rework, multiple teams, flexible work hours, individual performance ratings and learning curve factors. The model is designed to calculate project completion time and cost. In addition, it generates a probability distribution function of completion time that can be used to further guide PD manager decision-making. I encapsulated the model within a software application called SimLinkTM for both Mac OS® and iOS@ mobile devices. Finally, I adopted a multistage validation process using both historical data sets and ongoing project data to accurately replicate observed results and guide decision making in real world scenario. I built additional confidence in model's predictive ability through sensitivity and stochasticity analysis. The application can be used to evaluate the impact of different PD attributes and analyze various PD scenarios before implementing them in real world. Specifically, the application (and underlying model) has been used to investigate cost and schedule targets for various PD staffing configurations, as well as to analyze the impact of around-the-clock development activities. Lastly, model limitations and generalizability to other PD settings are discussed. by Armen A. Mkrtchyan. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The ISO 9000 {{standards}} {{are widely used}} throughout the world, and are becoming the most important quality standards. Thousands of enterprises {{all over the world}} have already adopted these standards, with many more {{in the process of doing}} so. A range of benefits can be achieved by the implementation of ISO 9000 standards, such as increased customer satisfaction, reduced defects, improved efficiency of the quality system, and improved market share. However Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face difficulties when implementing ISO 9000 standards. This can be due to employees’ internal resistance to change, paperwork consumption, and high implementation and maintenance costs. Most SMEs are unable to cover the expenses of training and development programmes as a result of restricted financial resources. The managers of SMEs planning to implement ISO 9000 standards and maintain the certification of ISO 9001 standard for long periods should create an empowering work environment in which continuous improvement can take place. The aim of this research is to examine the relationships between the work environment and success of ISO 9000 implementation in the context of SMEs. This study begins with the completion of a comprehensive literature review focused on Enterprise Strategy, ISO 9000 Standards and Organisational Development. The literature review is followed by the research methodology, which illustrates the methods and research tools used to collect data pertinent to this research. These include exploratory survey and case studies which led to the main findings of the research. The collected data have been analysed through the use of Social Package Statistical Software (SPSS) and Microsoft’s Excel software. The findings of this research show that there are critical success factors that impact the work environment. These factors are represented in terms of temperature, noise, job security, individual recognition, salary, reward systems, quality awareness, and relationships. By integrating the literature review and the research findings, a simple work environment model has been devised. This model has been designed with consideration to the combination of factors described in the motivation theories of Maslow and Herzberg, along with health and safety legislations in the work place. This research contributes to the redefinition of the work environment in ISO 9001 standard.

40|$|Corruption is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon that {{is described by}} scholars as cancer in society. Although, corruption is comprised of a comprehensive character {{there are several ways}} to counteract its consequences, one example would be through the enhancement of auditing. It is therefore interesting to look at what effect mandatory audits have on small and medium-sized enterprises in countries where that not exists. The research questions we have chosen to focus on are what perspective Zambian auditors have on how well suitable mandatory audits and international auditing standards are for Zambian SMEs? We will also explore which the auditors’ views regarding the importance of auditing and its role in combating corruption? The purpose of this thesis is to create an understanding regarding implementing and improving the usage of mandatory audits and international auditing standards within Zambian SMEs. This also includes enlightening the problems auditors face in their process to use these regulations within Zambian SMEs as tools to assist in the fight against the obstacles that corruption creates. This study has been done through qualitative research where the main empirical findings have been conducted through interviews with auditors in Zambia. These auditors have for instance, been asked questions about what rules that exist in their country, their view on the implementation of mandatory auditing and international auditing standards on SMEs, and if they have any personal experience of corruption in their line of work. The conclusion from this research showed that auditing could aid in the fight against corruption. These conclusions are based on the perceptions and opinions of the included auditors. An implementation of mandatory audits and international auditing standards within Zambian SMEs will detect and reduce corruption. Despite potential shortfall in knowledge while implementing adjusted ISA for SMEs, the benefits of implementation exceed the shortcomings. Auditing cannot only be used to detect corruption but also to deter it. Through mandatory audits and the risk of being caught pursuing corrupt acts will increase, deterring corruption. Consequently, auditing carries a great importance to combat corruption, and mandatory audits together with implementations of international auditing standards within <b>SMEs</b> will <b>aid</b> in a significant reduction of corruption in Zambia.  Korruption är ett världsutbrett fenomen som har beskrivits av forskare som cancer i samhället.

In the automotive sector for example, a trend is the change from the purchase of individual components and products to the outsourcing and supply of complete engineered systems. In order to compete and grow their capability SMEs (Small to Medium sized Enterprises) need to find and collaborate closely with complementary partners in order to acquire new skills, technology, resources, tacit knowledge and know-how. To address these difficulties the author developed, implemented and tested a Low Cost Virtual Teaming (LC VT) Collaborative Toolset and more importantly a Collaborative Architecture or business model specially for enabling e-business within manufacturing based SMEs. Both the Toolset and the Architecture are supported by a Collaborative Process methodology, containing rules and protocols.

Additionally, feedback from the field resulted in improvements where required and kept the model up to date and relevant. A mixed methodology approach was taken to give a broader and complementary view of the issues to ensure balance within the research leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the issues. The research presents an architecture that provides an industry independent e-marketplace to facilitate the communication and collaboration between the OEM and SME supplier groups to enable the pooling of information and knowledge. The Collaborative Architecture considers the whole cycle of the work processes from identifying and finding new suppliers and winning new orders, through to collaborative product development and to providing production order information. Initial research projects, undertaken by the author, provide key research results, which helped secure secondary funding for a second phase project which was over £ 3. 6 m. The West Midlands Collaborative Commerce Marketplace (WMCCM) is an integrated e-business infrastructure project for enabling the West Midlands manufacturing SMEs (1, 800 SME members) and facilitates finding new business, finding complementary partners, and also creating and supporting collaborative activities. WMCCM brings together the outputs of the research from the AutoLean III and Autocle@r projects through an integrated collaborative business model. SMEs that can find new sources of work, form partnerships to pool their expertise to help undertake it, who have the know-how to form effective Virtual Teams and can access tools to support collaborative working, are more likely to succeed in the continuing competitive times which lie ahead.

40|$|Entrepreneurial {{capital has}} {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} important facet of entrepreneurship and new venture creation. Much of the evidence to validate such claims emerged from research that focussed upon large businesses and multinational corporations. Despite this newly acquired status {{and the rise of}} small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) {{to the top of the}} socio-economic and political agendas of policy makers in both industrially developed and developing nations, there exists a marked paucity of empirically rigorous research on entrepreneurial capital and convertibility dynamics in SMEs, with a focus on the practical measurement and management of owner-manager experience and knowledge. Fairchild (2002) notes that the practical management objectives of measuring owner-managers’ knowledge are to find out how well an SME can convert human capital like individual learning/team capabilities to structural capital like organizational knowledge or aspects like documented processes and knowledge bases and thereby moved from tacit to explicit knowledge, and reduced the risk of knowledge lost with the constant changes in such businesses. To bridge this knowledge gap, this research study investigates the dynamics of entrepreneurial capital convertibility in UK SMEs. For the purpose of this thesis, an innovative mixed-method approach was developed, to include 17 face-to-face interviews capturing both quantitative and qualitative data with owner-managers and eight case studies of SMEs located in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom. The quantitative data generated was analysed using SPSS. This was harmonized with qualitative data obtained from focussed case studies. Developing results presents a rich and in-depth insight into entrepreneurial capital convertibility in SMEs, specifically from the owner-manager’s perspective. The role and centrality of owner-managers in the process of entrepreneurial capital convertibility in SMEs was illustrated and confirmed. The results suggest that a mixed approach provides an informative and powerful method to explore entrepreneurial capital convertibility dynamics in SMEs, reflecting owner-managers’ capital in terms of knowledge management development, strategic thinking, design thinking, leadership styles and entrepreneurial types. Thus, an owner-manager’s personality is mostly shaped by their environment (ba) and past and/or shared experiences which, in turn, influences the way SMEs are disposed to entrepreneurial capital convertibility. An original model of entrepreneurial capital convertibility dynamics is outlined, that reflects perceptions of SME owner-managers’ mental ‘mind maps’. Suggestions are made to extend and validate the entrepreneurial capital convertibility model in future research in a national and international context. Through a process of testing and validating the model, knowledge audits may <b>aid</b> <b>SMEs</b> in adopting knowledge management practices leading to strategic thinking. A process of continuous reflection, experimentation and organising to withstand environmental turbulence is also recommended. Furthermore, if SME owner-managers adopt knowledge management practices and their implications in terms of flexibility and adaptation, they will be better positioned to interact, learn and co-produce with strategic stakeholders, re-design internal and external business processes and survive in a dynamic environment...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has {{abandoned}} apartheid and re-entered {{the global economy}} where factors like the lack of global competitiveness and global recession, amoung other factors, are contributing to poor performance of South African firms. This poor performance has resulted in many firms restructuring, shrinking, closing down and losing {{hundreds of thousands of}} jobs. The South African government is promoting SMEs as alternative employment source. The problem is the high rate of SMEs closure. To sustain jobs, SMEs must survive and grow. Critical to <b>aiding</b> <b>SME</b> growth is the understanding of various internal and external factors which determine success or failure. This study investigates “skills” as one of the significant internal factors. The literature reviews eight models by authors Glancey (1998), van Vuuren&Nieman (1999), Erikson (2002), Wickham (1998), Man et al (2002), Ucbasaran et al (2004), Darroch&Clover (2005) and Perks&Struwig (2005) to present the integrated model for entrepreneurial performance as “integrated ↑E/P = f(key skills) x [1 + h. (supporting skills) ] ”. The key skills are represented as multiplicative, symbolising the fact that the absence of any one key skill will lead to zero performance. Based on this model, several propositions are put forward. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the key set of competencies identified by the eight models reviewed (as presented in the detailed model) can be applied to a specific industry (the textile and clothing industry) at a specific geographic location (Johannesburg). The cross-sectional, ex post facto, formal empirical study involved interviewed 570 manufacturing SMEs (197 successful and 373 less successful SMEs). The study ascertained which skills the SME owner/managers perceived as important for success; how they rated their competencies in the said skills; and whether they had been trained in those skills. The instrument used was a structured questionnaire. The statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, frequencies, factor analysis, Cronbach alpha coefficient, Chi-square; t-test and one-way ANOVA tests. The analysis was concluded with a Scheffe’s multiple comparison procedure. The main findings of the study are: 1. Key skills that enhance SME success include the ability to gather resources, marketing, motivation, legal, financial and operational management skills. 2. Successful SMEs considered key skills to be more important and rated themselves more competent in most of the key skills than did less successful SMEs. 3. Successful SMEs had been trained in more skills categories than less successful SMEs, with most of the successful SMEs having received training in all the key skills identified. This study recommends that the training of SMEs should focus on developing those skills identified as key internal factors influencing SME success by following the training model “Training for ↑E/P = training in key skills x [1 + training in supporting skills] ”. The study concludes by listing limitations and suggesting further research. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Business Managementunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Otaru University of Commerce (小樽商科大学) 商学mastercourseIt {{is noted}} that inquiry on {{importance}} of specific advantages in determining {{not only how}} MNEs engage in FDI, but also in explaining why MNEs establish production in specific locations have been studied extensively. However, inquiry into what determines the FDI by SMEs, which face shortage in the management and financial resources, has not received much attention despite the increasing overseas production operations by SMEs. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the Japanese auto industry suppliers system in order to dentify the reason for SMEs to engage in overseas production operation. On the surface, the activities of SMEs and those of MNEs seem highly divergent. Until recently, they have operated in largely separate realms, each in its own competitive space with markedly different characteristics; SMEs largely considered to be operating on the domestic market place. However, globalization has dismantled the barriers that traditionally segmented local business opportunities and firms from international counterparts. Evidence indicate that SMEs which were considered passive victim of globalization, {{in the last few}} decades have become active players by setting up activities beyond their home market and their role is increasingly crucial in contributing to the growth of the industry. This is particularly observed in the Japanese automobile industry, where a large share of SMEs parent companies have their subsidiaries involved in the value chain of overseas subsidiaries of major Japanese automobile manufacturers. Although {{it is well known that}} the fundamental objective of firms is growth and development, the fact that SMEs increasingly engage in FDI brings crucial questions. The questions come because it has been studied that, as firms internationalize their operations they face a number of challenges such as liability of foreignness or disadvantages faced by firms to compete with local firms in their markets (Hymer, 1976). Other problems faced by firms when investing outside home country include geographical distance, which increases both the costs of communication and travel and the complexities of managing geographically dispersed assets. In addition, firms face the problem of psychic distance, because they must compete with local firms that have greater knowledge of the local culture and language, as well as of local legal, regulatory and marketing practices. These challenges bring up the concern about what offer SMEs the prospects to compete on a par with other global manufacturers. Considering that SMEs face the shortage of both management and financial resources to run overseas subsidiaries as compared to large-scale MNEs, this argument implies that, firm-specific advantages alone are much less in explaining the FDI by SMEs but need to consider the environments surrounding business relations among firms. To examine the FDI behavior by SMEs this paper develops an approach to explain the FDI by <b>SMEs</b> with the <b>aid</b> of the investment in the inter-firms relations. The model of this paper builds its logic upon the basic insights developed in network approach to industrial system and firm’s internationalization (Johanson and Mattsson, 1987, 1988) to identify the determinants for SMEs to engage in FDI. And in contrast to the most existing frameworks on FDI, the benchmark of this study is based on the assumption that there exists a coordination of activities between firms that can not achieved through a central plan or on organizational hierarchy, nor does it take place through the traditional market model (price mechanism). This coordination is achieved through continuous cooperative transactions and mutual orientation to each other (Richardson G., 1972; Asanuma B., 1987; and Itoh, M. et al., 1993). In this light, firms in the industrial systems are considered as embedded actors in the business relationships. By examining the distinctive features of the Japanese suppliers system(customer-supplier relationship) in automobile industry, it is evident there is a symbiotic relationship between major automobile manufacturers and suppliers of auto parts (about 96 % of which are SMEs) that explains the determinants of FDI by SMEs suppliers. The symbiotic relationship between firms makes it difficult to change the existing relation specific investment to orient to another customer. This can be described as due to the switching, monitoring and competitive cost as result of cumulative nature of activities to develop the relationship. And because the symbiotic relationships involve adaptations in a number of dimensions such as technically, logistically, administratively, knowledge development or specific capital investment there are costs involved in shifting the production lines to fit a new customer (SMEs lack enough resources for this transition). In light of the interpretation of the engagement of Japanese SMEs in the FDI it is indicated that since Japanese companies are mutually related to each other through keiretsu or subcontracting system, SMEs are feeling pressure to implement overseas production to meet the requirements of principal customers in order to ensure the continuation of their relationship with major customer, while looking for possibilities to diversify customers in the host country to become independent. This argument shows that since SMEs in auto parts industry depend more on the relationship with principal customers, any adjustment in the industrial or network landscape such as major customer’s increasing overseas production or increasing competition due to global procurement of cheap products by major supplier will force SME suppliers to implement overseas production operations. This means, as long as FDI can assure the continuation of business relationship with their major customer especially in Japan SMEs will be ready to engage in overseas production. This shows that the decision to invest abroad by SMEs is not necessarily the result of short-term economic profitability, but rather the reaction to other factors such as fear to lose major customer and maintaining the long time firm’s network relationship...|$|R
