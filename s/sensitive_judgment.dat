40|$|In this artiche it {{is argued}} that human rights require justification. It regards their universality, their high priority, their legal character. Human rights deal with {{normative}} considerations involving a guarantee of a status, a prohibition to discriminate persons and/or to humiliate them. They are a type of social practice requiring implemetation and concretization. There are interests, needs common to every human being, goods (including the conditions of agency) the frustation of which is antithetical to the decent life of human beings. Human rights are indeterminate. Therefore they range from abstract to specific. It is only in all their application that human rights become concrete. Application involves interpretation. From this point of view the role of adjudication is fundamental. It connects the universality of human rights provisions and the particularity of individual cases. Adjudication implies a contextually embedded and situationally <b>sensitive</b> <b>judgment</b> of particulars...|$|E

This paper {{presents a}}n attempt to apply the same model {{to the case of}} judgment on an objective scale. This is a big challenge since the behavioral data are showing the opposite type of effects. Thus we have repeatedly obtained contrast effects of irrelevant information, when judging on a subjective scale. In the experiment described here we obtained an assimilation effect in exactly the same conditions except that the scale was objective. Without any changes of the model we run the corresponding simulations and there are a good and bad news. The bad news is that we did not obtain the assimilation effect, {{but the good news is}} that the contrast effect disappeared. The paper discusses possible reasons for these results and possible ways to improve the model...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} how people with sickle cell disease pain are {{perceived}} by hospital staffJudgments about people with pain are influenced by contextual factors {{that can lead to}} stigmatization of patients who present in certain ways. Misplaced staff perceptions of addiction may contribute to this, because certain pain behaviors superficially resemble symptoms of analgesic addiction. We used a vignette study to examine hospital staff judgments about patients with genuine symptoms of analgesic addiction and those with pain behaviors that merely resemble those symptoms. Nurses and doctors at hospitals in London, UK, judged the level of pain, the likelihood of addiction, and the analgesic needs of fictitious sickle cell disease patients. The patient descriptions included systematic variations to test the effects of genuine addiction, pain behaviors resembling addiction, and disputes with staff, which all significantly increased estimates of addiction likelihood and significantly decreased estimates of analgesic needs. Participants differentiated genuine addiction from pain behaviors resembling addiction when making judgments about addiction likelihood but not when making judgments about analgesic needs. The treatment by staff of certain pain behaviors as symptoms of analgesic addiction is therefore a likely contributory cause of inadequate or problematic hospital pain management. The findings also show what a complex task it is for hospital staff to make <b>sensitive</b> <b>judgments</b> that incorporate multiple aspects of patients and their pain. There are implications for staff training, patient education, and further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to test for the use of the {{representativeness}} heuristic by auditors in situations in which its use will lead to judgments that systematically depart from the Bayesian optimal responses. No explicit representation of payoffs was made, nor were subjects typically asked to choose a course of action. Thus it cannot be concluded that use of the representativeness heuristic in the experimental situations tested is not cost effective. To the extent, however, that one is willing to assume that action choices are <b>sensitive</b> to <b>judgments</b> of outcome probabilities, and these action choices have differential expected payoffs, a finding of extensive heuristic use by auditors would suggest further research to assess the economic consequences of such use. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the gravest}} {{constraints}} which South Africa faces {{in its efforts}} to promote development and to lift much of its population out of poverty is the relative scarcity of its water. Significant changes were made to South Africa's water law in the 1990 s, especially with the promulgation of the National Water Act 36 of 1998. In terms of this Act a Water Tribunal was created which ought to have enhanced water security and to have provided a settled forum to adjudicate disputes and to assist in developing the jurisprudence of water law. Instead the Tribunal appears to have created almost as much confusion as clarity before it was dissolved in much uncertainty over whether it would continue in existence or not. A recent judgment in the Gauteng High Court (Trustees of the Time Being of the Lucas Scheepers Trust, IT 633 / 96 v MEC for the Department of Water Affairs, Gauteng) has created uncertainty by departing from the precedent of a relatively recent judgment in the North Gauteng High Court (Escarpment Environment Protection Group and Wonderfontein Community Association v Department of Water Affairs and Xstrata Alloys (Pty) Ltd and The Water Tribunal). In the context of the uncertainty created by the falling into desuetude, at least between 2011 and 2016, of the Water Tribunal, and contradictory indications from National Government, litigants have been forced to seek other fora for remedies. On occasion, courts have been sympathetic and given <b>sensitive</b> <b>judgments</b> – on occasion they have not. Against this background of inconsistent jurisprudence, it is important that there be greater clarity of rights, duties and institutions, and that institutions become settled as soon as possible so that a consistent jurisprudence can begin to emerge in the water rights field. While the situation stabilises, which it is hoped that it will soon begin to do, it is suggested that both courts and government act with circumspection in considering applications concerning water use rights; and be sensitive of the current uncertain circumstances when making decisions.

It incorporates both an international perspective and a particular focus on Australia. The paper reviews the epidemiological knowledge base, noting its complexity {{and the ways in}} which risk factors may vary with the population or subpopulation being studied. While much of the recent focus on suicide has been shaped by the increase in youth suicide, suicide remains a significant problem across all adult age groups. Hence, this paper discusses suicide across the life span, but also identifies youth suicide and Indigenous suicide as two areas of particular concern. In relation to Indigenous suicide, it is important to move from a national focus to examine regional suicide patterns and conditions of risk within particular communities. The paper considers core principles of clinical assessment and intervention, acknowledging the powerful emotions and <b>sensitive,</b> complex <b>judgments</b> involved in this work.

40|$|Rule-based {{forecasting}} (RBF) is {{an expert}} system that uses features of time series to select and weight extrapolation techniques. Thus, it is dependent upon the identification of features of the time series. Judgmental coding of these features is expensive and {{the reliability of the}} ratings is modest. We developed and automated heuristics to detect six features that had previously been judgmentally identified in RBF: outliers, level shifts, change in basic trend, unstable recent trend, unusual last observation, and functional form. These heuristics rely on simple statistics such as first differences and regression estimates. In general, there was agreement between automated and judgmental codings for all features other than functional form. Heuristic coding was more <b>sensitive</b> than <b>judgment</b> and consequently, identified more series with a certain feature than judgmental coding. We compared forecast accuracy using automated codings with that using judgmental codings across 122 series. Forecasts were produced for six horizons, resulting in a total of 732 forecasts. Accuracy for 30 % of the 122 annual time series was similar to that reported for RBF. For the remaining series, there were as many that did better with automated feature detection as there were that did worse. In other words, the use of automated feature detection heuristics reduced the costs of using RBF without negativel...|$|R

Those located in the touristic heritage zones within Kuala Lumpur were being converted by their owners into hotels and cafés to meet current demands to sustain their incomes.

40|$|Mind {{perception}} entails ascribing {{mental capacities}} to other entities, whereas moral judgment entails labeling entities {{as good or}} bad or actions as right or wrong. We suggest that mind perception {{is the essence of}} moral judgment. In particular, we suggest that moral judgment is rooted in a cognitive template of two perceived minds—a moral dyad of an intentional agent and a suffering moral patient. Diverse lines of research support dyadic morality. First, perceptions of mind are linked to moral judgments: dimensions of mind perception (agency and experience) map onto moral types (agents and patients), and deficits of mind perception correspond to difficulties with moral judgment. Second, not only are moral <b>judgments</b> <b>sensitive</b> to perceived agency and experience, but all moral transgressions are fundamentally understood as agency plus experienced suffering—that is, interpersonal harm—even ostensibly harmless acts such as purity violations. Third, dyadic morality uniquely accounts for the phenomena of dyadic completion (seeing agents in response to patients, and vice versa), and moral typecasting (characterizing others as either moral agents or moral patients).

40|$|Purpose: To date, the {{literature}} on perception of affective, pragmatic, and grammatical prosody abilities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been sparse and contradictory. It {{is interesting to note}} that the primary perception of syllable stress within the word structure, which is crucial for all prosody functions, remains relatively unexplored in ASD. Thus, in the current study, we explored syllable stress perception sensitivity and its relationship to speech production abnormalities and communicative ability in adults with ASD. Method: A same–different syllable stress perception task using pairs of identical 4 -syllable words was delivered to 42 adults with/without high-functioning ASD, matched for age, to investigate primary speech perception ability in ASD. Speech production and communicative ability in ASD was measured using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2000). Results: As predicted, the results showed that adults with ASD were less <b>sensitive</b> in making <b>judgments</b> about syllable stress relative to controls. Also, partial correlations revealed a key association of speech production abnormalities with stress perception sensitivity, rather than communicative ability. Conclusions: Our findings provide empirical evidence for deficits on primary syllable stress perception in ASD and its role on sociocommunicative difficulties. This information could facilitate the development of effective interventions for speech and language therapy and social communication...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Findings from neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) differentiates between self and mother in {{participants}} from Western cultures, but not in Chinese participants. However, previous research suggests that self-motivated immigrants possess more independent self-construal styles. Thus, it is possible that their independent self-construals might be reflected at the neural level. In the present study, we examined the contribution of the MPFC to self and close other-referential processing of psychological traits in Chinese participants, newly arrived to the United States, in both their native language and in English. We predicted that, contrary to prior findings, the MPFC would differentially represent psychological traits for self and mother. Moreover, this effect would be greatest when performing judgments in English. During fMRI scanning, participants (N = 18) completed a standard self-referential processing task in which they rated whether a series of psychological trait adjectives applied to themselves or to their mothers. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the MPFC strongly differ-entiated between self and mother judgments in both languages. However, we found no effect of language in this task. Finally, the posterior cingulate cortex was uniquely <b>sensitive</b> to self-referential <b>judgments</b> in Chinese. These findings indicate that the MPFC differentiates between self and mother among self-motivated immigrants...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{heavy-duty vehicle}} emission regulations are prompting {{the use of}} PM and NOx aftertreatment systems in the US, the EU and Japan. In the US, the EPA Highway Diesel Rule, which will be fully implemented in 2010, has stimulated debate over whether urea selective catalytic reduction (urea-SCR) or lean NOx traps (LNT) are the better NOx aftertreatment approach for meeting this new standard. And, if urea-SCR is indeed the preferred option, how can its compliance and infrastructure challenges be overcome during the relatively short window of time between now and 2010. This thesis begins by performing a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of urea-SCR and LNT aftertreatment to determine which technology is more appropriate for use in heavy-duty vehicles and how <b>sensitive</b> that <b>judgment</b> is to changes in key variables, such {{as the price of}} urea. The focus then shifts to an exploration of the various compliance and infrastructure challenges associated with urea-SCR, namely the need to have a replenishable supply of urea. In particular, the actions and policies necessary to surmount those obstacles are discussed. Next, the policies and market factors that {{played a role in the}} EU's successful introduction of urea-SCR are examined and assessed for their ability to be applied in the US context. Finally, the long-term viability of urea-SCR is appraised through an investigation of the potential for competing emission control technologies to emerge and the prospect that urea-SCR becomes adopted by the light-duty diesel market. This thesis concludes by offering both a prognosis for what can be expected to occur between now and 2010, given the current course of action, as well as policy recommendations for how that trajectory might be corrected, such that the introduction of urea-SCR in 2010 is achieved with the maximum air quality benefit at the lowest cost. by Kristian M.

40|$|The {{present study}} has a {{threefold}} aim: First, the theoretical {{aim is to}} give a contribution to refinement {{of the theory of}} dialogue based feminist ethics, concerning the understanding of judgment and narration within such an ethics.   The study also has an empirical aim, defined as to clarify what kind of knowledge, relevant to the moral judgment of an engaged outsider actor, can be received from dialogical interpretation and analysis of a limited selection of critically reflecting life stories. Third, a methodological aim is defined as to develop an approach to interpretation and analysis of reflecting life stories, which renders the storyteller visible as a reflecting moral subject, and makes the story accessible as a source of knowledge for the moral judgment of an engaged outsider actor. The thesis combines philosophical reflection and argumentation, with a narrative-hermeneutic method for interpretation of life stories, relating the two to each other in a hermeneutic process.  The theoretical reflection draws on Seyla Benhabibs theory of communicative ethics. A dialogue based model for moral justification and a likewise dialogue based model for political legitimacy {{are at the heart of}} this universalistic theory, although in combination with a conception of a narratively and hermeneutically constituted context <b>sensitive</b> moral <b>judgment,</b> based on Hannah Arendt’s concept “enlarged thought”. In the reflection, this model is related to other feminist theorizing within the tradition of dialogue based feminist ethics, as found in the works of Iris M. Young, Georgia Warnke and Shari Stone-Mediatore. The empirical study draws on three critically reflecting life stories from Israeli-Palestinian women activists for a just peace. The methodology for interpretation and analysis that is worked out combines dialogical interpretation as presented in Arthur W. Frank’s socio-narratology with a method for structural analysis derived from Shari Stone-Mediatores theory of storytelling as an expression of political resistance struggle. The results show that some stories drawing on marginalized experiences have a potential­ to stimulate further public debate through their capacity to enable a stereoscopic seeing, elucidating a tension between ideologically structured discourse and non-linguistic experience; implying that narrative-hermeneutic competence should be considered crucial for public debate. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{specifically}} {{the influence of}} estimated perioperative mortality and stroke rate on the assessment of appropriateness of carotid endarterectomy. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: An expert panel convened to rate the appropriateness {{of a variety of}} potential indications for carotid endarterectomy based on various rates of perioperative complications. We then applied these ratings to the charts of 1, 160 randomly selected patients who had carotid endarterectomy in one of the 12 participating academic medical centers. STUDY DESIGN: An expert panel evaluated indications for carotid endarterectomy using the modified Delphi approach. Charts of patients who received surgery were abstracted, and clinical indications for the procedure as well as perioperative complications were recorded. To examine the impact of surgical risk assessment on the rates of appropriateness, three different definitions of risk strata for combined perioperative death or stroke were used: Definition A, low risk < 3 percent; Definition B, low risk < 5 percent; and Definition C, low risk < 7 percent. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overall hospital-specific mortality ranged from 0 percent to 4. 0 percent and major complications, defined as death, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or myocardial infarction, varied from 2. 0 percent to 11. 1 percent. Most patients (72 percent) had surgery for transient ischemic attack or stroke; 24 percent of patients were asymptomatic. Most patients (82 percent) had surgery {{on the side of a}} high-grade stenosis (70 - 99 percent). When the thresholds for operative risk were placed at the values defined by the expert panel (Definition A), only 33. 5 percent of 1, 160 procedures were classified as "appropriate. " When the definition of low risk was shifted upward, the proportion of cases categorized as appropriate increased to 58 percent and 81. 5 percent for Definitions B and C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high proportion of procedures performed for symptomatic patients with a high degree of ipsilateral extracranial carotid artery stenosis and generally low rates of surgical complications at the participating institutions, the overall rate of "appropriateness" using a perioperative complication rate of < 3 percent was low. However, the rate of "appropriateness" was extremely <b>sensitive</b> to <b>judgments</b> about a single clinical feature, surgical risk. These data show that before applying such "appropriateness" ratings, it is crucial to perform sensitivity analyses in order to assess the stability of the results.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{investigation}} on the efficacy of pulverised sugar dusting on knocking-down Varroa destructor mites {{and the influence of}} the dynamics of the treatment on the degree of infestation in honey bee colonies. Two methods were deployed to measure the degree of infestation of bee colonies with V. destructor mites: the sugar shake method and the technique which involves mesh bottom boards equipped with sticky inserts. The research was carried out on 30 strong honey bee colonies in three successive years. The results proved that dusting with pulverised sugar (particle diameter below 40 μm) influenced the fall of V. destructor in comparison with both their fall off prior to the treatment and the negative control. The most discernible effects on the mite fall and the decline in their population in the hives was obtained with dustings repeated at threeday intervals. To conclude, the dynamics of the treatment affected the degree of infestation in bee colonies. However, the efficacy of sugar dusting was significantly lower in comparison with the one of flumethrin (positive control). Thus, in spite of considerable favourable effects on the decline in the degree of infestation with mites, by no means may dusting with pulverised sugar be advised to beekeepers as the one and only means of bee protection against V. destructor. The use of the technique which involves mesh bottom boards equipped with sticky inserts proved more efficacious and <b>sensitive</b> in the <b>judgment</b> of the degree of infestation of bee colonies in comparison with the sugar shake method, which includes dusting 300 bees with 40 g of pulverised sugar (particle diameter below 40 μm) ...|$|R

The pervasiveness of morally negative views toward the overweight and obese, such as laziness and lack of self-control, are undeniable in mainstream U. S. society, situated both institutionally (such as health care barriers or media stereotypes) and interpersonally (such as the negative comments of others). To test basic pathways related to the etiology of women's vulnerability to feeling "fat-stigma" in interpersonal relationships, we present a study conducted between August and November 2009 that combines social network, anthropometric, body image, and interview data for 112 women aged 18 - 45 years, living in Phoenix, Arizona, U. S., and linked follow-up interviews with 823 of their social ties. Based on the proposition that some social network characteristics should amplify the personal experience of stigma, and others should ameliorate it, we ask: what relationship qualities make women more <b>sensitive</b> to the <b>judgments</b> of others about their weight? We find that what others say about women has only a very limited influence on how women judge others' negative views of their weight once actual body size is taken into account, but {{that women are more}} influenced by the opinions of those they are closer to and interact with more often. Ultimately, the degree to which women perceive themselves to be judged by others regarding their weight is not well explained by the actual opinions of people in their networks, either known or unknown to them.

Total propaganda recognizes that within a nation individuals should all have in common a standard of living, a culture, and an ideology.The need of an average standard of living is that people must be able to afford to buy a radio, TV, a newspaper, or go to the movies. It is mostly concerned with the densest mass which is made up of average men and not the very rich or very poor. Poor cannot do this therefore they cannot be subjected to integration propaganda because the immediate concerns of daily life absorb all their capacities and efforts. The poor can only be subjected to agitation propaganda, excited to the point of theft and murder. But they cannot be trained by propaganda, kept in hand, channeled, and oriented. More advanced propaganda can influence only a man who is not completely haunted by poverty, a man who can view things from a certain distance and be reasonably unconcerned about his daily bread, who therefore can take an interest in more general matters. [...] "For propaganda to be effective the propagandee must have a certain store of ideas and a number of conditioned reflexes that can only be acquired through peace of mind springing from relative security. The establishment of a mode of common life- all this leads {{to the creation of a}} type of normal man conveniently leads all men toward that norm via a multitude of paths. Propaganda's intent is to integrate people into the normal pattern prevailing in society bring about conformance to way of life. To sum up: The creation of normalcy in our society can take one of two shapes. It can be the result of scientific, psycho-sociological analysis based on statistics- that is the American type of normalcy. It can be ideological and doctrinaire- that is the Communist type. But the results are identical: such normalcy necessarily gives rise to propaganda that can reduce the individual to the pattern most useful to society." [...] "Information" [...] Is an essential element of propaganda, which must [...] "have reference to political or economic reality" [...] to be credible. In fact, no propaganda can work until the moment when a set of facts has become a problem in the eyes of those who constitute public opinion." [...] Education permits the dissemination of propaganda in that it enables people to consume information. Information is indistinguishable from propaganda in that information is an essential element of propaganda because for propaganda to succeed it must have reference to political or economic reality. Propaganda grafts itself onto an already existing reality through [...] "informed opinion". Where no informed opinion with regard to political or economic affairs propaganda cannot exist making it an indispensable aspect. Propaganda means nothing without preliminary information that provides the basis for propaganda, gives propaganda the means to operate, and generates the problems that propaganda exploits by pretending to offer solutions. It is through information that the individual is placed in a social context and learns to understand the reality of his own situation. Information allows us to evaluate our situation feel our own personal problems are a general social problem thus enabling propaganda to entice us into social and political action. Information is most effective when it is objective and broad because it creates a general picture. With information quantity is better than quality, the more political or economic facts believed to be mastered by an individual, the more <b>sensitive</b> their <b>judgment</b> is to propaganda. In fact, only in and through propaganda do the masses have access to political economy, politics, art, or literature. The more stereotypes in a culture, the easier it is to form public opinion, and the more an individual participates in that culture, the more susceptible he becomes to the manipulation of these symbols.|$|R
