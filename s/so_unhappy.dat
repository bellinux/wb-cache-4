5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine. The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers. They were <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the Quebec circus's inexperience that they had, at one point, sent a letter to the media complaining about how they were being treated.|$|E

"Property of a Lady", {{which was}} written in early 1963, was {{commissioned}} by Sotheby's for use in their annual journal, The Ivory Hammer, and was published in November 1963 and later in Playboy; Sotheby's chairman Peter Wilson is mentioned by name in the story. Fleming was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the final piece he wrote to Wilson and refused payment for something he considered so lacklustre.|$|E
500|$|In letters {{revealed}} in 2015, Einstein {{wrote to his}} early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still-strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that [...] "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> as only a man can be" [...] while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a [...] "misguided love" [...] and a [...] "missed life" [...] regarding his love for Marie.|$|E
500|$|At age 17 in 1902, Roosevelt {{completed}} her formal education {{and returned to}} the United States; she was presented at a debutante ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel on December 14. She was later given her own [...] "coming out party". She said of her debut in a public discussion once (as later recounted in her New York Times obituary), [...] "It was simply awful. It was a beautiful party, of course, but I was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy,</b> because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not know all the young people. Of course I had been so long abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls I used to know in New York. I was miserable through all that." ...|$|E

500|$|Arnold was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{with the}} conduct of the Gortonites that he wrote to Massachusetts protesting Roger William's {{proposed}} errand to England to seek a charter for the colony. [...] In this letter, he spoke in very uncomplimentary terms of the Warwick settlers: [...] "under the pretense of liberty of conscience about these parts there came to live all the scum and runaways of the country, which in time for want of better order may bring a heavy burden on the land." [...] These sentiments dissipated over time. [...] Gorton's objectionable activities ceased following an appeal to the Massachusetts government, and he accepted Arnold's ownership of disputed land. [...] The Pawtuxet settlers expressed the desire to reunite with Providence, finally able to coexist with Gorton, and it was done in 1658.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the fall}} of the town which Pope Pius II lamentably termed [...] "the gateway to Rascia", Stephen fled to Bosnia with his family and in-laws, seeking refuge at the court of his father. The King of Hungary accused Stephen and his family of selling Smederevo Fortress to the Ottomans [...] "for a great weight of gold", and the Pope at first {{believed}} him. Pius's own investigation appears to {{have come to the conclusion}} that Stephen did not sell the fortress, as the Pope did not repeat the claim. Ottoman, Bosnian and Serbian sources say nothing about the supposed betrayal, so the allegation is unlikely to be based on fact. The Serbian-born janissary Konstantin Mihailović and the Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles maintained Stephen's innocence and pointed out to the strength of the Ottoman army. Both state that the Serbs within Smederevo were <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Bosnian rule and convinced that the Ottomans would prevail (and grant them more religious tolerance than the Hungarians) that they went out to meet Mehmed and presented him with keys to the city.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 2008, the five-term Republican Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter made clear {{his plans to}} seek re-election. Specter had {{narrowly}} avoided a primary defeat against conservative challenger Pat Toomey during his 2004 Senate race, and {{he was expected to}} face an even greater challenge from Toomey in 2010, particularly since the conservative faction of the Pennsylvania Republican Party had vowed to defeat Specter in the upcoming primary. Some high-profile Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden and Governor Rendell, began encouraging Specter to join the Democratic Party by publicly offering to help Specter raise money if he switched. A March 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll found Specter trailing Toomey 41 percent to 27 percent among Republican primary voters, in large part due to voter angst over Specter's support for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was supported by President Obama. Since the Pennsylvania primaries are closed, the poll noted that Specter could not be assisted by support from moderates or Democrats. Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said of the poll results, [...] "Pennsylvania Republicans are <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Sen. Specter’s vote for President Barack Obama's Stimulus Package and so-called pork barrel spending that they are voting for a former Congressman they hardly know." ...|$|E

[...] He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{testimony}} to Nott’s feelings towards Ludlow's philosophy and writing talent that he asked the young man to write a song for the commencement ceremony of the Class of 1856. College legend holds that Ludlow was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the late night lyrics he composed {{to the tune of}} the drinking song Sparkling and Bright [...] he threw away the manuscript. Fortuitously, his roommate discovered it and brought the work to Rev. Nott’s attention. Song to Old Union became the school's alma mater, and is sung at commencement to this day.|$|E

Keating himself was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the book that it brought the two men's friendship to an abrupt end.

2500|$|After the {{establishment}} of the WRAF in 1918 she was suggested as a potential Commandant due to her experience in reform and management. She agreed to spend a month [...] "looking round" [...] the camp, and was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> that she repeatedly tried to resign. Following her dismissal on 28 August 1918 by Lord Weir she wrote to several important political figures such as Winston Churchill asking for a judicial inquiry into her dismissal, claiming that it was part of an attempt by other senior WRAF officers to [...] "cover up rife immorality" [...] at WRAF bases. Lord Stanhope proposed establishing the Select Committee of the House of Lords on the Women's Royal Air Force to investigate any immorality. [...] His proposal passed, and the Committee began its work on 14 October 1918.|$|E
2500|$|By mid October, Marshal André Masséna, a {{seasoned}} French general, {{who had fought}} the Austrians in Lombardia before during the campaign of 1796–1797, was waiting for developments on the main theatre of operations in Bavaria. On 18 October, Masséna won a bridgehead on the east bank of the Adige River in the Battle of Verona. At dawn, the French launched their attack from Verona against Josef Philipp Vukassovich's division. After heavy fighting, the divisions of Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne cleared the town of San Giorgio {{and part of the}} heights of Veronetta. The French lost 77 dead and 246 wounded, while the Austrians suffered 246 killed and 906 wounded. Archduke Charles was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Vukassovich's performance that he replaced him with Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg.|$|E
2500|$|Hou Junji was resentful that, {{despite his}} great achievement, {{he was put}} under arrest, albeit briefly. [...] In the spring of 643, when fellow general Zhang Liang was sent out of the capital {{to serve as the}} commandant at Luo Prefecture (洛州, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan), Hou tried to provoke Zhang by asking him, [...] "Who {{squeezed}} you out?" [...] Zhang, in jest, responded, [...] "Other than you, who can squeeze me out?" [...] Hou responded, [...] "I conquered a kingdom, but I ran into someone throwing a temper tantrum big enough to overturn a house. [...] What strength do I have to squeeze you out?" [...] He then rolled up his sleeves and yelled, [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> that I would rather die. [...] Do you want to commit treason? [...] I will commit treason with you!" [...] Zhang secretly reported this exchange to Emperor Taizong, but Emperor Taizong pointed out that this was a private conversation with no corroboration, and took no action on it.|$|E

2500|$|After losing {{two of the}} {{original}} band members, Flea and Kiedis started looking for musicians to fill those spots. Shortly after Irons' departure they chose as Slovak's replacement DeWayne [...] "Blackbyrd" [...] McKnight, former member of Parliament-Funkadelic and who at one point briefly filled in for Slovak, when he was temporarily fired. D. H. Peligro of the punk rock outfit Dead Kennedys replaced Irons. Kiedis and Flea had been friends of Peligro {{for many years and}} even had a joke band together called Three Little Butt Hairs. With a new lineup set, Kiedis decided to enter rehab to fix his drug problem. Kiedis entered a rehab facility in Van Nuys called ASAP. After two weeks into Kiedis' rehab he was taken by his counselor, Bob Timmons, to finally visit Slovak's grave. Kiedis had no desire to be there; however, Timmons urged him to talk to Slovak. Within minutes, Kiedis had opened up and could not stop crying. Thirty days later, Kiedis left rehab and was ready to resume his career with the band. Three dates into the tour, McKnight was fired, because the chemistry was not there with the other three. McKnight was with the band long enough to record one song, [...] "Blues For Meister" [...] (drums were performed by Jack Irons – bass and drums were recorded before Hillel's death), a song sung by Flea. McKnight was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> about being fired he threatened to burn down Kiedis' house.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{months later}} Poirot goes {{to visit the}} convent Casey's {{daughter}} entered, in a remote part of the western coast of Ireland. He discovers that she had died two months earlier. Poirot makes the acquaintance {{of one of the}} locals who helps him break into the convent – where he recovers the goblet. He returns it to Power and tells him that the nuns were using it as a chalice. Casey's daughter probably took it there to atone for her father's sins and the nuns were ignorant of its ownership and ancient history. Poirot deduced it would be at the convent as there had been no trace of anyone having the goblet after it was stolen. Therefore, it was somewhere where [...] "ordinary material values did not apply". The mention of Casey's daughter being a nun supplied the obvious place. Poirot shows Power how, during the Renaissance, the Pope used a hidden mechanism in the goblet to put the poison in the victim's drink. Poirot suggests no good will come out of owning an object with such an evil history. If it is given back to the convent, the nuns will say masses for Power's soul. He reminds Power of his boyhood in western Ireland. Power agrees; he has got what he wants, which was to own the goblet. Poirot returns the goblet to the convent as the gift of a man <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> he does not know he is unhappy.|$|E
2500|$|Bu Zhi and Wei Jing {{settled in}} Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡), where they {{encountered}} an influential landlord, Jiao Zhengqiang (焦征羌), who allowed his retainers to behave lawlessly. As Bu Zhi and Wei Jing feared that Jiao Zhengqiang would seize {{the plot of}} land on which they farmed, they decided to offer him some of their produce as tribute. When they arrived at his residence, he was asleep {{so they had to}} wait outside. After some time, Wei Jing became impatient and wanted to leave, but Bu Zhi stopped him and said, [...] "We came here because we feared he would seize our land. If we come here to visit him and then leave without even meeting him, he might think that we're insulting him and we'll only end up antagonising him." [...] After a while, Jiao Zhengqiang woke up, saw them through the window, and instructed his servants to lay mats on the ground for them to sit outside while he remained indoors. Wei Jing was enraged but Bu Zhi remained calm and composed. When it was time for lunch, Jiao Zhengqiang feasted on tasty dishes and did not invite them to join him. Instead, he had scraps of food served to them in small bowls. Wei Jing, who received only vegetables and mushrooms, was <b>so</b> <b>unhappy</b> that he did not eat at all. In contrast, Bu Zhi finished all the food he got. They then bid farewell to Jiao Zhengqiang and left. Wei Jing later scolded Bu Zhi, [...] "How can you put up with this?" [...] Bu Zhi replied, [...] "We're of lowly status. He treated us in a manner befitting our status. What's there to be ashamed of?" ...|$|E
