30|$|In {{the wear}} experiment, the wear of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> {{leads to the}} down-moving of the T-type plate along the Z axis, and the {{downward}} displacement is the wear depth of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing.</b> Meanwhile, the slender pole moves down with the T-type plate along the Z axis, the displacement sensor, fixed on the slender pole, declines along the Z axis and gradually distances the contacting clamp of the displacement sensor (there is a pre-compressing quantity between the displacement sensor and the contacting clamp of the displacement sensor), {{and at the moment}} the displacement sensor detects the wear depth of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  1 and Figure  2, the bearing fixture {{assembled}} the self-lubricating <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is placed on}} the base of the test bench, so that the top of the slender pole tightly touches the bottom of the T-type plate under the spring force. Then the displacement sensor is adjusted and fixed, so that there is a pre-pressing quantity between the displacement sensor and the contacting clamp of the displacement sensor. Without the start-up of the transmission module, there was no relative movement between the inner and outer races of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing.</b> And when opening embedded hydraulic station, there was no applied load to the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{major failure}} {{mechanism}} of typical <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> with self-lubrication is the wear of the woven fabric liner, {{which is an}} orthotropic composite of different elastic properties in different directions. The elastic properties of the liner are required for studying the tribological properties of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper aims to develop an elastic property analysis model suitable for three commonly used fabric liners through a theoretical analysis of the elastic properties {{in order to obtain}} the parameter expression of the compliance matrix. The influence of the elastic properties on the wear depth of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> is further investigated.

30|$|The {{self-lubricating}} <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are special}} journal bearings which inlay or bond the self-lubricating solid materials between {{the inner and}} outer races. These bearings have some special characteristics, such as maintenance-free, compact structure, and low coefficient of friction. Therefore, the self-lubricating <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> are widely applied to aviation and aerospace fields [1].|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{based on}} the {{classical}} Archard adhesion wear theory, a three-dimensional finite element model was established, {{with the aim of}} simulating the failure process of self-lubricating <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> in the swinging wear condition. The results show that the self-lubricating <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> go through two different stages during the wear process, namely, initial wear stage and stable wear stage. Because the large contact points wear out during the initial wear stage, the maximum contact pressure decreases as the test period increases. The relatively larger wear depth region shows elliptical distribution, and the maximum distribution appears in the central contact area. The wear depth reaches 0.974 mm after swinging 25, 000 times. PTFE fibers, which possess a good friction performance but poor abrasion resistance, abundantly exist on the friction surfaces of the fabric liner. Consequently, the friction torque during the initial wear stage is slightly smaller than the friction torque during the stable wear stage; however, the wear rate during the initial wear stage is high. The reliability and effectiveness of the finite element model are verified by experiment. The developed finite element model can be used for the analysis of the wear mechanisms of bearings and the prediction of the service life of bearings.|$|R

30|$|The <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> {{test bench}} is a {{necessary}} detecting equipment in the research process of self-lubricating spherical plain bearings. The varying environmental temperatures cause the thermal deformation of the wear-depth detecting system of bearing test benches and then affect {{the accuracy of the}} wear-depth detecting data. However, few researches about the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> test benches can be found with the implementation of the detecting error compensation. Based on the self-made modular <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> test bench, two main causes of thermal errors, the friction heat of bearings and the environmental temperature variation, are analysed. The thermal errors caused by the friction heat of bearings are calculated, and the thermal deformation of the wear-depth detecting system caused by the varying environmental temperatures is detected. In view of the above results, the environmental temperature variation is the main cause of the two error factors. When the environmental temperatures rise is 10.3  °C, the thermal deformation is approximately 0.01  mm. In addition, the comprehensive compensating model of the thermal error of the wear-depth detecting system is built by multiple linear regression (MLR) and time series analysis. Compared with the detecting data of the thermal errors, the comprehensive compensating model has higher fitting precision, and the maximum residual is only 1  μm. A comprehensive compensating model of the thermal error of the wear-depth detecting system is proposed, which provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of the real-time wear-depth detecting precision of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> test bench.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The working {{principle}} and performance {{characteristics of a}} self-made oscillation tribo-tester were introduced. Under different oscillation frequency and pressure conditions, the friction coefficient and linear wear of spherical plain bearings with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) woven liner were investigated. By using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), the wear mechanism of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> was analyzed. The results indicate that with the oscillation frequency increases, the friction coefficient of spherical plain bearings decreased while the wear loss increased. In the high frequency of 4. 8 Hz, the reduction ranges of the friction coefficient is not obvious with the contact pressure increased, but the effect of contact pressure on the wear of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> is great.

All polymer-fiber combinations gave friction coefficients from 0. 05 to 0. 18 and low wear. Adding CdO and CdI 2 reduced the wear of degassed bearings in dry air. These additives were not needed when the bearing liners contained adsorbed moisture.

30|$|At present, {{the thermal}} error {{compensation}} has been intensively studied in precise CNC machine [3], yet few researches in the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> test benches. The existing researches only build the thermal error models, {{and do not}} compensate effectively the thermal errors. Zhou [4] built the thermal error compensation model of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> test bench under the high temperature operating condition, but did not verify the fitting precision and the applicability of this model, nor compensated the thermal errors. Hu et al. [5] made a comprehensive compensating model for the wear-depth detecting system of the <b>spherical</b> <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> test bench based on the multi-body kinematics and verified its accuracy by FEM, but didn’t compensate the thermal errors, either. Li et al.

Relevant researches of CNC machine {{can be used on}} thermal compensating method, bringing in software-based compensating error method. In other words, {{on the basis of the}} thermal deformation analysis, the mathematical compensating model of the thermal errors is built, and then the thermal deformation is predicted in the control system. At last, the thermal errors are compensated in real time [7, 8]. In this process, many mathematical methods are used for the thermal error modeling, such as, regression analysis method [9], FEM, neural networks [10], time series analysis [11], screw theory, fuzzy theory [12], grey theory [13], support vector machine [14], genetic algorithm [15], ant colony algorithm [16].|$|E
