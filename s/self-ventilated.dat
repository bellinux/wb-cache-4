50|$|The {{original}} Jenn-Air Products Company {{was founded}} by Louis J. Jenn in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1947, later becoming simply Jenn-Air. In the early years, the company was focused on manufacturing and marketing of industrial fans {{for use in a}} variety of commercial and industrial applications. In 1961, Jenn-Air's integration of one of these fans to a cook-top range lead to the invention of the first <b>self-ventilated</b> downdraft range. The company expanded its product line to include many other kitchen appliances including microwave ovens, refrigerators, dishwashers, and small appliances such as mixers and blenders.|$|E
50|$|The {{new design}} {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} train design in modern times that had inter-vehicle articulation and distributed traction. The design used Alstom Onix IGBT based traction inverters; the weight reduction associated with IGBT technology allowed an axle load of within 17 tonnes per axle. The trainsets were to {{be made up of}} modules of 3-car sets with two powered bogies per module. Each motor bogie had two body-mounted <b>self-ventilated</b> motors, one per axle, rated at 600 kW. The traction electronics used two taps per transformer per module, each powering two parallel connected inverters, with a separate inverter for each motor. There were two carriage designs: the driving control cars, and intermediate cars; and two designs of bogie: powered and unpowered.|$|E
40|$|The {{cooling load}} {{reduction}} potentials of <b>self-ventilated</b> cavity walls (SVCW) were quantitatively investigated through numerical simulations. Parametric and correlation studies {{were conducted to}} understand the impacts of typical wall geometric configurations {{on the performance of}} reducing cooling load. After quantifying the impacts of temperature and wall geometries, estimates of cooling-load reduction potentials for three summer months in four different locations in three climate regions were calculated. In addition, peak-time cooling-load reduction potentials of SVCW were investigated quantitatively to understand the impact of SVCW on reducing peak cooling load in summer time. Numerical simulation results were validated either through the published data set, or through the experimental data from thermal imaging. The results of the investigations suggested that SVCW system has significant potentials in reducing building’s summer cooling load across the US. Moreover, SVCW system also performs very well in reducing peak summer cooling load. The research outcomes can be applied to both new buildings and retrofitting of existing buildings. ...|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: These results {{demonstrate}} that the major limiting factors in achieving the core standards are principally driven by factors unrelated to physiotherapy provision. In particular the most significant limiting factor of the <b>self-ventilating</b> and tracheostomy groups was fatigue/exercise tolerance, followed by medical limitation although <b>self-ventilating</b> patients {{are more likely to}} refuse treatment. The ventilated via ETT group, although receiving significant respiratory physiotherapy input receive less rehabilitation due to sedation. These data could be used to help inform any potential ESICM guidelines for ICUAW therapy.|$|R
30|$|Results: A {{total of}} 53 {{patients}} were included with 417 physiotherapy contacts over the study period. Patients are offered two treatment sessions per day Monday to Friday and once at a weekend, standard practice in our critical care unit. Patients {{were described as}} one of 3 categories: <b>self-ventilating,</b> ventilated via tracheostomy and ventilated via Endotracheal Tube (ETT).|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Most {{people when}} asked, express a {{preference}} to die at home, but {{little is known}} about whether this is an option for critically ill patients. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken to describe the size and characteristics of the critical care population who could potentially be transferred home to die if they expressed such a wish. METHODS: Medical notes of all patients who died in, or within 5 ?days of discharge from seven critical care units across two hospital sites over a 12 -month period were reviewed. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were developed and applied to identify the number of patients who had potential to be transferred home to die and demographic and clinical data (eg, conscious state, respiratory and cardiac support therapies) collected. RESULTS: 7844 patients were admitted over a 12 -month period. 422 (5. 4 %) patients died. Using the criteria developed 100 (23. 7 %) patients could have potentially been transferred home to die. Of these 41 (41 %) patients were diagnosed with respiratory disease. 53 (53 %) patients were conscious, 47 (47 %) patients were <b>self-ventilating</b> breathing room air/oxygen via a mask. 20 (20 %) patients were ventilated via an endotracheal tube. 76 (76 %) patients were not requiring inotropes/vasopressors. Mean time between discussion about treatment withdrawal and time of death was 36. 4 ?h (SD= 46. 48). No patients in this cohort were transferred home. CONCLUSIONS: A little over 20 % of patients dying in critical care demonstrate potential to be transferred home to die. Staff should actively consider the practice of transferring home as an option for care at end of life for these patients...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY An {{interdisciplinary}} research program on organic pig production, EKOPIG, was financed by FORMAS and by SLU. Part IV of EKOPIG {{was carried out}} at SLU-Alnarp and emphasis was on housing systems for organic growing-finishing pigs. In this part, an animal house for organic growing-finishing pigs was built. The planning and construction of the building is described in this report. When planning {{the design of the}} animal house, a number of principles were taken into consideration. Among others, the pigs should be easy to control and monitor. It should also be easy to control feeding and production, to weigh the pigs, and to send them to slaughter. The labour requirement should be minimized by using automatic manure and feeding systems. The building construction should be simple, uninsulated, and <b>self-ventilating,</b> and to a major extent be constructed of locally available wooden material. In addition, dung contact between the animal groups should be avoided [...] The house had room for 128 growing-finishing pigs distributed into 8 pens of 16 pigs each (Figure 8). There were two different pen types, of which one had deep straw bedding (Figure 15), and the other had slanted floors and the “straw-flow” system (Figures 12 and 16). The pens were designed according to the EU and KRAV regulations (with or without letting the animals go outside). The total pen area was 1. 5 m 2 per pig inside and 1 m 2 per pig outside on the concrete area. The building was constructed at JBT’s research farm for pig studies at Odarslöv, and had bearing outer walls and framework roof trusses. The animal house was located near the existing manure container (Figures 1 and 2). The concrete floor was poured on location (Figure 3) upon which walls were built up of cavity cement blocks. The sides of the dung channel and the wall towards the animal area were also built of cavity cement blocks (Figure 4). The lower section of the wall was built of lightclinker blocks which were plastered on both sides, and above this section the wall was made of a wooden frame covered with wood panels (Figure 5). The roof consisted of cement fiber plates (Figure 6). There was natural ventilation due to the wooden slats on the walls and an open roof ridge with transparent covering. The roof ridge was furnished with a wind shield and was solid the first 4 m from each gable. The pen with the straw flow system had a lying area which was covered and a floor profile slanting to the dung channel (Figure 16). All the pens were placed in a row with openings towards the north (Figure 13) facing the concrete area and pasturage. An inspection passage was placed along one of the outside walls (Figure 9). The concrete outside lying area had the same design for all of the pens (Figure 14). The floor profile for the pens and concrete areas are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The pigs were fed using an automatic dry feed system (Figure 18) in transverse troughs (Figure 17), and over the troughs water pipes with nose valves were placed so the pigs had the possibility of wetting the feed. Roughage was distributed in containers placed in the concrete area on the stable walls (Figures 19 and 20). The pigs had free access to water via a water cup located in the dung alley (Figure 21). The water installations were protected from frost using an electric heating cable inserted in the water pipes in the animal house. Ordinary straw was used as bedding and it was handled in the form of big bales transported into the house using a tractor with a front loader (Figure 22). The dung from the animal house was managed both as solid and liquid manure. The pens with deep straw bedding were cleaned using a front loader once per batch, and the dung transported to an area for solid dung located near the animal house. The pens which had slanted floors were kept clean via the activity of the animals. Straw was distributed to the lying area and much of the straw carried out to the pen floor. Due to the animals’ activity it ended up in the dung area (10 % slant) {{at the lower end of}} the pen. There it was mixed with the dung and pressed down by the pigs through an opening between the floor and the pen wall (Figure 23). A dung alley/channel with concrete slats connected all the pens (Figure 24), and it was scraped daily using a cable driven scraper (Figure 25). The dung was moved to a pump well and then pumped over to a storage container. The manure was mixed before pumping by pumping it around (Figure 7) the dung channel on the outside area. During the planning phase for the animal house, many calculations for the use of feed, water, straw and as well as the quantities of dung and urine which would be produced were carried out (Table 1) An estimation of the building costs was carried out with the help of the data for cost estimation for farm production buildings obtained from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Table 8). The present calculation was based on the prices for 2002, and the estimated cost for the animal house was 1, 465, 000 SKK, or 11, 450 SKK per pig place. The building area per pig was 3. 9 m 2 including the service areas. The cost of the manure containers and straw storage was not included in this estimation. The size of the pasture areas was calculated and consideration was taken to the recommendations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus loading (Tables 2 – 5) per ha for pigs on pasture. An estimation was made of the amount of the produced manure which would remain in the house or be on the outside areas. For 4 of the 8 pens (Figure 26) fenced lots were made (Figure 28) which the pigs had access to in the summer months. Special transport alleys (Figure 27) out to these lots were also built to maintain a good longevity for these hard used areas. The pasture lots were established with a wide range of grasses (Table 6) which were completed later with more diverse species (Table 7) ...|$|R
