5|$|In {{the wake}} of this attention, {{existing}} acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition {{as a result of}} the movement included Interpol, the Killers, the Catheters, Mooney Suzuki and the Go in the US, and Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Editors, the Cribs, the Libertines, the Fratellis, Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs in the UK. Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E
25|$|On 19 November 2007, Spirit debuted on the UK Albums Chart {{at number}} one with first-week sales of 375,872 copies, {{making it the}} fastest selling debut album in the UK, beating Arctic Monkeys' Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not (2006) by 12,000 copies, until the release of Susan Boyle's debut album I Dreamed a Dream in November 2009, which sold 410,000 copies in its first week. It was the fourth fastest selling album of all time, behind Be Here Now (Oasis, 1997), X (Coldplay, 2005) and Life for Rent (Dido, 2003). The album {{remained}} at number one for seven weeks, and reached one million sales after 29 days, making it the fastest album to sell one million copies by a solo female in the UK. Spirit was the second biggest selling album of 2007 in the UK, behind Back to Black (Amy Winehouse, 2006). For {{each of the first}} seven weeks it sold over 100,000 copies, a record which was later equalled by JLS (JLS, 2009), and beaten by 21 (Adele, 2011), which sold over 100,000 copies for twelve weeks. On 23 November 2008, the album returned to number one for a week, following the release of the deluxe version of the album. In the UK Spirit was the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s, and is the twentieth best-selling album of all time. The album has been certified ten-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, with sales of 3.1 million by December 2014. It is the 4th best selling album of the millennium in the UK, and as of November 2015 has sold 3,132,668 copies in the UK.|$|E

500|$|The band {{finished}} recording {{their debut}} album, Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not, at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with British record producer Jim Abbiss producing. Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies {{in the first}} week. This smashed the previous record of 306,631 copies held by Popstars by Hear'Say, and sold more copies on its first day alone – 118,501 – {{than the rest of}} the Top 20 albums combined. The cover sleeve of Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not, showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for [...] "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK". The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and suggested the opposite – [...] "You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to Fox Business Channel, Grae Drake, {{senior editor}} of Rotten Tomatoes, {{expressed}} dismay over the critical reception, stating, [...] "As much as I love and respect our critics at Rotten Tomatoes, I've got to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> shocked. Listen, the movie’s not perfect but ... I just cannot fathom it. It was a good movie, you guys." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{have usually}} been {{categorized}} under the indie rock, garage rock and post-punk revival genres. A {{key part of}} their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography, is lead singer and frontman Alex Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years. A large part of their iconic British sound is credited to the punk poet John Cooper Clarke from whom the Arctic Monkeys even borrowed lyrics and the title from in [...] "I Wanna Be Yours". Turner adapted Clarke's method of delivery mostly in their first album, Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> That's What I'm Not. Their early albums Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> That's What I'm Not and Favourite Worst Nightmare were rooted in garage rock and post-punk revival, with Turner's sharp lyrics the focal point. On the first album Alex Turner examined human behaviour in nightclubs and {{in the culture of}} the band's hometown, Sheffield. Turner describes [...] "Dancing Shoes" [...] as being about [...] "people always looking to [...] when they go out however much they mask it." ...|$|E

500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{achieved}} chart {{success with}} their first single [...] "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" [...] which reached {{number one in the}} UK Singles Chart. Their first album Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not, released on 23 January 2006, was at the time the fastest-selling debut album in British music history. It received critical acclaim, winning both the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 BRIT Awards for Best British Album. [...] The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, sold over 225,000 copies in its debut week, and was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize. The group also picked up the award for Best British Album and Best British Group at the BRIT Awards in 2008. Overall, the band has won five BRIT Awards, including [...] "Best British Breakthrough Act" [...] in 2006, [...] "Best British Album" [...] in 2007 for Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not, and [...] "Best British Group" [...] in 2008. At the NME Awards in 2006, they made history by becoming the first band to win both [...] "Best New Band" [...] and [...] "Best British Band" [...] in the same night.

500|$|Between June 16 and June 27, 2011, {{one song}} from 4 each day was {{available}} to listen to on Beyoncé's official website, together with its accompanying photographs from the album packaging and a quote. On June 27, 2011, [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was the twelfth song to be made available. In the accompanying quote, Beyoncé said: [...] "I try to write songs that will {{bring out the best}} in all of us and keep us close together. I think about saying the things that women want to say but sometimes are not confident enough to <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to continue to write those songs that give women strength." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Miss; <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> in love {{ever since}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ten years old; <b>I</b> may <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born in love, {{and hope to}} die in love." ...|$|R

500|$|Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, {{the single}} [...] "Leave Before the Lights Come On", came on 14 August 2006. Turner {{said that the}} song {{was one of the}} last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and {{suggested}} that [...] "it feels very much like it could be on the album". Peaking at No.4 in the UK, the single became the band's first single not to reach No.1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former bandmates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later.|$|E
500|$|The media {{coverage}} of the allegations was criticized for using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, for accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money, for accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money, for deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance at its worst, for a lack of objectivity and for using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt. At the time, Jackson said of the media reaction, [...] "I will <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions".|$|E

6000|$|I {{have always}} lived with Aunt Martha--my parents died when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a baby. Aunt Martha <b>says</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{to be her}} heiress if I please her--which means--but, oh, {{you do not know}} what [...] "pleasing" [...] Aunt Martha means.|$|R
500|$|At the time, Jackson said of {{the media}} reaction, [...] "I will <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{particularly}} upset by {{the handling of the}} matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions". A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds (4.5kg) in weight and had stopped eating. Jackson's health had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} canceled the remainder of his Dangerous World Tour and went into rehabilitation. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic, and was put on a Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was [...] "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level". While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Diamond Sea" [...] {{is notable}} for its 19:35 duration. Moore {{explained}} {{the length of}} some of the album's songs: [...] "We all have different aesthetics as to how songs should work. I generally push for a lot of abandon while some people in the group are more interested in truncating things. If I was the leader as much as people <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> every song would be 20 minutes long". The unlisted ninth track, officially called [...] "Becuz Coda", was originally part of the song [...] "Becuz", but the record label felt they needed to cut the seven-and-a-half-minute track to make the album's opening more accessible. The album was produced by Sonic Youth and John Siket, who also engineered the band's previous two albums. Audio mixing took place at Greene Street Studios in New York City in June 1995.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to be a leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for justice, <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for peace, <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter... I just want to leave a committed life behind." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People {{were never}} right in <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Anne. But in some respects, {{they will be}} right if they write me down as Emily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a good fellow--and, remember, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> asked for, {{you must}} <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> obliged {{to quit the}} court for a few minutes, and left you in charge." ...|$|R
