5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> meters.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>level,</b> the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and intermodulation distortion vs. <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>level</b> (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E

At the high fuel-air ratios, severe low-frequency resonance was encountered which represented {{more than half}} the total energy in the sound spectrum. At similar thrust conditions, lower <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> were obtained from a current fighter air craft with a different afterburner configuration.

50|$|This {{pressure}} field {{is generated by}} multifrequency sirens powered by nitrogen or compressed air modulators. This system can generate <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>levels</b> up to 160 dBSPL.

500|$|Subwoofers {{received}} {{a great deal}} of publicity in 1974 with the movie Earthquake which was released in Sensurround. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin Vega [...] "Sensurround" [...] system used large subwoofers which were driven by racks of 500 watt amplifiers which were triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the film screen and two more were placed together {{at the rear of the}} audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17Hz to 120Hz was generated at the level of 110–120 decibels of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>level,</b> abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976 there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic Midway in 1976 and Rollercoaster in 1977.
