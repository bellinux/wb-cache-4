30|$|Most {{widely used}} timing {{recovery}} schemes are Gardner algorithm [2] and band-edge algorithm, or known as Godard algorihtm, [3]. The band-edge algorithms has originated from the output energy maximization (OEM) of <b>sampled</b> received <b>signals,</b> i.e., finding timing phase maximizing {{the energy of}} the <b>sampled</b> <b>signals.</b> Since the <b>sampled</b> <b>signals</b> is mixed with inter-symbol-interference terms, the timing phase based on OEM is optimized for infinite length equalizers but not for a finite length equalizer. As we will show in this article, Gardner algorithm also belongs to this OEM category and, consequently, cannot produce optimized timing offset for a finite length equalizer. In general, it is difficult and costly task to optimize timing phase for a given finite length equalizer: joint optimization of timing and equalization has inherent latency problem and often requires frequent training signals.|$|R
