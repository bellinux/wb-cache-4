5|$|An edited {{version of}} the video was {{produced}} for the Spanglish {{version of the}} song, in which Ne-Yo's <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> cut and replaced with scenes featuring David Bisbal.

5|$|At Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo {{directed}} the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay {{and did the}} storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> noticeably different {{when compared to the}} film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement. Adobe Photoshop was used to add the finishing details to the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> shot {{outside of}} the studio. Woodbury, during Season 3, was filmed in {{downtown}} Senoia. Other exceptions include the Kingdom, which is filmed at the former military base Fort McPherson, now converted to studios for Tyler Perry.|$|E
5|$|The Kalyanasundara icon is not {{the object}} of popular worship and is usually used only in the {{celebrations}} of the divine marriage in annual temple festivals. However, Kalyanasundara <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> found across India in caves, sculptures and on temple walls.|$|E
50|$|Although set in Limerick, many street <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} Cork. For example, the 'fleas in the mattress' <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed at Farren Street, Blackpool and other <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot at Roche's Buildings, Lower John Street and Barrack Street.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the music}} video, Aguilera portrays her alter ego Baby Jane, a {{nickname}} that Nelly once gave her. The narrative <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> punctuated by shots of two trombonists playing the Dave Cortez brass sample in unison. The video depicts {{a mix of}} styles from the 1920s, as well as modern.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E
5|$|Living nativity <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> {{not without}} their problems. In the United States in 2008, for example, vandals {{destroyed}} all eight scenes and backdrops at a drive-through living nativity scene in Georgia. About 120 of the church’s 500 members {{were involved in}} the construction of the scenes or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than US$2,000. Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint.|$|E
5|$|The DVD release {{included}} a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes {{he intended to}} include in the release. However, these <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would detract from the film's integrity.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> {{the only}} one set by Beethoven. The setting for this <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> given thus by Schikaneder: ...|$|R

5|$|The NBC {{site also}} {{featured}} {{more than two}} minutes-worth of clips involving the subplot between Kevin and Lynne, including Andy discussing his new method of being mean to women while courting dates, {{in response to his}} recent failed engagement with Angela.

5|$|The clip {{opens with}} Lopez and her love {{interest}} conversing {{on the side}} walk {{in front of a}} shop window. These <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> intercut with that of suspicious men in a van, observing Lopez and her lover. Later, Lopez and her lover split and she starts singing as she walks down the street. She goes inside a boutique and enters through at a secret door. As she enters, she takes off a wig and changes her clothing.

In the end, it is revealed that Lopez is an undercover FBI agent who surrenders her boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by show runner and {{executive}} producer Shonda Rhimes, while filmmaker Daniel Minahan directed it. Sara Ramirez began receiving star billing in the season premiere, after numerous appearances during the last episodes of the second season. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California.

Magnuson Park in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this <b>scene</b> <b>were</b> preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|R
50|$|Opening <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot in Toronto, Ontario. The camera booth <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shot on {{the lower}} draw bridge (linking Hamilton and Burlington).

5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot {{can pick up}} various objects; these can then be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> also included.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two {{children}} walking through an post-apocalyptic world, with industrial sites in the background. The two children are barred in with barded wire fences. Hamasaki then appears inside a photo album, singing the song in front of cherry blossom trees. Hamasaki's <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> inter cuts that are featured throughout the entire video. The two children escape by crawling under the fence, but are being watched by camera surveillance.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Furtado walking under a stone bridge near {{which is an}} icon of Jesus Christ. As the video {{progresses}} she continues to walk and starts singing the song's lyrics.
