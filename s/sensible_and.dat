5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E

25|$|In {{correspondence}} with his ex-student and friend Markus Herz, Kant admitted that, in the inaugural dissertation, {{he had failed}} to account for the relation between our <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> intellectual faculties.

He also refrained from having a wide social network, and rarely hosted guests at home.|$|E

25|$|In Of the Standard of Taste, Hume {{argues that}} no rules {{can be drawn}} up about what is a tasteful object. However, a {{reliable}} critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> unprejudiced, and having extensive experience. Of Tragedy addresses {{the question of why}} humans enjoy tragic drama. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.|$|E

25|$|James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) {{have been}} best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, {{he is also}} boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of {{the events in the}} series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> {{responsible}} friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will always take care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.|$|E
25|$|Earth {{receives}} {{energy from}} the Sun {{in the form of}} ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation. Of the total amount of solar energy available {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, about 26% is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. Because the Earth's surface is colder than the photosphere of the Sun, it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that were absorbed. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, thereby warming it. In addition to the absorption of solar and thermal radiation, the atmosphere gains heat by <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the surface of Earth. This leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent.|$|E
25|$|Earth: The earth {{signs are}} Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. A native with mainly earth signs will be {{practical}} and cautious, <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> capable {{and will be}} happier with concrete things than abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with quite {{a lot to get}} it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though there can be a tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to be shy in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

25|$|Haig {{told the}} War Policy Committee (19 June, and {{contrary}} to Robertson's advice of six days earlier) that “Germany was nearer her end than they seemed to think … Germany was within {{six months of the}} total exhaustion of her available manpower, if the fighting continues at its present intensity” and (20 June) he had no “intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses” whilst Robertson wanted to avoid “disproportionate loss” (23 June). At this time Haig was involved in discussions as to whether Robertson should be appointed First Lord of the Admiralty (a ministerial post), and Woodward suggests that he may have felt that Robertson had outlived his usefulness as CIGS. Ministers were not entirely convinced by Jellicoe’s warnings about German submarines and destroyers operating from the Belgian ports, but were influenced by France’s decline (the opposite to Robertson’s original view that this made a major offensive less <b>sensible)</b> <b>and</b> by the apparent success of the Kerensky Offensive. The Flanders Offensive was finally sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme.|$|E
25|$|Aufmarsch I West {{was one of}} four {{deployment}} plans {{available to}} the German General Staff in 1914. Each plan favoured certain operations, but did not specify exactly how those operations were to be carried out, leaving the commanding officers to carry those out at their own initiative and with minimal oversight. Aufmarsch I West, designed for a one-front war with France, had been retired once it became clear it was irrelevant to the wars Germany could expect to face; both Russia and Britain were expected to help France, and there was no possibility of Italian nor Austro-Hungarian troops being available for operations against France. But despite its unsuitability, and the availability of more <b>sensible</b> <b>and</b> decisive options, it retained a certain allure due to its offensive nature and the pessimism of pre-war thinking, which expected offensive operations to be short-lived, costly in casualties, and unlikely to be decisive. Accordingly, the Aufmarsch II West deployment was changed for the offensive of 1914, despite its unrealistic goals and the insufficient forces Germany had available for decisive success. Moltke took Schlieffen's plan and modified the deployment of forces on the western front by reducing the right wing, the one to advance through Belgium, from 85% to 70%. In the end, the Schlieffen plan was so radically modified by Moltke, that it could be more properly called the Moltke Plan.|$|E
