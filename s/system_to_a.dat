5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.|$|E
5|$|Although deep {{convection}} was displaced to {{the northwest}} of an exposed LLCC early on January 14, the JMA still upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm and named it Mekkhala, under moderate vertical wind shear offset by excellent poleward outflow. In post-season analysis, the agency upgraded the storm at 12:00 UTC on the previous day. Late on January 14, the PAGASA named the storm Amang right after it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development}} of rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey {{generally}} adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, mining, etc.).

5|$|Hurricane Arlene {{originated}} {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline on August8. Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual anticyclonic loop, the system slowly increased in organization and intensity. By August10, the low neared the Bahamas but remained disorganized.

5|$|Later on August 11, {{the center}} of Etau became {{partially}} devoid of convection, with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center. Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken. Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well {{to the east of}} Japan. Roughly 24hours later, the JMA also downgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression. The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August14 as it slowly tracked northward.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of Tropical Depression Fourteen, the southern Caribbean Sea was under a large area of low pressure. On October 30, satellite imagery showed that the area of pressure was beginning to form into a tropical disturbance. A reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled for the next morning to investigate the forming system, but by 1400 UTC on October 31, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida had upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression based on the imagery and surface data. At this time, the specialists at the Hurricane Center believed that this was its most developed stage of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September1 and continued westward until reaching the eastern Pacific fifteen days later. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed along the wave axis on September16 as convective activity organized, and by 0600UTC on September18, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Convective bands began to form {{near the center}} a few hours later, leading to an improved satellite presentation overall. Tracking west-northwestward {{as a result of the}} mid-level ridge, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000UTC on September19. Turning northwest, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite, prompting the NHC to upgrade the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Category1 hurricane 24 hours later. With an area of deep convection near the center, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mb (hPa; 29.06inHg) at 0000UTC on September21. Westerly flow associated with a large upper-level low began to undercut the outflow of Ivo, and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours. The convective pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear, and despite a brief burst of convection, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000UTC on September 23. Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward, and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly. The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction.|$|E
5|$|Across Florida, Gordon's winds damaged {{power lines}} and knocked down trees and traffic signals; about 425,000people lost power due to the storm. The rains caused {{flooding}} in Dade and Collier counties, which damaged $275million worth of crops, mostly to vegetables and sugar cane. In some locations, the crop damage was worse than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state. Along Elliott Key, Gordon damaged the coral reef <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater extent than Andrew. Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast-rising water and roof collapses. In Volusia County, floods entered 1,236buildings, causing $26million in damage. Flooding caused dozens of roads to close, {{some of which were}} washed out. In the Everglades, flooding killed several deer. Statewide, two people drowned in separate instances after driving into flooded areas. Three people drowned along beaches, including one man who died in a rip current while attempting to rescue his son. In Hillsboro Inlet, two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves. Throughout Florida, Gordon directly killed eight people, and injured 43people. There were also three indirect deaths; two were from traffic accidents, and one was related to a heart attack after a person pushed a stalled car in a flooded road. Statewide damage was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|After the cyclone {{bypassed}} Socotra, its convective core became better defined due {{to improved}} outflow. On 2November, Chapala entered the Gulf of Aden, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record in that region. At 12:00UTC that day, the IMD downgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very severe cyclonic storm, after Chapala {{had been an}} extremely severe cyclonic storm for 78hours. The structure became disorganized that day due to increased easterly wind shear and interaction with the Arabian Peninsula to the north, causing cooler and drier air to enter the circulation. Around this time, the storm began moving more to the west-northwest toward Yemen, rounding the southwestern periphery of a ridge. Between 01:0002:00UTC on 3November, Chapala made landfall near Mukalla with winds of 120km/h (75mph). This marked the first hurricane-intensity landfall for Yemen on record, and the first severe cyclonic storm to hit the country since May 1960. According to the JTWC, Chapala moved ashore and immediately turned back over water, although the agency soon reassessed the center as being over land. Chapala quickly weakened over land, degenerating into a depression by 00:00UTC on 4November, and weakening into a remnant low pressure area three hours later.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather persisted as of 9 April to {{the southeast}} of Diego Garcia. The system moved generally westwards, steered by a ridge, and a low-level circulation gradually became more defined. Limiting factors to faster development included poor inflow and moderate wind shear, although associated convection became more organized. At 06:00UTC on 11 April, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion (MFR) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 8 about 600km (375mi) south of Diego Garcia. Six hours later, the agency upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression. At 13:00UTC on 11 April, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting the increased organization of the convection, circulation, and outflow. Later that day, the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Fantala, and the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S. By that time, the convection was quickly consolidating around the center, organizing into a circular central dense overcast.|$|E

A training cruise in March saw the ship visit New Zealand and Fiji. Sydneys fourteenth voyage, to deliver 6 RAR to Vietnam and return with 4 RAR, commenced on 8 May when Sydney sailed from Townsville. She met the destroyer Vampire off Singapore on 14 May, reached Vũng Tàu five days later, and arrived back in Brisbane on 30 May.
