A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their <b>study</b> <b>area</b> were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
40|$|There {{are none}} known Bronze Age {{settlement}} on Gotland, {{although there are}} severalexcavation reports that mention that they have found a probable Bronze Age settlement.

These <b>study</b> <b>areas</b> have been investigated if they might be possible Bronze Age settlements. This paper discusses about the criteria of settlements and also investigate if the <b>study</b> <b>areas</b> meet those criterias. There are many different criteria for settlement but only the criteria of FMIS are used in the study. There are also different criteria for hearths and cooking pits, what separates them from each other.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{based on the results of}} {{empirical}} research on the utilization of the Health Care System (HCS) by twelve <b>study</b> <b>areas</b> from seven countries (WHO/International Collaborative Study of Medical Care Utilization). The aim of the secondary analysis was to compare the health care needs, resources and determinants of use of the HCS between the Polish city, Lodz, and the remaining <b>study</b> <b>areas.</b> The chief findings were as follows: 1. 1. The level of needs for health care is higher in Lodz than in other <b>study</b> <b>areas.</b> 2. 2. The volume of HCS resources in Lodz is at the medium level, but its organization makes the utilization of the HCS difficult. 3. 3. The utilization of medical assistance by physicians in Lodz is near the median comparing with the remaining <b>study</b> <b>areas</b> but the lenght of hospital stay in Lodz is the longest among all <b>study</b> <b>areas.</b> Problems of the accessibility of medical assistance cause an overloading of the inadequate hospital system. 4. 4. The extra-medical causes of the use of the HCS are stronger in Lodz than in other <b>study</b> <b>areas,</b> whereas the medical determinants (perceived morbidity) are weaker. ...|$|R

Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway {{to provide access to}} properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) <b>study</b> <b>area.</b> These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

25|$|The Devils Garden is {{also known}} as a Wilderness <b>Study</b> <b>Area</b> for the purpose of {{possible}} wilderness designation; however, wilderness status was not recommended by the BLM's District Manager in an Instant <b>Study</b> <b>Area</b> report submitted to the U.S. Congress in 1991. One of the stated reasons was that the existing roads, parking lot, picnic tables and toilet facilities are all in close proximity to the natural area. A second reason was the likelihood of several groups of people converging at the same time around the main formations of the site, which are located in a 10-acre area adjacent to the parking lot (1.6% of the total designated area of 640 acres). Both of those reasons diminish the wilderness experience of solitude in a remote natural setting.|$|E
