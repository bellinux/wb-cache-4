5000|$|After World War I {{he devoted}} himself entirely to his inventions. In 1923, his book, [...] "Can We Attempt a Space Journey to the Moon?" [...] stirred quite an {{interest}} in the media which start comparing his experiences in rocketry to those of the USA scientist Goddard and the French Esnault-Pelterie. In 1930, at the 19th Convention of the Italian Society for the Progress of Sciences, he read his paper on 'Astronautics and Jet Propulsion' and suggested awarding an International Prize for Astronautical Altitude to foster enthusiasm 'towards Astronautics, so little known in Italy'. His suggestion was vetoed by the Scientific Committee of the Convention. The years between the two World Wars were to see an increasingly hostile relationship between Gussalli and the academic world and state institutions: he would often accuse the many scientific committees of shortsightedness, apathy and lack of intuition. These were also the years in which he was in regular correspondence with Goddard and Oberth.In 1941 he published his second book, 'Jet Propulsion for Astronautics: Reduction of Fuel Consumption Makes Possible Human Navigation in Space' or… Makes Space Exploration a Reality?', suggesting the use of a 'solar engine' as an auxiliary motor. Then he drew plans for a stratospheric airship. Between 1942 and the end of World War II he wrote his last book: 'Interplanetary Travel through Solar Radiations: a Fuel-Free Propulsion System (that needs no fuel) is the Key to Interplanetary Travel'. The book was published in 1946, both in Italian and English, drawing more attention abroad than in Italy. His last writing dates from June 1949. He addressed a letter to the Italian National Center for Research, the historical Accademia dei Lincei and the Italian Society for the Progress of Sciences, underlining analogies between his writings and the experiments being performed in the USA at the time on multiple-stage rockets, spaceships spinning on their axes to create artificial gravity {{and the development of a}} <b>solar</b> <b>engine</b> to power spacecraft. This letter, which is regarded as his last will and testament, in scientific terms, ends on a sour note, with him blaming the Italian scientific milieu for its disinterest in his theories. He died on June 23, 1950, at Barbano di Salo' in Northern Italy.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{reciprocating}} <b>solar</b> <b>engine</b> utilizing small particles to absorb concentrated sunlight directly within the cylinders is described.

It differs from other gas driven heat engines using solar energy in three main respects. First, the radiant flux is deposited directly in the working fluid inside the cylinder; second, the heat is directed to the appropriate cylinder by controlling the solar flux by an optical system; third, the gas is heated during a significant portion of the compression stroke.

30|$|As {{a result}} of a {{scientific}} cooperation between Moulay Ismail University in Morocco and the University of Technology of Dresden in Germany, an LTD γ-type Stirling engine was manufactured. This engine was tested and studied under real conditions [11]. Based on the conclusions of this study, a new prototype of LTD-SE with rhombic drive mechanism is being developed. This new prototype is designed to be simple, robust, cheap, and stable to be used for water pumping in poor rural African areas. In fact, this engine is manufactured more than 90 % from mechanical cheap parts available in poor areas, so that it could be easily manufactured and maintained right there. Besides, it is a <b>solar</b> <b>engine,</b> fact that lowers significantly its use price. In addition to that, the new prototype is a beta type which has a symmetric geometry that gives the engine more stability compared to γ-type Stirling engines, and the drive mechanism used, which is the rhombic drive, allows the coaxial position of the engine pistons, fact that improves also the engine stability.|$|E

40|$|A solar-thermal engine {{serves as}} a {{high-temperature}} solar-radiation absorber, heat exchanger, and rocket nozzle. collecting concentrated solar radiation into an absorber cavity and transferring this energy to a propellant as heat. Propellant gas can be heated to temperatures approaching 4, 500 F and expanded in a rocket nozzle, creating low thrust with a high specific impulse (I(sub sp)). The Shooting Star Experiment (SSE) solar-thermal engine is made of 100 percent chemical vapor deposited (CVD) rhenium. The engine 'module' consists of an engine assembly, propellant feedline, engine support structure, thermal insulation, and instrumentation. Engine thermal performance tests consist {{of a series of}} high-temperature thermal cycles intended to characterize the propulsive performance of the engines and the thermal effectiveness of the engine support structure and insulation system. A silicone-carbide electrical resistance heater, placed inside the inner shell, substitutes for solar radiation and heats the engine. Although the preferred propellant is hydrogen, the propellant used in these tests is gaseous nitrogen. Because rhenium oxidizes at elevated temperatures, the tests are performed in a vacuum chamber. Test data will include transient and steady state temperatures on selected engine surfaces, propellant pressures and flow rates, and engine thrust levels. The engine propellant-feed system is designed to Supply GN 2 to the engine at a constant inlet pressure of 60 psia, producing a near-constant thrust of 1. 0 lb. Gaseous hydrogen will be used in subsequent tests. The propellant flow rate decreases with increasing propellant temperature, while maintaining constant thrust, increasing engine I(sub sp). In conjunction with analytical models of the heat exchanger, the temperature data will provide insight into the effectiveness of the insulation system, the structural support system, and the overall engine performance. These tests also provide experience on operational aspects of the engine and associated subsystems, and will include independent variation of both steady slate heat-exchanger temperature prior to thrust operation and nitrogen inlet pressure (flow rate) during thrust operation. Although the Shooting Star engines were designed as thermal-storage engines to accommodate mission parameters, they are fully capable of operating as scalable, direct-gain engines. Tests are conducted in both operational modes. Engine thrust and propellant flow rate will be measured and thereby I(sub sp). The objective of these tests is to investigate the effectiveness of the <b>solar</b> <b>engine</b> as a heat exchanger and a rocket. Of particular interest is the effectiveness of the support structure as a thermal insulator, the integrity of both the insulation system and the insulation containment system, the overall temperature distribution throughout the engine module, and the thermal power required to sustain steady state fluid temperatures at various flow rates...|$|E
