40|$|A selfconsistent {{thermodynamic}} T-matrix {{approach is}} deployed {{to study the}} microscopic properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), encompassing both light- and heavy-parton degrees of freedom in a unified framework. The starting point is a relativistic effective Hamiltonian with a universal color force. The input in-medium potential is quantitatively constrained by computing the heavy-quark (HQ) free energy from the static T-matrix and fitting it to pertinent lattice-QCD (lQCD) data. The corresponding T-matrix is then applied to compute the equation of state (EoS) of the QGP in a two-particle irreducible formalism including the full off-shell properties of the selfconsistent single-parton spectral functions and their two-body interaction. In particular, the <b>skeleton</b> <b>diagram</b> functional is fully resummed to account for emerging bound and scattering states as the critical temperature is approached from above. We find that the solution satisfying three sets of lQCD data (EoS, HQ free energy and quarkonium correlator ratios) is not unique.
