50|$|Calthemite {{is also a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>deposit</b> {{derived from}} concrete, mortar or lime, which can be mistakenly assumed to be efflorescence. Calthemites are usually {{deposited}} as calcite {{which is the most}} stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).|$|E

5000|$|A speleogen is a {{geological}} formation within a cave {{that has been}} created by the removal of bedrock, {{rather than as a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>deposit.</b> They are typically formed in limestone or dolostone solutional caves. The United States Code defines speleogens as [...] "relief features on the walls, ceiling, and floor of any cave or lava tube which are part of the surrounding bedrock, including anastomoses, scallops, meander niches, petromorphs and rock pendants in solution caves and similar features unique to volcanic caves." ...|$|E
50|$|Both {{calcium and}} {{magnesium}} go into solution when dolomite rock is dissolved. The speleothem precipitation sequence is: calcite, Mg-calcite, aragonite, huntite and hydromagnesite. Hence, {{the most common}} speleothem (<b>secondary</b> <b>deposit)</b> in caves within dolomite rock karst, is calcium carbonate in the most stable polymorph form of calcite. Speleothem types known to have a dolomite constituent include: coatings, crusts, moonmilk, flowstone, coralloids, powder, spar and rafts. Although {{there are reports of}} dolomite speleothems known to exist in a number of cave around the world, they are usually in relatively small quantities and form in very fine-grained deposits.|$|E

5000|$|Calthemite is a <b>secondary</b> <b>deposit,</b> {{derived from}} concrete, lime, mortar or other {{calcareous}} material outside the cave environment. Calthemites grow on or under, man-made structures and mimic {{the shapes and}} forms of cave speleothems, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone etc. Calthemite {{is derived from the}} Latin calx (genitive calcis) [...] "lime" [...] + Latin < Greek théma, [...] "deposit" [...] meaning ‘something laid down’, (also Mediaeval Latin thema, [...] "deposit") and the Latin -ita < Greek -itēs - used as a suffix indicating a mineral or rock. The term [...] "speleothem", due to its definition can only be used to describe secondary deposits in caves and does not include secondary deposits outside the cave environment.|$|E
50|$|When {{described}} Azteca eumeces {{was known}} from approximately thirty nine fossil insects which are solitary or group inclusions in transparent chunks of Dominican amber. The amber {{was produced by}} the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola and across northern South America up to southern Mexico. The holotype specimen was collected from Palo Quemado, near Santiago, while the other six amber specimens are from unidentified amber mines in fossil-bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studies of the associated fossil foraminifera and may be {{as old as the}} Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being a <b>secondary</b> <b>deposit</b> for the amber, and the Miocene the age range is only the youngest that it might be.|$|E
5000|$|Within set {{concrete}} {{there remains}} some free [...] "calcium hydroxide" [...] (Ca(OH)2), which can further dissociate to form Ca2+ and hydroxide (OH−) ions". Any water which finds a seepage path through micro cracks and air voids present in concrete, will readily carry the (Ca(OH)2) and Ca2+ (depending on solution pH and chemical reaction at the time) to {{the underside of}} the structure where leachate solution contacts the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere readily diffuses into the leachate and causes a chemical reaction, which precipitates (deposits) calcium carbonate (CaCO3) {{on the outside of the}} concrete structure. Consisting primarily of CaCO3 this <b>secondary</b> <b>deposit</b> derived from concrete is known as [...] "calthemite" [...] and can mimic the shapes and forms of cave [...] "speleothems", such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone etc. Other trace elements such as iron from rusting reinforcing may be transported and deposited by the leachate at the same time as the CaCO3. This may colour the calthemites orange or red.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and <b>secondary.</b> Primary <b>deposits</b> occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. <b>Secondary</b> <b>deposits</b> occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions.

50|$|Rimstone or gours can {{be formed}} by the <b>secondary</b> <b>deposits</b> derived from concrete, lime or mortar. These <b>secondary</b> <b>deposits</b> {{consisting}} primarily of calcium carbonate, are called calthemites and mimics the shapes and forms of cave speleothems to create stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone and gours. Gours form beneath concrete structures on a floor with a gradual sloping surface or {{on the side of}} rounded stalagmites derived from concrete. Most of the calcium carbonate carried by the leachate is deposited as stalactites (when the drop rate is slower than one drop per minute), leaving little in solution to be carried to the ground to create stalagmites, flowstone and gours. The leachate which does reaching the ground, usually evaporates quickly due to air movement beneath the concrete structure, hence micro-gours are more common.|$|R
40|$|Steam {{generator}} (SG) fouling, in {{the form}} of corrosion <b>deposits</b> on the <b>secondary</b> sides of SG tubes, has been known to occur in almost all commercial US nuclear PWR (pressurized water reactor) plants. The level of fouling, as measured by the quantity of corrosion products that form, varies widely from plant to plant. In addition, the effect of SG fouling, as measured by a decrease in effective heat-transfer coefficient, has also varied substantially among commercial US plants. While some have observed large decreases in heat transfer, others have noted little change in performance despite the presence of significant quantities of secondary corrosion layers on their SG tubes. This observation has led to considerable confusion about what role <b>secondary</b> <b>deposits</b> play in causing heat-transfer degradation in SGs. As will become clear later in this report, <b>secondary</b> <b>deposits</b> can have a wide range of effects on heat transfer, from highly resistive to slightly enhancing (reflected by negative fouling). These different behaviors are the result of differences in deposit thickness, composition, and morphology. The main focus of this report is an investigation of the effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>deposits</b> on SG thermal performance. This investigation includes compilation of detailed information on the properties of tube scale at five commercial US nuclear plants and corresponding information characterizing SG thermal performance at these plants...|$|R
