5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique abilities as the game progresses, including abilities needed to <b>solve</b> <b>some</b> puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can smash dirt for banana coins, Chunky Kong can lift rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to <b>solve,</b> <b>some</b> political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

The first proposal called for the Federated Malay States and Unfederated Malay States to be joined into a larger federation styled the Malayan Union. It was expected that Penang and Malacca would be severed from the Straits Settlements to join the new federation while Singapore remained a separate Crown Colony.|$|E
25|$|When {{the campus}} had grown sufficiently, {{land in the}} {{southern}} part of the city was purchases and a new campus built there in 1990. Since then the campus has grown with new programs and new installations. In 2004, the campus and borough authorities signed an agreement to provide online preparatory education open to the public run as a joint venture between ITESM and the borough. The online program is meant to <b>solve</b> <b>some</b> of the problems with providing educational opportunities to the more rural areas of the borough such the communities of Ajusco Medio and Ajusco Alto. In addition, to the online resources, students from the campus can also complete their social service requirement for graduation by tutoring in rural schools in the borough.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 an {{expatriate}} German, Ronald Richter, {{proposed the}} Huemul Project in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. These {{turned out to}} be fake, but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole. In particular, it prompted Lyman Spitzer to begin considering ways to <b>solve</b> <b>some</b> of the more obvious problems involved in confining a hot plasma, and, unaware of the z-pinch efforts, he developed a new solution to the problem known as the stellarator. Spitzer applied to the US Atomic Energy Commission for funding to build a test device. During this period, Jim Tuck who had worked with the UK teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). When he heard of Spitzer's pitch for funding, he applied to build a machine of his own, the Perhapsatron.|$|E

25|$|If the {{manifold}} {{is allowed}} to have boundary, then some restrictions must {{be put on the}} domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain <b>solve</b> <b>some</b> differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the signature operator) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the Atiyah–Patodi–Singer eta invariant. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry, which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten's work on anomalies.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Caporetto in 1917, Italian {{forces were}} forced far back into Italian {{territory}} and the humiliation {{led to the}} arrival of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando as Prime Minister, who managed to <b>solve</b> <b>some</b> of Italy's wartime problems. Orlando abandoned the previous isolationist approach to the war and increased coordination with the Allies {{and the use of the}} convoy system to fend off submarine attack, allowed Italy to be able to end food shortages from February 1918 onward and Italy received more raw materials from the Allies. 1918 also saw the beginning of official repression of enemy aliens and Italian socialists were increasingly repressed by the Italian government. The Italian government was infuriated with the Fourteen Points of Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, as the advocation of national self-determination meant that Italy would not gain Dalmazia as had been promised in the Treaty of London. In the Parliament of Italy, nationalists condemned Wilson's fourteen points as betraying the Treaty of London, while socialists claimed that Wilson's points were valid and claimed the Treaty of London was an offense to the rights of Slavs, Greeks and Albanians. Negotiations between Italy and the Allies, particularly the new Yugoslav delegation (replacing the Serbian delegation), agreed to a trade off between Italy and the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was that Dalmazia, despite being claimed by Italy, would be accepted as Yugoslav, while Istria, claimed by Yugoslavia, would be accepted as Italian.|$|E

The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review {{as part of the}} 6th Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise.

500|$|... {{is one of}} the few Australian artists {{here who}} {{combines}} a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter landscapes in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to <b>solve</b> <b>some</b> of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of [...] "Rough Country", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as caryatids. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.|$|E
