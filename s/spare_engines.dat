5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of <b>spare</b> <b>engines,</b> 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Convair (then still Consolidated-Vultee) {{developed}} streamlined pods, {{looking like}} oversize drop tanks, that were mounted {{on each side}} of the B-36's fuselage to carry <b>spare</b> <b>engines</b> between bases. Each pod could airlift two engines. When the pods were empty, they were removed and carried in the bomb bays. There is no record of the special engine pods ever being used.|$|E

Operating out of 12 fire stations located throughout the city, the HFD is the fifth-largest fire department in Connecticut. Under the command of two Deputy Chiefs in two Districts, the HFD maintains a fire apparatus fleet of eleven engines, five ladders, one tac unit (rescue), one fireboat, one rehab unit, one decon Unit, one foam unit, one fire investigation unit, three Maintenance Units, and numerous other spare apparatus.

50|$|The {{first four}} units, 1101-1104, were {{delivered}} with 1,700-hp EMD 567B engines {{along with a}} <b>spare</b> <b>engine.</b> Having a <b>spare</b> <b>engine</b> was later deemed unnecessary and the fifth 567B engine was thus built into MY 1105. 1106-1144 were delivered with 1,950-hp EMD 567C engines. MY 1145-1159 were delivered with 1,950-hp EMD 567D1 engines. Starting in 1968, the weaker MYs with 567B engines were reclassified as class MV, with the classification following the 567B engines as they were swapped around among the locomotives during maintenance. MY 1149 received a <b>spare</b> 645E <b>engine</b> (as used in class MZ, though with the turbocharger removed) after sustaining severe frost damage in the harsh winter of 1978-79.|$|R

25|$|Tate was {{immediately}} and severely handicapped when the best pilots and 12 aircraft of the airlift went west to Egypt with Brereton on 26 June. Despite {{the use of}} the 1st Ferrying Group, the buildup of the airlift grew very slowly during the summer monsoon. Overuse of the small number of aircraft available, spotty maintenance, and a lack of spare parts led to numerous groundings until overhauls could be effected. In particular the lack of replacement tires and <b>spare</b> <b>engines</b> held down operations even after eight of the C-47s sent to the Middle East returned in August. For {{a short period of time}} engines intended for P-43 fighters of the Chinese Air Force were adapted for use on C-47s but the supply of those proved small.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 1942, German {{military}} units occupied Vichy Air Force bases and seized their aircraft: around 134 Potez 630s of several variants were taken. Of the seized aircraft, 53 were refurbished and dispatched to Romania {{for use as}} trainers and target tugs; <b>spare</b> <b>engines</b> were also reused to power a number of Luftwaffe Henschel Hs 129Bs. Production of the type was resumed under German control; significant numbers of aircraft {{appear to have been}} pressed into service by the Germans, mostly in liaison and training roles. The last three Potez 631s in service were recaptured examples; these made a final contribution following the cessation of hostilities in their use as trainer aircraft at the Centre d'Essais en Vol for the revived French Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} A-7 taking precedence, the PoAF {{continued}} interested in acquiring the F-5 {{for the air}} defense role and as a proper replacement for the F-86F Sabre. As such, a delegation was sent to Norway in July 1979 to evaluate F-5A/B aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF). However, with {{the selection of the}} A-7, it was only in 1982 that new talks took place, with the RNoAF offering the sale of 11 F-5A that would require additional repairs due to cracks found in the airframe. While these fighters were offered at a low price, Portugal would have had to pay for the repairs. Furthermore, the PoAF was particularly interested in twin-seat F-5 fighters, but the RNoAF did not plan on retiring any of its F-5B aircraft. In November 1984, the United States offered four F-5A with <b>spare</b> <b>engines</b> to Portugal, but the latter declined the offer since the aircraft had logged over 3,000 flight hours. In the same year the RNoAF made a new offer of 15 to 20 F-5A/B, but the PoAF declined; since most of the aircraft would have required repairs and the airframes had few flight hours left.|$|E

2500|$|The {{opportunity}} {{to resolve this}} problem presented itself when electrification of the LSWR's suburban network meant a cascade of newer, more powerful designs such as the M7s and T1s into the O2's rural strongholds. As a result, several O2s became surplus to mainland requirements. Two of these <b>spare</b> <b>engines</b> were modified at Eastleigh works, {{with the addition of}} a Westinghouse Air Brake to allow compatibility with the Isle of Wight coaching stock. [...] These two O2s were shipped across the Solent in 1923 and trialed extensively on services across the island, but particularly the intensive Ryde-Ventnor line services, where they proved to be highly successful. Further engines were then shipped across in small batches throughout the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

The 1st Aero Squadron, {{based on the}} same field, had received eight new Curtiss JN2 [...] "Jennies" [...] and <b>spare</b> <b>engines</b> on June 21, but before the squadron could fully flight test the new aircraft it was ordered to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Disassembling and crating the aircraft again, the squadron left San Diego by train on July 26. A section of two aircraft and four pilots was ordered to Brownsville, Texas shortly after its arrival in Oklahoma. [...] Gorrell joined the squadron when it relocated to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, on November 25. As junior officer in the squadron, he was assigned the collateral duties of squadron adjutant and supply officer.|$|E
2500|$|The pending sale of 18 {{fighters to}} Canada {{along with a}} {{possible}} sale of another 70 may be adversely affected by Boeing's actions against competitor Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned. These included a complaint to the U.S. government about Bombardier selling CSeries passenger aircraft to Delta Air Lines at unduly low prices. As a result, in late September 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce proposed a 219% tariff on CSeries aircraft to be imported into the U.S. [...] A final decision on the tariff will be made in spring 2018. Nonetheless, the U.S State Department granted Canada permission on 12 September to buy 10 F/A-18E Advanced Super Hornets and 8 F/A-18F Advanced Super Hornets [...] (or EA-18G Growlers) along with supporting equipment, spare parts, <b>spare</b> <b>engines,</b> and logistics as well as armaments (such as AIM-9X/AIM-120 Missiles and JDAM bombs) for both sets of jets.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{problems}} the investigators thought {{may have been the}} reason of the supposed crash was that the aircraft was carrying a <b>spare</b> <b>engine.</b> Therefore there would have been more weight on one side. This reason was ruled out as the flight recorders relayed information of the rudder position which assists in the carrying of a 5th engine. Carrying a 5th engine helped airlines carry broken engines back to be maintained.|$|R
