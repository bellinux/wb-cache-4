40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{simple and}} practical approaches for controlling {{the complexity of}} neural networks (NN) in order to optimize their generalization ability. Several formal and heuristic methods have been proposed in the literature for improving the performances of NNs. It is of major importance for the user to understand which cf these methods are of practical use and which are the more efficient. We will try here {{to fill the gap}} between specialists of these techniques and the user by presenting and analyzing some methods which we have <b>selected</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> simplicity and efficiency. We will consider only supervised learning...|$|R
40|$|Low power {{electronics}} are an ideal application for organic photovoltaics (OPV) where a low-cost OPV device {{can be integrated}} directly with a battery to provide a constant power source. We demonstrate ultra-high voltage small molecule multijunction devices with open circuit voltage (VOC) values of up to 7 V. Optical modelling is employed to aid the optimisation of the complex multi-layer stacks and ensure current balancing is achieved between sub-cells, and optimised multijunction devices show power conversion efficiencies of up to 3. 4 % which is a modest increase over the single junction devices. Sub-cell donor/acceptor pairs of boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) /fullerene (C 60) and SubPc/Cl 6 -SubPc were <b>selected</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> high VOC in order to minimise the required number of junctions, but also for their absorption overlap to reduce the spectral dependence of the device performance. As a result, the devices are shown to directly charge a micro-energy cell type battery under both low illumination intensity white light and monochromatic illumination...|$|R
2500|$|At 19, he was six-foot {{three and}} an {{imposing}} figure. [...] "A very tall, very dark young man strode through the New College gates. We watched in awe," [...] E.W. Swanton later wrote. A leg-spinner and useful lower-order batsman, {{in his first}} match Bettington took 5 for 48 in Warwickshire's second innings. Alongside him for the Oxford team, also making their first-class debuts, were Douglas Jardine and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow. In his second match he took 5 for 52 in the second innings against Middlesex. In his third match he took 5 for 48 in Essex's second innings, including a hat-trick. In his fourth match he took seven wickets against Free Foresters, in his fifth, 7 for 47 and 5 for 52 against Somerset, and in his sixth, 8 for 67 and 5 for 61 against Surrey. At this stage Oxford had won five consecutive matches. In the next match, a loss to MCC, he took only three wickets, but it brought his first-class wicket tally to 50 in only his seventh match. He was <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> Gentlemen in <b>both</b> <b>their</b> matches. As well as his cricket Blue in 1920 he also won his Rugby Blue and golf Blue.|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} first curated {{collection}} of wild and cultivated African rice species. For that, we designed specific SNPs {{and were able}} to structure these very low diverse species. Oryza glaberrima, the cultivated African rice, is endemic from Africa. This species and its direct ancestor, O. barthii, are valuable tool for improvement of Asian rice O. sativa in terms of abiotic and biotic stress resistance. However, only a few limited studies about the genetic diversity of these species were performed. In the present paper, {{and for the first time}} at such extend, we genotyped 279 O. glaberrima, <b>selected</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> impact in current breeding and for their geographical distribution, and 101 O. barthii, chosen based on their geographic origin, using a set of 235 SNPs specifically designed for African rice diversity. Using those data, we were able to structure the individuals from our sample in three populations for O. barthii, related to geography, and two populations in O. glaberrima; these two last populations cannot be linked however to any currently phenotyped trait. Moreover, we were also able to identify misclassification in O. glaberrima as well as in O. barthii and identified new form of O. sativa from the set of African varieties...|$|R
40|$|The {{rich and}} {{detailed}} "thick descriptions" produced by ethnographers {{have contributed to}} the understanding of human-computer interactions; meanings and cultures of the digital environment; and practices of technology use. Ethnography has traditionally focused on a site, geographically localized community or particular workplaces. However, in an increasingly computer mediated and networked world, ethnographers have had to adapt their methods, their sites of investigation and their objects of analysis. We have many ?shorthands? for these difficulties: distribution, scale, heterogeneous expertises, and multiple membership. Often these difficulties are precisely what our research attempts to address but only rarely do we give ourselves leeway to discuss how they affect our own practice. We have arranged this session to open and encourage discourse on the experiences, approaches and outcomes to ethnographic studies of large-scale systems. The four participants in this interactive panel will recount exemplary approaches in their study of large scale systems. Exemplars told as experiences, stories and narratives, are ideal devices for capturing and conveying the complexities of real world field experiences. These exemplars will serve as the material for an open discussion. Our participants were <b>selected</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> diverse modes of interface with their objects of study and a shared commitment to ethnography and information systems. This includes a range of ?sites? stretching from funding and policy sphere, the activities of design and implementation, to studying actual use of production quality systems...|$|R
40|$|Engagement ??? {{sometimes}} called action research, contribution, or intervention ??? is {{the participation of}} the researcher in the object of study. It is a key contemporary feature in making iSchool research accessible and relevant to broader communities. However, it also presents novel challenges for the traditional academic endeavor. We have many ???shorthands??? for these difficulties: misaligned reward structures, diverging goals, miscommunication across heterogeneous expertises, multiple membership, challenges of multidisciplinary collaboration, or unrealistic expectations on social science. Often these difficulties are precisely what our research attempts to address but only rarely do we give ourselves leeway to discuss how they affect our own practice. We have arranged this session to open and encourage discourse on the experiences, approaches and outcomes of engagement. The core of the presentations will be centered on storytelling. Stories, or narratives, are ideal devices for capturing and conveying the complexities of real world field experiences. The four participants in this interactive panel will recount exemplary narratives of their engagement at the intersections of social research, information studies and domain sciences. These stories will serve as the material for an open discussion. Our participants were <b>selected</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> diverse modes of interface with their objects of study and a shared commitment to engaging social /information/domain science. This includes a range of activities stretching from policy recommendations, to participant observation or contributions to technology design; from distanced roles such as ???shrink wrapped??? consulting, to long view historical studies, to becoming a daily members and ???stakeholders??? in the success of projects...|$|R
