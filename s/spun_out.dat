5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} time sheets in Saturday's free {{practice}} session, with Sebastian Vettel {{a tenth of}} a second behind, while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four. Few cars took to the track during {{the early part of the}} session due to high temperatures and strong winds. A brief red flag period occurred midway through practice when Daniil Kvyat <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> in turn four.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} session on Saturday was run without spectators {{to ensure their}} safety. On track, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, ahead of his closest championship rival Sebastian Vettel. With conditions worsening {{over the course of}} the session, Vettel <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> twice. Max Verstappen ended the session last, while Force India's Nico Hülkenberg was third, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Sainz.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow climb back up the field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> and retired with a gearbox problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, to sit in 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping from third to ninth, one position outside of the points.|$|E
5|$|Green flag pit stops {{began on}} the 152nd lap; Kenseth made his pit stop on the same lap. Johnson and Biffle made a pit stop the next lap, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon. After pit stops, Biffle {{reclaimed}} the first position. On lap 157, Elliott Sadler <b>spun</b> <b>out,</b> causing the second caution. None of the leaders elected to pit under the caution. The race restarted on lap 162 with Biffle in the lead, ahead of Kenseth and Jeff Gordon. By the 190th lap, Biffle's lead was three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In Q2, lap times {{improved}} {{and the two}} Mercedes drivers led the way, with Rosberg {{a little over a}} tenth of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Fernando Alonso went faster than Valtteri Bottas and looked to make it into Q3, when Max Verstappen went faster and eliminated the McLaren driver. Also not in the top ten were both Lotus and the second McLaren of Jenson Button. Conditions soon worsened, preventing faster lap times. Many drivers <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> {{in the latter part of}} the session, complaining about aquaplaning.|$|E

5|$|The season did {{not start}} well when Hill <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> of second place shortly {{after the start of}} the South African Grand Prix and failed to finish the race after colliding with Alex Zanardi on lap 16. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Hill {{qualified}} and spent {{the early stages of the}} race running second behind Prost, and then took the lead when Prost crashed out, but was relegated back to second by another triple world champion, Ayrton Senna. Nevertheless, the race still gave Hill his first podium finish.|$|E
5|$|On lap 206, Martin's car {{suffered}} {{a flat tire}} and the fourth caution was given as a result. Bowyer led on the restart, although he was passed by Stewart within one lap. On lap 213, Hamlin spun sideways, prompting the fifth caution. Despite remaining undamaged, Hamlin fell from fourth to twenty-second position. Stewart led on the restart, as Jeff Gordon claimed second from Bowyer. By lap 221, a sixth caution came out as Kurt Busch, Johnson, and Kyle Busch all spun sideways. After the accident, Johnson fell to twenty-fourth; Stewart maintained his lead on the restart. Five laps later, Matt Kenseth <b>spun</b> <b>out,</b> causing the seventh caution. Stewart led the drivers back to the green flag, but was overtaken by McMurray one lap later.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E

5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session on Friday afternoon, with Räikkönen the only driver to lap the course in less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson Button <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the firstround of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap {{race was}} won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after {{starting}} from second position. David Coulthard {{finished second in}} a Williams, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> while leading on lap30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later {{found to be a}} suspension failure. Schumacher's win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component changes {{for the rest of the}} event. Despite Schumacher's victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race, and seemed to be on course for a comfortable victory before his sudden retirement.|$|E
5|$|The school began {{replacing}} its Tiger Moths with CAC Wackett Trainers in January 1942. No.11 EFTS absorbed No.3 EFTS's instructors, {{students and}} Wackett Trainers in April, {{shortly before the}} latter unit disbanded. The same month at Benalla, thirty-two United States Army Air Corps pilots undertook four weeks of flying in the Wacketts. On 5September 1942, one of the Wacketts crashed after apparently stalling on takeoff, killing the trainee and seriously injuring the pilot. The Wackett Trainers were taken out of service for upgrades in February 1943, and the school again began operating Tiger Moths. One pilot was killed and another seriously injured when their Tiger Moths collided shortly after takeoff on 15June. On 7July, one of the Tiger Moths crashed during a night-flying exercise just east of Benalla, killing both pilots. Another Tiger Moth and its pilot were lost in a crash west of Benalla on 20October 1943. On 14May 1944, a pilot was killed and a trainee seriously injured when their Tiger Moth <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> of control during an instrument test north of Benalla.|$|E
5|$|Sharing {{agreements}} {{may also}} be used as a loophole to control television stations in situations where it is legally impossible to own them outright. For instance, FCC regulations only allow a single company to own more than one full-powered television station in a given market if there are at least eight distinct station owners, and also prohibits the ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations (based on total day viewership) in a market. An LMA or similar agreement does not affect the ownership of the station's license, meaning that they do not require the approval of the FCC to establish, and the two stations are still legally considered separate operations from a licensing standpoint. Both Tribune Media and the Gannett Company were required to use shared services agreements as a similar loophole to take control of certain stations in their respective 2013 purchases of Local TV and Belo, as they did not have exemptions to the FCC's newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in the affected markets. Both companies have since <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> their publishing arms as independent companies; the Tribune Publishing Company and Gannett Company. Tegna, who holds the former Gannett's broadcasting and digital media properties, re-acquired the licenses for most of the affected stations following the split.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 Daytona 500 {{is known}} for the final lap battle between Pearson and Petty. In 2007, ESPN rated the race as the fourth most {{interesting}} Daytona 500. Petty was leading Pearson going into the last lap {{by a couple of}} car lengths. Pearson used the draft to attempt a slingshot pass against Petty {{at the end of the}} back stretch on the last lap, but his car pushed high into the final turn while going around another car. Petty edged under Pearson, and their cars crashed into each other on the frontstretch in the final turns. They both <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> into the infield grass approximately 100 feet (30 meters) short of the finish line. Benny Parsons who was driving the third place car, was over a lap behind the disabled cars. With Petty unable to restart his car, Pearson slowly drove his Wood Brothers Mercury over the grassy infield past the finish line for his only Daytona 500 victory. He won a series-best ten races in 1976, but finished ninth in season points after competing in only 22 of 30 events. He won his only IROC race at the first race of IROC III in 1975/1976 at Michigan International Speedway and finished fifth in points.|$|E
