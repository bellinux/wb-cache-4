5|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is a {{pinball game}} {{developed}} by Jupiter, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, {{and was released}} {{in the same year}} – on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is based on Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and is a sequel to Pokémon Pinball for the Game Boy Color. In <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping the ball in play as long as possible and hitting bumpers. In keeping with the theme of Pokémon, it features Pokémon collection, where while the players play pinball, they must also capture the eponymous creatures.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} law tracts that {{originated}} {{from the church}} were written in Old Irish. The most famous of these is Cáin Adomnáin, which was apparently created in 697 {{under the influence of}} Adomnán and ratified by a number of ecclesiasts and kings whose names appear in the text. The idea of the law was apparently to supplement the punishments of Brehon law for crimes against women, children, and clerics. In <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> follows the ideas embodied in Brehon law although there are differences; for instance, it uses capital punishment, which Brehon law avoids.|$|E

25|$|York's hostile {{attitude}} toward the Council's surrender of the French province of Maine, in return for {{an extension of the}} truce with France and a French bride for Henry, must have contributed to his appointment on 30 July 1447 as Lieutenant of Ireland. In <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was a logical appointment, as Richard was also Earl of Ulster and had considerable estates in Ireland, {{but it was also a}} convenient way (for his enemies at court) of removing him from both England and France. His term of office was for ten years, ruling him out of consideration for any other high office during that period.|$|E
25|$|Number {{theory is}} {{the theory of}} the {{positive}} integers. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and congruence. Its fundamental theorem states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding automorphic forms, which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.|$|E

[...] "That was when Tech began actively encouraging faculty, staff and students to be entrepreneurial...

[...] Historian David Szatmary writes that the timing of the rebellion [...] "convinced the elites of sovereign states that the proposed gathering at Philadelphia must take place."

500|$|Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller {{was born}} on November 30, 1965 in New York City.

While the family was [...] "never very religious", they celebrated both Hanukkah and Christmas, and Stiller had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony. His parents frequently took him on the sets of their appearances, including The Mike Douglas Show when he was six. He considered his childhood unusual, stating [...] "In <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> was a show-business upbringing—a lot of traveling, a lot of late nights—not what you'd call traditional." [...] His elder sister, Amy, has appeared in many of his productions, including Reality Bites, , and Zoolander.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Carr, an {{academic}} and practising lawyer, called {{the implementation of}} Section 1 [...] "slightly awkward", suggesting that in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was more limited than the provisions contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1893 from the seller's point of view. Unlike with the 1893 Act, a seller cannot exclude the provisions, and while the right to sell can be excluded {{it is not clear}} how this might be done. Turpin complimented the section on hire-purchase agreements, although noting some flaws in draftsmanship; he also questioned whether or not the protection given to consumers would be sufficient. Prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was one of the few limitations on clauses in consumer contracts. Most of it was eventually superseded by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the Act's provisions.|$|E

500|$|Talking to Nashville Scene, Lewis {{said that}} the songs [...] "weren't written off-the-cuff, but they were {{definitely}} recorded, not carelessly, but with a real effort to capture a live feeling, particularly with the vocals". Lewis continued, [...] "To me, it's a big step in a different direction...and {{to be able to}} sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me." [...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, so we knew that we could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record in <b>some</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>It</b> was about getting the band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could." [...] As [...] "a child of digital generation", Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools, but wanted to capture the [...] "not-perfect sound" [...] of some of her favorite records.|$|E
500|$|The Crusaders' {{winning run}} {{finally came to}} an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, [...] "...in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could stop talking about it and we could get on with playing it week by week." [...] The Crusaders {{recovered}} to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E
