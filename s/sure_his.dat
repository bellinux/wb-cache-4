5|$|Carleton {{addressed}} the weak {{points of the}} town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along {{the walls and the}} inner defenses; and he made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.|$|E
5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing {{by a few}} feet. During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went to use the toilet during the ninth inning. While he was off the field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher to make <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} Stranger {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E
60|$|In {{his long}} {{ride to the}} city he assured himself in vain {{that he was doing}} right if he was not <b>sure</b> of <b>his</b> {{feelings}} towards the girl. It was quite because he was not <b>sure</b> of <b>his</b> feeling that he could not be sure he was not acting falsely and cruelly.|$|R

5|$|In {{the space}} of six days, Galland's friend, Steinhoff was badly burned in a crash on 18 April, and then, on 24 April, his friend Lützow was posted missing. On 21 April, Galland was {{credited}} with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 103rd and last Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. On 26 April, Galland claimed his 103rd and 104th aerial victories against B-26s, escorted by the 27th Fighter Group and 50th Fighter Group. Galland again made a mistake; he stopped to make <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> second victory was going to crash and {{he was hit by}} a USAAF P-47 Thunderbolt piloted by James Finnegan. Galland nursed his crippled Me 262 to the airfield, only to find it was under attack by more P-47s. Galland landed under fire and abandoned his jet on the runway. The battle was his last operational mission. Soon afterward, he was sent to hospital for a knee wound sustained during his last mission. The Americans lost four B-26s and another six damaged. In return two Me 262s were shot down: the other pilot surviving.|$|E

25|$|The lack of top-class facilities, though, didn't {{diminish}} his hunger or ambition. Despite not {{breaking through}} to the national team earlier, Babar made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> name {{was always in the}} reckoning by consistently being among the wickets.|$|E

25|$|Warbucks angrily kicks {{him into}} a vase (leaving an imprint of his shoe on his backside) while berating him again for his brazen interfering, and he storms out the door, smashing the windows. He vows that when he and Annie returned, {{there would be some}} major changes made, and he made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> nasty wife knew that loud and clear.|$|E
25|$|He takes a {{rickshaw}} to the Ayakura villa, and, making <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> {{mother has}} left, sends for Tadeshina. Astonished, she takes {{him to an}} obscure boarding-house in Kasumicho where he threatens to show Satoko's last letter (which he tore up) to Prince Toin if she does not arrange a meeting. Three days later, {{he returns to the}} boarding-house and encounters Satoko; they make love; to Tadeshina's despair, he demands another encounter.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} change of {{government}} in Samarra brought the expedition to a premature conclusion. The ascension of al-Musta'in could not be ignored indefinitely by Wasif; having already missed {{the opportunity to play}} a role in the selection of the new caliph, he needed to make <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> interests back in the capital were protected. As a result, he decided to abandon the Byzantine front, and by 863 he was back in Samarra.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{many members}} of the University of Florida’s History Department, Zieger’s {{teaching}} style was very student oriented. He used a very detailed website that allows people taking his class to fully understand every single day of lecture. Also, he was adamant about making <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> undergraduates come prepared to discuss the material to be covered in class. This has twofold benefit, as it not only ensures preparation, but also allows students to boost their grade with frequent quizzes covering the reading material.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} they {{recorded}} the Subject to Change EP – which was first released in late 1983, shortly after they disbanded – The Faith had adopted a more melodic and emotional approach, perhaps owing to {{the addition of a}} second guitar player. The two guitars together seem to chime, creating an unusual – for hardcore – sense of melody. And instead of employing hardcore's usual strangled bark, Alec MacKaye makes <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> words are clear and easy to discern: The Faith's musicality often trumps their rage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{traditional}} {{element of}} the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems before their entry into the headquarters. Mishima planned his suicide meticulously {{for at least a}} year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members had any indication of what he was planning. His biographer, translator John Nathan, suggests that the coup attempt was only a pretext for the ritual suicide of which Mishima had long dreamed. Mishima made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> affairs were in order and left money for the legal defense of the three surviving Tatenokai members.|$|E

60|$|Laughter lurked in {{the mouth}} corners and eye-corners, and there were cheek lines about the mouth {{that would seem to}} have been formed by laughter. Equally strong, however, every line of the face that meant blended things carried a notice of surety. Dick Forrest was sure-- <b>sure,</b> when <b>his</b> hand reached out for any object on his desk, that the hand would {{straightly}} attain the object without a fumble or a miss of a fraction of an inch; <b>sure,</b> when <b>his</b> brain leaped the high places of the hog cholera text, that it was not missing a point; <b>sure,</b> from <b>his</b> balanced body in the revolving desk-chair to the balanced back-head of him; sure, in heart and brain, of life and work, of all he possessed, and of himself.|$|R
25|$|Hart and Mould {{were the}} band's songwriters. Both wrote their songs {{separately}} {{and at a}} prodigious pace; in later years, Hart accused Mould of making <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> songs comprised no more than 45 percent of the material on an album. They designed their logo to represent their common train of thought, a circle enclosing three parallel horizontal lines with a vertical line connecting them. The circle symbolized the band: the three lines were the individual members, and the intersecting line was the common thread of creativity which connected them.|$|E
25|$|His {{first job}} as king was to retake Sagaing where {{his sister and}} her lover {{had been trying to}} revive the old Sagaing Kingdom. His forces easily retook Sagaing. Over the next few months, he was able to use {{diplomacy}} to persuade the southern vassals, whom Thado Minbya could not conquer militarily, to acknowledge him as king. That Gov. Saw Yan Naung of Prome and Gov. Theinkhathu Saw Hnaung of Sagu were his elder brother and brother-in-law, respectively, may have helped. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>his</b> authority was nominal: Pyanchi I of Toungoo offered nominal allegiance to Ava only because he himself was consolidating his power at Toungoo, and would later attempt to revolt.|$|E
25|$|Johnson was {{fortunate}} in finding talented men to staff his administration. Police Chief Frederick Kohler, a stubborn, incorruptible martinet, gained national renown {{for cleaning up}} and professionalizing the force, and clamping down on vice. While laws were strictly enforced, Kohler made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> men went easy on young first offenders and honest citizens in trouble. City Solicitor Newton D. Baker led the successful fight for 'Home Rule', working to give Cleveland a charter that would allow it greater independence from state oversight; Baker's efforts would pay off in 1912, when he wrote the amendment to the state constitution that brought full Home Rule to all Ohio's cities. Both Baker and Kohler would become mayors in their own right, continuing Johnson's policies, and Baker later served as Secretary of War under Woodrow Wilson.|$|E

25|$|The {{expedition}} {{gathered at}} Plymouth, England on 14 September 1585 with Sir Francis Drake {{in command of}} twenty one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. Sailing from Plymouth he first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. Drake however intended {{this to be a}} diversionary raid where it was hoped to trick the Spanish to think they were not heading towards the Caribbean, by doing this he had already made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> presence was felt at Las Palmas in the Canary islands. After taking on water from the undefended La Gomera island, he continued his voyage, heading south towards the former Portuguese Cape Verde Islands. By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and the commencement of war with Spain, Portuguese colonies and ships were now a target for the English.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the assets}} the Custodian {{controlled}} only became clear over the next year. Late in 1918, Palmer reported he was managing almost 30,000 trusts with assets worth $500 million. He estimated that another 9,000 trusts worth $300 million awaited evaluation. Many of the enterprises in question produced materials significant to the war effort, such as medicines, glycerin for explosives, charcoal for gas masks. Others ranged from mines to brewing to newspaper publishing. Palmer built a team of professionals with banking expertise {{as well as an}} investigative bureau to track down well-hidden assets. Below the top-level positions, he distributed jobs as patronage. For example, he appointed one of his fellow members of the Democratic National Committee to serve as counsel for a textile company and another the vice-president of a shipping line. Always thinking like a politician, he made <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> group's efforts were well publicized.|$|E
25|$|To be <b>sure,</b> <b>his</b> reforms {{could not}} {{and did not}} achieve {{everything}} overnight. The spread of Theravada Buddhism in Upper Burma was gradual; it took over three centuries. Its monastic system did not achieve widespread village level penetration in more remote areas until as late as 19th century. Nor did the Aris die out. Their descendants, known as forest dwelling monks, remained a powerful force patronized by the royalty down to the Ava period in the 16th century. Likewise, the nat worship continued (down to the present day). Even the Theravada Buddhism of Anawrahta, Kyansittha and Manuha was one still strongly influenced by Hinduism when compared to later more orthodox (18th and 19th century) standards. Tantric, Saivite, and Vaishnava elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they would later do, reflecting both the relative immaturity of early Burmese literacy culture and its indiscriminate receptivity to non-Burman traditions. Indeed, even today's Burmese Buddhism contains many animist, Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu elements.|$|E

60|$|When {{the list}} was read he objected {{to two or three}} names--only to two or three. They were not those of staunch enemies of the Government; nor did he propose in their places the names of staunch supporters. He {{suggested}} certain gentlemen who, from their acquaintance with bridges, tolls, rivers, &c., would, as he said, be probably of use. He, also, was <b>sure</b> of <b>his</b> men, and as he succeeded with two of them, he was also pretty <b>sure</b> of <b>his</b> committee.|$|R
