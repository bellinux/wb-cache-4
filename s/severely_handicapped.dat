Torpedoes were sensitive and highly costly in production terms. The weather conditions off enemy coasts made their use more complicated and the depth of the water was considered too shallow. It was also uneconomical to use the weapon against low-tonnage shipping, Coastal Command's main target. Aside from that, the Beaufort torpedo-bomber was being posted overseas from August 1941 onwards.|$|E

Overuse of the small number of aircraft available, spotty maintenance, and a lack of spare parts led to numerous groundings until overhauls could be effected.

This feat was all the more extraordinary because owing to a serious groin strain Jackson bowled at only medium pace for most of the season. Jackson was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1959, then took a further 140 wickets in 1959 (being the first to reach 100), and then 160 at 13.61 in 1960.

Assuming command of a composite unit of Army and Marine service and headquarters elements totalling approximately 250 men, during a critical stage in the vital defense of the strategically important military base at Hagaru-ri, Major Myers immediately initiated a determined and aggressive counterattack against a well-entrenched and clearly concealed enemy force numbering an estimated 4,000. <b>Severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> by a lack of trained personnel and experienced leaders in his valiant efforts to regain maximum ground prior to daylight, he persisted in constantly exposing himself to intense, accurate and sustained hostile fire in order to direct and supervise the employment of his men and to encourage and spur them on in pressing the attack. Inexorably moving forward up the steep, snow-covered slope with his depleted group in the face of apparently insurmountable odds, he concurrently directed artillery and mortar fire with superb skill and, although losing 170 of his men during fourteen hours of raging combat in sub-zero temperatures, continued to reorganize his unit and spearhead the attack which resulted in 600 enemy killed and 500 wounded. By his exceptional and valorous leadership throughout, Major Myers contributed directly to the success of his unit in restoring the perimeter.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the prevalence of malocclusion and treatment needs in transfusion dependent β-thalassemia major children. Methods One hundred transfusion dependent β-thalassemia major children visiting the Department of Pediatrics were selected randomly and evaluated for malocclusion with Angle’s classification and Dewey’s modification. The orthodontic treatment needs were also assessed using Grainger’s treatment priority index (TPI). The orthodontic treatment needs were compared to normal children. Results The assessment of treatment needs revealed a higher prevalence of <b>handicapping</b> and <b>severely</b> <b>handicapping</b> malocclusion in thalassemic children compared to normal children. The thalassemic patients were found to show significantly more Angle’s Class II malocclusion (55  % vs. 15. 7  %) when compared to normal children. Conclusions The higher prevalence of Angle’s Class II malocclusion and definitive malocclusion in thalassemic children indicates the importance of preventive orthodontic procedures and efforts towards providing orthodontic treatment to these children...|$|R
