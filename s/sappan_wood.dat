30|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the fatty acids produced by lipase activity from P. acnes resulted in inflammation owing to neutrophil chemotaxis [30]. A decline in free fatty acids caused by lipase inhibition is associated with a decrease in the growth of P. acnes [31]. Natural inhibitors of lipase such as flavonoids were reported as promising candidates for acne treatment [32]. In addition, therapeutic agents for acne-like antibiotics are usually employed to inhibit inflammation or kill the bacteria. Several reports also suggest that in case of tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin, several side effects were observed such as appearance of resistant bacteria, organ damage and immunohypersensitivity if they are taken for a long time [33]. In the present study, lipase inhibitory activity of isolated compounds was also evaluated. The results in Table  1 revealed that gallic acid and terchebulin have anti-lipase activity with IC 50 value of 149.3 and 260.7  μM, respectively. Previously, inhibitory activities of kaempferol and glycyrrhizic acid on P. acnes lipase has been reported and their IC 50 (240 – 340  μM) were evaluated as being fairly high lipase inhibitors [32]. In comparison with the above, this study has indicated that inhibitory level of terchebulin is less than gallic acid; however, it is still in the range of natural inhibitor of lipase. These results are in contradiction to that of Patil et al. [28] who stated that gallic acid did not inhibit lipase activity of P. acnes (with IC 50 > 5, 000  μM); furthermore, he mentioned that T. chebula fruit extract showed significant inhibition of lipase activity (IC 50  =  60  μM). Various studies support our results that gallic acid possess anti-lipase activity but specifically for pancreatic lipase [34]. Makihara et al. [35] concluded that gallic acid is the active ingredient of T. bellirica fruits that causes pancreatic lipase inhibition. Although several enzymatic activities are affected by ellagitannin-related compounds and could be influenced by the number and orientation of the galloyl group [20], it was a surprise for us to report that gallic acid alone could have high activity. This inhibition of lipase by this compound might be due to the binding of the substrate or the interaction with enzyme. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the mechanism of inhibition induced by these compounds. The IC 50 values of flavogallonic acid dilactone and ellagic acid were (534.80 and 832.59  μM, respectively). Although tetracycline is a potent antimicrobial agent, it has inhibitory activity against P. acnes lipase and is used as positive control [22, 28]. Tetracycline has low lipase inhibitory activity (883.3  μM) as compared to gallic acid, terchebulin and flavogallonic acid dilactone. Previously Batubara et al. [22] also reported that brazilin isolated from Caesalpinia <b>sappan</b> L. <b>wood</b> had strong lipase inhibition than tetracycline. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the anti-lipase activity of terchebulin and flavogallonic acid dilactone has been investigated.|$|R

The extract of Evodia Fruit caused the most dramatic decrease in residual CYP 3 A 4 activity (i. e. 22. 3 % residual activity after 30 min preincubation). A substantial decrease in residual CYP 3 A 4 activity was also observed from extracts of <b>Sappan</b> <b>Wood,</b> Incised Notopterygium Rhizome, Schisandra Fruit, Great Burdock Achene, Angelica Dahurica Root and Rhubarb (residual activity of 40. 6, 41. 2, 53. 4, 47. 1, 53. 4 and 59. 2 % after 30 min preincubation, respectively). These results are comparable to those using troleandomycin, a known irreversible inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, which gave a residual activity of 49. 4 % under identical conditions. 26 種の生薬のシトクロムP 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4) 及び 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) に対する阻害作用を調べた。生薬エキス粉末から調製されたメタノール可溶性画分をNADPH生成系存在下, ヒト肝ミクロソームとプレインキュベーションした後のCYP 3 A 4 の残存活性(erythromycin N-demethylation活性) とCYP 2 D 6 の残存活性(dextromethorphan O-demethylation活性) を測定した。その結果, 16 種の生薬がCYP 3 A 4 活性をプレインキュベーション時間依存的に低下させた。中でも, 呉茱萸によるCYP 3 A 4 活性の低下作用が最も顕著であった(30 分間プレインキュベーションした後の活性の残存率は 22. 3 %) 。次いで, 蘇木, 羌活, 五味子, 牛蒡子, 白止, 大黄が顕著な低下を示した(30 分間プレインキュベーションした後の活性の残存率は, それぞれ 40. 6, 41. 2, 53. 4, 47. 1, 53. 4, 59. 2 %) 。これら 7 種生薬によるCYP 3 A 4 活性低下作用は, CYP 3 A 4 に対する不可逆的阻害剤であるtroleandomycinによる残存率(49. 4 %) に匹敵した。CYP 2 D 6 活性に対してプレインキュベーション時間依存的な活性の低下を示した生薬は, 5 種であった。最もCYP 2 D 6 活性の低下作用が大きかった生薬は, 羌活であり, 30 分間プレインキュベーションした後の活性の残存率は 61. 9 %であった。以上の結果から, 呉茱萸, 蘇木, 羌活, 五味子, 牛蒡子, 白止, 大黄等の複数の生薬エキス中に, CYP 3 A 4 に対するmetabolism-dependent inhibitorが含まれていることが示唆された。relation: isVersionOf: [URL] Century COE Program Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical Universit...|$|E
