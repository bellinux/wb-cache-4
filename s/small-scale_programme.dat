40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that, under certain conditions, student-centred and <b>small-scale</b> course <b>programmes</b> result in more academic success. The present study investigates these conditions in further detail. It is examined whether, in comparison to a course programme that is relatively more lecture-based, a student-centred course programme promotes academic success to a larger extent when students’ experience of these environments is positive, when they show high levels of effort and engagement and spend more time studying. Four hundred seventy-five first-year business administration students from a course programme relatively student-centred and a course programme relatively lecture-based participated in the study. The students completed a questionnaire on experiences, student attitude and time spent studying. Academic success data were obtained from student administration offices. Analyses of variance and linear structural modelling {{analyses were conducted to}} answer the research questions. Results show that in the relatively student-centred course programme, feeling at home affected effort as well as engagement. Effort was related to the time spent studying as well as academic success [credits and grade point average (GPA) ]. Similarly, in the more lecture-based course programme, feeling at home affected effort and engagement. In this case, effort affects time spent studying which in turn affected academic success in terms of GPA. There are a number of differences between the models: time spent studying, effort and feeling at home seem to play different roles in the student-centred course programme compared to the course programme that is relatively lecture-based. The process that explains academic success in student-centred and <b>small-scale</b> course <b>programmes</b> is different compared to the process in more traditional lecture-based course programmes...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} human disease prevalences are {{supported}} by host-parasite-environment interactions. One such disease is schistosomiasis. Schistosoma parasites are transmitted between the snail intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts in an aquatic environment. This host-environment link determines the parasite transmission dynamics and is a route through which control of transmission can be achieved. Transmission control methods based on manipulating the host-environment link were reviewed, the limitations of each method were highlighted and conditions in which they {{may be used in}} <b>small-scale</b> control <b>programmes</b> in sub-Saharan Africa were suggested. Chemical control may be ideal in poor rural communities, where health education strategies have little impact and where fishing is not an important livelihood strategy, because human contact with contaminated water is necessary for parasite survival. In aquaculture and other water development project areas, biocontrol may yield positive results due to reduced predation on snail predators and competitors as a result of restricted access. Environmental modification may be ideal in man-made systems, where the planning phase includes appropriate engineering works. Control strategies must be based as much on the ecology of host snails as on social aspects of the affected community, and be implemented on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

40|$|SETTING: In {{the first}} 2 {{years of the}} East Timor National TB Control Programme, 7960 new {{patients}} were treated (2 RHZE/ 6 HE) and 224 received a retreatment regimen (2 SRHZE/ 1 RHZE/ 4 R 3 H 3 Z 3 E 3). OBJECTIVE: To determine {{the nature and extent}} of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in treatment failure cases in East Timor. METHODS: Sputum specimens from retreatment failure cases were processed and inoculated into a BACTEC MGIT 960 tube and onto Löwenstein-Jensen media. Isolates were identified by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, hybridisation with nucleic acid probes and biochemical investigations. Susceptibility testing was performed using the radiometric proportion method. Pyrazinamide testing was performed using the Wayne indirect method. RESULTS: Eighteen patients failed retreatment (0. 7 % of new cases) and 14 were available for analysis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from all specimens, despite considerable transport delays. Nine (64. 3 %) had multiple drug resistance (MDR-TB) and four (28. 6 %) had other drug resistance. All MDR-TB isolates were susceptible to amikacin, capreomycin and ethionamide, with most also susceptible to ciprofloxacin and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). CONCLUSIONS: An excellent TB control programme has been established in East Timor. If funds are available, East Timor provides an ideal setting for a <b>small-scale</b> DOTS-Plus <b>programme</b> to treat prevalent cases of MDR-TB, and this study could inform the second-line drug regimen...|$|R

The evaluation methods included interviews with trained birth attendants and the analysis of health service statistics and survey data. The findings showed that the programme had been moderately successful in imparting knowledge and overcoming cultural inhibitions about assisted deliveries. However, the effective-ness of the programme was severely curtailed by structural deficits in the health system, especially lack of skilled staff, supervision and transport. In deprived {{areas such as the}} Sahel, it is probably the health centre, the hospital and the referral system that should be the first priority for improvement, rather than grass-roots practices. Outside the industrialized countries it is still common for babies to be delivered by village birth attendants or family members. The shift towards primary health care in the 1970 s stressed the benefits of home deliveries and led to the introduction of training courses for traditional birth attendants in most devel-oping countries, with variable results.

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} broad ranging {{overview}} of Adult Christian Education, approached {{from the standpoint}} of the facilitation of Understanding. We introduce nine questions central to this subject, and these form the thesis' overall structure and content. Continuous interaction is made with educationalists currently working in A. C. E., especially in the United States. We interact especially with J. M. Lee and T. H. Groome. Chapter I. l considers the nature of God's activity in A. C. E. programmes; and seeks to justify a moderate interventionist model of revelation; against M. Wiles particularly. Chapter I. 2 propounds a matrix of twelve Aims possible in A. C. E. Our overall definition of A. C. E. focuses on Discipleship and Maturity (L. O. Richards). Chapter II. 1 focuses on the content of A. C. E. We here concentrate upon Christian doctrine, illustrated in the Ascension. Detailed exegesis of the Ascension texts highlights the work of G. Lohfink. Chapter II. 2 addresses the nature of the person being educated. Drawing on D. Cairns, J. Macquarrie we discuss the nature of the Imago Dei, and education into the Imago Christi. Chapter II. 3 offers extensive justification for hermeneutical theory forming the underlying dynamic for learning theory pertinent to A. C. E. In dialogue initially with Heidegger, Bultmann and Gadamer we construct a model for A. C. E. with power to promote interpretative ability, and application of faith to daily life. A special place is reserved for the Holy Spirit's educative role. We utilize Narrative Theology as a powerful and practical hermeneutical bridge. (D. E. Miller) Chapter III features a particular <b>small-scale</b> educational <b>programme</b> carried out in a Church setting, using the model developed in Chapters I. II. The thesis concludes by re-emphasizing the multifaceted dimensions of A. C. E. necessary in order to be adequate to both Christian tradition and experience. Teaching that facilitates the release of students towards their own "meaning making" is far more demanding than traditionally required in education which transmits predetermined content. This is because of the teacher's need to understand in depth both the subject material (for hermeneutically distanced understanding) and his students (for hermeneutical fusion of horizons) ...|$|R

Both tagging programmes known as the Indian Ocean Tuna Tagging Project (IOTTP), targeted three main species of tuna commercially exploited in the Indian Ocean: bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares). The two programmes tagged 219, 149 tuna and 34, 294 recaptures were reported to the commission. This study focused on tuna behaviour in the Indian Ocean looking at seasonal impacts, inter-annual variability in relation to ocean environment, survival estimates, movement patterns, size-groups and school-type: Free Schools (FS) and Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Using a multivariate approach, {{it was found that}} the years 2005 to 2007 were most abundant in recoveries of skipjack adults (77. 45 %) while yellowfin adults were mainly abundant during 2008 to 2011. It also showed that year and zone were significant factors influencing local abundance in tuna. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves enabled estimates on the longevity of the three species to be made. It was estimated that the cohorts (99 %) vanished at 12, 5. 8 and 10 years for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin, respectively. The years 2006 (cold-productive phase) and 2007 (warmchlorophyll depleted phase) showed tuna movement patterns changing with an El Ni˜no event and primary productivity. Tuna tagged in the Tanzanian region, showed that those under FADs moved pre-dominantly towards the Somalian and Seychelles waters, while those in FS moved to the Seychelles and Mozambique waters. General Additive Model (GAM) analyses showed that the area bounded by 5 ⁰N- 5 ⁰S and 45 ⁰- 55 ⁰E was the main tag recovery regions for tuna under FADs. While in FS, the core recovery region was observed to be from 0 ⁰N- 10 ⁰S and 50 ⁰- 60 ⁰E. Recoveries were distributed in the temperature range 25 - 29 ⁰C.

40|$|Between 1982 and 1984 six new {{stations}} were opened on passenger railways in West Yorkshire whilst additional sites were being considered. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to assess and evaluate demand at the six existing and up to 28 potential new stations in West Yorkshire. This involved three inter-related strands of research. Firstly, market research was carried out at the six new stations opened and was particularly useful in determining the proportions of travellers generated and abstracted. Secondly, statistical models, based on aggregate simultaneous and disaggregate mode split structures, were developed and their forecasting abilities assessed. In this part of our work a subsidiary aim emerged; namely to assess the trade-off between complexity and accuracy in modelling new station demand. Thirdly, an evaluation framework, using one set of demand forecasts, was developed, {{taking into account the}} costs and benefits to Public Transport operators, new station users and society as a whole. It was found that the six new stations opened in West Yorkshire may be judged a success in both financial and social terms, whilst up to 10 sites were identified as representing good social investments. In terms of our subsidiary aim it was found that, given limited resources, simple modelling approaches, such as provided by an aggregate simultaneous model, may be preferable to more complex approaches when evaluating <b>small-scale</b> new station <b>programmes.</b> Our findings are shown to have implications beyond West Yorkshire as simple guide lines for new station site identification and evaluation have been determined. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{scavenging}} village {{chicken is}} important to millions of smallholders in Ethiopia, as in other less-economically developed countries, for its contribution to the economic, nutritional and social well-being of farmers, especially women and children. Infectious diseases are frequently cited as the greatest constraint to village chicken production, and in Ethiopia, most mortality is attributed to seasonal outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND). This study conducted four cross-sectional surveys over an 18 -month period in two geographically distinct regions of Ethiopia, to examine a range of bacterial, viral and parasitic infections in randomly-selected village chickens, and {{to look at their}} 6 -month survival rate. The two chicken populations of the different regions were found to be different in terms of their population dynamics and phenotypic characteristics, and these may be driven by farmer demands, which are dictated by the local economic and cultural value placed on specific qualities in the chickens. Over the course of the study, no large outbreaks were observed in the eight villages which took part in the study, and only 9 out of 1280 birds (0. 7 %) were found to be serologically positive for ND. However, {{even in the absence of}} large outbreaks, around 20 % of the birds in the study were reported to have died of disease within the 6 -month follow-up period, and a further 13 % lost to predation. Both location and seasonal variation influenced a bird’s fate, as did farmer decisions, such as choosing birds with specific characteristics to sell or eat. Rather than large outbreaks, the rainy season appeared to be associated with increased small-scale losses, and a variety of signs were described, suggesting several pathogens may be involved. No single infection measured at the time of sampling was a good predictor of subsequent death from disease; instead different pathogens appeared to be important in each region, and reduced the probability of survival through a variety of mechanisms. Positive correlations between Pasteurella and Salmonella, and between Marek’s disease and parasitic diseases were identified, but fewer birds than expected were identified with pathogens from both these groups, perhaps suggesting a decreased chance of survival for co-infected birds. Strong seasonal variation in prevalence was not observed for any of the infections in the study, suggesting that seasonal rises in disease mortality are unlikely to be attributable to a single infection, but other factors may play a role, including an increased probability of co-infection. This makes it difficult to prioritise control strategies for individual diseases; instead development programmes may find broad-based strategies, such as improving hygiene and chick management may be more beneficial to minimise the <b>small-scale</b> losses. <b>Programmes</b> also need to be tailored to local needs rather than assuming a blanket strategy will work equally well for all farmers or regions. Any development strategies to control single diseases should consider potential impacts on non-target infections, due to the existence of multiple interactions between pathogens in this system...|$|R

The research studies this 'new' mode of economic development, especially the role of local government coordination during the transitional period. of the reform when market was incomplete, by means of a case study of small-scale household pond aquaculture in Shandong province based on data collected through fieldwork. The research uses both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

In order to assess this coordination role, the researcher uses primary interviews from fish farmers and government officials both at the national and the local level.

40|$|Metazoan parasites {{threaten}} {{the development and}} expansion of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) sea-cage aquaculture in Australia. There is international speculation that parasite transmission from farmed to wild fish leads to increased incidence of parasitism in wild fish. Conversely, transfer of parasites from wild fish to farmed fish can negatively impact upon the health of farmed fish. Baseline information on the parasite assemblage of wild S. lalandi in Australia will: 1) allow informed judgments {{to be made in}} order to responsibly monitor, and perhaps remedy, potentially negative impacts and; 2) enable identification of parasite species of potential harm to the Australian S. lalandi aquaculture industry. I collected wild Seriola spp. (Carangidae) throughout southern Australia and examined them for metazoan parasites. Fifty-six metazoan parasite species are identified, including one new species. A taxonomic listing is provided for the metazoan parasites found. Taxonomic descriptions are made for the blood fluke Paradeontacylix godfreyi n. sp. (Digenea: Sanguinicolidae) and a redescription is provided for the parasitic copepod Naricolax chrysophryenus (Cyclopoida: Bomolochidae). A qualitative risk assessment was devised for the metazoan parasite taxa identified for the sea-cage aquaculture of S. lalandi in South Australia. Risk was interpreted considering the likelihood and consequence of parasite establishment and proliferation. The monogeneans Benedenia seriolae and Zeuxapta seriolae were considered extremely likely to establish and proliferate. Benedenia seriolae also poses high potential negative consequences for cost-effective S. lalandi sea-cage farming. However, the absence of potential mitigation methods and parasite management for Paradeontacylix spp. (Digenea), Kudoa sp. and Unicapsula seriolae (Myxozoa) indicates that these species may also present high negative consequences for S. lalandi aquaculture in Australia. The nature of wild Seriola migrations is critical for an understanding of the potential impact of disease and parasite interactions between wild and farmed fish. A <b>small-scale</b> tagging <b>programme</b> of wild-caught S. lalandi and S. hippos in South Australia provided insight into the movements of these species. Recapture results indicate that large S. lalandi remain in, or return to, northern Spencer Gulf. S. lalandi also move past sea-cage farms in Fitzgerald Bay, northern Spencer Gulf, which is an important consideration in view of potential expansion of the S. lalandi sea-cage industry in Spencer Gulf. There is surprisingly little experimental assessment on parasite transmission from farmed fish to wild fish. Studies assessing parasite interactions between wild and cultured fish employ models to quantify parasite population levels of cultured, wild and escaped fish, while others carry out comparative surveys of parasite prevalence and intensity over time, in areas close to and distant from farming activity. I provide preliminary data on ectoparasite prevalence and intensity on wild S. lalandi in areas close to, distant from and where there is no sea-cage farming in southern Australia. I review methods employed in the northern hemisphere to assess sea-louse transfer between wild and farmed salmon and propose methods for assessing monogenean parasite transmission from farmed to wild S. lalandi in Australia. In summary, this thesis provides insight into the potential for parasite interactions between wild and farmed S. lalandi. I document the parasite assemblage of wild and farmed S. lalandi and wild S. hippos and provide baseline data on ‘natural’ parasite prevalence and intensity. I provide a taxonomic description of a new species of blood fluke. I indicate the likelihood of parasite transfer from wild fish to farmed S. lalandi, and identify parasite taxa with potentially negative consequences for sea-cage aquaculture. I provide the first firm data that wild S. lalandi move past one area where kingfish are farmed in sea-cages in South Australia. Finally, I propose procedures to better understand the potential for monogenean parasite transmission from farmed S. lalandi to wild fish. This thesis reports new information that is important when considering and managing expansion of the S. lalandi sea-cage aquaculture industry throughout Australia. It also provides baseline data on natural parasite levels to enable ongoing monitoring of the potential impacts of the industry on wild fish populations. Thesis (Ph. D.)
