5|$|During the First World War, {{the club}} {{supported}} {{the war effort}} by allowing the ground {{to be used as}} a rifle range for military training. On the outbreak of the Second World War, all outdoor sport was banned by the Government until safety implications could be assessed. When football resumed a few weeks later, Birmingham's Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of its proximity to probable air-raid targets such as the BSA munitions factories. The matter was first raised in Parliament in November 1939, but the Home Secretary felt unable to intervene. By March 1940, when St Andrew's had for some time been the only football ground in England <b>still</b> <b>closed,</b> the Chief Constable bowed to public pressure, and a crowd of 13,241 witnessed Birmingham's first home game in more than six months.|$|E
5|$|The Portway is {{regularly}} closed to through traffic {{in order to}} cater for other events besides routine maintenance. The annual Bristol Half Marathon in September uses the Portway {{as part of its}} route and the annual Bristol's Biggest Bike Ride also uses the road which is closed to motor traffic for the day. A series of Peaceful Portway festivals take place immediately after the sporting events while the road is <b>still</b> <b>closed,</b> allowing visitors to enjoy the scenery of the Avon Gorge without any traffic. In 2009, city councillor John Rogers proposed that the Portway be closed to motor traffic on summer Sundays to allow cycling in a car free environment. In 2015, the Portway was closed for five consecutive Sundays over May and June. The Mayor of Bristol, George Ferguson said the closure tied in with Big Green Week, an annual festival promoting eco-friendly activities around Bristol, where several events along the road were happening anyway.|$|E

The {{external}} Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10:00a.m., with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day. Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built. Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station. The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> for renovations begun in 2002. Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the new 1987–88 Division One season, the club was again in {{financial}} trouble, with half the Fratton End <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> to fans and leaky roofs in the North and South stands. Portsmouth were relegated straight back down to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw chairman John Deacon sell the club to London-based businessman and former Queens Park Rangers chairman, Jim Gregory.|$|E

The club had admitted its first African-American member in 1990, but was <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> to women. The Club chose to air the Masters without commercials rather than succumb to the pressure to open admissions to women.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, occupations and {{units with}} the primary role of {{preparing}} for direct involvement in combat {{on the ground or}} at sea were <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> to women: infantry, armoured corps, field artillery, air-defence artillery, signals, field engineers, and naval operations. On 5 February 1987, the Minister of National Defence created an office to study the impact of employing men and women in combat units. These trials were called Combat-Related Employment of Women.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, another subway tunnel {{section of}} the Orange Line at eastern Kaohsiung City {{collapsed}} during construction. The collapse of the subway tunnel also brought about {{the collapse of a}} road tunnel above the subway tunnel. Several nearby buildings were evacuated for several days for inspection. It was estimated that the road tunnel could not be rebuilt and reopened for traffic for at least a few months. In January 2008 the section was <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> and traffic is diverted around the affected area.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the fate}} of control of church {{buildings}} was decided by the church parishes, but as most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in Volyn and Rivne Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control. The lack of parishes in eastern and southern Ukraine prompted President Kravchuk to intervene and force the <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> buildings since the Communist times to re-open under the UOC-KP's ownership. Upon the 1994 election of Leonid Kuchma, most of the violence was promptly stopped, and the presidency adopted a de facto neutrality regime to all the four major church groups.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{has been}} voiced {{about the new}} contractor's {{effectiveness}} in correcting the perceived problems in safety, security and financial management that were cited as the reasons for bidding the contract, and Bechtel's lack of transparency (as a private corporation) and increasing control of national nuclear facilities. In August 2011, a near criticality incident happened with eight rods of plutonium placed {{close to each other}} to take a photo. In the aftermath, 12 of 14 of the lab's safety staff left in anger about their advice being dismissed by the management. Without safety management, the Plutonium Facility PF-4 was shut down in 2013 and is <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> in 2017 because the lab fails to meet expectations.|$|E

From there, they headed west to besiege the fortress of A'zaz on 15 May. Several days later, while Saladin was resting {{in one of}} his captain's tents, an assassin rushed forward at him and struck at his head with a knife. The cap of his head armour was not penetrated and he managed to grip the assassin's hand—the dagger only slashing his gambeson—and the assailant was soon killed. Saladin was unnerved at the attempt on his life, which he accused Gumushtugin and the Assassins of plotting, and so increased his efforts in the siege.|$|E

On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an [...] "eerie silence".

[...] On 17 March 2003, only 17 of the 66 secondary schools in New Caledonia were functioning, with others <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> primarily due to safety concerns.

500|$|After Skinner {{has long}} broken {{free of the}} [...] "Cigarette Smoking Man", he is again forced to take orders, this time from Alex Krycek. He is covertly {{infected}} with nanotechnology, which gives Krycek the leverage to control him. Two years later, Skinner is finally able to rid himself of Krycek, when during an attempt by Krycek on Mulder's life, Skinner fatally shoots Krycek. At Mulder's murder trial, Skinner is asked to act as Mulder's lawyer, having become a supporter of Mulder's cause. Later, Skinner and Deputy Director Alvin Kersh confront the [...] "Toothpick Man" [...] in Kersh's office, after Agents John Doggett and Monica Reyes discover that the X-Files office had been emptied out. This results in another, apparently permanent, closing of the X-Files division. Six years later, with the X-Files [...] <b>still</b> <b>closed</b> down, Skinner assists Scully in finding Mulder after he goes missing while consulting on the FBI's investigation into the disappearance of a missing agent.
