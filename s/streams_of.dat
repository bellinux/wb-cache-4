5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Stream</b> <b>of</b> {{unconsciousness}} {{is characterized}} by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow. Despite the name, the <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> unconsciousness occurs more {{in the form of}} waves than an actual continuous running <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> dialogue. The <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> unconsciousness is one of several forms of dramatic monologue, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person.
