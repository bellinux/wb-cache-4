5000|$|In {{summer of}} 1948 Krick {{performed}} the first series of 27 airborne cloud seeding tests over central Arizona, dropping up to 300 lb of ice particles on each flight. Indeed, the seeded clouds released rain, raising water levels in local reservoirs. The [...] "rain makers" [...] {{admitted that the}} result had other, natural, causes, but in a year {{that was one of}} the driest on record it was a significant success. Financially, the volume of water added by Krick's experiment cost only $2.50, compared to $14 going rate. In December 1949 Krick suggested cloud seeding without resorting to airborne devices; his proposal employed ground-based smoke generators dispersing vaporized silver iodide. A single <b>smoke</b> <b>dispenser</b> set, asserted Krick, could be moved by two wheelbarrows; it theoretically provided cloud-seeding particles for an area of 240 sq mi. Tests demonstrated a fourfold increase in precipitation. By 1951 his cloud-seeding business had 120 employees and had been hired to seed clouds over 330 e6acre km2 in the western United States as well as parts of Mexico and San Salvador.|$|E
50|$|Two {{groups of}} four Wegmann 76 mm smoke mortars are mounted {{on either side of}} the turret and can be {{electrically}} fired either as single rounds or in salvos of four. They are mounted on most Leopard 2 models, with the exception of Dutch Leopard 2s, which are equipped instead with a Dutch-designed smoke mortar system with six barrels on each side. Swedish Stridsvagn 122 utilize French GALIX <b>smoke</b> <b>dispensers,</b> similar to the system found on the French Leclerc.|$|R
25|$|The {{reason for}} the {{significant}} effect of the two 28cm rounds on Blücher was that the first round penetrated {{the side of the}} ship and exploded inside a magazine containing cans of oil, <b>smoke</b> <b>dispensers,</b> incendiary bombs, aircraft bombs for the cruiser's Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance floatplanes and depth charges. The bulkheads on that deck were blown out and the burning oil developed into an intense fire. The second 28cm shell also knocked out the electricity central for the ship's main guns, rendering them unable to return fire.|$|R
2500|$|T-55AI [...] "Igman" [...] - Yugoslav upgrade of the T-55A, {{intended}} for modernization of YPA's aging fleet of T-55s. It was using sophisticated components from M-84, local produced advanced versions of T-72, with {{whom it was}} in parallel development. Major improvements included external mounting of 2 rails for AT-3 Sagger missiles, an engine from T-72, a simplified SUV with meteosensor and laser rangefinders from M-84, addition of spaced armor on turret and front body, and installation of <b>smoke</b> <b>dispensers.</b> About 20 were made before break-up of Yugoslavia. Prototypes were impressed into regular service, however there is no data of them being used in combat.|$|R
5000|$|Stridsvagn 122 (Strv 122) ("Tank 122") is a Swedish main {{battle tank}} {{based on the}} German Leopard 2. As with the Leopard 2A5 {{it is based on}} the German Leopard 2 Improved variant, {{utilizing}} newer technology such as command, control, and fire control systems, as well as reinforced armour and long-term combat capacity. Externally, the vehicle can be distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 by the French GALIX <b>smoke</b> <b>dispensers,</b> different storage bins, and the thicker crew hatches. The Strv 122B, has been equipped with modular AMAP composite armour from IBD Deisenroth to give [...] "360° protection" [...] against threats such as EFPs, rocket propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices.|$|R

5000|$|The Leopard 2(S) is a Swedish Army {{variant of}} the Leopard 2 Imp, which has {{received}} the local designation Stridsvagn 122. It is based on what was then called [...] "Leopard 2 Improved" [...] and features increased armour on the turret top and front hull, and improved command, control and fire control systems. Externally, the vehicle can be distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 by the French GALIX <b>smoke</b> <b>dispensers,</b> different storage bins, and the much thicker crew hatches. The Strv 122B, a variant equipped with modular AMAP composite armour from IBD Deisenroth, has increased 360° protection against threats like EFPs, RPGs and IEDs. The width of 4 m has been kept, while the weight increases by only 350 kg.|$|R
25|$|A Flight is {{composed}} of aircrew responsible for operating four Pilatus PC-9A(F) Forward Air Control (FAC) variant aircraft. The PC-9A(F) in grey paintwork differs from the standard PC-9A in several ways, including external stores carriage, communications equipment, undercarriage and is fitted with <b>smoke</b> grenade <b>dispensers</b> for target marking. The aircraft are based at RAAF Base Williamtown to train ADF Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC).|$|R
2500|$|The Tracker {{carried an}} {{internal}} torpedo bay {{capable of carrying}} two lightweight torpedoes or one nuclear depth charge. [...] There were six underwing hard points for rocket pods and conventional depth charges or up to four additional torpedoes. [...] A ventrally-mounted retractable radome for AN/APS-38 radar and a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) AN/ASQ-8 mounted on an extendable rear mounted boom were also fitted. [...] Early model Trackers had an Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM) pod mounted dorsally just aft of the front seat overhead hatches and were also fitted with a smoke particle detector or [...] "sniffer". [...] Later S-2s had the sniffer removed and had the ESM antennae moved to four rounded extensions on the wingtips. A 70-million-candlepower searchlight was mounted on the starboard wing. The engine nacelles carried JEZEBEL sonobuoys in the rear (16 in early marks, 32 in the S-2E/G). [...] Early Trackers also carried 60 explosive charges, dispensed ventrally {{from the rear of}} the fuselage and used for active sonar (JULIE) with the AN/AQA-3 and later AQA-4 detection sets, whereas the introduction of active sonobuoys (pingers) and AN/AQA-7 with the S-2G conversion saw these removed. <b>Smoke</b> <b>dispensers</b> were mounted on the port ventral surface of the nacelles in groups of three each.|$|R
