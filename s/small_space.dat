5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into a <b>small</b> <b>space</b> on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Foundation already owned {{two of the}} {{two dozen}} pieces prior to Citygarden's creation, and it {{purchased}} the remaining number between 2006 and 2009. The organization has not revealed the cost of acquiring the sculptures, an amount {{not included in the}} $30 million; however, it is estimated that the collection is worth around $12 million, if not more. The garden has received criticism from those who think that 24 sculptures is too many in such a <b>small</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a <b>small</b> <b>space</b> on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of plasma display panels and microdischarges, there is great {{interest}} in sustaining plasmas in <b>small</b> <b>spaces.</b> In principle, plasmas in <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> should scale {{in the same manner}} as plasmas in macroscopic spaces by keeping pd (pressure × dimension) constant. In practice, this is not necessarily the case. In many instances the characteristic size of the plasma is on the order of the Debye length and the surface-to-volume ratio is sufficiently large that surface processes dominate. Following pd scaling also implies that higher pressures are required to facilitate plasmas in <b>small</b> <b>spaces.</b> The high pressure and small dimensions also imply that transients are particularly important. In this paper, the dynamics of plasmas sustained in <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> will be discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the design processes in contemporary Japanese landscape architecture. It is {{framed by the}} question whether exposure to smallness and dense environments generates knowledge that motivates and enables Japanese landscape architects to approach <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> different from large-scale projects. The aim is to investigate if design strategies exist that reveal specific methods in designing for <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> and to further understand how theses methods are applied in designing for <b>small</b> <b>spaces.</b> Interviews {{as well as a}} specific design task focus on designers’ understanding, perception, and appraisal of design possibilities for <b>small</b> urban <b>spaces</b> through investigation of their design process and work practice. The study reveals that rather than a single approach on designing for <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> differentiated design strategies are utilized, which consider spatial context, sensory experience and processes and emphasize the understanding of site specific-ness in the design process for these spaces.

5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model. A station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a <b>small</b> <b>space</b> on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Briarcliff {{resident}} and artist Myril Adler proposed {{a series of}} exhibits of graphic art; the first showing was in October of that year and recurred each month thereafter, each with Sunday opening receptions. Exhibitors included Adler, Michael Ponce de Leon, Seong Moy, Rodolfo Abularach, Fritz Eichenberg, Jacob Landau, George Earl Ortman, Minna Citron, and Alfredo Da Silva. Exhibited works included etchings and engravings, woodcuts, cellocuts, lithographs, collage intaglios, and serigraphs. As {{a result of these}} exhibits, the library began a collection of prints donated by the exhibiting artists. In the library's <b>small</b> <b>space,</b> Adler displayed prints between shelves and in the youth and children's reading rooms.|$|E
5|$|In 2029, {{aboard the}} United States Air Force space station Oberon, Leo Davidson {{works closely with}} {{primates}} who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a <b>small</b> <b>space</b> pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers {{that the world is}} ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.|$|E

5|$|The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago {{was created}} {{as the result}} of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, {{collectors}} and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art to complement the city's Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in Time. It opened in fall 1967 in a <b>small</b> <b>space</b> at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck. In 1970 he invited Wolf Vostell to make the Concrete Traffic sculpture in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|When the Shawnee Purchase Units {{were first}} established, {{temporary}} headquarters {{were set up}} in Room 303, First Trust and Savings Bank Building, Harrisburg, Illinois. This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the fourth floor, are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the <b>small</b> <b>space</b> under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively <b>small</b> <b>space</b> and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a <b>small</b> <b>space,</b> thus allowing transmission.|$|E
