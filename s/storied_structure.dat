5|$|The {{entrance}} gate from this palace, which was earlier {{the main gate}} and which has carved ornamentation, leads to the royal baths and then to an elegant small dwelling unit built within a garden in typical Mughal architectural style; this had been built exclusively for Rai Parveen, the female escort of the Raja Indrajit; her large-size portrait in a revealing and seductive attire adorns hall in this Mahal. She was a poet and musician. The building is a double <b>storied</b> <b>structure</b> built with bricks, rising to {{the height of the}} trees in the well tended garden called Anand Mahal. The garden is laid out with octagonal flower beds and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to feel at home? And {{how would}} this be photographed? These {{questions}} inspired this creative project, Architectures of Memory, which is comprised of a photographic series, Living Rooms (2013), and an accompanying essay, Landscapes of My Remembering. Living Rooms was made in the community where the author was born, called Retreat in Cape Town, South Africa. The 17 color photographs depict interior home spaces of iconic “council houses” which are identical detached, double, or often, triple <b>storied</b> <b>structures</b> built by the British and Afrikaner regimes for people of color. Landscapes of My Remembering is a 3, 553 -word essay that reflects on an event which inspired the photographic series. It includes an analysis of the photography book, Innenwelt- Inner World, Photographs of Romania and Exile (2007) by Beatrice Minda. Minda’s collection of 70 color photographs of rooms were made inside homes belonging to Romanians and Romanian exiles, emigrants, and itinerant workers in both Romania, and in Germany and France. The paper concludes with a list of the works cited and with portraits of the participants whose homes were photographed in Retreat.  Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main {{investigation}} {{in this research}} work is to maintain the eco-balance by preventing the open site dumping of the Blast furnace slag (BFS), a by-product {{in the process of}} cement production is an industrial waste, causing environmental pollution and prevention of sand mining by the replacement of Slag for fine aggregates in ferrocement. Sand mining has led to the danger of river-course change and causing floods. This replacement has been found to improve the strength characteristics of ferrocement and also makes it lightweight. This not only helps in construction of multi <b>storied</b> <b>structures</b> but also found to maintain thermal comfort. The main investigation is regarding the percentage replacement of sand by BFS and reinforcing with meshes. It is observed that the ultimate strength reaches a peak value and later decreases due to replacement of BFS. Marginal decrease in ultimate strength with increase in mesh content has also been observed. Further, with the cracks developed parallel to the mesh layers, the weak planes are generated along the mesh layer which has hastened the failure. The experimental results are analysed and a theoretical solution has been developed for the computation of stress corresponding to strain...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} {{centrifuge}} liquefaction tests {{have been conducted}} at C-CORE’s geotechnical centrifuge facility: two on variable soil and one on uniform soil deposits. A single <b>storied</b> frame <b>structure</b> resting on two strip footings was also placed on that soil deposit. Experimental results such as accelerations, excess pore water pressures (EPWP) and settlements were monitored throughout the tests. Recorded results support the conclusion of previous research that more EPWP is generated in heterogeneous soil deposits than in the corresponding homogeneous soil. The mechanism of this phenomenon is discussed in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed at {{identifying}} the anatomical characters expressing life history traits of woody species from the northern Congo Basin. We crosschecked three databases: the botanical inventories produced during the CoForChange project (857 spp.), the database of life history traits established by the CIRAD (France) and GxABT (Belgium) (464 spp.), and the anatomical database Inside Wood (761 spp. and genera for tropical Africa). A total of 155 shared species was obtained. We performed correspondence analyses between the anatomical characters and two main groups of traits: leaf phenology and light-requirement. Results showed: (i) that wood anatomy is involved in leaf phenology and light-requirement in a significant way (7. 56 % of the variance on axe 1), (ii) that evergreenness was correlated to IAWA characters 14 to 18 (scalariform perforation plates, e. g. Olacaceae) and deciduousness to characters 118 to 122 (<b>storied</b> <b>structures,</b> e. g. Malvaceae and Meliaceae), (iii) that pioneer (P) and non-pioneer light-demanding (NPLD) species showed similar traits but were different from shade-tolerant (ST) species, (iv) that deciduous and evergreen species showed separate distributions, and (v) that wood anatomy validated the well documented strong correlation between evergreen species and ST species, with an inversion of the tendency for deciduous species correlated to P and NPLD species. We conclude that anatomical characters {{can be used as}} indicators of life history traits in species-rich biomes. Further investigations are needed to increase the input of wood anatomy in explaining the life history traits in African tropical species...|$|R

Bastions adorned the corners and the western wall. Of the existing three gates, the west gate forms the entrance to the Qila and is called the Bara Darwaza (big gate). All three gates are double - <b>storied</b> <b>structures</b> built with red sandstone and have chhatris. The enclosure wall inside has cells in two - bay depth. The northern gate, built in 1543-44, is called the Talaqi-Darwaza for reasons unknown. On this gate, in the front, carved marble leogryphs in combat with a man are seen above the oriel windows. Built in random rubble masonry with dressed stone facing, the gate has a tall arch enclosed by two smaller arched openings. Two bastions adorn the gate with high ceiling rooms. On {{the second floor of the}} gate, there are two openings. Exterior surface of the gate had coloured tiles and the inner rooms were covered with incised plaster work. The Purana Qila was stated to have been left unfinished by Suri, which was later completed by Humayun. The southern gate is called the Humayun Darwaza; the reasons attributed for the name are that either Humayun built it or the gate overlooked Humayun’s tomb. An inscription in ink on the gate refers to Sher Shah with the date as 950 A.H. (1543-44).|$|R

50|$|Connaught Place's Georgian {{architecture}} is modelled after the Royal Crescent in Bath. While the Royal Crescent is semi-circular and a three <b>storied</b> residential <b>structure,</b> Connaught Place {{had only two}} floors, which made almost a complete circle intended to house commercial establishments {{on the ground with}} residential space on the first floor. The circle was eventually designed with two concentric circles, creating an Inner Circle, Middle Circle and the Outer Circle with seven roads radiating from a circular central park. As per the original plan, the different blocks of Connaught Place were to be joined from above, employing archways, with radial roads below them. However, the circle was 'broken up' to give it a grander scale. Even the blocks were originally planned to be 172 m in height, but later reduced to the present two-storied structure with an open colonnade.|$|R
40|$|Steel {{columns in}} frame {{structure}} always carry heavy upcoming compressive forces. As a consequence, axial shortening becomes a common phenomenon in a multistoried steel <b>structure.</b> A 100 <b>storied</b> steel <b>structure</b> is analyzed in SAP 2000 {{to study the}} magnitude overall effects of column shortening. It was found from the study that the maximum axial shortening occurs at the columns of top storey of the steel structure and at the columns of bottom storey, the axial deformation is negligible. The increasing rate of axial shortening is significant at the initial levels. However, at the upper levels, the amount of axial shortening in steel columns differs insignificantly. In the selected rigid frame structure, the axial shortening of adjacent steel columns is found to influence significantly the differential shortening of the structure. The consequent effect of differential shortening leads to develop excessive stress in the corner joints which ultimately hamper the normal behavior of the structural systems. The results are discussed elaborately in the paper...|$|R
