"PHIN will elevate and {{integrate}} {{the capabilities of}} public health information systems across {{the wide variety of}} organizations that participate in public health and across the wide variety of interrelated public health functional needs. PHIN is both a response to the needs for better integration among public health systems and a plan for developing systems and infrastructure to better support public health activities and improve public health outcomes. PHIN targets the support and integration of systems for disease surveillance, national health status indicators, data analysis, public health decision support, information resources and knowledge management, alerting and communications and the management of public health response.PHIN includes a portfolio of software solutions and artifacts necessary in building and maintaining interconnected information systems throughout public health at the local, state and federal levels. PHIN advances the National Health Information Infrastructure and federal E-Gov agendas by working with the Federal Health Architecture (FHA) and implementing the Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) standards for reducing the burden of private sector reporting through the automated use of electronic clinical data for public health purposes as an alternative to manual reporting. It is consistent with other private sector initiatives such as Connecting for Health and e-Health as well as the industry standards for clinical data messaging such as HL7.

40|$|This Article {{uses the}} jurisprudential {{dichotomy}} between two opposing types of legal requirements — “rules” and “standards” — to examine extraterritorial regulation by the United States. It argues {{that there is}} natural push toward standards in extraterritorial regulation because numerous institutional actors either <b>see</b> <b>standards</b> as the best option in extraterritorial regulation or accept standards as a second-best option when their first choice (a rule favorable to their interests or their worldview) is not feasible. The Article explores several reasons for this push toward standards, including: statutory text, statutory interpretation theories, the nonbinary nature of the domestic/foreign characterization, the tendency of extraterritorial regulation to favor plaintiffs, interest-group pressures, and interbranch struggles within the federal government. Since it appears standards are here to stay, this Article concludes by suggesting {{that they may have}} some underappreciated benefits, at least {{from the perspective of a}} regulating state. First, the uncertainty inherent in standards may be a necessary consequence of regulatory schemes permitting private civil litigants to enforce extraterritorial statutes. Second, this inherent uncertainty may permit a state’s regulatory program to influence primary behavior abroad that would be difficult to reach through a rule-based model...|$|E

40|$|Highlights: • Statins {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{anti-cancer}} efficacy • Statin-HMG-CoA reductase inhibition • Statin cellular influx transport • Quantitative structure activity relationships • Statins, cyclin-dependent kinases, cell cycle progression Abstract The general QSAR equation: Transport or Inhibition = ΔG desolvation + ΔG lipophilicity + Dipole Moment + Molecular Volume {{is shown to}} apply to statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, passive and active statin cellular transport, the inhibition of growth of pancreatic cancer cells, and the survival times of mice. The equation also applies to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases, which {{are known to be}} involved with statins in affecting the progression of tumour cell cycles. The common clinical practice of using " hydrophilic " and " hydrophobic " statins as being arbiters of anti-cancer efficacy is clearly wrong. Efficacy of statins is a function of how well desolvation, lipophilicity, dipole moment and molecular volume of individual statins affect the many pathways involved in their anti-cancer activities.

It {{has been found that}} a four parameter linear model incorporating desolvation energy, lipophilicity, dipole moment and molecular volume of the ligands is a good model to describe the binding between ligands and kinases or proteases. The resistance shown by MDR proteases to the anti-viral drugs is multi-faceted involving varying changes in desolvation, lipophilicity and dipole moment interaction compared to the non-resistant protease. Desolvation {{has been shown to be}} the dominant factor influencing the effect of inhibitors against the cyclin-dependent kinases, but lipophilicity and dipole moment are also significant factors.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a novel 4 {{parameter}} model (IC 50 =ΔG desolvation free energy of water + lipophilicity + dipole moment + molecular volume) applies to a broad range of PARP 1 and PARP 2 inhibitory activity. Similarly to other inhibitors, desolvation plays a critical role in binding activity, a factor usually ignored in quantitative binding models. The model is consistent with a process where the water solvated inhibitor moves from a bulk water environment ε 78. 3 to an environment representative of the interior of a protein binding pocket ε 6 - 10. Correlations have been found between equation 1 and literature docking studies which support this model. A correlation has been found using a variant of equation 1 using the electron affinity of the inhibitors (along with the desolvation, lipophilicity and dipole moment). This observation may support the notion that PARP inhibitors that show synergism with adjuvant drugs and radiotherapy that are used concomitantly with PARP inhibitors in the clinic may involve redox electron transfer processes.
