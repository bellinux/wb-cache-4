40|$|Simulation {{models of}} spray pattern are {{required}} for the dynamic behaviour assessment of sprayer booms. The reasons are their ease of use and their independence regarding variable operating conditions such as liquid properties and nozzle state, which interfere with the discrimination between various dynamic behaviours properties. Although such models {{have been developed for}} many decades, no international consensus has been reached on their use in a standardised test procedure. A consensual model is tested in the scope of standardisation specific needs. It uses ISO- 5682 / 1 <b>spray</b> <b>table</b> measurements of the static distributions to compute three 2 -D distribution at three heights using a filtered back-projection algorithm. These distributions are interpolated to generate a 3 -D matrix of repartition at various heights. This 3 -D matrix is used as nozzle distribution description in a dynamic distribution model where the dynamic distribution is computed as a summation of the static distribution at successive positions. The model kernel was found suitable to predict the repartition under a moving boom...|$|E
40|$|An user {{interface}} to input parameters, run simulations, and graph the outputs from the continuous casting model CON 1 D {{was designed and}} implemented in a spreadsheet environment, {{with a focus on}} including features to expand the usability and audience of the model. CON 1 D is a very powerful and efficient 1 -D transient computational model of heat transfer in the process of continuous casting of steel slabs. This model has been validated by many plant measurements to predict mold temperatures, shell thickness, mold heat flux, slab temperatures, and many other parameters. This interface incorporates worksheets where the user can enter input data with user-friendly features and functionality. A grade-table sheet allows the user to setup the composition of commonly used steel grades, which can be used to automatically fill fields when running various simulations. A <b>spray</b> <b>table</b> sheet allows a change in casting speed to automatically update water flow rates of all of the spray zones. The {{user interface}} includes the key ability to convert the units of parameters, allowing users to utilize either British units, metric units, or a customized mixture. The interface integrates with a familiar spread-sheet post-processor, which reads in the many output files generated by CON 1 D and plots the results in readily-customized graphs. User feedback was used to make iterative improvements to the system. The interface has received positive feedback from users. The added user-friendly features of the interface will allow a wider audience of users to benefit from the CON 1 D model, including both researchers and a larger group of users in the industrial environment of continuous casting systems...|$|E

40|$|Therapeutic {{cannabis}} {{administration is}} increasingly used in Western countries {{due to its}} positive role in several pathologies. Dronabinol or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) pills, ethanolic cannabis tinctures, oromucosal <b>sprays</b> or <b>table</b> vaporizing devices are available but other cannabinoids forms can be used. Inspired by the illegal practice of dabbing of butane hashish oil (BHO), cannabinoids from cannabis were extracted with butane gas, and the resulting concentrate (BHO) was atomized with specific vaporizing devices. The efficiency of "cannavaping," defined as the "vaping" of liquid refills for e-cigarettes enriched with cannabinoids, including BHO, was studied as an alternative route of administration for therapeutic cannabinoids. The results showed that illegal cannavaping would be subjected to marginal development due to the poor solubility of BHO in commercial liquid refills (especially those with high glycerin content). This prevents the manufacture of liquid refills with high BHO concentrations adopted by most recreational users of cannabis to feel the psychoactive effects more rapidly and extensively. Conversely, "therapeutic cannavaping" could be an efficient route for cannabinoids administration because less concentrated cannabinoids-enriched liquid refills are required. However, the electronic device marketed for therapeutic cannavaping should be carefully designed to minimize potential overheating and contaminant generation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Severe {{deficiencies}} of iron (Fe) and iodine (I) affect {{more than one}} third of the world 9 s population. A table salt, fortified with I and Fe, would be useful in areas in which anemia and goiter coexist. However, interactions between the two minerals have prevented their simultaneous use as fortificants. A method has been developed to coat I with dextran such that after <b>spraying</b> onto <b>table</b> salt, Fe and I do not interact. Our objective was to determine the absorption of Fe and the urinary excretion of I from table salt when provided in meals designed to significantly inhibit or enhance Fe absorption. Subjects (n 5 16) ingested Fe-enhancing and Fe-inhibiting meals containing 5 g of table salt with 0. 39 mmol dextran-coated I as potassium iodide and 1 mg of Fe (ferrous fumarate labeled with 59 Fe) per gram of salt. Subjects also received a reference dose of 3 mg of ferrous fumarate labeled with 59 Fe to “correct ” for interindividual variation in iron absorption at a later date. Measured by whole-body counting, Fe-absorption from the Fe-enhancing meal (36. 2 6 12. 0 %, corrected; 13. 5 6 13. 8 % uncorrected) was significantly higher than that from the Fe-inhibiting meal (7. 4 6 11. 3 %, corrected; 4. 0 6 8. 4 %, uncorrected) (P, 0. 0001). Urinary excretion of iodine at baseline and postingestion were not significantly different (0. 89 6 0. 5 vs. 1. 06 6 0. 39 mmol/L, P, 0. 47) and were within the normal range. We conclude that Fe was well absorbed but influenced by the composition of the meal and that urinary excretion of iodine was maintained in the normal range with dextran-coated iodine. J.

5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball {{match with}} Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee {{in the fifth}} contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal {{and the only way}} to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese grater by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation with Beer Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table on the floor next to the stage. Ray and Devon then <b>sprayed</b> the <b>table</b> with lighter fluid. Devine lit the table on fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|R
40|$|In the Pesticide Risk Reduction Programme Ethiopia the {{evaluation}} of risks of pesticides present in drinking water for man and cattle was selected as a priority protection goal. In cooperation with the Plant Health Regulatory Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of Ethiopia and other Ethiopian stakeholders Alterra developed a procedure to assess the risks for drinking water caused by pesticides, used according to Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). To do so, ‘realistic worst case’ scenarios were developed, that intend to protect man and cattle in 99 % of all possible situations in Ethiopia. For groundwater three scenarios representing wells in aquifers in the Ethiopian highlands or Rift Valley margins were developed and for surface water three scenarios representing small rivers in the highlands or temporay stagnant ponds were developed. The scenarios were linked to crops on which pesticides are used that score high on acute, chronic or local chronic risk for man. In addition other agro-environmental conditions were defined, such as precipitation, soil, and land use management.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the flash X-ray {{diagnostics}} of dodecane sprays produced in ambient air and in a high pressure chamber filled up to 30 bars of nitrogen. The sprays are generated through serial vehicle injectors having six holes of 150 µm in diameter. The injector is pressurized from a few hundreds of bars up to 1200 bars and injection durations are of a few hundreds of microseconds, these parameters representing typical operation conditions of such injectors in vehicle engine technology. The flash X-ray source developed for this study delivers X-ray pulse, 20 ns in duration, of X-ray photons essentially emitted in the copper characteristic lines around 8 keV. Such characteristics allow for the recording of radiographs, {{with the use of}} an X-ray camera, of pure, non seeded dodecane sprays in the near nozzle region, up to 4 mm downstream the nozzle outlet. Radiographies obtained by averaging over a few thousands of X-ray shots allow for the determination of the near nozzle spray density. The very short X-ray exposure also allow for time resolved analysis of the spray expansion in the high pressure chamber. Such time resolved analysis was performed on a microsecond time scale to study the spray expansion. Two main observations have been recently obtained and confirm some data obtained by groups [1] studying such spray doped with a cerium additive and using 8 keV synchrotron X-ray on very large scale facility. First, the density measured at the nozzle outlet appears to be well below that awaited if the spray would consist in a pure liquid column on the first diameter of expansion. A significant decrease of the axial spray density from the nozzle outlet over the three first millimetres downstream the propagation path was also measured. Second, time resolved X-ray radiography show evidence for a non intuitive behaviour of the spray propagation velocity in the near nozzle region. It has been measured that the spray expansion velocity tends to accelerate along the three first millimetres downstream of the nozzle outlet. These X-ray measurements appear as the first, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, obtained in non doped dodecane <b>sprays</b> using a <b>table</b> top X-ray source.

40|$|Concrete is {{attacked}} by aggressive {{agents in the}} marine and softwater environments which reduce the durability of concrete. To help lessen {{the effect of this}} aggressive attack, fly ash concrete has been recommended for use in these environments. The lower permeability, increased chemical resistance and higher long-term strength of fly ash concrete are expected to improve the concrete durability. In this research the effect of fly ash was investigated with regard, initially to general concrete properties such as bleeding, early set, workability, mortar excess and compressive strength. Lethabo field 2 fly ash and Western Cape materials were used for this work. Having developed a wide range of concrete mixes, further investigation was done into specific concrete properties such as the effect of different curing regimes, water absorption, permeability and freeze-thaw resistance. These properties are considered to have an influence on concrete durability. Comparisons were made between the concrete properties of Lethabo field 2, Lethabo classified and Matla classified fly ash concrete. The three types of concrete were tested for compressive strength, sorptivity (rate of water absorption) and density. At the same time, fly ash and OPC concrete samples were exposed to the marine and softwater environment for up to 10 months. Marine exposure was done in the submerged, tidal and <b>spray</b> zones in <b>Table</b> Bay. Softwater exposure was done at Constantia Nek and Steenbras Water Treatment Plants. The performance of concrete in the various exposure conditions was measured by compressive strength, sorptivity and density tests. Fly ash improved many of the properties of concrete, with fly ash concrete having better workability, higher long-term strength, reduced bleeding, lower sorptivity and reduced permeability than similar OPC concrete. Some of the properties of concrete were however worsened by using fly ash. Fly ash concrete had longer setting times, reduced resistance to freezing and thawing and was more adversely affected by dry curing than similar OPC concrete. Lethabo field 2 fly ash concrete had higher compressive strength and lower sorptivity than either Lethabo classified or Matla classified fly ash concrete. The long-term performance of Lethabo classified and Matla classified fly ash concrete was better than that of Lethabo field 2 fly ash concrete, with regard to compressive strength development and sorptivity reduction. Fly ash concrete performed well in both the marine and softwater environments. After 10 months of exposure in either marine or softwater conditions, fly ash concrete had higher compressive strength and lower sorptivity than similar OPC concrete. The good performance of fly ash concrete in the marine and softwater environment confirmed the ability of fly ash to improve many of the important durability properties of concrete. From this medium-term durability investigation it was found that Lethabo field 2 fly ash improved the performance of concrete in marine and softwater environments while fly ash, in general, improved many of the durability properties of concrete...|$|R
40|$|Combustion of fuels {{appears in}} many sets of {{equipment}} and applications that involve transformation of a primary not useful form of energy into a secondary usable {{one that can be}} employed for purposes of electricity generation, transportation and industrial thermochemical processes. Strict environmental regulations demand for the reduction of the pollutants emissions (e. g. NO$_{x}$ CO$_{ 2 }$, CO, SO$_{ 2 }$, etc.) that are responsible for the global warming of the planet and the formation of acid rain and smog. Since renewable energy sources cannot replace the use of fossil fuels in the foreseeable future alternative ways have to be investigated. Combustion of biofuels such as liquid ethanol, a well known and widely used alcohol, under MILD (Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution) conditions is a scenario on that direction. From the one hand, combustion of biofuels offers sustainability and lower greenhouse gas emissions and from the other, MILD conditions offer more uniform and lower peak temperature profiles reducing so the nitrogen oxides emissions and increasing the lifetime of the combustion chamber. However, modeling of ethanol spray turbulent combustion is a complicated problem since it involves many different phenomena that are coupled between each other including the injection of the spray, the atomization into droplets and the dispersion in the domain, the turbulence of the gaseous flow, the mass, momentum and energy exchange between the two phases and finally the combustion. The closure of the unresolved chemical source terms in the numerical analysis of such a problem is a challenge and the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) method appears as a perspective approach to deal with it. This method approximates the turbulent flame as an ensemble of laminar, thin, one dimensional, counterflow flames the so-called flamelets. In that way the chemical reactions can be decoupled from the turbulence field and be calculated separately. The results are stored in look-up tables that are retrieved during the turbulence simulation with the use of connecting variables. Not having found a way so far to relate a <b>spray</b> flamelet look-up <b>table</b> with the turbulence flow many researchers create a gaseous flamelet table instead ignoring the spray and evaporation effects in it. As it has been reported this omittance can possibly lead to over-prediction of the temperature and important species profiles in the modeling of the turbulent flame. In this study, both a gaseous and spray ethanol flamelet library are created so that a direct comparison between the two can be done. The interference of spray influences the structure of the flame making it deviate significantly from the gaseous flamelets. The results show that not only the strain rate (as for the case of the gaseous flamelets), but also the equivalence ratio implied in the fuel side and the initial droplets’ diameter influence the flame structure of the spray flamelets. A non-slip velocity between the droplets and the carrier gas is kept as a boundary condition for all the cases. Increased initial droplets' momentum due to increased strain rate and initial diameter makes the droplets survive and follow longer trajectories in the domain. If droplets manage to cross the stagnation plane and meet the opposing gaseous stream, one or more droplets' reversals are observed. The motion of droplets in the domain is associated with the evaporation process the location of which affects the viability of the flame. Enhanced evaporation at the stagnation plane favors the creation of a double reaction zone. If the ethanol vapor is brought in the reaction zone at a high temperature level a hotter flame compared to the gaseous case can be created. Moreover, if evaporation takes place in regions where combustion is not strong enough, local flame extinction might happen. Thus, not only the residence time of the reactants (as for the case of the gaseous flamelets), but also the location and the intensity of the evaporation affect the flame structure. Decomposition of the ethanol gas into intermediate species can occur for all the cases but is more apparent in the gaseous flamelets and for lower strain rates. Mass fraction profiles of CO$_{ 2 }$ and H$_{ 2 }$O indicate the outer flame structure and follow the temperature profile, while local presence of CO indicates that the reactions are weakened, incomplete or they have just started. Local evaporation of the droplets is also predicted by the evaporation source term of the continuity equation and at the location where a local peak is observed additional peaks of the ethanol and oxygen consumption rates are found which are in a stoichiometric ratio. For increased droplets' initial momentum, slip velocity effects are found that lead to increased drag force and the deceleration of the droplets. Increasing the equivalence ratio at the boundary two reaction zones are observed for all the cases, but it does not influence the motion of the droplets. Finally, {{as a result of the}} evaporation two or more peaks of scalar dissipation rate can be found compared to the single peak observed in the gaseous flamelets. It becomes evident that the motion and the evaporation of the droplets strongly affects the flame structure. More reaction zones, of varying intensity and location can be found in the spray flamelets. Temperature and species profiles show deviations between the two libraries and as a result the creation of a complete spray flamelet library and finding a way to relate it with the turbulence calculation is an important issue to be studied in a future study. Finally, it is also recommended that the influences of a slip boundary velocity condition should be studied for the spray calculations. <br/...|$|R
