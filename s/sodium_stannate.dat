In this paper, two different methods {{were used to}} prepare the nano-scale zinc hydroxystannate particles. The reaction of tin tetrachloride and zinc oxide was the first way. In the second method, zinc chloride reacted with <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate.</b> The reaction conditions were studied, and the products were characterized by TG/DTA, SEM, and XRD. The best experiment conditions to synthesis zinc hydroxystannate are using <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate</b> and zinc chloride as the raw material, reacting for an half hour at the temperature of 323 K, and molar ratio of reactants of 1 : 1. This will get higher yield, more pure product with regular morphology...|$|E

40|$|By {{incorporating}} up {{to about}} 1 per cent of aluminum in the tin anodes used in alkaline tin plating, the current densities obtainable can be markedly increased. The effect of twenty-six elements upon the anode behavior of tin in alkaline solutions has been studied. Many have little effect in the quan-tities tested, i. e., {{up to about}} 1 per cent; some, such as nickel, silver, cad-mium, and indium have a strong passivating action. Among the several which tend to increase anode efficiency, aluminum appears most promising from a practical standpoint, since it alloys smoothly and easily with tin, is nonpoisonous, cheap, produces no observable deleterious effect on the bath, and forms alloys which are stable and of good mechanical properties.

40|$|Anode {{properties}} of mesoporous (m-) SnO 2 -based materials for secondary lithium-ion batteries have been investigated. Thermally stable m-SnO 2 powders with high specific surface area were prepared from <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate</b> as a tin-source by utilizing the self-assembly of cetylpyridinium chloride in water, followed by annealing in air {{as well as}} argon. Various reductants such as Sn metal and SnOx (1 ?x< 2) were also prepared by annealing under various reductive conditions. Pure m-SnO 2 annealed in air showed a small capacity (57 mA h g- 1) at 20 th discharge, while the capacity of m-SnO 2 annealed in argon was two times as large as that of pure m-SnO 2. Annealing in hydrogen atmosphere brought a further high capacity to the material, while the specific surface area of their reductants was low. Among all the samples tested, the sample containing Sn metal, Sn 3 O 4 and several kinds of SnO, annealing in argon at 500 °C and subsequently in hydrogen at 300 °C, exhibited the highest charge-discharge properties (240 mA h g- 1 even at 20 th discharge) ...|$|E
40|$|Layered Eu-doped SnO 2 ordered nanoarrays {{constructed}} by nanorods with 10 nm diameters and several hundred nanometers length were synthesized by a substrate-free hydrothermal route using alcohol and water mixed solvent of <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate</b> and sodium hydroxide at 200 °C. The Eu dopant {{acted as a}} crystal growth inhibitor to prevent the SnO 2 nanorods growth up, resulting in tenuous SnO 2 nanorods ordered arrays. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the tetragonal rutile-type structure with a systematic average size reduction and unit cell volume tumescence, while enhancing the residual strain as the Eu-doped content increases. The surface defects that were caused by the incorporation of Eu ions within the surface oxide matrix were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The results of the response properties of sensors based on the different levels of Eu-doped SnO 2 layered nanoarrays demonstrated that the 0. 5 at % Eu-doped SnO 2 layered nanorods arrays exhibited an excellent sensing response to methanal at 278 °C.

40|$|In this research, the {{performance}} of Al–air batteries based on pure Al and Al- 0. 5 wt%In anodes in 4 M NaOH solutions with or without different concentrations of additives was investigated by galvanostatic discharge test. The characteristics of the anodes after discharge were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX). The corrosion behavior of the anodes was researched by self-corrosion rate test and potentiodynamic polarization test. The {{results show that the}} Al–In alloy exhibits a low self-corrosion rate and high anodic efficiency when ZnO or Na 2 SnO 3 is added to 4 M NaOH. The results of galvanostatic discharge at 20 mAcm− 2 indicate that the Al–air battery based on Al- 0. 5 wt%In anode shows excellent discharge performance. The Al–air battery based on the alloy anode has an operating voltage of 1. 3 V and anodic efficiency of 75. 2 % in 4 M NaOH with 0. 02 M Na 2 SnO 3, and an operating voltage of 1. 01 V and anodic efficiency of 82. 5 % in 4 M NaOH with 0. 2 M ZnO.

Then, 1.69  g of silver nitrate was dispersed in 25  mL of ultra-pure water, and then, 2.4  mL ammonium hydroxide was added into the silver nitrate solution to form silver–ammonia solution. After stirring for 5  min, the freshly prepared silver–ammonia solution was added into the mixture under magnetic stirring for 1  h. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was migrated into a 50 -mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150  °C for 5, 10, 24, and 36  h. After the hydrothermal procedure, the autoclave was cooled down naturally to room temperature and the SnO 2 /Ag product was collected by centrifugation, followed by rinsing with deionized water and ethanol and drying in a vacuum oven at 60  °C.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of cyclic phenylboronates by two methods has been described. Phenylboronates from polyols {{soluble in water}} were prepared by the method of Kuivila, Keough and Soboczenski. Those from polyols insoluble in water were prepared by the method of Sugihara and Bowman. A method for estimating the boron content of phenylboronates not containing any other phenyl group has been devised. This utilises the ultraviolet absorption due to the grouping. The structures of several phenylboronates have been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} galactitol forms a 1, 3 : 4, 6 -bisphenylboronate and that glycerol forms a 1, 2 -mono-phenylboronate. The formation of 5 - 6 -membered rings in the phenylboronates of glycerol and galactitol has been discussed with reference to the reactions of aldehydes and ketones with polyols, and with reference to thermodynamics. The lack of reactivity of the free hydroxyl groups in some phenylboronates has been discussed and a reason for this suggested. The formation of a 'tridentate' structure, resulting in a boat-shaped conformation in the phenylboronates containing unreactive hydroxyl groups is indicated. Chromatography of polyols using a solvent containing phenylboronic acid has been carried out. Some correlation between the increase in R values of compounds in the presence of phenylboronic acid, and their structures is evident. In most cases it involves a 'tridentate' structure (and l(ax), 2 (eq), 3 (ax) -grouping of hydroxyl groups) as previously described. The use of a solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate</b> (at pH 11. 5) as an electrolyte for electrophoresis has been described, and {{it has been shown that}} for cyclic polyols a 1 (ax), 2 (eq) -diol grouping is preferred, and for acyclic polyols a threo-diol grouping is preferred for complexing. <p...|$|E
40|$|Autocatalytic ternary Ni-Sn-P, Ni-W-P and {{quaternary}} Ni-W-Sn-P {{films were}} prepared using alkaline citrate-based baths and compared with binary Ni-P coatings. Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) showed that binary Ni-P deposit contained 11. 3 wt. % of phosphorus. Codeposition of tungsten in Ni-P matrix resulted in ternary Ni-W-P with 5 wt. % P and 7. 8 wt. % of tungsten. Incorporation of tin led to ternary Ni-Sn-P deposit containing 0. 4 wt. % Sn and 10. 3 wt. % P. Presence of both sodium tungstate and <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate</b> {{in the basic}} bath had resulted in quaternary coating with 6. 9 wt. % W, traces of Sn and 6. 4 wt. % P. X-ray diffraction patterns of all the deposits revealed a single, broad peak which showed the nanocrystalline nature of the deposits. For {{the first time in}} related literature, the presence of a metastable phase Ni 12 P 5 in ternary deposits is reported in the present study. Metallographic cross-sections of all the deposits revealed the banded/lamellar structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of the deposits showed smooth nodules for ternary deposits, but coarse and well-defined nodules for quaternary deposits. DSC studies of phase transformation behavior of the ternary Ni-Sn-P deposit revealed a single sharp exothermic peak at 365 xB 0;C. However, ternary Ni-W-P and quaternary Ni-W-Sn-P deposits exhibited a low temperature peak at 300 xB 0;C, a split type high temperature peak at 405 and 440 xB 0;C and a very high temperature peak at 550 xB 0; C. Higher activation energy values were obtained for W-based alloy deposits. Presence of W and Sn has helped to retain high microhardness values even at higher temperatures indicating an improved thermal stability...|$|E
3000|$|Hydrogen is {{an ideal}} energy source due to its {{harmless}} effect to environment [1]. However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen gas is still challenging nowadays. One solution to this issue is to development a use-on-demand hydrogen source. Aluminum, abundant in earth, has low density, high capacity and excellent activity to water and is a superior material for hydrogen generation [2]. In addition, the product of Al/water reaction is Al(OH) 3 or AlOOH, which is easily recycled to produce Al by Halle–Heroult process [3]. However, the high activity of Al to water is prohibited by {{a thin layer of}} aluminum oxide on its surface. The generation of hydrogen can be achieved using highly corrosive basic solution such as sodium hydroxide [2]. In recent reports [4, 5], sodium stannate-doped sodium hydroxide solution effectively promoted hydrogen generation from the Al/H 2 O system by weakening the oxide layer using sodium hydroxide and oxidizing Al by reducing the Sn(OH) 6 − 2 [...] ions. The usage of sodium hydroxide could be reduced. However, the continuous and subsequent hydrogen generation reactions require more <b>sodium</b> <b>stannate,</b> and the accumulation of Sn metal waste could also interfere with the practical application of this system. A fascinating report by Rosenband [6] showed that 6 -μm-sized Al in water could yield 100  % hydrogen in less than 5  min by their in-house activated treatment of Al powders. Al–Ga alloys [7, 8], KCl/NaCl [9] or metallic oxide modifiers [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] are also employed to enhance the generation of hydrogen. However, these methods, accompanied with potential pollution, high cost, and additional energy supply, are not very attractive. Deng et al. [12, 13, 14, 15] reported that γ-Al 2 O 3 is an excellent modifier of aluminum power for hydrogen generation. In their study, a powder mixture of Al and Al(OH) 3 was used to form porous Al/γ-Al 2 O 3 composite after sintering [12, 13]. In our previous study [16, 17], Al(OH) 3 was proved to be very effective to promote hydrogen generation from Al/water system when it is small in size and of low crystallinity. In the present study, to better understand the effectiveness of Al(OH) 3 powders on the reaction of Al and water, five different sources of Al(OH) 3 were evaluated. An optimum condition is obtained, which produces 100  % yield hydrogen (1, 360  ml/g Al at 25  °C) from neutral water within 6  min using effective Al(OH) 3 powders and taking advantages of exothermic heat from the Al–water reaction.|$|E
