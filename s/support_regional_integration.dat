Comment: In its approach to regional integration the European Commission as a regional organisation itself focuses largely on the creation of regional structures. It almost entirely neglects the development of national capacity to effectively relate to and control, at the policy level, the work of regional structures. This is a major weakness in the EU's approach since it tends to foster regional organisations which float free from national control. This can lead to agreements being concluded, which are left largely un-implemented since there is no strong national commitment to their implementation. This is a direct consequence of there being no strong national input into their formulation. This Commission background note sets {{out how the}} EU proposes to support [...] ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Supporting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> {{processes}} {{within the}} context of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an integral component of Brussels' strategic interest in South-East Asia. Hereby, Indonesia - regional primus inter pares and self-proclaimed driver of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> - is perceived as a key partner for Europe. There are indications, however, that Indonesia seems to be turning away from ASEAN under the administration of the current president, Joko Widodo ("Jokowi"). A new narrative has recently emerged in Jakarta that seeks to prioritise Indonesia's national interests in all aspects of the country's international affairs over long-standing hallmarks of Indonesia's international politics - most notably of ASEAN being the cornerstone of Indonesian foreign policy. In order to be able to gauge changes in Indonesian foreign policy towards ASEAN under Jokowi, this research paper traces the role that ASEAN has played in Indonesian foreign policy - from the fall of Suharto up to the present day. The study finds that Indonesia's role in ASEAN differs distinctly from one policy field to the other. Although Indonesia has contributed extensively towards <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> in the field of security policy, it has predominantly displayed inert - or outright negative - attitudes towards <b>regional</b> economic <b>integration.</b> There are a number of indicators that Jakarta's foot-dragging - with regard to economic integration - might further increase under the Jokowi administration. This, however, is not tantamount to a complete neglect of ASEAN in the foreseeable future. After all, ASEAN is still viewed by policy-makers in Jakarta as being the centre of the regional security architecture and the main instrument for maintaining regional security and stability.

40|$|In 2007, the EU {{launched}} a Strategic Partnership with Brazil despite the EU’s commitment to multilateralism {{and despite the}} long-lasting interregional relationship between the EU and MERCOSUR since 1995. By singling out Brazil, the EU shifted from the EU-MERCOSUR interregional negotiations on an Association Agreement (1999 - 2004) to a bilateral track. In view of the EU’s inconsistency in multilateral, interregional, and bilateral approaches towards South America, the paper will analyze why the EU shifted to a Strategic Partnership, and it will compare the interregional negotiations (1999 - 2004) with the bilateral talks with Brazil (since 2007). The comparative analysis will rely on original data from 29 semi-structured elite interviews conducted in Brussels, Belgium, and Montevideo, Uruguay, and on grey literature and the news portal Mercopress. The paper argues that the EU switched from interregional to bilateral talks because it feared losing Brazil to its competitors, the U. S. and China. In its endeavor to prevent this loss, when interregional negotiations seemed fruitless because of MERCOSUR’s increasing fragmentation, the EU privileged Brazil as a strategic partner. Although the EU has committed itself to <b>supporting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> in South America, material interests have sidelined this commitment.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} rise {{in international}} production {{in recent years}} stands out as the most decisive factor in the globalization of economic activity. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been growing very rapidly {{in the recent past}} while international trade ceased being the principle mechanism linking national economies. It is rather the interlinkages of trade and FDI that influence the economic growth and welfare of countries in a global environment that undergoes continuous change. In this trend, the European Union (EU), plays a protagonist's role. Since 1985 we have witnessed a shift in the European Community (EC) from trade-policy-led to production-based integration. The unification of the EC marker was accompanied by a massive FDI inflow while intra-EC investment exhibited a spectacular increase with an unprecedented level of merger and acquisition activity. The EC periphery {{does not seem to be}} in position to partake in these dramatic changes in the area of international production. The heavy concentration of transnational activity in the central core of the European Union is in the center of many concerns voiced by the periphery. This paper addresses the above problem. First, the paper attempts to assess the extent and nature of the problem. Secondly, it looks into possible explanations on a cause and effect basis. Finally, the question is raised whether corporate <b>integration</b> <b>supports</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> in the EU in the absence of a comprehensive FDI policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{institutionalization of}} an international, regional polity and {{market in the}} European Union raises key questions {{about the role of}} <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> in the convergence of European welfare states. To date, sociological work has emphasized processes of industrialization and globalization as the social changes that may drive increasing similarity among welfare states. Building on neoinstitutionalist world polity theory and the Europeanization literature from political science, this paper develops the argument that <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> drives welfare-state isomorphism by generating, diffusing, and enforcing the adoption of policy scripts concerning “appropriate ” welfare policy. The hypothesis that deepening <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> drives growing welfare-state isomorphism is tested with time-series data on variation in welfare spending and novel measures of <b>regional</b> <b>integration,</b> for 14 European Union countries, over the 1960 - 1998 period. Results from cointegrating time-series (OLS) and autocorrelation-corrected (OLS with Newey-West standard errors) regression models <b>support</b> the hypothesis: <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> is associated with a reduction in variation among the welfare states of the European Union. This suggests that in theorizing contemporary changes in the welfare state, sociologists should attend to the institutionalization of regional political economy. Welfare states can be conceptualized as embedded in regional, as well as global, systems and institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ This paper {{focuses on}} {{poverty in the}} MENA region and whether it can be {{alleviated}} by intergenerational support within and across households. Intergenerational relations are mediated through several institutions. The most prominent of these are households, state, civil society and market. Combinations of social arrangements, economic resources and cultural traditions govern these institutions. Whether or not family and households can provide the necessary supports for their poorer or disadvantaged members would crucially depend on household composition, its economic resources and its interaction with the institutions of state, civil society and market. This paper also explores the trends in family formation and composition over time and household interaction with the above mentioned institutions through the labour market, or through various state and NGO driven welfare programmes. The above trends as well as migration impact the intergenerational support within families.

40|$|Working paper series, African Development Bank Group, Working paper n° 103 The African Development Bank allocates its {{concessional}} resources through a procedure which is mainly {{based on the}} quality of the beneficiary countries' economic policy and governance. This allocation procedure relies mainly on the Performance-Based Allocation formula which can be criticized on two grounds. Firstly, the weight on economic policy and governance is viewed as being excessive. Secondly, it lacks transparency and consistency. We consider how to amend that formula so as to take into account certain common characteristics of many African countries. The main proposal is to augment the formula by an economic vulnerability criterion. The numerical simulations show that the introduction of the United Nations economic vulnerability index in the formula gives rise to allocations which not only account for post conflict situations but also inherent fragility. We also consider a lower population weight in order to address the problem of country size. This change helps avoid inconsistencies arising from the application of country allocation ceilings in the various stages of the computation. Finally, a few proposals concerning the African Development Fund's <b>support</b> to <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> are explored...|$|R
40|$|The Southern African Development Community’s (SADC) {{water and}} energy sectors are under {{increasing}} pressure due to population growth and agricultural and industrial development. Climate change is also negatively impacting on the region’s {{water and energy}} resources. As the majority of SADC’s population lives in poverty, <b>regional</b> development and <b>integration</b> are underpinned by water and energy security as the watercourses {{in the region are}} transboundary in nature. This paper reviews the region’s water and energy resources and recommends policies based on the water–energy nexus approach. This is achieved by reviewing literature on water and energy resources as well as policy issues. Water resources governance provides a strong case to create a water–energy nexus platform to <b>support</b> <b>regional</b> planning and <b>integration</b> as SADC countries share similar climatic and hydrological conditions. However, there has been a gap between water and energy sector planning in terms of policy alignment and technical convergence. These challenges hinder national policies on delivering economic and social development goals, as well as constraining the regional goal of greater <b>integration.</b> <b>Regional</b> objectives on sustainable energy and access to clean water for all can only be achieved through the recognition of the water–energy nexus, championed in an integrated and sustainable manner. A coordinated regional water–energy nexus approach stimulates economic growth, alleviates poverty and reduces high unemployment rates. The shared nature of water and energy resources requires far more transboundary water–energy nexus studies {{to be done in the}} context of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> and policy formulation...|$|R
40|$|New {{initiatives}} {{are needed to}} increase {{the effectiveness of the}} trade policy instruments the EU uses in its policy of development cooperation with the ACP countries. Merely giving non-reciprocal preferences has not worked very well. The main reason for this failure is that non-reciprocal preferences have not improved supply conditions in developing countries. FTAs in the shape of EPAs can give a new impetus to production and trade. For this strategy to succeed, the ACP and EU should avoid trade diversion and deflection and create as much trade as possible. This requires MFN liberalisation together with <b>regional</b> <b>integration.</b> This paper shows that EPAs could have important benefits for ACP economies by creating competitive market conditions, leading to dynamic welfare effects and by reinforcing economic reforms. The success or failure of the new approach depends on a number of factors that have been analysed in this paper. This paper argues that the expectation underlying the Cotonou Agreement that effective negotiating partners in the shape of ACP RIAs will develop in the short term will not come true, {{with the exception of the}} Caribbean region. In the Pacific region, no ACP RIA is in the making. In SSA, <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> suffers from overlapping membership, lack of commitment and small or negative economic effects. As a result, the EU will have to use EPAs as an instrument to stimulate viable RIAs among ACP countries in SSA. This puts a number of responsibilities on the EU in order to create successful EPAs. For the full benefits of regional free trade to arise, deep integration is necessary. Harmonisation of competition policy, of regulations with respect to product norms and standards is called for. Second, substantial funds will have to be provided by the EU for social safety nets, for capacity building in order to improve the implementation of public functions that are required if markets are to function for the benefit of the citizens at large and for retraining. In order to make EPAs successful, the market access for sensitive ACP export products should be improved. Third, the EU will have to be willing to act as the hegemon in EPAs, sanctioning infringements on obligations and supporting ACP countries that have run into externally caused difficulties threatening their participation in EPAs. If EPAs are to work as commitment mechanisms that effectively lock in ACP policy reforms, ACP countries should run the risk of losing substantial benefits if they do not meet their obligations, and feel secure that they will be supported in case of external shocks. As the negotiations on EPAs have not started at the moment of writing, there is no certainty about the willingness of the EU to take up this role. However, given the trends in sanctioning human rights violations, in <b>supporting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> among developing countries, the relative size of the EDF and given the high stake the EU has set on EPAs, the new role that the EU will have to play to make EPAs successful, is not completely unrealistic...|$|R

The joint report on {{the first phase of the}} EPA negotiations and its annexes (consisting of the joint reports of the various negotiating sessions) are to serve as 'a point of reference' and to 'provide guidance' for the negotiations to be conducted at the regional level. It was announced that the second phase of negotiations would begin on October 4 th 2003 with the start of negotiations in central Africa and on October 6 th with the start of negotiations in west Africa. Despite the launching of Phase 2, it was agreed that Phase 1 negotiations would continue in order to address remaining areas of divergence on issues of common concern to the ACP as a whole. In presenting the outcome of Phase 1 'the common agreement on objectives' (an instrument for promoting sustainable development) was emphasised and the importance of <b>supporting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> was stressed. It was asserted that EPAs would 'improve the current level of preferential market access which ACP exports enjoy'. Comment: The joint statement on the outcome of Phase 1 could not hide the profound divergence which exists around issues of central importance to the EPA negotiations including: the reform of WTO rules on free-trade areas; the need to get to grips with agricultural issues arising from CAP reform; the need for additional resources to address adjustment costs; and the lack of agreement on the scope of future negotiations on services and trade-related areas. The joint report on the Phase 1 outcome which is merely to 'provide guidance' and act as a 'point of reference' more accurately reflects EU objectives than those of ACP countries, which sought a more comprehensive and binding agreement. Brussels-based observers suggest that the 'satisfaction' over the outcome was more a reflection of the European Commission's view, following pressure to stress the points of convergence, to the neglect of many ACP concerns.
