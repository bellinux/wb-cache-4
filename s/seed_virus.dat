This phenotype was associated with HA 1 (A 138 S, L 194 P) and HA 2 (D 160 N) substitutions, and strongly related to decreased virus stability towards acidic pH and elevated temperature.

Using the model seasonal H 3 N 2 virus A/Udorn/ 307 / 72 (Udorn) virus and the high-growth A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) virus, we assessed the influence of the source of the PB 1 gene on virus growth and vaccine yield. Classical reassortment of these two strains led to the selection of viruses that predominantly had the Udorn PB 1 gene. The presence of Udorn PB 1 in the <b>seed</b> <b>virus,</b> however, did not result in higher yields of virus or HA compared to the yields in the corresponding <b>seed</b> <b>virus</b> with PR 8 PB 1.

While the rates of accumulation of most mutations were higher when passaging was performed at 37 °, a U → C transition at nucleotide 5832 occurred faster at 34 °, the temperature used for vaccine production.

Well-tolerated and highly immunogenic live in-fluenza virus vaccines have been produced with lines of cold-adapted virus derived by gradual or abrupt lowering of incubation temperatures to 25 C [1 - 7]. Under optimal conditions, use of a recombination technique permitted shortening of the time required for obtaining <b>seed</b> <b>virus</b> suit-able for production of vaccine to six weeks [8]...|$|E
40|$|This Memorandum {{discusses}} {{the fate of}} variola virus stocks which have been kept in two WHO Collaborating Centres, as well as cloned DNA fragments of variola virus genome, smallpox vaccine, and <b>seed</b> vaccinia <b>virus</b> {{for the production of}} this vaccine. General and specific recommendations are given concerning destruction of variola virus; storage, distribution and handling of cloned DNA fragments of variola virus genome; and about stocks of smallpox vaccine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Urabe AM 9 {{strain of}} mumps vaccine live {{is known for}} its genetic {{instability}} and some vaccines derived from this strain were withdrawn from the market due to an excessive number of vaccine-associated parotitis and meningitis cases. To identify the molecular basis of this instability, we determined complete nucleotide sequences of several stocks of the Urabe strain used for vaccine production by different manufacturers and of two clinical isolates from cases of vaccine-associated meningitis. In contrast to previously published studies relating the Lys 335 → Glu mutation in the viral HN gene with neurovirulence of mumps virus, we could not confirm any association of this mutation with the safety of mumps vaccine. Each of the three vaccine stocks studied had its own characteristic profile of mutations that was identified by cDNA sequencing and quantitated by mutant analysis by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage. Determination of the mutational profile of mumps vaccine lots could allow vaccine manufacturers to characterize <b>seed</b> <b>viruses</b> and monitor the consistency of vaccine production to prevent emergence of virulent revertants...|$|R
40|$|Various {{methods for}} the {{recovery}} of virus inoculated into ground beef were investigated {{in an attempt to}} develop a sensitive system {{that could be used to}} detect viral contaminants in market foods. A 100 -g sample, inoculated with poliovirus 1, was suspended in 150 to 900 ml of Eagle minimum essential medium, pH 8. 5, and mixed in either plastic bags or plastic cups on a mechanical shaker. The particulate materials were removed by means of cheese cloth, glass wool, woven fiber glass, or low-speed centrifugation. Large volumes of fluid were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Microbiological contamination was controlled by high antibiotic concentrations or by filtration. Quantitative plaque-forming-unit recovery of the virus was determined by utilizing an agar overlay technique on Vero cell cultures. The data indicated that from 20 to 50 % of the <b>seeded</b> <b>virus</b> could be recovered from a 100 -g sample of ground beef. The glass wool and woven fiber glass methods were the most effective, with recovery of approximately 50 % of the inoculated virus...|$|R
