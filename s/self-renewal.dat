5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of <b>self-renewal.</b> Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{stem cell}} {{research}} {{has been focused on}} uncovering the general molecular mechanisms that control their <b>self-renewal</b> and differentiation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-renewal,</b> {{which is}} the ability to go through {{numerous}} cycles of cell division while still maintaining its undifferentiated state.|$|E
25|$|To ensure <b>self-renewal,</b> {{stem cells}} undergo {{two types of}} cell {{division}} (see Stem cell division and differentiation diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a progenitor cell with limited <b>self-renewal</b> potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally differentiating into a mature cell. It {{is possible that the}} molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as receptors) between the daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|Unipotent {{cells can}} produce only one cell type, their own, but have the {{property}} of <b>self-renewal,</b> which distinguishes them from non-stem cells (e.g. progenitor cells, which cannot self-renew).|$|E
25|$|The Notch {{signaling}} pathway {{was found to}} be critical mainly for neural progenitor cell (NPC) maintenance and <b>self-renewal.</b> In recent years, other functions of the Notch pathway have also been found, including glial cell specification, neurites development, as well as learning and memory.|$|E
25|$|Telomerase activity: Telomerases are {{necessary}} to sustain cell division unrestricted by the Hayflick limit of ~50 cell divisions. hESCs express high telomerase activity to sustain <b>self-renewal</b> and proliferation, and iPSCs also demonstrate high telomerase activity and express hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), a necessary component in the telomerase protein complex.|$|E
25|$|Similar to ESCs, these iPSCs had {{unlimited}} <b>self-renewal</b> {{and were}} pluripotent, contributing to lineages {{from all three}} germ layers {{in the context of}} embryoid bodies, teratomas, and fetal chimeras. However, the molecular makeup of these cells, including gene expression and epigenetic marks, was somewhere between that of a fibroblast and an ESC, and the cells failed to produce viable chimeras when injected into developing embryos.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of <b>self-renewal</b> based on constructive conflict.|$|E
25|$|CSCs, now {{reported}} in most human tumors, are commonly identified and enriched using strategies for identifying normal stem {{cells that are}} similar across studies. These procedures include fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), with antibodies directed at cell-surface markers and functional approaches including side population assay or Aldefluor assay. The CSC-enriched result is then implanted, at various doses, in immune-deficient mice to assess its tumor development capacity. This in vivo assay is called a limiting dilution assay. The tumor cell subsets that can initiate tumor development at low cell numbers are further tested for <b>self-renewal</b> capacity in serial tumor studies.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) are cancer cells (found within tumors or {{hematological}} cancers) that possess characteristics associated with normal stem cells, specifically {{the ability to}} give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. CSCs are therefore tumorigenic (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem cell processes of <b>self-renewal</b> and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are hypothesized to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival {{and quality of life}} of cancer patients, especially for patients with metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{was expected to}} have a large number of new candidates as the major political parties had undergone <b>self-renewal</b> in recent years, many of whom belong to the post-1965 generation. PAP had introduced 24 new candidates. Opposition fielded a total of 25 new candidates, in which the two opposition parties that held a seat, the Workers' Party and the Singapore Democratic Alliance introduced 15 and eight new candidates, respectively. Singapore Democratic Party, a group which did not win any seats in the last election, fielded two new candidates. A total of 49 brand-new candidates (including 11 female candidates, seven from PAP, four from WP and one from SDP) participated in the election.|$|E
25|$|A new way {{of looking}} at {{carcinogenesis}} comes from integrating the ideas of developmental biology into oncology. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that the different kinds of cells in a heterogeneous tumor arise from a single cell, termed Cancer Stem Cell. Cancer stem cells may arise from transformation of adult stem cells or differentiated cells within a body. These cells persist as a subcomponent of the tumor and retain key stem cell properties. They give rise to a variety of cells, are capable of <b>self-renewal</b> and homeostatic control. Furthermore, the relapse of cancer and the emergence of metastasis are also attributed to these cells. The cancer stem cell hypothesis does not contradict earlier concepts of carcinogenesis. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has been a proposed mechanism that contributes to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|Tissue-specific {{stem cells}} produce {{differentiated}} cells {{through a series}} of increasingly more committed progenitor intermediates. In hematopoiesis (blood cell formation), the process begins with long-term hematopoietic stem cells that self-renew and also produce progeny cells that upon further replication go {{through a series of}} stages leading to differentiated cells without <b>self-renewal</b> capacity. In mice, deficiencies in DNA repair appear to limit the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate and self-renew with age. Sharpless and Depinho reviewed evidence that hematopoietic stem cells, as well as stem cells in other tissues, undergo intrinsic aging. They speculated that stem cells grow old, in part, as a result of DNA damage. DNA damage may trigger signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that contribute to depletion of stem cell stocks. This has been observed in several cases of accelerated aging and may occur in normal aging too.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. Cancer cells must {{be capable of}} continuous proliferation and <b>self-renewal</b> to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain {{the growth of a}} tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, if most tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If they are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from disregulation of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell plasticity). Confounding this debate is the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a Phenotypic plasticity under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} evolution, the oldest {{physiological}} role of Ahr is in development. Ahr {{is presumed to}} have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand-independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted {{in the ability to}} bind ligand and might have helped humans evolve to tolerate smoke of fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears {{to play a role in}} the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis, lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their <b>self-renewal</b> and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation.|$|E
25|$|HDAC3 {{has been}} found to be most closely related to HDAC8. HDAC3 {{contains}} a non-conserved region in the C-terminal region that was found to be required for transcriptional repression as well as its deacetylase activity. It also contains two regions, one called a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) as well as a Nuclear Export Signal (NES). The NLS functions as a signal for nuclear action while an NES functions with HDACs that perform work outside of the nucleus. A presence of both signals for HDAC3 suggests it travels between the nucleus and the ctyoplasm. HDAC3 has even been found to interact with the plasma membrane. Silencing Mediator for Retinoic Acid and Thyroid Hormone (SMRT) receptors and Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor (N-CoR) factors must be utilized by HDAC3 in order to activate it. Upon doing so, it gains the ability to co-precipitate with HDACs 4, 5, and 7. HDAC3 can also be found complexed together with HDAC-related protein (HDRP). HDACs 1 and 3 have been found to mediate Rb-RbAp48 interactions which suggests that it functions in cell cycle progression. HDAC3 also shows involvement in stem cell <b>self-renewal</b> and a transcription independent role in mitosis.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 {{article from}} the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research {{indicates}} that PrP expression on stem cells {{is necessary for}} an organism's <b>self-renewal</b> of bone marrow. [...] The study showed that all long-term hematopoietic stem cells express PrP on their cell membrane and that hematopoietic tissues with PrP-null stem cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cell depletion.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the film}} with a 'B–' rating, {{summarizing}} it as a [...] "lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age <b>self-renewal,</b> {{set in a}} shimmering, weltering, jewel-colored India", and that it succeeded in selling [...] "something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, was more igneous in his 2/5 star review, saying that the film [...] "needs a Stannah chairlift to get it up to any level of watchability, {{and it is not}} exactly concerned to do away with condescending stereotypes about old people, or Indian people of any age." [...] Noting the luminous, prolific resumes of the cast he noted [...] "nothing in this insipid story does anything like justice to the cast's combined potential." [...] He went on to opine that the film appeared [...] "oddly like an Agatha Christie thriller with all the pasteboard characters, 2D backstories and foreign locale, but no murder." [...] In further negative reviews, critics from The Guardian and the blog Marshall and the Movies criticized the film for having a colonialist and orientalist point of view towards India.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{and white}} blood cell {{production}} is regulated with great precision in healthy humans, {{and the production of}} leukocytes is rapidly increased during infection. The proliferation and <b>self-renewal</b> of these cells depend on growth factors. One of the key players in <b>self-renewal</b> and development of haematopoietic cells is stem cell factor (SCF), which binds to the c-kit receptor on the HSC. [...] Absence of SCF is lethal. There are other important glycoprotein growth factors which regulate the proliferation and maturation, such as interleukins IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7. Other factors, termed colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), specifically stimulate the production of committed cells. Three CSFs are granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and macrophage CSF (M-CSF).|$|E
2500|$|Tower-shaped City was a 300 metre tall tower {{that housed}} the {{infrastructure}} for an entire city. It included transportation, services and a manufacturing plant for prefabricated houses. The tower was vertical [...] "artificial land" [...] onto which steel, pre-fabricated dwelling capsules could be attached. Kikutake proposed that these capsules would undergo <b>self-renewal</b> every fifty years and the city would grow organically like branches of a tree.|$|E
2500|$|In later work, Till and McCulloch {{were joined}} by {{graduate}} student Andy Becker. [...] They cemented their stem cell theory and in 1963 published their results in Nature. In the same year, in collaboration with Lou Siminovitch, a trailblazer for molecular biology in Canada, they obtained evidence that these same marrow cells were capable of <b>self-renewal,</b> a crucial aspect of the functional definition of stem cells that they had formulated.|$|E
2500|$|The Notch pathway is {{essential}} for maintaining NPCs in the developing brain. Activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain NPCs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the critical components of the pathway cause precocious neuronal differentiation and NPC depletion. Modulators of the Notch signal, e.g., the Numb protein are able to antagonize Notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the Fibroblast Growth Factor pathway promotes Notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating cortical surface area growth and, potentially, gyrification. [...] In this way, Notch signaling controls NPC <b>self-renewal</b> as well as cell fate specification.|$|E
2500|$|Pluripotent {{adult stem}} cells are rare and {{generally}} small in number, {{but they can be}} found in umbilical cord blood and other tissues. Bone marrow is a rich source of {{adult stem cells}}, which have been used in treating several conditions including liver cirrhosis, chronic limb ischemia [...] and endstage heart failure. The quantity of bone marrow stem cells declines with age and is greater in males than females during reproductive years. Much adult stem cell research to date has aimed to characterize their potency and <b>self-renewal</b> capabilities. [...] DNA damage accumulates with age in both stem cells and the cells that comprise the stem cell environment. [...] This accumulation is considered to be responsible, at least in part, for increasing stem cell dysfunction with aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).|$|E
2500|$|Two {{models for}} {{hematopoiesis}} have been proposed: determinism and stochastic theory. For {{the stem cells}} and other undifferentiated blood cells in the bone marrow, the determination is generally explained by the determinism theory of haematopoiesis, saying that colony stimulating factors and other factors of the haematopoietic microenvironment determine the cells to follow a certain path of cell differentiation. This is the classical way of describing haematopoiesis. In stochastic theory, undifferentiated blood cells differentiate to specific cell types by randomness. This theory has been supported by experiments showing that within a population of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, underlying stochastic variability {{in the distribution of}} Sca-1, a stem cell factor, subdivides the population into groups exhibiting variable rates of cellular differentiation. For example, under the influence of erythropoietin (an erythrocyte-differentiation factor), a subpopulation of cells (as defined by the levels of Sca-1) differentiated into erythrocytes at a sevenfold higher rate {{than the rest of the}} population. [...] Furthermore, it was shown that if allowed to grow, this subpopulation re-established the original subpopulation of cells, supporting the theory that this is a stochastic, reversible process. Another level at which stochasticity may be important is in the process of apoptosis and <b>self-renewal.</b> In this case, the haematopoietic microenvironment prevails upon some of the cells to survive and some, on the other hand, to perform apoptosis and die. By regulating this balance between different cell types, the bone marrow can alter the quantity of different cells to ultimately be produced.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of <b>self-renewal</b> and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling. [...] Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of hematopoiesis including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E
60|$|There is {{an answer}}: {{it is an}} answer {{to say that the}} energy is truly from outside the world; that it is psychic, or {{at least one of the}} results of a real psychical disturbance.

50|$|In Dnmt3a-/- mice, many genes {{associated}} with HSC <b>self-renewal</b> increase in expression and some fail to be appropriately repressed during differentiation. This suggests abrogation of differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{and an increase}} in <b>self-renewal</b> cell-division instead. Indeed, it was found that differentiation was partially rescued if Dnmt3a-/- HSCs experienced an additional Ctnb1 knockdown - Ctnb1 codes for β-catenin, which participates in <b>self-renewal</b> cell division.|$|E
50|$|Stem cell <b>self-renewal</b> {{is thought}} {{to occur in the}} stem cell niche in the bone marrow, and it is {{reasonable}} to assume that key signals present in this niche will be important in <b>self-renewal.</b> There is much interest in the environmental and molecular requirements for HSC <b>self-renewal,</b> as understanding the ability of HSC to replenish themselves will eventually allow the generation of expanded populations of HSC in vitro that can be used therapeutically.|$|E
5000|$|The neurosphere assay {{examines}} three fundamental {{characteristics of}} neural stem cells: proliferation, <b>self-renewal,</b> and multipotency. [...] <b>Self-renewal</b> and multipotency are {{the requirements for}} cells to be considered stem cells. The neurosphere assay, or stemness assay, {{has been used to}} confirm that neurospheres contain neural stem cells. Neurospheres are dissociated and distributed into single-cell wells to examine <b>self-renewal</b> through clonal analysis. A small percentage of cells reform into a secondary neurosphere. The secondary neurospheres are then transferred into a culture medium containing growth factors that promote cell differentiation. The presence of varying cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, confirms the multipotency of these precursor cells. The evidence of <b>self-renewal</b> and multipotency serves to confirm the presence of neural stem cells within neurospheres, and emphasizes that neural stem cells comprise {{only a fraction of the}} neurosphere.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the findings at CRI, Morrison's laboratory has discovered a number of critical mechanisms that distinguish stem cell <b>self-renewal</b> from the proliferation of restricted progenitors. They have shown that stem cell <b>self-renewal</b> is regulated by networks of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors and that the balance between proto-oncogenic and tumor suppressor signals changes with age. This likely explains why the mutation spectrum changes with age in cancer patients, as different mechanisms become competent to hyper-activate <b>self-renewal</b> pathways in patients at different ages. His laboratory has further shown that in some cancers many tumor cells are capable of driving disease growth and progression while other cancers are driven by minority subpopulations of cancer cells that adopt stem cell characteristics. These insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of <b>self-renewal</b> have suggested new approaches for promoting normal tissue regeneration and cancer treatment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Self-renewal</b> {{process is}} highly {{regulated}} from cell cycle and genetic transcription control. There are some signaling pathways, such as LIF/JAK/STAT3 (Leukemia inhibitory factor/Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and BMP/SMADs/Id (Bone morphogenetic proteins/ Mothers against decapentaplegic/ Inhibitor of differentiation), mediated by transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and others components, {{and they are}} responsible for <b>self-renewal</b> genes expression and inhibition of differentiation genes expression, respectively.|$|E
