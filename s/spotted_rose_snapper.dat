Five species of dactylogyrids {{were found on the}} gills of their hosts: Haliotrematoides guttati (García-Vargas, Fajer-Ávila, & Lamothe-Argumedo, 2008), H. plectridium Kristky and Mendoza-Franco in Kritsky, Tingbao, & Yuan, 2009, H. spinatus Kristky and Mendoza-Franco in Kritsky et al. (2009), Euryhaliotrema perezponcei García-Vargas, Fajer-Ávila & Lamothe-Argumedo, 2008 and E. mehen (Soler-Jiménez, García-Gasca, & Fajer-Avila, 2012). Freshly {{collected}} specimens provided an opportunity to study and compare specimens from different localities in further detail and few morphological characters were added to the description of each species. Additionally, a fragment of 856 bp of the 28 S ribosomal RNA (D 1 –D 3) was obtained for all the sampled monogeneans, and a phylogenetic analysis along with all available sequences of dactylogyrids was conducted to establish the systematic position of the species within the Ancyrocephalinae. Our results suggest that species of Haliotrema might be included in Haliotrematoides genus.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{protocol for}} hormonal induction of spawning in <b>spotted</b> <b>rose</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus guttatus) resulted in increased spawning efficiency in newly-caught wild breeders and wild-caught adults maintained in captivity {{for more than}} a year. A controlled-release delivery system (implant) based on an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAc) matrix was loaded with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). The required GnRHa dose was established in two stages. The first stage included meta-analysis of our earlier experiments with wild spawners; the second stage included new experiments with wild and captive breeders. A nomograph was devel- oped to calculate the required GnRHa implant dose, taking into account the origin of the female (wild vs. captive), the initial mean oocyte diameter, and body weight. The effective GnRHa dose was greater in wild than captive females and, in both cases, inversely related to mean oocyte diameter. Using this nomograph, over half the wild females with a mean oocyte diam- eter of ≥ 425 μm and over half the captive females with a mean oocyte diam- eter of ≥ 350 μm responded to GnRHa implant treatment (producing multi- ple spawning events in captives), with mean total relative fecundity ranging 80 - 278 x 103 eggs/kg body weight and 51 - 85 % fertilization success. The nomograph can be used to calculate the GnRHa implant dose required to induce spawning in this species under commercial aquaculture conditions...|$|E

40|$|Ectoparasitic monogeneans cause {{problems}} in aquacul-ture worldwide; {{they include the}} dactylogyrids that affect lutjanids and barramundi in southeast Asia (Whittington 2005). Dactylogyrid monogeneans, such as Haliotrema-toides spp. and Euryhaliotrema spp., are common on the gills of the wild and cultured <b>spotted</b> <b>rose</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutja-nus guttatus (steindachner) (see Fajer-Ávila et al. 2007), a fish that is important in aquaculture (Álvarez-Lajonchere et al. 2007). High levels of infection can cause a general stress response with potentially harmful effects on the farmed fish (Del Río-Zaragoza et al.   2010). Most species of monogeneans are restricted not only to a particular host but also to a particular body part of the host (turgut et al. 2006). gill-infecting dactylogyrid monogeneans commonly exhibit a narrow site-specificity (Dzika 1999, lo and Morand 2000, simková et al. 2000, turgut et al. 2006). {{the effect of these}} gill preferences is not clear, and many host and environmental factors could be involved (Pie et al. 2006). the variation in parasite dis-tribution on the gills could be due to a response to water currents (llewellyn 1956, Paling 1969), differences in the area between the gill arches (Buchmann 1989), aggrega-tion of parasites for mating (rohde et al. 1995), avoidance of interspecific  competition  (Simková  et  al.   2000),  rein-forcement of reproductive barriers to prevent hybridisation (Šimková and Morand 2008) or migration driven by host immunity (Buchmann and Bresciani 1998). Microhabi-tat distribution and niche restriction also seem to be af-fected by seasonal variation (rohde 1991), the size and development of the host and ecological and morphologi-cal differences between monogenean species (Dzika 1999, chapman et al. 2000, Šimková et al. 2002). other authors suggest that several of these factors may act synergisticall...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of replacing fish meal protein {{at different levels}} with poultry by product meal food grade (PBM-FG) was assessed in diets for <b>spotted</b> <b>rose</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus guttatus. Four diets were formulated, the control diet fish meal {{was used as the}} main protein source (FM); the other three diets had increasing levels of PBM-FG replacing 25, 50 or 75 % of the fish meal protein respectively. The diets were fed close to apparent satiation, three times a day to quadruplicate groups of juvenile snapper (average body weight 11. 0 ± 0. 04 g). The fish were randomly distributed into groups of 15 fish in a 120 L seawater tank. The response of snapper to diets containing graded levels of fish meal was evaluated by measuring weight gain, feed efficiency, body composition, hematological parameters and apparent nutrient digestibility during a 12 -week period. The replacing of the 25 % of fish meal protein by PBM-FG did show a similar trend for feed efficiency and growth performance than control diet. Feed efficiency and growth performance was reduced at 75 % level of fish meal protein replacement by PBM-FG, due to deficiencies of lysine and methionine. The final whole-body proximate composition did not differ among treatments. The hematological characteristics were similar among the treatments control, 25 and 50 %, but the fish fed PBM-FG 75 % showed the lowest levels for total protein and glucose parameters. The dietary dry matter and protein apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) decreased with increasing dietary PBM-FG. High values for lipid ADCs were observed in all diets...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Many {{regions of}} the world have very few stocks assessed, often due to limited data quality or {{quantity}} or lack of trained scientists to apply and interpret stock assessments. These same areas with fewer assessments perform worse across fishery management attributes, including research capacity, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics. Some studies have used the limited data available to approximate the status of these “unassessed” stocks and find them to be declining compared to assessed stocks. Global assessments of “unassessed” stocks are informed by many attributes of the stock, one of which is the trend in reported catch to the U. N. Food and Agriculture Organization. These assessments assume that the catch data are accurate, at least in trend if not in magnitude. However, quantifying catch is a major challenge due to commonly misreported sectors such as discards, small-scale, recreational, and illegal, unreported, unregulated fisheries. One approach is to improve catch data by improving monitoring programs or conducting catch reconstructions. Another approach is to collect alternative data types to conduct stock assessments. Stocks that are not assessed because they have the lowest information or research capacity appear more likely to be unsustainable, and further research and management action is required to improve the status of the data- and research-capacity-limited fisheries. This dissertation addresses issues of data quality in the monitoring process and data limitation in the assessment process. Chapter 1 addresses an issue of data quality in asking, “does unreported catch lead to overfishing?” We used simulation analysis to demonstrate that if catch is misreported at a constant rate, surplus production models can still estimate unbiased stock status and would avoid overfishing with effective management. If catch misreporting is increasing over time, stock assessments would recommend harvest limits that would lead to under-exploitation, while decreasing reporting rates lead to over-exploitation. This question is relevant to fisheries around the world dealing with uncertainties in catch reporting in their stock assessment, as well as current debates over the use of catch reconstructions. In Chapter 2 stock assessments are examined for fisheries that only have length composition data and biological information, since it is often easier to collect length measurements than to quantify total catch. Length measurements from samples of the catch, referred to as length composition data, can be contrasted with expected length composition in an unfished state to reveal information about fishing mortality, recruitment, and selectivity. Most data-poor length-based stock assessment methods assume the population is in equilibrium, i. e. that fishing mortality and recruitment have not changed within one generation of the species. In this chapter we present a Length-based Integrated Mixed Effects (LIME) model that relaxes this equilibrium assumption and directly estimates variable fishing mortality and recruitment using the same data inputs as other length-based methods. Using simulation testing we demonstrated LIME performs best for life history types with a maximum age of less than 20 years, and is unbiased across a range of recruitment and fishing mortality patterns, provided individual growth parameters are known. LIME also has the capability of including multiple years of length data, abundance indices, and catch time series when available. LIME is a flexible new tool for stock assessments of fish usually caught as bycatch and other small-scale fisheries. Chapter 3 applies LIME and the equilibrium-based Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LB-SPR) methods to assess a medium-lived Costa Rican <b>spotted</b> <b>rose</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus guttatus, and short-lived Kenyan rabbitfish, Siganus sutor. LIME estimated the Costa Rican snapper fishery to be overfished in the most recent year of data after a period of full exploitation, whereas LB-SPR estimated more variability in stock status throughout the time series but the fishery was above the target reference point in the most recent year of data. LIME estimated the rabbitfish fishery to have undergone a period of overexploitation in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, but fishing mortality has continually decreased over time resulted in a recovered stock in the most recent year of data. Alternatively, LB-SPR estimated the stock slightly less than the SPR target. Chapter 3 presented the first empirical LIME assessment and comparison with a commonly-used alternative method, and presented guidelines for future LIME applications...|$|E

The combination of <b>rose</b> <b>spots</b> (figure 1), clinical symptoms, travel history, and mild {{elevation of the}} patient’s aspartate ami-notransferase and alanine transaminase levels all supported the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Patients usually present with pro-gressive fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea and sometimes present with respiratory symptoms. Typhoid fever is usually caused by infection due to Salmonella enterica se-rotype Typhi or, less commonly, by infection due to S. enterica serotype Paratyphi. The duration of incubation is usually 10 – 14 days, and humans are the only natural host [1]. Typhoid fever is endemic to many parts of Asia and is usually transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water. <b>Rose</b> <b>spots</b> (figure 1) are a rare finding; they are present after {{the first week of}} symptoms in only 5 %– 30 % of cases and typically last only 2 – 3 days [1].
