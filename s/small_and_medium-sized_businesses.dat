40|$|The {{development}} {{of small business}} in Poland began only after the change of the economic system. Small business in the initial stage o f the transformation successfully contributed to diminishing unemployment, and consequently lessened {{the negative effects of}} the liquidation and restructuring of state-owned companies, particularly in the areas that could not attract investment for their lack of appropriate infrastructure. After Poland joins the EU, <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> companies will also have a fundamental role in maintaining the high pace of economic growth. To fulfil that role, however, <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business</b> companies will need appropriate national policies. The ways of supporting <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business</b> have not been effective so far. The policies on this sector have been asynchronous if at all visible, while the measures have had only short-term effects. Consequently, the necessity arises to restructure the approach toward supporting <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business</b> so that the funds invested in that sector are not wasted. In the article an attempt has been made to formulate fundamental criteria that should constitute the basis for supporting <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business...</b>|$|R

25|$|Economic {{freedom in}} terms of technoliberalism {{involves}} small scale capitalism, that is capitalism for <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>businesses,</b> rather than corporate organizations created by major interest groups. Ideally, localized systems and community ties will {{pave the way for}} a new capitalist economy, undoing the power of global capitalism. Implemented trust regulations will compliment this, meaning more rules for big companies to create better competition, whereas smaller companies will be enforced with fewer rules. Technoliberalism places an emphasis on these <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>businesses</b> because it can help boost economic growth. Money spent by local authorities with small firms is re-spent into the local economy, compared to that spent with large businesses in the same area. Doing business this way then, is better value for money.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{prove that}} despite the active state policy carried out since {{the second half of}} the 2000 s and aimed at {{supporting}} <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business</b> in the Russian Federation, the current level of development of this economic sector is insufficient. The present paper characterizes the modern structure of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business.</b> The authors show that the main problems hindering its growth are conditioned by low market demand, large tax deductions, numerous administrative barriers, lack of funding and state support. On the basis of the official data of Russian Federal State Statistics Service on theresults of annual surveys of entrepreneurs, the authors revealed the factors that prevented innovation situation in the country have stable negative impact on MSB, while the impact of such factors as imperfect legal and regulatory framework, investment risks, low profitability and inadequate state of technological infrastructure is relatively nonsignificant. The authors describe systemwide and resource measures of state regulation of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business.</b> The system-wide measures include preferential access to production facilities and equipment, special tax regimes, administrative control. The measures of resource support to entrepreneurs consist in subsidizing the lease payments and interest rates on loans for the modernization of production; grant support, the establishment of microfinance organizations and guarantee funds, the development of business support infrastructure. The authors describe the forms of these measures implementation in 2013 and the main directions of improving the state regulation of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>business,</b> including the reduction of tax burden and facilitation of taxation procedures, the reduction of administrative barriers and ensuring access of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> enterprises to government orders and technological infrastructure...|$|R
25|$|Because of its {{conservative}} financial {{approach and}} its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared {{with many of}} its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated by <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>businesses,</b> rather than the large business groups. The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level {{not seen since the}} 1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election. Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002–2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4%.|$|E
25|$|Abruzzo's {{industrial}} sector expanded rapidly, especially in mechanical engineering, transportation equipment and telecommunications. The structure of {{production in the}} region reflects {{the transformation of the}} economy from agriculture to industry and services. Although industry has developed strongly, it retains weak points due to the existence of only a few large businesses alongside a huge fabric of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>businesses.</b> Both pure and applied research are carried out in the region, where there are major institutes and factories involved in research in the fields of pharmaceutics, biomedicine, electronics, aerospace and nuclear physics. The industrial infrastructure is spread throughout the region in industrial zones which have already been mentioned, the most important of which are Val Pescara, Val Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino. A further activity worthy of note is seaside and mountain tourism, which is of considerable importance to the economy of the region. Agriculture, involving small holdings, has succeeded in modernising and offering high-quality products. The mostly small, agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, sugar beet, potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Traditional products are saffron and liquorice. Most famous in the world is Abruzzo's wine Montepulciano d'Abruzzo; in the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as being {{one of the most widely}} exported DOC classed wine in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Taiwan has {{recovered}} quickly {{from the global}} financial crisis of 2007–2010, and its economy has been growing steadily. Its economy faced a downturn in 2009 due to a heavy reliance on exports which in turn made it vulnerable to world markets. Unemployment reached levels not seen since 2003, and the economy fell 8.36% {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2008. In response, the government launched a US$5.6 billion economic stimulus package (3% of its GDP), provided financial incentives for businesses, and introduced tax breaks. The stimulus package focused on infrastructure development, <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>businesses,</b> tax breaks for new investments, and low-income households. Boosting shipments to new overseas markets, such as Russia, Brazil, and the Middle East was also a main goal of the stimulus. The economy has since slowly recovered; by November 2010, Taiwan's unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low of 4.73%, and continued dropping to a 40-month low of 4.18% by the end of 2011. The average salary has also been rising steadily for each month in 2010, up 1.92% from the same period in 2009. Industrial output for November 2010 reached another high, up 19.37% from a year earlier, indicating strong exports and a growing local economy. Private consumption is also increasing, with retail sales up 6.4% compared to 2009. After 10.5% economic growth in 2010, the World Bank expected growth to continue and reach 5% for 2011.|$|E
