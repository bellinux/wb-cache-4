40|$|World {{currency}} network constitutes one of {{the most}} complex structures that is associated with the contemporary civilization. On a way towards quantifying its characteristics we study the cross correlations in changes of the daily foreign exchange rates within the basket of 60 currencies in the period December 1998 [...] May 2005. Such a dynamics turns out to predominantly involve one outstanding eigenvalue of the correlation matrix. The magnitude of this eigenvalue depends however crucially on which currency is used as a base currency for the remaining ones. Most prominent it looks {{from the perspective of a}} peripheral currency. This largest eigenvalue is seen to systematically decrease and thus the structure of correlations becomes more heterogeneous, when more <b>significant</b> <b>currencies</b> are used as reference. An extreme case in this later respect is the USD in the period considered. Besides providing further insight into subtle nature of complexity, these observations point to a formal procedure that in general can be used for practical purposes of measuring the relative currencies significance on various time horizons. ...|$|R

50|$|When {{currency}} is duplicated, {{it increases the}} overall {{amount of money in}} the virtual economy and increases prices in player-to-player transactions. In a 2005 case of currency duping in EverQuest II, the game's developers noticed an unexpected 20% rise in the total money found in the economy over a 24-hour period following the dissemination of the dupe. A <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> dupe in Star Wars Galaxies was found after the designers compared how much money was created versus how much money was destroyed and noted that, despite more money leaving the system than entering, they observed no shortage of money in the virtual world.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} dollarization (see Domestic liability dollarization) is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate. It {{refers to the}} situations where liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies (usually denominated in US dollar) while assets are in the local currency. Consequently. liability dollarization is also used interchangeably with currency mismatch. Under this currency mismatch, an unexpected depreciation of local currency would deteriorate bank and corporation's balance sheets, and the shrink in asset relative to foreign currency debts would threaten {{the stability of the}} financial system in local country. In countries with <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly. This could provide an argument for sterilized foreign market intervention.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{potential}} effect of Chinese superstition on returns in eight major currencies. We focus on market responses to days that are superstitiously deemed by the Chinese {{to be either}} lucky or unlucky. After controlling for the weekend and calendar month anomalies, our results suggest that lucky day 8 in the month is associated with <b>significant</b> lower <b>currency</b> returns for four currencies (Canadian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, and British Pounds). In contrast, lucky day 18 is associated with <b>significant</b> higher <b>currency</b> returns for Australian dollars, and unlucky day 24 is associated with significant higher returns for Euros. The results support the argument that Chinese manufacturers convert the foreign currency receipt into US dollars on day 8, and that Chinese companies buy Australian dollars on day 18, possibly to pay for importing natural resources.

40|$|IntroductionThis {{publication}} presents {{results in}} respect of 31 March 2013, from an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey of Australian resident enterprises with exposure to foreign currency. The survey covers all enterprises with <b>significant</b> foreign <b>currency</b> denominated balance sheet items and/or <b>significant</b> expected foreign <b>currency</b> denominated receipts or payments from trade. The information collected included foreign equity assets, foreign currency denominated debt assets and liabilities, expected future foreign currency receipts and payments from trade, the principal value of outstanding currency derivative contracts and policies on hedging foreign currency exposure. The survey was conducted by the ABS at the request of, and with the financial support of, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).

5000|$|The authors {{describe}} {{this as the}} [...] "German view" [...] of budget-cutting. The German view also includes the more traditional assumption that reducing government expenditures {{as a percent of}} GDP will lessen crowding out, making [...] "room for the private sector to expand" [...] which only operates when the economy is near full employment. The authors also did not provide a model for EFC but rather described conditions under which it was observed in Denmark from 1983-84 and Ireland from 1987-89, a period when the world was undergoing rapid interest rate declines and worldwide growth. These conditions included a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> devaluation prior to assuming a peg against a stable currency (Germany in Denmark's case), budget improvement through significant tax increases and spending cuts and sufficient liquidity that current disposable income did not constrain consumption. The authors stated that when current disposable income constrained consumption, [...] "Keynesian textbook propositions seem to recover their predictive power, as witnessed by the 7% drop in real consumption in 1982 during the first Irish stabilization." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Travel Balance Approach (TBA) {{model is}} {{premised on the}} notion that the {{economic}} development of a country, in general, and tourism development, in particular, will stimulate four sequential stages (namely, Introductory, Growth, Maturity and Decline stages) of a country’s travel balance. This paper uses an extension of the TBA and longitudinal tourism statistics from Australia to identify the critical factors that propel a country from the Decline stage to a fifth stage of Rejuvenation. These factors include, but are not restricted to, concerted government action with support from the tourism industry to promote the country overseas (particularly with theme years), collaborative efforts from the direct providers and indirect providers of tourism services, competitive airfares, deregulation, and <b>significant,</b> unexpected <b>currency</b> devaluations...|$|R

A central {{finding is that}} these episodes are very divergent and can be usefully classified, {{on the basis of}} cluster analysis, in three groups. A majority of cases is characterised by internal adjustment, exhibiting slowing domestic demand growth. In some cases, the adjustment was mainly external, facilitated by an exchange rate depreciation but without economic slowdown. Finally, some cases involved a crisis-like combination of a severe slowdown and a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation.

30|$|The {{seasonality}} {{analysis of}} this paper is motivated by the significant agricultural exports of Guatemala, which lead to <b>significant</b> foreign <b>currency</b> inflows after the harvest periods in every year. The seasonality analysis is also motivated by: (1) the relative importance of agricultural exports in Guatemala has decreased during the past decade, while (2) the relative importance of the non-seasonal receipt of loans, payment of loans and remittance payments to Guatemala have increased during the same period. We have found that the stochastic seasonality of the GTQ/USD exchange rate is significant, both statistically and economically. We have explained the changing amplitude for the period of January 1994 –June 2017 by the following points: (1) reducing growth rate of total exports; (2) reducing relative importance of total exports, and increasing relative importance of non-seasonal foreign currency movements (i.e. loans and remittance payments); (3) reducing relative importance of agricultural product exports to total exports.|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{currency}} denominated debt as {{an influence}} of exchange rate pressure during the 2008 global crisis is explored across 58 countries. Countries with higher ratios of foreign currency denominated debt to total international debt experienced <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation during the global crisis. Predicted values of foreign currency denominated indebtedness are obtained based on country characteristics by employing a double censored tobit model estimation technique. Comparison of actual to predicted values {{just prior to}} the crisis demonstrates whether or not countries are over-indebted. According to our analysis, over-indebted countries experienced higher rates of exchange rate depreciation in the global crisis of 2008. Additionally, oil exporters, countries with strong financial linkages with the US and net importers experienced significant depreciation. International reserve accumulation before the crisis is associated with currency appreciation during the crisis. However, this result is insignificantly estimated...|$|E

40|$|The {{regional}} {{effects of}} sharing {{a single currency}} on bilateral trade with other European Union member states are a contentious question. This paper examines the regional effects on trade of the set up of the euro as a common currency. It takes advantage of a gravity specification of bilateral trade between the seventeen Spanish regions and EU- 13 countries over the period 1997 - 2004 and accounts for two distinct effects depending on the temporal set up of the euro. That is, the exchange rate volatility effect (from exchange rate fixing of national currencies in 1999) is distinguished from the so-called common currency effect (resulting from the issuing of a new currency in 2002). Findings are suggestive of a regional concentration of currency union effects in a few regions, namely those relatively more open to trade, though such effects are found to fade away over time. Trade expansion for the set up of the euro ranges between 45 to 16 % depending on the specification, but only the exchange rate volatility effect of a common <b>currency</b> was found <b>significant,</b> pure <b>currency</b> union effects were instead found to be almost negligible. trade policy; regional policy; regions; EMU...|$|R
