25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} watch movements. Several manufacturers of mechanical watch movements have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, <b>shock</b> <b>resistant,</b> and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for watch movements are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|E

30|$|Introduction Septic shock {{remains a}} major health issue {{even in our}} industrialized countries, with {{described}} mortality rates between 11.4 and 24.3  % {{in the most recent}} European studies. Several international pediatric therapeutic guidelines have been published and widely diffused. As for epinephrine, they recommend its use as a first-line drug in cold <b>shocks</b> <b>resistant</b> to a well-conducted fluid resuscitation or as a second-line drug in “cold” <b>shocks</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopamine or “warm” <b>shocks</b> <b>resistant</b> to norepinephrine. However, those recommendations are only based on adult or neonatal references that can hardly be applied to children as the physiopathology of children’s septic shock is different on several aspects. Thus, our study constitutes the first specifically pediatric work on epinephrine use in septic shock.|$|R

40|$|Resistance to {{ampicillin}} in Escherichia coli is due {{generally to}} the presence of a β-lactamase (penicillinase). Resistant strains have been found to fall into two groups: those with high-level resistance (1, 000 μg/ml or greater) and those with low-level resistance (8 to 250 μg/ml). Most of the high-level resistant organisms posses β-lactamases whose synthesis is episomally mediated. These strains release penicillinase from the cell when they are subjected to osmotic <b>shock.</b> Low-level <b>resistant</b> strains do not release the enzyme with osmotic <b>shock.</b> High-level <b>resistant</b> strains are not susceptible to the synergistic action of a penicillinase-resistant penicillin with ampicillin. Seventy eight per cent of low-level resistant strains are susceptible to the synergistic action of ampicillin and oxacillin. The two types of β-lactamases are similar in regard to most properties; both enzymes are subject to competitive inhibition by penicillinase-resistant penicillins. The difference in location in the cell might explain why only some strains of E. coli are susceptible to the synergistic action of penicillin combinations...|$|R

40|$|Promoter–proximal pausing during {{transcriptional}} elongation is {{an important}} way of regulating many diverse loci, including the human hsp 70 gene. Pausing of RNA polymerase can be enhanced by chromatin structure. We demonstrate that activation of hsp 70 leads to disruption of transcribed chromatin in front of RNA polymerase.

Disruption of chromatin farther downstream also occurs following activation but is sensitive to α-amanitin, suggesting that polymerase movement is needed to disrupt distal portions of the hsp 70 gene.

40|$|Introduction: Management {{of severe}} vasoplegic shock in {{overdose}} {{can be very}} challenging. We describe a case of severe refractory vasodilatory shock in poisoning where methylene blue (MB) was used with success. However, the patient subsequently developed severe Serotonin Syndrome (SS) {{as a result of}} an interaction between serotonergic drugs and MB. Case Report: A 15 -year-old male developed severe vasoplegic shock 1. 5 hours after overdosing on several different medications including quetiapine slow release, quetiapine immediate release, desvenlafaxine slow release, venlafaxine, amlodipine, ramipril, fluoxetine, promethazine and lithium. His vasoplegic <b>shock</b> was <b>resistant</b> to high doses of noradrenaline and vasopressin. MB was administered 6. 5 hours post ingestion and within 1 hour there was an improvement in his hemodynamic status and reduction of catecholamine requirements. Twelve hours post ingestion, he developed severe Serotonin Syndrome that lasted 5 days as a result of interaction between MB, a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I), and the antidepressants taken in overdose. MB had a calculated half-life of 38 hours. Conclusion: MB is a useful additional strategy for severe drug induced vasodilatory shock and may be potentially life-saving. Clinicians should be aware that it can interact with other drugs and cause life-threatening Serotonin Syndrome. Lower doses or shorter durations may be wise in patients at risk of this interaction...|$|R
40|$|Author abstract]Tomato cultivars having {{different}} resistant-grades {{to tobacco}} mosaic virus (TMV) were inoculated with TMV-OM (ordinary strain) or TMV-TM (tomato strain). They were incubated at 25 ℃ under different light intensities. TMV concentration in tomato plants {{was determined by}} measuring the optical density at 260 nm of the resultant TMV nucleoprotein. In the resistant cultivar, Ogata-Zuiko (ZK) which shows top-necrosis (TN) by inoculation, TMV concentration increased 3 times under high light intensity (20, 000 lx) over that produced under dark, whereas in the susceptible cultivar, Fukuju No. 2 (F 2) which shows mosaic symptom, TMV concentration increased about 3 times under weak light intensity (3, 000 lx) and 5 tunes under high intensity over that produced under dark. Heat <b>shock</b> of <b>resistant</b> cultivar, ZK, at 45 ℃ for 10 min just before inoculation lowered TMV concentration as compared with that untreated. Phloem and phloem parenchymatous cells in the cross section of stem of resistant cultivar reacted with diazo and Schiff's reagents showing an accumulation of phenolic compounds i the phloem and its adjacent tissues. The occurrence of top-necrosis in the resistant cultivar, having a gene of Tm- 2 ^a, is discussed.
