5|$|The Barranca Blanca and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from Volcán Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya. They contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments, {{including}} mylonite and schist. The Barranca Blanca ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice. The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca Blanca ignimbrite. It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were <b>still</b> <b>hot</b> {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while <b>still</b> <b>hot,</b> as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is <b>still</b> <b>hot</b> and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E

25|$|In stage fifteen, it was <b>still</b> <b>hot,</b> and {{the riders}} were not {{motivated}} to race. They stopped {{during the race}} to cool down in the Mediterranean Sea, but were quickly ordered by Jacques Goddet to continue the race. The journalists that followed the race reported on this in a humorous way, and the organisation therefore fined them.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{variations}} of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed {{after it has}} solidified, but while <b>still</b> <b>hot.</b> It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).|$|E
25|$|Floral (millefiori) and spiral patterns: This was {{produced}} by binding rods of coloured glass together and heating and fusing them into a single piece. These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused together, and then wound round a glass rod whilst <b>still</b> <b>hot</b> to produce a spiral pattern. Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be {{fused together to form}} a plate or fused to plain glass.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} of 18 July 2013 at 8:20a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the {{destroyed}} building and preparing to remove rubble from the place, showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear where it came from. Although there was {{no change in the}} afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled. According to TEPCO rain could have found its way to the primary containment of the reactor, and because this vessel was <b>still</b> <b>hot,</b> it could cause the steam.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture needles {{during this}} period were much thicker than most modern ones and often {{resulted}} in infection. Infection {{is caused by a}} lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time. Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were <b>still</b> <b>hot,</b> creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} glassblowing {{was found by}} Roman Ghirshman in Chogha Zanbil, where many glass bottles {{were found in the}} excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site. Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, dated from 37 to 4 BC. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while <b>still</b> <b>hot</b> to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} floats, {{including most}} Japanese glass fishing floats, were handmade by a glassblower. Recycled glass, especially old sake bottles, was typically used and air bubbles {{in the glass}} {{are a result of}} the rapid recycling process. After being blown, floats were removed from the blowpipe and sealed with a 'button' of melted glass before being placed in a cooling oven. (This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark. However, no pontil (or punty) was used in the process of blowing glass floats.) While floats were <b>still</b> <b>hot</b> and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.|$|E
25|$|The earlier erupted {{group of}} {{volcanic}} deposits at Cinder Cone, which are relatively titanium-poor, consist {{of the older}} scoria cone, the Old Bench flow, the two Painted Dunes flows, and {{the lower part of}} the widespread ash layer. The later erupted, relatively titanium-rich group consists of the large, younger scoria cone, the upper part of the ash layer, and the two Fantastic Lava Beds flows. Flow 2 of the Fantastic Lava Beds (see geologic map) is the flow that everyone but Diller thought had been erupted in 1851. The ash on the Old Bench and Painted Dunes lava flows is brightly oxidized because it fell on the lava flows when they were <b>still</b> <b>hot.</b> This oxidized ash belongs to the same compositional group as the Fantastic Lava Beds flows, the last flows erupted at Cinder Cone. All the volcanic materials at Cinder Cone therefore represent a single eruptive sequence that probably spanned no more than a few months.|$|E
25|$|A box cooker has a {{transparent}} glass or plastic top, {{and it may}} have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but <b>still</b> <b>hot</b> enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|E
