500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> and {{made me feel good}} about being an artist." [...] Like many young people in the area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really know what he was doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E
500|$|Villa {{admitted}} that he came close to giving up football {{at the age of}} 14 after growing disillusioned and falling out with his coach. However, thanks to his parents' encouragement, he persisted in pursuing his dream, realising his talent could earn him a living. [...] "In those days I was a nobody, not earning a penny and after being made to sit on the bench all season I just wanted to get away and play with my friends" [...] he said. [...] "But my dad always <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> and cheered me up until my career turned round." [...] He went on to begin his footballing career at UP Langreo and when he turned 17 he joined the Mareo football school.|$|E

In his study, Cai divides mental existence into two types: mental existence without material <b>support</b> (<b>ME</b> 1) and with physical <b>support</b> (<b>ME</b> 2). There {{are two kinds}} of ME 1, spirit and demon. There {{are two kinds of}} ME 2, human and medium. After distinguishing between these forms of mental existence, Cai defines religion as an association between two types of mental existence (2013).|$|R

500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids <b>supported</b> <b>me,</b> which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California, the son of film {{producer}} and screenwriter Naomi Foner (née Achs) and film director Stephen Gyllenhaal. Actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, his older sister, appeared {{with him in the}} film Donnie Darko. Gyllenhaal's father, who was raised as a Swedenborgian, is of Swedish and English descent, and is a descendant of the Swedish noble Gyllenhaal family. Jake's last ancestor to be born in Sweden was his great-great-grandfather, Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal. Jake's mother is Jewish, and {{was born in}} New York City to a family from Russia and Poland. Gyllenhaal has said that he considers himself Jewish. On his 13th birthday, Gyllenhaal performed a [...] "barmitzvah-like act, without the typical trappings", volunteering at a homeless shelter because his parents wanted to give him a sense of gratitude for his privileged lifestyle. His parents insisted that he have summer jobs to support himself and he thus worked as a lifeguard and as a busboy at a restaurant operated by a family friend. Gyllenhaal said his parents encouraged artistic expression: [...] "I do have parents who constantly <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> in certain ways. In other ways, they were lacking. Definitely, it's in expression and creativity where my family has always been best at." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, reports {{speculated that}} Knight {{requested}} {{to be released}} from his contract and that [...] "they were working out the details" [...] at that time. In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a [...] "breakdown in communication" [...] with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a [...] "hilarious, ridiculous rumor". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: [...] "Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely grateful to {{have had the opportunity to}} play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. I continue to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly thank all of the fans who have <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> and the show with such passion and enthusiasm." [...] In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: [...] "I think I speak for the entire Grey's Anatomy family when I say we wish T.R. Knight the best in his future endeavors. He is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, Delia is {{rushed to}} {{hospital}} after spiking a high temperature of 105, {{where she is}} diagnosed with leukemia, devastating Chloe. SoapNet noted that [...] "Chloe's world is turned upside down" [...] {{as a result of}} the diagnosis. The leukemia storyline spans into January 2012. Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> through the entire shooting day, and the writing. It was just all wrapped up in a neat little package. I could not ask for a better show." [...] Delia needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I got to show a lot of range, and also got to work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare. In light of Chloe's marriage to Kevin ending and Billy experiencing troubles in his marriage to Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Jamey Giddens of Zap2it observed that this could act as a catalyst towards a [...] "Chilly" [...] (Chloe and Billy) reunion, writing, [...] "The perfect storm of two failing marriages and a sick child seems to be conjuring up the right elements for some Chilly weather in Genoa City." ...|$|E
2500|$|He persevered, {{and became}} the first ever to reach the Pole solo.

2500|$|The controversy, however, {{did not end}} there. In {{response}} to McEnroe's on-court outbursts during the Championships, the All England Club did not accord McEnroe honorary club membership, an honor normally given to singles champions after their first victory. McEnroe responded by not attending the traditional champions' dinner that evening. He told the press: [...] "I wanted to spend the evening with {{my family and friends}} and the people who had <b>supported</b> <b>me,</b> not a bunch of stiffs who are 70–80 years old, telling you that you're acting like a jerk." [...] The honor was eventually accorded to McEnroe after he won the championship again.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on his victory, he said: [...] "I {{just want}} to {{dedicate}} this championship to my family, and all my close friends who have <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> through my career. Spain is not a country with an F1 culture, {{and we had to}} fight alone, every step of the way, to make this happen. A huge thank-you should also go to the team as well– they are the best in Formula One, and we have done this together. It will say that I am world champion, but we are all champions– and they deserve this." [...] In the May 2007 issue of F1 Racing, Alonso said that the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix was his greatest race.

His reoccurrence of cancer is devastating and I wish him a full recovery. I know firsthand that Eric is a fighter and I have full confidence that he will beat cancer once again. I have received numerous calls and emails today regarding my political future and I truly appreciate {{all of those who}} believed in me and <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> during my 28 years of public service. I will address any political decisions in the future but right now it is important for Eric to get the treatment that he needs to recover." [...] Since that time, Kuhl has become more public and has been issuing more public statements and granting interviews to local radio station WLEA, primarily about the Massa situation. He was considering entering the special election for the vacant seat, but passed on it, endorsing former Corning mayor Tom Reed.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Burroughs High School in 1990, he began {{playing in a}} band called of All Things he formed with two friends, {{covering}} songs by Descendents, Social Distortion and Bad Religion, as well as writing original punk numbers. The group primarily performed at friend's parties and bonfires, and once played Oasis, the local music venue. Hoppus left Ridgecrest in summer 1992 to attend college {{and get a job}} at a local music store in San Diego. Hoppus continued playing gigs with of All Things, returning on weekends. Eventually, Hoppus' manager became suspicious of his weekend activities (Hoppus having told him he worked with mentally disabled children in Ridgecrest) and refused any time off on weekends. His [...] "short lived attempt" [...] at college, studying at California State University, San Marcos, revolved around plans to become an English teacher. He recalls he [...] "hated" [...] college and his reasoning behind becoming a teacher involved sights set for educational reform. He dropped out in the early 1990s after [...] "things began to take off with Blink-182" [...] and lived with his mother for many of {{the early years of the}} band. Hoppus describes his mother as always supportive in his decisions to drop out of college and tour with Blink-182; however, he describes his father as [...] "more realistic, [...] he said, 'Have something to fall back on.'" [...] "I'm really fortunate that my mom always completely <b>supported</b> <b>me,</b> even to the point that I dropped out of college and lived at her house for five years before our band started to catch on," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s shops such as Laura Ashley (whose first London outlet opened in 1968) were {{routinely}} promoting the [...] "peasant look" [...] and selling {{a range of}} [...] "uniquely eccentric clothes ... The magic was being able to step into a 'Laura Ashley' dress and imagine you had found {{something out of a}} dressing-up box". At around the same time too, and into the 1970s, the brassière (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation {{in the early part of}} the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic Germaine Greer (The Female Eunuch, 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of [...] "bra burning" [...] in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, Carry On Girls, and a poster by Young & Rubicam, one of a mildly subversive series for Smirnoff vodka: [...] "I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of women's [...] "liberation". A Vermont lawyer later observed wryly that [...] "like every good feminist-in-training in the sixties, I burned my bra", but that [...] "now it's the nineties ... I realize Playtex [...] had <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> better than any man I know." [...] Claire Perry, who became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 2010 and later a government minister, reflected that, as a [...] "women's officer" [...] at Oxford University in the early 1980s, she was [...] "a bra-burning feminist with a hideous new-romantic haircut", but that her feminism had, in her view, matured.|$|E
