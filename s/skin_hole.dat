40|$|The {{performance}} of a riveted patch repair, applied on a cracked panel, is simulated by using both a commercially available Boundary Element code (BEASY) and a Finite Element code (ANSYS). A two-dimensional stress analysis on a single-sided repaired configuration is performed by both methodologies; consequently, the occurrence of out-of-plane bending {{and its effect on}} the through-thickness SIF (Stress Intensity Factor) variation is neglected. The connection between the two layers (patch and panel) is realised by 32 rivets, with through-cracks initiated on the most loaded holes.

40|$|In this work, the {{performance}} of a new methodology, based on the Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM) and applied to reinforced cracked aeronautic panels, is assessed. Such procedure is mainly based on two-dimensional stress analyses, whereas the three-dimensional modelling, always implemented in conjunction with the sub-modelling approach, is limited to those situations in which the so-called ‚Äúsecondary bending‚Äù effects cannot be neglected. The connection between the different layers (patches and main panel) is realised by rivets: a peculiar original arrangement of the rivet configuration in the two-dimensional DBEM model allows {{to take into account the}} real in-plane panel stiffness and the transversal rivet stiffness, even with a two dimensional approach. Different in plane loading configurations are considered, depending on the presence of a biaxial or uniaxial remote load. The nonlinear hole/rivet contact, is simulated by gap elements when needed. The most stressed <b>skin</b> <b>holes</b> are highlighted, and the effect of through the thickness cracks, initiated from the aforementioned holes, is analysed in terms of stress redistribution, SIF evaluation and crack propagation. The two-dimensional approximation for such kind of problems is generally not detrimental to the accuracy level, due the low thickness of involved panels, and is particularly efficient for studying varying reinforcement configurations, where reduced run times and a lean pre-processing phase are prerequisites. The accuracy of the proposed approach is assessed by comparison with Finite Element Method (FEM) results and experimental tests available in literature. This approach aims at providing a general purpose prediction tool useful to improve the understanding of the fatigue resistance of aeronautic panels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{stress state}} {{around the middle}} (<b>skin)</b> plate <b>hole</b> of double-lap single bolted joints are {{investigated}} under an initial clamping force. Two different materials are considered for the middle plate: a quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite laminate and an aluminum alloy 7075 -T 6 plate. The outer (splice) plates are aluminum alloy 7075 -T 6 for both cases. The noncommercial FE code ANSYS vl 2. 0 {{is used for the}} analyses [1]. Linear solid brick elements are used to model the aluminum plates and the composite laminate. One element per layer approach is employed in through-the-thickness direction to model the laminated composite plate. The bolt and the washer are modeled as a single linear elastic deformable solid body. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to define the contact behavior between the joint members including the effect of friction. Comparison of the stress results show that the clamping force has a significantly different effect for composite and aluminum plates. Initial clamping force introduces beneficial compressive stresses for aluminum plate whereas both tensile and compressive stresses occur for the composite laminate. The stress analysis results are used to explain the phenomena behind the different clamping force responses...|$|R

The {{applicability of the}} method for fabricating microstructures and removing residual PDMS is also verified. The etch rate of PDMS was dominantly influenced by the gas flux ratio of CF 4 /O 2 and the microwave power. While the PDMS etch rate increased as the flux ratio of CF 4 was increased, the etch rate decreased as the flux ratio of O 2 was increased. The maximum etch rate of 4. 31 Œºm min‚àí 1 was achieved when mixing oxygen (O 2) and tetrafluoromethane (CF 4) at a 1 : 2 ratio at 800 W power. The PDMS etch rate almost linearly increased with the microwave power.

40|$|The {{search of}} optimal {{variants}} for composite repair patches allows {{to increase the}} service life of a damaged air- plane structure. To sensibly choose the way of repair, {{it is necessary to}} have a computational complex to predict the stress- strain condition of "structure-adhesive-patch" system and {{to take into account the}} damage growth considering the material properties change. The variant of the computational complex based on inclusion method is proposed. For calculation purposes the repair bonded joint is divided into two areas: a metal plate with patch-shaped hole and a "patch-adhesive layer-skin" composite plate (inclusion). Calculation stages:Evaluation of the patch influence to the skin stress-strain condition, stress distribution between skin and patch in the case of no damage. Calculation of the stress-strain condition is performed separately for the <b>skin</b> with <b>hole</b> and for the inclusion; solutions are coupled based on strain compatibility. Definition of the damage growth parameters at new stress-strain condition due to bonded patch existence. Skincrack stress intensity factors are found to identify the crack growth velocity. Patch is modelled as a set of "springs" bridging the crack. Degradation analysis of elasticity properties for the patch material. Repair effectiveness is evaluated with respect to crack growth velocity reduction in the initial material in compari- son with the case of the patch absence. Calculation example for the crack repair effectiveness depending on number of loading cycles for the 7075 -T 6 aluminum skin is given. Repair patches are carbon-epoxy, glass-epoxy and boron-epoxy material systems with quasi- isotropic layup and GLARE hybrid metal-polymeric material. The analysis shows the high effectiveness of the carbon-epoxy patch. Due to low stiffness, the glass-epoxy patchdemonstrates the least effectiveness. GLARE patch containing the fiberglass plies oriented across the crack has the same effectiveness as the carbon and boron patches. Proposed bonded repair calculation method and corresponding computational model allow to analyze effectively the possible structural damage cases and to select optimal variant of patch installation subject to material durability undercyclic loads. Lack of this information may lead to establishing the inadequate inspection intervals of the damage locationand may reflect on economic factors of the airplane maintenance and flight safety...|$|R
40|$|Today's highly {{competitive}} {{environment in the}} commercial air transportation business instigates airline companies to continue operating their aircrafts beyond the design life, {{as long as the}} maintenance ascertaining their safe operation is more cost-effective than the investment into a new aircraft. In the context of damage tolerance of aging aircrafts, the residual strength of the fuselage skin damaged by multiple fatigue cracks received considerable attention. In the stress field of the fuselage <b>skin,</b> the rivet <b>holes</b> of the <b>skin</b> splice joints constitute a number of stress concentrations, where multi-site damage (MSD) may develop: several small cracks may coalesce to form a large crack, after which damage may progress fast to ultimate failure. The small cracks may also lead to widespread fatigue damage (WFD), where unstable crack growth of a lead crack becomes possible due to strength reduction. As experimental work revealed clearly the stochastic nature of MSD and WFD failure, a realistic analysis of the uncertainties is necessary. It is the aim of this paper to develop a probabilistic framework for lifetime predictions of aircraft fuselages with MSD or WFD which incorporates an efficient method frequently employed in deterministic analyses, the finite element alternating method (FEAM). The uncertainties are characterised by random variables and importance sampling is applied in order to obtain robust and efficient estimations of the failure probability {{as a function of the}} cycle number.

Puncturing an artery cause significant bleeding; the piercing will likely have to be reset. This piercing is sometimes recommended to be done with an erect penis to avoid the chance of the piercing pinching when the penis becomes erect; unfortunately this practice leads to even more bleeding as both erectile chambers of the penis are engorged with blood while it is erect. In order to prevent blood loss this piercing is usually accomplished with a specially made piece of jewelry that does the piercing and then shortened and remains in place throughout the healing process, as rare as the piercing is, there are very few that succeed in fully healing, the first manner is by cauterization after the jewelry is in its final position whereby the jewelry is heated to a point that it sears the inner tissues of the corpora cavernosa.
