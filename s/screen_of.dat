40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the costs and}} effects of alternative strategies for annual <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> school children for refractive errors, {{and the provision of}} spectacles, in different WHO sub-regions in Africa, Asia, America and Europe. METHODS: We developed a mathematical simulation model for uncorrected refractive error, using prevailing prevalence and incidence rates. Remission rates reflected the absence or presence <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> strategies for school children. All screening strategies were implemented for a period of 10 years and were compared to a situation were no screening was implemented. Outcome measures were life years adjusted for disability (DALYs), costs <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> and provision <b>of</b> spectacles and follow-up for six different screening strategies, and cost-effectiveness in international dollars per DALY averted. Epidemiological information was derived from the burden of disease study from the World Health Organization (WHO). Cost data were derived from large databases from the WHO. Both univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed on key parameters to determine the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: In all regions, <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> 5 - 15 years old children yields most health effects, followed by <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> 11 - 15 years old, 5 - 10 years old, and <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> 8 and 13 years old. <b>Screening</b> <b>of</b> broad-age intervals is always more costly than <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> single-age intervals, and there are important economies of scale for simultaneous <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> both 5 - 10 and 11 - 15 -year-old children. In all regions, <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> 11 - 15 years old is the most cost-effective intervention, with the cost per DALY averted ranging from I$ 67 per DALY averted in the Asian sub-region to I$ 458 per DALY averted in the European sub-region. The incremental cost per DALY averted <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> 5 - 15 years old ranges between I$ 111 in the Asian sub-region to I$ 672 in the European sub-region. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the conservative study assumptions and the robustness of study conclusions towards changes in these assumptions, <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> school children for refractive error is economically attractive in all regions in the world...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Children are {{the ones}} who are at risk of {{contracting}} tuberculosis (TB), but so far it has not been a priority. The proportion of tuberculosis in children case detection remains low among all tuberculosis cases. Bojonegoro is one among regencies in East Java which was appointed as the operational trial tuberculin test. The case detection begins with <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspects. <b>Screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children by health centers officer will determine how much the cases of tuberculosis in children are found in health centers. Health officers at the health centers became the most dominant factor in <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children. Training about tuberculosis in children was done in 16 health centers among 36 health centers in Bojonegoro. This study aimed to analyze the effect of training to the <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children by health center officers in Bojonegoro. This study is observational analytic with cross-sectional design. The sampling technique is simple random sampling with respondents consisting of 29 doctors and 29 nurses who are responsible for tuberculosis programs in 29 health centers in Bojonegoro. The variables studied were the training and <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children. The results showed that <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children was inappropriate from the target (75. 9 %) and officers who have not attended the training of tuberculosis in children were 58. 6 %. Logistic regression test showed that there was effect of training to the <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children (p = 0. 019) and prevalence ratio showed that health officers who was attended the training of tuberculosis in children were able to do the <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis suspected children well 8, 50 times greater than those who didn’t.

Approximately 3,500 troops, supported by a heavy bombardment, attempted to land, but were caught under fire in the river shallows. Members of the Louisbourg Grenadiers, who reached the beach, attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions, but came under heavy fire; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe to pull his troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm's 60.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top <b>screen</b> <b>of</b> the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country uses {{a series}} of map screens to track the players' progress.

Each level on the map is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings (the game's main enemy), while friendly areas are marked by members of the Kong family. Every individual world map screen has one boss enemy {{at the end of the}} course, which must be defeated to travel back to the main map <b>screen</b> <b>of</b> the whole island. It is possible to access previous world maps without defeating the boss by finding Funky Kong and borrowing his barrel plane. Players use this ability to select the world from the main screen, then the level within it. During play the game interface hides most game-related information, such as the number of bananas, letters, and animal tokens collected, as well as the number of lives remaining. When an item is collected, the relevant information briefly appears on the screen.|$|E
