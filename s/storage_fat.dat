Here, I wish to propose a theory that relates the formation of ketone bodies under such conditions to a deficiency in dietary pantothenic acid.

30|$|The {{scientific}} research community has commonly utilized {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) to evaluate lean muscle and adipose tissues due {{to the accuracy of}} measuring by contiguous MR slices. MRI offers an accurate and non-invasive means to assess the size and volume of regional muscle and fat (Commean et al. 2011). When MRI was used to quantify regional adipose tissue or skeletal muscle in humans, most studies measure a single cross-sectional area (CSA) image of abdominal or thigh (Cotofana et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2004). In this regard, there are limited data reporting analyses of the percentage of fat in upper limbs by MRI. A study with ultrasonic techniques has shown the age-related changes in CSA of fat and muscle of limbs during the growth period (Kanehisa et al. 1994). Therefore, the morphological assessment of the upper limb as well as the lower limb is important to determine the regional specificities of the body composition, and can provide useful information to advance our understanding of local limb morphology, which may provide new information to prevent metabolic and musculoskeletal disorders. Over the past years, the functional differences of the upper and lower limbs that occurred in the process of human evolution have been discussed; however, only few researches have investigated the morphological differences of the upper and lower limbs. We hypothesized that a specific characterization of regional <b>storage</b> <b>fat</b> and skeletal muscle in the upper limb could be identified as compared to the lower limb of young healthy adults. To solve this question, both BIA and MRI were used to quantify regional adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in vivo. Therefore, in this study, using the CSA image selected from multiple imaging protocols by MRI and separated limbs data from BIA, the human limb composition was determined and compared between the upper and lower limbs. The aim of this study was (1) to investigate whether the fat percent of limbs was equivalently estimated by using MRI and BIA, and (2) to determine the regional <b>storage</b> <b>fat</b> in upper and lower limbs of young healthy adults.|$|E
