5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes {{on the front of}} their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E

50|$|Elephant pupinid snails are {{dioecious}} (having separate {{male and}} female sexes). Males have a cone-shaped external penis on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> body which will broaden and enlarge during mating season. Females also have a genital groove on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> body.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{flounder}} can be differentiated {{from the}} commonly co-occurring Summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) by their small teeth and eyes nearly always positioned {{on the right}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies. Meanwhile, Summer flounder have {{their eyes on the}} left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies and possess large, conspicuous teeth.|$|R
5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> brain go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} {{horns and}} the muscular neck {{may have been}} used in fighting conspecifics. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of Carnotaurus remain unclear: some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods.|$|E
5|$|The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, {{in their}} plumage, {{and have a}} similar pattern {{to that in the}} {{corresponding}} sex of house sparrow. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their cheeks and the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks, as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.|$|E

5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles along the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and {{are found in the}} click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{exhibits}} {{included a}} {{science and technology}} exhibit by Great Britain, while Mexico and Peru focused on handicrafts, and Japan and India attempted to show both of these <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> national cultures. The Taiwan and South Korea pavilions showed their rapid industrialization {{to the world and}} the benefits of capitalism over communism during the time of cold war era. Other pavilions included one featuring Brazilian tea and coffee; a European Communities Pavilion from the then six countries of the European Economic Community; and a joint pavilion by those countries of Africa that had by then achieved independence. Sweden's exhibit included the story of the salvaging of a 17th-century man-of-war from Stockholm harbor, and San Marino's exhibit featured its postage stamps and pottery. Near the center of this was the DuPen Fountain featuring three sculptures by Seattle artist Everett DuPen.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species {{tend to be less}} robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
25|$|The early-Ming specimens, {{while still}} {{definitely}} chelonian, had sprouted small ears; <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads and their carapaces are often decorated by a leaf-like design. They usually have prominent teeth, which real-life turtles don't.|$|E

Other Puritans contented themselves with being able to meet freely and act on local parishes.

Two religious authors stand out beyond the others in this time: John Bunyan and Izaak Walton.|$|E
25|$|Skiers missing an arm use a {{technique}} that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. Skiers with hemiplegia have to be trained to use both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> body equally. If they do not, {{they are likely to}} fall over when their skis cross in front of them.|$|E
25|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes {{on the front of}} their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting. The American woodcock probably has the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the vertical plane.|$|E

25|$|Young {{saltwater}} crocodiles are {{pale yellow}} in colour with black stripes and spots {{on their bodies}} and tails. This colouration lasts for several years until the crocodiles mature into adults. The colour as an adult is much darker greenish-drab, with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes apparent. Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain fairly pale skin, whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish. The ventral surface is white or yellow in colour on saltwater crocodiles of all ages. Stripes are present on the lower <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies, but do not extend onto their bellies. Their tails are grey with dark bands.|$|E
