2500|$|Ritchie {{argued that}} Parliament cannot {{properly}} exercise the powers vested in it, if it cannot define the qualifications {{required to be}} an Indian and to [...] "use and benefit of Crown lands reserved for Indians". Also, citing the preamble to the Canadian Bill of Rights (which describes Parliament's intention to enact a Bill of Rights [...] "which <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> the respect of Parliament for its constitutional authority"), it would appear, Ritchie asserted, that the Bill does not purport to [...] "amend or alter {{the terms of the}} British North America Act". Moreover, Ritchie also noted that the majority in Drybones clearly disavowed of an approach that would render an entire Act inoperative because of a violation, which held instead that only the offending provision should be construed as inoperative.|$|E

60|$|As to the West Indies,--indeed, as to either, if we {{look for}} matter of {{exchange}} in order to ransom Europe,--it is easy {{to show that we}} have taken a terribly roundabout road. I cannot conceive, even if, for the sake of holding conquests there, we should refuse to redeem Holland, and the Austrian Netherlands, and the hither Germany, that Spain, merely as she is Spain, (and forgetting that the Regicide ambassador governs at Madrid,) will see with perfect satisfaction Great Britain sole mistress of the isles. In truth, it appears to me, that, when we come to balance our account, we shall find in the proposed peace only the pure, simple, and unendowed charms of Jacobin amity. We shall have the satisfaction of knowing that no blood or treasure has been spared by the Allies for support of the Regicide system. We <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> at leisure on one great truth: that it was ten times more easy totally to destroy the system itself than, when established, it would be to reduce its power,--and that this republic, most formidable abroad, was of all things the weakest at home; that her frontier was terrible, her interior feeble; that it was matter of choice to attack her where she is invincible, and to spare her where she was ready to dissolve by her own internal disorders. We <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> that our plan was good neither for offence nor defence.|$|E
60|$|For {{since the}} parts of these Bodies, by Prop. 5. do most {{probably}} exhibit the same Colours with a Plate of equal thickness, provided {{they have the same}} refractive density; and since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with Water or Glass, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect; to determine the sizes of those parts, you need only have recourse to the precedent Tables, in which the thickness of Water or Glass exhibiting any Colour is expressed. Thus if it be desired to know the diameter of a Corpuscle, which being of equal density with Glass <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> green of the third Order; the Number 16-1/4 shews it to be (16-1/4)/10000 parts of an Inch.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{pleasure}} is a thief to business; how any man {{can call it}} innocent, let him answer that does so; it robs him every way, as I have said above: and if the tradesman be a Christian, and has any regard to religion and his duty, I must tell him, that when upon his disasters he <b>shall</b> <b>reflect,</b> and see that he has ruined himself and his family, by following too much those diversions and pleasures which he thought innocent, and which perhaps in themselves were really so, he will find great cause to repent of that which he insisted on as innocent; he will find himself lost, by doing lawful things, and that he made those innocent things sinful, and those lawful things unlawful to him. Thus, as they robbed his family and creditors before of their just debts--for maintenance is a tradesman's just debt to his family, and a wife and children are as much a tradesman's real creditors as those who trusted him with their goods--I say, as his innocent pleasures robbed his family and creditors before, they will rob him now of his peace, and of all that calm of soul which an honest, industrious, though unfortunate, tradesman meets with under his disasters.|$|E

6000|$|As the {{plausible}} couple never laud {{the merits}} of any absent person, without dexterously contriving that their praises <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> upon somebody who is present, so they never depreciate anything or anybody, without turning their depreciation to the same account. Their friend, Mr. Slummery, say they, is unquestionably a clever painter, and would no doubt be very popular, and sell his pictures {{at a very high}} price, if that cruel Mr. Fithers had not forestalled him in his department of art, and made it thoroughly and completely his own;—Fithers, it is to be observed, being present and within hearing, and Slummery elsewhere. Is Mrs. Tabblewick really as beautiful as people say? Why, there indeed you ask them a very puzzling question, because {{there is no doubt that}} she is a very charming woman, and they have long known her intimately. She is no doubt beautiful, very beautiful; they once thought her the most beautiful woman ever seen; still if you press them for an honest answer, they are bound to say that this was before they had ever seen our lovely friend on the sofa, (the sofa is hard by, and our lovely friend can’t help hearing the whispers in which this is said;) since that time, perhaps, they have been hardly fair judges; Mrs. Tabblewick is no doubt extremely handsome,—very like our friend, in fact, in the form of the features,—but in point of expression, and soul, and figure, and air altogether—oh dear! ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{return to}} you, Sir, though I feel obliged by your Hospitality, [...] etc., etc., {{in the present}} {{instance}} I have been completely deceived.

In one [...] word, hear my determination. I will never pay for them out of my [...] allowance, and the Disgrace will not attach to me but to those by [...] whom I have been deceived. Still, Sir, not even the Shadow of [...] dishonour <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> on my Name, for I will see that the Bills [...] are discharged; whether by you or not is to me indifferent, so that [...] the men I employ are not the victims of my Imprudence or your [...] Duplicity. I have ordered nothing extravagant; every man in College is [...] allowed to fit up his rooms; mine are secured to me during my [...] residence which will probably be some time, and in rendering them [...] decent I am more praiseworthy than culpable. The Money I requested was [...] but a secondary consideration; as a Lawyer you were not obliged to [...] advance it till due; as a Friend the request might have been [...] complied with.

60|$|The {{distinction}} between the loss of consideration which a person may rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and the reprobation {{which is due to}} him for an offence against the rights of others, is not a merely nominal distinction. It makes a vast difference both in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether he displeases us in things in which we think {{we have a right to}} control him, or in things in which we know that we have not. If he displeases us, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel called on to make his life uncomfortable. We <b>shall</b> <b>reflect</b> that he already bears, or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he spoils his life by mismanagement, we shall not, for that reason, desire to spoil it still further: instead of wishing to punish him, we shall rather endeavour to alleviate his punishment, by showing him how he may avoid or cure the evils his conduct tends to bring upon him. He may be to us an object of pity, perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or resentment; we shall not treat him like an enemy of society: the worst we shall think ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself, if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern for him. It is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules necessary for the protection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively. The evil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but on others; and society, as the protector of all its members, must retaliate on him; must inflict pain on him for the express purpose of punishment, and must take care that it be sufficiently severe. In the one case, he is an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit in judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our own sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any suffering on him, except what may incidentally follow from our using the same liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him in his.|$|E
