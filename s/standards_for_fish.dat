40|$|Changes in {{tastes and}} {{preferences}} in importing {{countries as well}} as the need to keep the environment safe, especially in developed markets, has contributed to a rising trend in the demand for sanitary and phytosanitary measures for quality products. However, the stringency and the preponderance of these measures have effects on trade, particularly for the developing and least developed countries in Africa. The effects often influence the attainment of the development aspirations of these Africa countries, especially employment, poverty reduction and sustainable growth. To this end, this study investigates the export effects of the EU standards for Africa. It uses the two-step Helpman et al. (2008) extensive and intensive trade margins model for two high-value foods and two traditional products. The EU standard requirements for each product are called the ‘hurdle to pass’ before the product can gain access to the EU market. In all, 52 African countries are considered in an empirical analysis covering the period 1995 to 2012. The study finds that product <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> and cocoa are trade-enhancing at the extensive margins, {{but this is not the}} case at the intensive margins. However, the standards are trade-inhibiting at both the extensive and intensive margins of exports for vegetables, while the standards are trade-restrictive at the extensive margins and trade-enhancing at the intensive margins for coffee. Thus, the findings suggest that the impacts of standards on exports are commodity-specific due to the significant differences in the costs of compliance, the size of the exporting firms or countries, access to development assistance and the commodity-specific interests of countries. The study recommends development partnerships and alliance policies on the part of Africa, with the development of institutions that can improve the level of standard-compliance in all African exporting markets...|$|E
40|$|Three {{case studies}} explore {{the effects of}} human {{activities}} on coastal streams and review measures to control {{the negative consequences of}} human activities. The first case study, an urban and a rural/forested stream in New Zealand, measured descriptors of water quality, including nutrients, dissolved oxygen and bacterial indicators of faecal contamination. The urban and rural catchments have stream-water qualities that fail to meet <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> life or bathing. Of the five sites studied, only one catchment, which had a substantial forest component (50 %), had bacterial counts which meet the Australian Recreational Water-quality Guidelines for Secondary Contact (Faecal coliforms and enterococci, ANZECC, 2000) and the New Zealand Interim Guidelines for Freshwater Bathing (Escherichia coli, MofE, 2000). Only one site (which was downstream of a sediment-detention dam) had water clarity which met the Ministry of the Environment's (MofE, 1994) guideline for contact recreation. The results from this New Zealand case study indicate that the absence of riparian vegetation altered the temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen regime, that livestock increased levels of nitrate, turbidity and bacteria indicators of faecal contamination and that urban land use increased peak flows, peak-flow turbidity and bacterial indicators of faecal contamination and decreased base flows. The second case study, of a stream in the former Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany), measured a similar suite of parameters and compared the German stream's 2001 water quality with records from 1991 (directly after the reunification of Germany). Measured levels of total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and dissolved oxygen all showed significant improvements between 1991 and 2001. Stricter controls and regulations are thought to be the cause. The final case study reviews plans for an urban residential development in the catchment of the New Zealand rural/forested stream. Degraded sections of the stream could actually be improved if the development is sensibly managed. However, the sensitive nature of the receiving environment (a marine reserve) requires that measures be taken to avoid or mitigate any deleterious effects.

40|$|The {{bioaccumulation}} {{of heavy}} metals and metalloids particularly arsenic (As) was studied with special {{reference to the}} food chain up to carp as the top predator in Lake Kasumigaura,associated with a trial remediation technology of arsenic contaminated soil {{in order to prevent}} its diffusion into the lake system. For this purpose,an investigation was conducted to clarify the bioaccumulation of heavy metals through the food chain with special reference to the progression of trophic level in the food chain;i. e.,sediment,organic debris,phytoplankton,zooplankton and eventually five chosen tissues(muscle,liver,kidney,gonad and intestine) of cultivated and wild carps (Cyprinus carpio) in Lake Kasumigaura. To clarify the first step in this trophic progression,the relative importance of zooplankton grazing and nutrient limitation in regulating the phytoplankton community was studied experimentally in an eutrophic pond with natural eutrophic water of Lake Kasumigaura. The phytoplankton community in the pond was regulated by both zooplankton grazing and nutrient supply,but the relative functions of these two factors interchanged seasonally. The phytoplankton biomass tended to be affected more by grazing in summer and autumn than winter and spring when the higher abundance of cladocerans and rotifers could have lower grazing impact on the phytoplankton biomass. Moreover,it was also found that in all cases,the zooplankton show greater accumulation of macronutrients,suth as calcium,magnesium,sodium,phosphorus and potassium and the essential trace elements such as manganese,iron,copper and zinc. In the case of non-essential trace elements that are toxic like arsenic,lead,cadmium,cobalt,chromium,nickel and vanadium were relatively high in winter,spring,and autumn except summer season. Differences in metal bioaccumulation of zooplankton could result from differences in food composition that alter the ingestion,exposure,and/or assimilation of metals and also the taxonomic composition of the zooplankton. The impact of carp cultivation on the concentrations of 24 elements in the sediment and associated water column was also monitored at two sites,one an area of intensive cage culture of carp,and the other a site for wild carp was located far from known cage culture areas,in Lake Kasumigaura between September 1994 and September 1995. The concentrations of most elements in Lake Kasumigaura water were mostly at a ppb level,except for Ca,Fe,K,Mg,Na,P and Si. The results indicate that the variations of arsenic in the lake water largely depend on biological processes,such as the metabolism of phytoplankton,decomposition of organic matter by bacteria,and microbial reduction of iron and manganese oxides in sediments. Statistically significant differences in metal concentrations were observed between the cultivation and wild sites with metal concentrations consistently higher at the cultivation site. Although cage culture of carp in the Lake Kasumigaura system may be causing localized increases in metal concentrations in the sediments,the concentrations of metals observed in the sediments in 1995 at both sampling sites were lower than those observed in Lake Kasumigaura in 1979 for all metals. In the comparison of trace elemental concentrations between cultivated and wild carp of Lake Kasumigaura,the concentrations of 32 elements were determined in the muscle,liver,intestine,kidney,and gonads of cultivated and wild carp caught at two sites in Lake Kasumigaura,between September 1994 and September 1995. Despite having a reputation for being heavily polluted,the carp were not heavily burdened with metals. The findings of the results in Lake Kasumigaura demonstrate that,diminution of arsenic from lower trophic levels to fish i. e.,zooplankton>fish. The results also suggest that Cd is biomagnified in the kidney and intestine but arsenic,chromium and lead are not biomagnified in any tissues of cultivated and wild carp. Zinc however was biomagnified in all tisuues of cultivated and wild carp. The results suggest that despite their dietary differences,the wild and cultivated fish were accumulating and distributing metals in the same mechanism and that aquacultural practices are not increasing metal concentrations in these fish. Metal concentrations were lowest in muscle,and did not exceed established quality <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>fish.</b> The intestine,kidney,liver,and gonad contained consistently the highest concentrations followed by the muscle. The carp muscle was especially rich in macronutrient metals notably potassium and sodium. The differences in metal concentrations between cultivated and wild carps were negligible,and should pose no health problems for consumers of either type of fish. As a trial remediation technology,an environmentally friendly and cost-effective extraction method has been studied for the removal of arsenic from contaminated soil in the watershed of Lake Kasumigaura. A yellow brown forest soil was contaminated experimentally with arsenic(V) and used as a model soil. Among the various potassium and sodium salts,potassium phosphate was most effective in extracting arsenic,attaining more than 40 % extraction in the pH range of 6 to 8 with the minimum damage to the soil properties. An exchange mechanism is proposed for the extraction of arsenic from soil using phosphate. By means of sequential extraction phosphate was shown to be effective in extracting arsenic of Al- and Fe-bound forms. Arsenic of the residual form was not extracted. Arsenic was efficiently extracted by phosphate solution of pH 6. 0 at 300 mM phosphate concentration and at 40 ℃. Thesis (Ph.

In analyzing effect of land use change on water quality, we took year 2005 as our baseline and postulated three land use scenarios. We applied Benefit Transfer techniques to value water quality changes resulting from land use change and estimated lower bounds for WTP to improve water quality to meet the FCB criterion for drinking water supply and fishing waters and BOD (DO) criteria <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> waters. Water quality modeling revealed that land use change would result in increased runoff, and associated increase in FCB and BOD/DO violations. But the BOD/DO violations could be curtailed by managing urban growth as evidenced absence of BOD violations in the managed growth scenario. Our study finds there may be problems of FCB under all postulated future land use scenarios. The findings also support existing literature that {{there are problems with}} FCB violation in the study area at the moment. Finally, it seems that the people of UCRB {{would be willing to pay}} a lower bound value between USD 15, 785, 740 and USD 16, 141, 230 per year to create and maintain quality <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>fishing</b> and drinking water supply.

40|$|Study {{carried out}} {{on the quality of}} fresh fish in retail markets of Bombay {{revealed}} that only 75 % of the samples were of acceptable quality. Incidence of faecal streptococci was generally high, indicating poor sanitary and hygienic practices in handling of fresh fish. Total bacterial counts higher than Indian standard specified limits were observed in more than one third of the samples analysed. 7. 5 % of the samples were found to be contaminated either with Salmonella or Clostridium perfringens, thus posing a serious potential health hazard to the consumer. The quality of fish in different markets is also discussed. The urgent need for formulation and implementation of quality <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> fresh <b>fish</b> in domestic trade is highlighted...|$|R
