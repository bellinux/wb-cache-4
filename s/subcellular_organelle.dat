50|$|A cnidocyte (also {{known as}} a cnidoblast or nematocyte) is an {{explosive}} cell containing one giant secretory organelle or cnida (plural cnidae) that defines the phylum Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones, hydrae, jellyfish, etc.). Cnidae are used for prey capture and defense from predators. Despite being morphologically simple, lacking a skeleton and many species being sessile, cnidarians prey on fish and crustaceans. A cnidocyte fires a structure that contains the toxin, from a characteristic <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> called a cnidocyst (also {{known as a}} cnida or nematocyst).

50|$|Common to all LOV {{proteins}} is the blue-light sensitive flavin chromophore, {{which in}} the signaling state is covalently linked to the protein core via an adjacent cysteine residue. LOV domains are e.g. encountered in phototropins, which are blue-light-sensitive protein complexes regulating a great diversity of biological processes in higher plants {{as well as in}} micro-algae. Phototropins are composed of two LOV domains, each containing a non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore in its dark-state form, and a C-terminal Ser-Thr kinase. Upon blue-light absorption, a covalent bond between the FMN chromophore and an adjacent reactive cysteine residue of the apo-protein is formed in the LOV2 domain. This subsequently mediates the activation of the kinase, which induces a signal in the organism through phototropin autophosphorylation. While the photochemical reactivity of the LOV2 domain {{has been found to be}} essential for the activation of the kinase, the in vivo functionality of the LOV1 domain within the protein complex still remains unclear. In case of the fungus Neurospora crassa, the circadian clock is controlled by two light-sensitive domains, known as the white-collar-complex (WCC) and the LOV domain vivid (VVD-LOV). WCC is primarily responsible for the light-induced transcription on the control-gene frequency (FRQ) under day-light conditions, which drives the expression of VVD-LOV and governs the negative feedback loop onto the circadian clock. By contrast, the role of VVD-LOV is mainly modulatory and does not directly affect FRQ. Finally, LOV domains have also been found to control gene expression through DNA binding andto be involved in redox-dependent regulation, like e.g. in the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Notably, LOV-based optogenetic tools have been gaining wide popularity in recent years to control a myriad of cellular events, including cell motility, <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> distribution, formation of membrane contact sites, and protein degradation.|$|E

Originally being defined as an intracellular storage pool for von Willebrand factor (VWF), it has recently been shown that an increasing number of other components, including P-selectin, interleukin (IL) - 8, eotaxin- 3, endothelin- 1, and angiopoietin- 2, is present within this <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle,</b> implicating a role for WPB exocytosis in inflammation, hemostasis, regulation of vascular tone and angiogenesis. Recent studies emphasize that WPBs provide a dynamic storage compartment whose contents can be regulated depending on the presence of inflammatory mediators in the vascular micro-environment.

However, only the last decades’ research has discovered their role in ageing and disease pathology, which have led to increasing interest in mitochondria as target for drug delivery. For a long time the mitochondria were thought to be static organelles, however, it was then discovered that they continuously fused together forming tubular networks followed by fission back into single organelles. The aim of the work was to evaluate whether liposomes could be recognized as artificial mitochondria and thereby be included in the fusion-fission cycle. Liposomes were prepared with different lipid compositions mimicking the composition of the outer mitochondrial membrane.

40|$|Peroxisomes are <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelles</b> {{which are}} present in {{virtually}} every eukaryotic cell and catalyze {{a large number of}} metabolic functions. The importance of peroxisomes for humans is stressed by the existence of a large group of genetic diseases in which either the biogenesis of peroxisomes is impaired or one of its metabolic functions. Thanks to the work on Zellweger syndrome which is the prototype of the group of peroxisomal disorders, much has been learned about the metabolism and biogenesis of peroxisomes in humans. These metabolic functions include: (1.) fatty acid beta-oxidation; (2.) etherphospholipid biosynthesis; (3.) fatty acid alpha-oxidation, and (4.) glyoxylate detoxification. Since peroxisomes lack a citric acid cycle and a respiratory chain, peroxisomes are relatively helpless organelles which rely heavily on their cross-talk with other <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelles</b> in order to metabolize the end products of metabolism as generated in peroxisomes.

Perturbations of the normal uptake and metabolism of carcinogens can arise through changes in microsomal enzyme activities, membrane permeabilities, and cell turnover. Metal effects on heme-dependent oxidative functions are well documented and are primarily manifested by increased heme degradation rates (microsomal heme oxygenase activity), decreased heme production (mitochondrial and cytosolic heme biosynthetic enzymes) and, {{in the case of}} a few metals, through nuclear effects of metals on the induction of microsomal enzymes. Many metals are accumulated by lysosomes, but known effects of metals on the function of these organelles in sequestering and storing organic compounds are few. Studies of changes in plasma or mitochondrial membrane permeabilities by metals have centered mainly on the susceptibility of membrane ATPase activities to metal ion alteration and on the involvement of metals in lipid peroxidation and free radical formation. Knowledge of the effects of metals on <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> functions should aid in the understanding of the mechanisms by which metal ions may play a role in the carcinogenic response.

Golgi, {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} and mitochondria/lysosomes, prepared from ovaries of rats injected with human choriogonadotropin (hCG) or 0. 9 % NaCl. Treatment in vivo with hCG resulted in 2 - 3 -fold induction of 125 I-HDL binding activity in all the <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelles.</b> The specific binding of HDL to various <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelles</b> was dependent {{on the amount of}} protein, lipoprotein concentration and incubation time.

40|$|Background—The "topical" {{effect of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{seems to be}} an important cause of NSAID induced gastrointestinal damage.  Aim—To examine the possible mechanism of the "topical" phase of damage in the small intestine.  Methods—Electron microscopy and <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> marker enzyme studies were done in rat small intestine after oral administration of indomethacin (doses varied between 5 and 30 mg/kg). The effect of conventional and non-acidic NSAIDs on rat liver mitochondrial respiration was measured in vitro in a Clarke-type oxygen electrode.  Results—The <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> marker enzymes showed mitochondrial and brush border involvement within an hour of indomethacin administration. Electron microscopy showed dose dependent mitochondrial changes following indomethacin administration consistent with uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (or inhibition of electron transport) which were indistinguishable from those seen with the uncoupler dinitrophenol. Parenteral indomethacin caused similar changes, but not in rats with ligated bile ducts. A range of NSAIDs, but not paracetamol or non-acidic NSAIDs which have a favourable gastrointestinal tolerability profile, uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in vitro at micromolar concentrations and inhibited respiration at higher concentrations. In vivo studies with nabumetone and aspirin further suggested that uncoupling or inhibition of electron transport underlies the "topical" phase of NSAID induced damage.  Conclusion—Collectively, these studies suggest that NSAID induced changes in mitochondrial energy production may be {{an important component of the}} "topical" phase of damage induction. ...|$|E

The rates of oxidation of phytanic acid in peroxisomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum were 37. 1 * 2. 65, 1. 9 * 0. 3, and 0. 4 * 0. 07 pmol/h per mg protein, respectively, from control fibroblasts. The phytanic acid oxidation activity in mitochondria (2. 04 0. 7 pmol/h per mg protein) and endoplasmic reticulum (0. 43 * 0. 2 pmol/h per mg protein) from Refsum fibroblasts was similar to control fibroblasts. However, phytanic acid oxidation in peroxisomes from Refsum fibroblasts was not detected at all the protein concentrations tested. On the other hand, the peroxisomes from Refsum fibroblasts had normal rates of activation and oxidation of palmitic and lignoceric acids, suggesting that the peroxisomes isolated from Refsum fibroblasts were metabolically active.
