These individuals interact with the Doing Business team in conference calls, written correspondence and visits by the global team. For the 2017 report, team members visited 34 economies to verify data and to recruit respondents. Data from the survey is subjected to several rounds of verification. The surveys are not a <b>statistical</b> <b>sample,</b> {{and the results are}} interpreted and cross-checked for consistency before being included in the report. Results are also validated with the relevant government before publication. Respondents fill out written surveys and provide references to the relevant laws, regulations and fees, based on standardized case scenarios with specific assumptions, such as the business being located in the largest business city of the economy.|$|E

Statisticians (working {{as part of a}} research project) [...] "create data that makes sense" [...] with random sampling and with randomized experiments; the design of a <b>statistical</b> <b>sample</b> or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians [...] "make sense of the data" [...] using the art of modelling and the theory of inference– with model selection and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data.|$|E

[...] At least 85 percent of these youths statewide have had some contact with the child welfare system, mostly through abuse or neglect proceedings. In New York City, 75 percent have been in foster care.

[...] "We believe that number is really an undercount." [...] This is confirmed by SNRG-NYC's New York City population estimate of 2008 which was 3,946.

40|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> {{can play}} an {{essential}} double role in defining document sets in response to legal discovery requests for production. Retrospectively, looking backward at existing results, <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> provides a way to measure quantitatively {{the quality of a}} proposed production set. Prospectively, looking forward, <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> (properly interpreted) shows how the quality of a proposed production set can be improved. The proposed improvements depend on transparency of classification: in order to correct clashes between human judgments of sampled data and a proposed hypothesis, one must know the source of the misclassification. And in correcting such misclassifications, one must take care to avoid standard dangers like overfitting. Section 1 below sets the stage by presenting the most basic material on <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> and introducing the concept of data profiles. Section 2 argues that <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> in retrospective mode is the only practical way to assess production quality. Section 3 offers several reasons why <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> assessment has failed to become the standard practice it deserves to be in the field of legal discovery. Section 4 focuses on the use of <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> in prospective, forwardlooking mode, to drive iterative improvement. Section 5 describes at a high level some of our practical experience at Cataphora using iterative <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> to force rapid convergence of an evolving responsiveness hypothesis with very high quality standards of review assessment. (In fact, the intrinsic role that <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> plays in this process described in this section—a process that has consistently yielded measurably high quality—is one reason to consider the issues that arise in the preceding sections.) Along the way, we offer a variety of questions for discussion in a series of footnotes. ...|$|R

50|$|When {{selecting}} a sampling approach {{there are two}} approaches to audit sampling: non-statistical and statistical approach. Three ways that <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> can assist the auditor are: to maximize the productivity with minimum wasted effort in designing the sample, to measure the sufficiency of the evidence taken during the audit, and to analyze the results. The statistical approach allows the auditor to measure the risk that is being sampled to help in reducing it to an acceptable level. With respect to performing <b>samples,</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>sampling</b> involves different kinds of costs such as training the auditors, designing individual samples to meet the requirements, and choosing the items to be examined.
