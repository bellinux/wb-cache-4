40|$|The {{quality of}} pixels on {{displays}} and semiconductors {{is directly related}} to the surface quality of the patterned <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> used. Burrs generated on the patterned <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> can degrade the quality of pixels on microelectronic devices during the deposition process. In this study, experimental observations of abrasive deburring along with large pulsed electron beam (LPEB) irradiation were performed to evaluate the deburring effects on patterned <b>metal</b> <b>masks.</b> Numerical modeling of LPEB irradiation approximately predicted melting depths and the experimental studies revealed limitations in the size of burrs removed by LPEB irradiation. Thus a LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was developed to eliminate burrs of <b>metal</b> <b>masks</b> regardless of their size. The size of burrs remaining after the LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was reduced to approximately 7. 2 μm which was much less than the results of abrasive deburring alone (38. 01 μm). The burr size distribution was reduced by 85 % and surface roughness (Ra) was decreased from 640 nm to 121 nm, indicating a uniform surface texture. close...|$|R

50|$|Alloying of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> alters its LME. Some {{alloying}} elements {{may increase the}} severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element {{is known to be}} segregation to grain boundaries of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> and alteration of the grain boundary properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the grain boundaries of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal.</b> The hardness and deformation behaviour of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely embrittled. Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely embrittled and the fracture stress varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to ductile transition temperature is increased by increasing grain size.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Basing on an inert {{perforated}} <b>metal</b> <b>mask,</b> {{a hybrid}} electrochemical fabrication combining electroforming and mask electrochemical machining was proposed to manufacture metal through-hole array with double tapered openings. The feasibility of this novel process was investigated experimentally. The effects of pattern parameters of inert <b>metal</b> <b>mask,</b> such as wall angle, α, substrate thickness, H, hole spacing, L and hole size, D, on {{profiles of the}} resulting holes were analyzed. The experimental {{results show that the}} hybrid fabrication is able to manufacture high-aspect-ratio double tapered hole array with good surface quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a novel}} class of microgrippers is demonstrated by means of bulk microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology using silicon on insulator wafer substrates and deep reactive ion etching. Hard masking is implemented to maximize the selectivity of the bulk etching using sputtered aluminum and aluminum–titanium thin films. The microroughness problem related {{to the use of}} <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> is addressed by testing different mask combinations and etching parameters. The O 2 flow, SF 6 pressure, wafer temperature, and bias power are examined, and the effect of each parameter on micromasking is assessed. Sidewall damage {{associated with the use of}} a <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> is eliminated by interposing a dielectric layer between silicon substrate and <b>metal</b> <b>mask.</b> Dedicated combdrive anchors are implemented to etch safely both silicon sides down to the buried oxide, and to preserve the wafer integrity until the final wet release of the completed structures. A first set of complete devices is realized and tested under electrical actuation...|$|R

50|$|External {{parameters}} like temperature, strain rate, {{stress and}} time {{of exposure to the}} liquid metal prior to testing affect LME.

The lower limit of the ductility trough generally coincides with the melting point of the liquid metal. The upper limit is strain rate sensitive. Temperature also affects the kinetics of LME.An increase in strain rate increases the upper limit temperature as well as the crack propagation rate. In most metal couples LME does not occur below a threshold stress level.|$|R
