40|$|For an M/G/ 1 queue {{with the}} {{objective}} of minimizing the mean number of jobs in the system, the Gittins index rule is known to be optimal among the set of non-anticipating policies. We develop properties of the Gittins index. For a single-class queue it is known that when the <b>service</b> time <b>distribution</b> is of type Decreasing Hazard Rate (New Better than Used in Expectation), the Foreground-Background (First-Come-First-Served) discipline is optimal. By utilizing the Gittins index approach, we show that in fact, Foreground-Background and First-Come-First-Served are optimal if and only if the <b>service</b> time <b>distribution</b> is of type Decreasing Hazard Rate and New Better than Used in Expectation, respectively. For the multi-class case, where jobs of different classes have different <b>service</b> <b>distributions,</b> we obtain new results that characterize the optimal policy under various assumptions on the <b>service</b> time <b>distributions.</b> We also investigate distributions whose hazard rate and mean residual lifetime are not monotonic. ...|$|R
