It is to summarize an evolutionary document collection at current time supposing the users have read some related <b>previous</b> <b>documents.</b> In this paper, we propose a graph-ranking-based method. It performs constrained reinforcements on a sentence graph, which unifies <b>previous</b> and current <b>documents,</b> to determine the salience of the sentences. The constraints ensure that the most salient sentences in current documents are updates to <b>previous</b> <b>documents.</b> Since this method is NP-hard, we then propose its approximate method, which is polynomial time solvable. Experiments on the TAC 2008 and 2009 benchmark data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

40|$|Legal {{document}} drafting is {{an essential}} professional skill for attorneys and judges. To maintain stylistic and substantive consistency and decrease drafting time, new documents are often created by modifying <b>previous</b> <b>documents.</b> This paper proposes a framework for document reuse based on an explicit representation of the illocutionary and rhetorical structure underlying documents. Explicit representation of this structure facilitates (1) interpretation of <b>previous</b> <b>documents</b> by enabling them to "explain themselves," (2) construction of documents by enabling document drafters to issue goal-based specifications and rapidly retrieve documents with similar intentional structure, and (3) maintenance of multi-generation documents. The applicability of this framework to a representative class of judicial orders [...] - jurisdictional show-cause orders [...] -is demonstrated. 1 Introduction Legal problem solving subsumes a number of distinct tasks, including analysis of the legal consequences of actual o [...] ...|$|R

Introduction In a <b>previous</b> <b>document</b> [RKB 99], we have defined the implications and requirements of taxonomic work, and reviewed the existing database technology in order to find which currently available model support most of the necessary features of taxonomic work. Taxonomic data is essentially hierarchical, required a lot of freedom, and necessitates the extraction of information by graph traversing techniques. We have shown that no model supports fully taxonomic data and taxonomic processes. The most promising model was the graph model, although it lacked many features we require. However, since this [...] ...|$|R

These changes have been sufficiently substantive to warrant review to determine whether any changes in the recommended treatment algorithms are needed. A consensus development conference was held in January 2007, and the present document highlights the results of the presentations and discussion about these issues. It reviews the epidemiology of hepatitis C in Canada, treatment of acute hepatitis C and new algorithms in chronic hepatitis C, including retreatment of previous treatment failures. In addition, sections on management of hepatitis C in special populations have been updated. There is also a section on the use of hematopoietic growth factors to help manage patients on therapy.
