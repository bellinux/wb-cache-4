Although the genetic diversity of the <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> lineage is relatively low, its morphological diversity has expanded substantially {{compared to that of}} the Saccharomyces cerevisiae species as a whole. Evaluation of the different types of breeding processes showed that the generation of hybrids (crossbreeding) has more profound effects on cell morphology than the isolation of mutants (mutation breeding). Analysis of phenotypic robustness revealed that some <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains are more morphologically heterogeneous, possibly due to impairment of cellular network hubs.

40|$|Modern <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains, {{which produce}} high {{concentrations}} of ethanol, are unexpectedly sensitive to environmental stress during sake brewing. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we investigated a well-characterized yeast stress response mediated by a heat shock element (HSE) and heat shock transcription factor Hsf 1 p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>sake</b> <b>yeast.</b> The HSE-lacZ activity of <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> during sake fermentation and under acute ethanol stress was severely impaired {{compared to that of}} laboratory yeast. Moreover, the Hsf 1 p of modern <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> was highly and constitutively hyperphosphorylated, irrespective of the extracellular stress. Since HSF 1 allele replacement did not significantly affect the HSE-mediated ethanol stress response or Hsf 1 p phosphorylation patterns in either sake or laboratory yeast, the regulatory machinery of Hsf 1 p is presumed to function differently between these types of yeast. To identify phosphatases whose loss affected the control of Hsf 1 p, we screened a series of phosphatase gene deletion mutants in a laboratory strain background. Among the 29 mutants, a Δppt 1 mutant exhibited constitutive hyperphosphorylation of Hsf 1 p, similarly to the modern <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains, which lack the entire PPT 1 gene locus. We confirmed that the expression of laboratory yeast-derived functional PPT 1 recovered the HSE-mediated stress response of <b>sake</b> <b>yeast.</b> In addition, deletion of PPT 1 in laboratory yeast resulted in enhanced fermentation ability. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hyperphosphorylation of Hsf 1 p caused by loss of the PPT 1 gene at least partly accounts for the defective stress response and high ethanol productivity of modern <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains...|$|E

The constructed plasmids required at least two types of marker genes: one for the selection of yeast transformants and one for the selection of a- or α-type derivative cells. To this end, we employed two commonly used marker genes for industrial yeast strains, namely the hygro and kanMX 4 genes, for the transformation and isolation of a- and α-type derivative cells, respectively (Murakami et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|Oxygen, a key {{nutrient}} in alcoholic fermentation, {{is rapidly}} depleted during this process. Several pathways of oxygen utilization {{have been reported}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during alcoholic fermentation, namely synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid, sterols and heme, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. However, the interaction between these pathways has not been investigated. In this study, we showed that the major proportion of unsaturated fatty acids of ester-linked lipids in sake fermentation mash is derived from the <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> rather than from rice or koji (rice fermented with Aspergillus). Additionally, during alcoholic fermentation, inhibition of the residual mitochondrial activity of <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> increases the levels of unsaturated fatty acids of ester-linked lipids. These findings indicate that the residual activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain reduces molecular oxygen levels and decreases the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, thereby increasing the synthesis of estery flavors by <b>sake</b> <b>yeast.</b> This is the first report of a novel link between residual mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by the brewery yeast during alcoholic fermentation...|$|E

To obtain insights into pyruvate metabolism, we investigated the mitochondrial activity of TCR 7 by oxigraphy and 13 C-metabolic flux analysis. The mutant strain (TCR 7), displayed an higher mitochondrial pyruvate influx and oxidation, and a decreased glycerol production compared to the reference strain.

30|$|Sake is a {{traditional}} Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. In the production of sake, rice starch is first degraded by the koji fungus Aspergillus oryzae into glucose, which is then fermented to ethanol by <b>sake</b> <b>yeast,</b> strains of the budding yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kitagaki and Kitamoto 2013; Shiroma et al. 2014). Sake yeasts have many characteristics suitable for sake brewing, such as aromatic production and high ethanol tolerance (Katou et al. 2008). <b>Sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains have been selected through several hundred years of brewing (Shiroma et al. 2014); however, more rapid methods for generating new and superior strains are highly desirable.|$|E
40|$|Sake is a {{traditional}} alcoholic drink in Japan. Both saccharification and alcohol fermentation take place simultaneously in sake-brewing. The final alcohol content is about 15 ％ in average. In previous study, we had determined some key factors affected sake-brewing in laboratory scale. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of sake-brewing using various kind of glutinous rice in a larger scale {{and the effects of}} using different <b>sake</b> <b>yeasts</b> on fermentation. Besides, the feasibility of using glutinuous rice as raw material to obtain a sake with a novel flavor was also studied. The production of koji starter is usually a key step in an industrial sake-brewing. The optimal conditions of its cultivation and dehydration were determined. In the process of koji starter-making, 0. 75 ％(w/w) charcoal and 0. 1 ％(w/w) spore suspension were added to steamed rice and mix thoroughly. The inoculated steamed rice was then cultivated at 30 ℃ for 4 days, followed by dehydrated at 50 ℃ for 24 hours. In the study of a larger-scale sake-brewing, the final concentration of ethanol in mash was 17. 47 ％(w/w) in average. Contents of both glucose and maltose in mash fell to zero at the end of fermentation. Lactic acid, malic acid and succinic acid are the major organic acids in fermented mash. The flavor related constituents, such as glucose, maltose and malic acid, were more dominant at the 29 th day compared to those obtained at the 33 th day in the sake mash. The concentration of ethanol in mash was 16. 65 ％(w/w) at the 29 th day. It was probable a better approach to shorten the fermentation day of sake-brewing by 4 days. The effects of using different <b>sake</b> <b>yeasts</b> on <b>sake</b> brewing was examined as follows. When each fermentation was performed by using two different yeast, Saccharomyce cerevisiae k 901 and BCRC 21679, a highest concentration with 17. 3 ％(w/w) of ethanol was always obtained. And the rice varieties used didn't cause an effect on the final ethanol concentration. There was no residual glucose or maltose in mash. The concentrations of organic acids showed a great variety divergency in values. When the japonica rice was used as raw material and fermented by a mixed culture of two yeast strains, the concentration of succinic acid was 1. 012 ％(w/w) at the 29 th day and 0. 6021 ％(w/w) at the 33 th day, They were the highest one among the test清酒為日本傳統釀造酒，屬糖化與酒精發酵同時進行之並行複式發酵，發酵後酒醪可達平均約 15 ％之酒精濃度。本研究延續本實驗室過去有關以使用糯米為原料進行，較大量清酒釀造試驗之可行性；以及以不同酵母菌進行清酒釀造之影響，期能獲得原料或菌株不同所帶來之特殊風味。 種麴製備為量產清酒的步驟之一。結果發現種麴製備條件為添加 0. 75 ％木炭至蒸飯混合後，接種 0. 1 ％Aspergillus oryzae BCRC 32279 之孢子懸浮液，於 30 ℃下培養四天，出麴後以 50 ℃熱風乾燥 24 小時。 以W 3 、AF 2 及TKW 1 等三種糯米進行較大量糯米清酒之釀造試驗部分，發酵完成時清酒醪之乙醇濃度平均可達 17. 47 ％（w/w），葡萄糖及麥芽糖幾乎完全被酵母菌利用，有機酸含量依次為乳酸、蘋果酸及琥珀酸；但發酵至第 29 天酒醪中葡萄糖、麥芽糖及蘋果酸等可能影響風味之成分皆較第 33 天者高，乙醇濃度平均也可達 16. 65 ％（w/w），故以糯米為原料進行清酒放大試驗時可嘗試將發酵時間縮短至 29 天。 以不同酵母菌Saccharomyce cerevisiae BCRC 21679 及K 901 釀造清酒時對清酒醪成份之影響，以混合兩株酵母菌進行發酵者，不論原料為糯米或梗米皆可達 17. 3 ％（w/w）之酒精濃度為最高。葡萄糖及麥芽糖之利用率與前述以BCRC 21679 釀造糯米清酒之結果相似，發酵第 33 天皆無殘留。蘋果酸、琥珀酸、乳酸、醋酸、檸檬酸及延胡索酸等有機酸含量於各實驗組間所呈現之結果極大，其中以稉米為原料並使用混合菌株發酵者於發酵第 29 及 33 天其等清酒醪之琥珀酸含量最高，分別為 1. 012 ％（w/w）及 0. 6021 ％（w/w）。壹、前言……………………………………………………………	 1 貳、文獻整理………………………………………………………	 2 【壹】清酒釀造之基礎理論………………………………………	 2 一、清酒（Sake）的種類…………………………………………	 2 (一) 吟釀酒………………………………………………………	 2 (二) 純米酒……………………………………………………… 2 (三) 本釀造酒……………………………………………………	 2 二、清酒之釀造……………………………………………………	 5 三、清酒釀造原料及處理…………………………………………	 5 (一) 釀造用水……………………………………………………	 5 (二) 原料米………………………………………………………	 5 四、清酒麴（koji）…………………………………	 10 (一) 麴之分類…… [...] ……………………………………………	 10 (二) 清酒麴之麴菌和種麴………………………………………	 10 (三) 清酒麴之功能………………………………………………	 15 (四) 麴菌增殖特性………………………………………………	 16 (五) 清酒麴之酵素………………………………………………	 17 (六) 清酒麴之製造………………………………………………	 18 (七) 製麴之污染微生物…………………………………………	 22 五、酒母（seed mash/moto）之種類及製造……	 26 (一) 酒母之種類…………………………………………………	 26 (二) 酒母中之酵母菌……………………………………………	 29 (三) 酵母菌之葡萄糖代謝………………………………………	 29 (四) 酵母菌對酒液中有機酸之貢獻……………………………	 34 (五) 酵母菌對酒類芳香化合物生成的影響……………………	 34 六、清酒醪（mash）……………………………………………	 37 (一) 特徵…………………………………………………………	 37 (二) 清酒醪中成分之變化………………………………………	 39 七、殺菌及熟成……………………………………………………	 39 (一) 壓榨、過濾…………………………………………………	 39 (二) 加熱殺菌……………………………………………………	 40 (三) 微生物之管理—火落菌……………………………………	 40 【貳】糯米清酒之釀造………………………………………	 43 一、稻米的分類……………………………………………………	 43 (一) 依品種類型（variety group）區分……………………	 43 (二) 依胚乳（endosperm）特性區分…………………………	 43 二、糯米清酒………………………………………………………	 43 參、實驗大綱………………………………………………………	 44 【壹】第一部份實驗較大規模之糯米清酒釀造試驗……………	 44 【貳】第二部份實驗不同酵母菌對清酒成分之影響………	 44 肆、材料與方法……………………………………………………	 45 【壹】實驗材料……………………………………………………	 45 一、米………………………………………………………………	 45 二、實驗菌株………………………………………………………	 45 (一) 麴菌種（Aspergillus oryzae）………………………	 45 (二) 酵母菌種（Saccharomyces cerevisiae）…………	 45 三、種之培養及保存………………………………………………	 45 (一) 麴菌培養及保存用培養基…………………………………	 45 (二) 酵母菌活化、計數及保存用培養基………………………	 46 四、化學藥劑………………………………………………………	 46 (一) 培養及保存菌種之試藥……………………………………	 46 (二) 酵素活性測定試藥…………………………………………	 46 (三) 基本成分分析試藥…………………………………………	 48 五、儀器設備…………………………………………	 48 六、電腦套裝軟體…………………………………………………	 49 【貳】實驗方法………………………………………………	 50 一、種麴的製備……………………………………………………	 50 (一) 米飯基質的製備……………………………………………	 50 (二) 孢子懸浮液的製備…………………………………………	 50 (三) 木灰的製備…………………………………………………	 50 (四) 種麴製備……………………………………………………	 50 (五) 分析項目……………………………………………………	 52 二、米麴的培養……………………………………………………	 51 (一) 製麴過程……………………………………………………	 55 (二) 分析項目……………………………………………………	 55 三、清酒之釀造流程………………………………………………	 58 (一) 酒母的製造…………………………………………………	 58 (二) 酒醪的發酵…………………………………………………	 58 (三) 澄清過濾……………………………………………………	 58 (四) 分析項目……………………………………………………	 58 伍、結果與討論……………………………………………………	 65 【壹】較大規模之糯米清酒釀造試驗……………………………	 65 一、種麴製備條件之探討…………………………………………	 65 (一) 木灰或木炭之添加比例及培養天數………………………	 65 (二) 木炭、木灰及種麴用米之微量金屬成分…………………	 67 (三) 種麴乾燥溫度及時間………………………………………	 75 二、以種麴製作米麴之試驗………………………………………	 76 三、糯米清酒之釀造………………………………………………	 76 (一) 可溶性固形物………………………………………………	 80 (二) pH值…………………………………………………………	 80 (三) 酵母生菌數…………………………………………………	 83 (四) 可滴定酸……………………………………………………	 83 (五) 胺基酸態氮…………………………………………………	 83 (六) 乙醇濃度……………………………………………………	 87 (七) 綜合比較……………………………………………………	 89 (八) 殘糖含量……………………………………………………	 94 (九) 有機酸含量…………………………………………………	 97 (十) 原料米之粗蛋白含量………………………………………	 97 (十一) 單元結論…………………………………… 97 【貳】不同酵母菌對清酒成分之影響………………………	 99 一、可溶性固形物……………………………………… 99 二、pH值………………………………………………	 99 三、酵母生菌數………………………………………	 102 四、可滴定酸…………………………………………	 102 五、胺基酸態氮………………………………………	 102 六、乙醇濃度…………………………………………	 106 七、綜合比較…………………………………………	 106 八、殘糖含量…………………………………………	 110 九、有機酸含量………………………………………	 113 十、單元結論…………………………………………	 117 柒、參考文獻………………………………………………………	 11...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{economic}} and product quality advantages exist in brewing when high-gravity worts of 16 to 18 % dissolved solids are fermented. Above this level, production problems such as slow or stuck fermentations and poor yeast viability occur. Ethanol toxicity has been cited as the main cause, as brewers' yeasts are reported to tolerate only 7 to 9 % (vol/vol) ethanol. The inhibitory effect of high osmotic pressure has also been implicated. In this report, it is demonstrated that the factor limiting the production of high levels of ethanol by brewing yeasts is actually a nutritional deficiency. When a nitrogen source, ergosterol, and oleic acid are added to worts up to 31 % dissolved solids, {{it is possible to}} produce beers up to 16. 2 % (vol/vol) ethanol. Yeast viability remains high, and the yeasts can be repitched at least five times. Supplementation does not increase the fermentative tolerance of the yeasts to ethanol but increases the length and level of new yeast cell mass synthesis over that seen in unsupplemented wort (and therefore the period of more rapid wort attenuation). Glycogen, protein, and sterol levels in yeasts were examined, as was the importance of pitching rate, temperature, and degree of anaerobiosis. The ethanol tolerance of brewers' yeast is suggested to be no different than that of <b>sake</b> or distillers' <b>yeast...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sake, a {{traditional}} alcoholic beverage in Japan, is brewed with sake yeasts, which {{are classified as}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Almost all sake yeasts form a thick foam layer on sake mash during the fermentation process because of their cell surface hydrophobicity, which increases the cells' affinity for bubbles. To {{reduce the amount of}} foam, nonfoaming mutants were bred from foaming sake yeasts. Nonfoaming mutants have hydrophilic cell surfaces and no affinity for bubbles. We have cloned a gene from a foam-forming <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> that confers foaming ability to a nonfoaming mutant. This gene was named AWA 1 and structures of the gene and its product were analyzed. The N- and C-terminal regions of Awa 1 p have the characteristic sequences of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor protein. The entire protein is rich in serine and threonine residues and has a lot of repetitive sequences. These results suggest that Awa 1 p is localized in the cell wall. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting analysis using hemagglutinin-tagged Awa 1 p. Moreover, an awa 1 disruptant of <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> was hydrophilic and showed a nonfoaming phenotype in sake mash.

Analysis of genes revealed the presence of both K 7 -acquired and K 7 -lost genes, in addition to numerous others with segmentations and terminal discrepancies in comparison with those of S 288 C. The distribution of Ty element also largely differed in the two strains. Interestingly, two regions in chromosomes I and VII of S 288 C have apparently been replaced by Ty elements in K 7.

Hence the interrelationship between the several yeasts was examined by the writers by means of the reactions of agglutination, precipitin and complement fixation. The yeasts used were as follows: Endomyces fibuliger Lindner, Zygosaccharomyces Barkeri Saccardo-Sydow, Debaryomyces globosus Klecker, Saccharomyces sake Yabe (<b>sake</b> <b>yeast),</b> bottom beer yeast 2 ̆ 2 Asahi, 2 ̆ 2 Schizosaccharomyces octosporus Beijerinek and Torula C. Yeasts which are included in different genera according to the botanical classification, were clearly distinguished from each other by the agglutinin test.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the interrelationship of yeasts more widely, the writers {{have used the}} following yeasts: (1) Carlsberg 2 ̆ 7 s bottom yeast no. 1 (Saccharomyces Carlsbergensis Hansen), (2) bottom beer yeast 2 ̆ 2 Yebisu 2 ̆ 2, (3) wine yeast 2 ̆ 2 Johannisberg 2 ̆ 2, (4) Saccharomyces ellipsoideus Hansen, (5) Saccharomyces turbidans Hansen, (6) Saccharomyces Pastorianus Hansen, (7) Saccharomyces validus Hansen, (8) Saccharomyces Sake Yabe, (9) Debaryoinyces globosus KlOcker, (10) Pichia membranaefaciens Hansen. 2 ̆ 2 Ringprobe 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Absattiguiigsverfahren 2 ̆ 2 were employed in the examination of these yeasts. While methcd of preparing the maceration juices was {{much the same as}} that covered in the first report, it differed from the former in using 20 times the amount of dried yeast powder, and in incubating the mixture of yeast and water for 6 days. Carrying on the 2 ̆ 2 Ringprobe 2 ̆ 2 test with these m aceration juices, the writers have demonstrated that precipitin reaction could be positively recognised even in dilution as high as 2000 times. The results are summarised in the following : (1) sake yeasts, wine yeasts, and beer yeasts are to be judged to be very closely allied organisms in their serological relationship, because they are undistinguishable from each other by 2 ̆ 2 Ringprobe 2 ̆ 2, (2) It is a very interesting fact that Saccharounyces turbidans, Saccharomyces Pastorianus and Saccharomyces validus, which are involved in the same undergroup with <b>Sake</b> <b>yeast,</b> wine yeast and beer yeast according to Hansen 2 ̆ 7 s classification, and are known as the pathogenic yeasts from industrial points of view, are precisely distinguished from the latter three species which are called the useful yeasts. (3) The closely related yeasts such as <b>sake</b> <b>yeast,</b> wine yeast and beer yeast were clearly differentiated from each other by 2 ̆ 2 Absattigungsverfahren 2 ̆ 2. (4) The varieties of <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> have never been distinguished one from another by either tests. (5) In the case of the identification of yeasts, it seems to be necessary to consider the serodiagnostic results with the classifications depending upon their morphological and cultural characteristics. 第一表 1 - 10 に見る如く (a) 清酒酵母菌類 (Saccharomyces Sake), 葡萄酒酵母菌類 (Saccharomyces ellipsoideus, Wine yeast 2 ̆ 2 Johannisberg 2 ̆ 2) 及び麥酒酵母菌類 (Saccharomyces Carlsbergensis, Bottom Beer Yeast 2 ̆ 2 Yebisu 2 ̆ 2) は輪環反應に依りて孰れも同樣に反應し之を麗別し難く其近縁的關係は五に接近せり。(b) HANSEN に從へば同一の Untergruppe に包括せらるゝSuccharomyces Pastorianus, Saccharomyces turbidans 及び Saccharomyces validus の如き釀造上の病源酵母菌類とも呼ぱるゝ種類は清酒酵母菌類, 葡萄酒酵母菌類及び麥酒酵母菌の如き有用酵母類とも云はるゝ種類に對して血清學的にも區別せらるゝは興味ある事實なり。第二表 1 - 38 は (c) 輪環反應に依りては類屬反應を呈する清酒酵母菌類, 葡萄酒酵母菌類及び麥酒酵母菌類の如き互に近縁なる酵母類に於ても試驗管内飽和法に依る時はかなり明瞭に相互を識別し得ることを示せり。第三表の結果は (d) 清酒酵母菌類の各種は互に區別し能はざることを明瞭ならしむ。以上の成績は從來一般に認めらるゝ酵母菌類の分類法のみに從ひ其位置を決定することは固より絶對に正確且つ必然的のものに非ず。細菌類の場合と同樣に更に血清學的觀察の結果をも考慮するの必要あることを指示するなり...|$|E
30|$|Although it was {{demonstrated}} that the basic method developed here (Fig.  2 a) was applicable for the isolation of yeast cells with mating ability from common <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains, due to the requirement for the repeated exchange of plasmids, this approach still required multiple steps to perform the final hybridization and isolated a- or α-type derivatives. To {{reduce the need for}} plasmid exchange steps, we introduced a third marker gene, which was compatible with the hygro and kanMX 4 marker genes, into the selection system. Using the commercial plasmid pAUR 112, which contains the AUR 1 -C marker gene, we successfully isolated hybrid cells without the need for the time-consuming plasmid exchange process. In a back-crossing comprising n cycles of hybridization, only a single plasmid exchange step would be required in the scheme illustrated in Fig.  2 b and c, whereas (2 n +  1) plasmid exchange steps would be needed in the scheme described in Fig.  2 a.|$|E
30|$|Sake yeasts {{belong to}} the budding yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have high {{fermentation}} activity and ethanol production. Although the traditional crossbreeding of sake yeasts is a time-consuming and inefficient process due to the low sporulation rates and spore viability of these strains, considerable effort {{has been devoted to}} the development of hybrid strains with superior brewing characteristics. In the present work, we describe a growth selection system for a- and α-type cells aimed at the crossbreeding of industrial yeasts, and performed hybridizations with <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains Kyokai No. 6, No. 7 and No. 9 to examine the feasibility of this approach. We successfully generated both a- and α-type strains from all parental strains, and acquired six types of hybrids by outcrossing. One of these hybrid strains was subjected to continuous crossbreeding, yielding the multi-hybrid strain, which inherited the genetic characteristics of Kyokai No. 6, No. 7 and No. 9. Notably, because all of the genetic modifications of the yeast cells were introduced using plasmids, these traits can be easily removed. The approach described here has the potential to markedly accelerate the crossbreeding of industrial yeast strains with desirable properties.|$|E
40|$|Acetic acid, a {{byproduct}} formed during yeast alcoholic fermentation, {{is the main}} component of volatile acidity (VA). When present in high concentrations in wine, acetic acid imparts an undesirable ‘vinegary’ character that results in a significant reduction in quality and sales. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} <b>saké</b> <b>yeast</b> strains resistant to the antifungal cerulenin produce significantly lower levels of VA. In this study, we used a classical mutagenesis method to isolate a series of cerulenin-resistant strains, derived from a commercial diploid wine yeast. Four of the selected strains showed a consistent low-VA production phenotype after small-scale fermentation of different white and red grape musts. Specific mutations in YAP 1, a gene encoding a transcription factor required for oxidative stress tolerance, were found in three of the four low-VA strains. When integrated into the genome of a haploid wine strain, the mutated YAP 1 alleles partially reproduced the low-VA production phenotype of the diploid cerulenin-resistant strains, suggesting that YAP 1 might play a role in (regulating) acetic acid production during fermentation. This study offers prospects for the development of low-VA wine yeast starter strains that could assist winemakers in their effort to consistently produce wine to definable quality specifications. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Auxotrophic mutants of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae are usually {{isolated}} in haploid strains because {{the isolation of}} recessive mutations in diploids {{is thought to be}} difficult due to the presence of two sets of genes. We show here that auxotrophic mutants of diploid industrial <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strains were routinely obtained by a standard mutant selection procedure following UV mutagenesis. We isolated His−, Met−, Lys−, Trp−, Leu−, Arg−, and Ura− auxotrophic mutants of five sake strains, Kyokai no. 7, no. 9, no. 10, no. 701, and no. 901, by screening only 1, 700 to 3, 400 colonies from each treated strain. Wild-type alleles were cloned and used as markers for transformation. With HIS 3 as a selectable marker, the yeast TDH 3 overexpression promoter was inserted upstream of ATF 1, encoding alcohol acetyltransferase, by one-step gene replacement in a his 3 mutant of Kyokai no. 7. The resulting strain contained exclusively yeast DNA, making it acceptable for commercial use, and produced a larger amount of isoamyl acetate, a banana-like flavor. We argue that the generally recognized difficulty of isolating auxotrophic mutants of diploid industrial yeast strains is misleading and that genetic techniques used for haploid laboratory strains are applicable for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|Urea is {{reported}} to be a main precursor of ethyl carbamate (ECA), which is suspected to be a carcinogen, in wine and sake. In order to minimize production of urea, arginase-deficient mutants (delta car 1 /delta car 1) were constructed from a diploid <b>sake</b> <b>yeast,</b> Kyokai no. 9, by successive disruption of the two copies of the CAR 1 gene. First, the yeast strain was transformed with plasmid pCAT 2 (delta car 1 SMR 1), and strains heterozygous for CAR 1 gene were isolated on sulfometuron methyl plates. Successively, the other CAR 1 gene was disrupted by transformation with plasmid pCAT 1 (delta car 1 G 418 r) and the resulting car 1 mutants were isolated on a G 418 plate. Arginase assay of the total cell lysate of the mutants showed that 70 % of transformants isolated on G 418 plates had no detectable enzyme activity, possibly {{as a result of the}} disruption of the two copies of the CAR 1 gene. Further genomic Southern analysis confirmed this result. We could brew sake containing no urea with the delta car 1 /delta car 1 homozygous mutant. It is of additional interest that no ECA was detected in the resulting sake, even after storage for 5 months at 30 degrees C. This molecular biological study suggests that ECA in sake originates mainly from urea that is produced by the arginase...|$|E
40|$|During the {{fermentation}} of sake, {{cells of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{are exposed to}} high concentrations of ethanol, thereby damaging the cell membrane and functional proteins. L-Proline protects yeast cells from damage caused by freezing or oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated the role of intracellular L-proline in cells of S. cerevisiae grown under ethanol stress. An L-proline-accumulating laboratory strain carries a mutant allele of PRO 1, pro 1 D 154 N, which encodes the Asp 154 Asn mutant -glutamyl kinase. This mutation increases the activity of -glutamyl kinase and -glutamyl phosphate reductase, which catalyze the first two steps of L-proline synthesis and which together may form a complex in vivo. When cultured in liquid medium {{in the presence of}} 9 % and 18 % ethanol under static conditions, the cell viability of the L-proline-accumulating laboratory strain is greater than the cell viability of the parent strain. This result suggests that intracellular accumulation of L-proline may confer tolerance to ethanol stress. We constructed a novel <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> strain by disrupting the PUT 1 gene, which is required for L-proline utilization, and replacing the wild-type PRO 1 allele with the pro 1 D 154 N allele. The resultant strain accumulated L-proline and was more tolerant to ethanol stress than was the control strain. We used the strain that could accumulate L-proline to brew sake containing five times more L-proline than what is found in sake brewed with the control strain, without affecting the fermentation profiles...|$|E
40|$|The killer {{character}} of strain {{isolated from the}} main mash of sake brewing which produces a killer substance for <b>sake</b> <b>yeast</b> was transmitted to hybrids of the strain and a standard strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae through a cytoplasmic determinant. The character was eliminated at 41 degrees C by incubation followed by growth at 30 degrees C. The killer strain produced the killer toxin in a growth-associated manner. A preparation of crude killer toxin extract showed first-order inactivation and a linear Arrhenius plot between 25 and 40 degrees C, with an activation of energy of 55. 0 kcal/mol. Addition of 1 % of synthetic polymer protected the toxin from inactivation by agitation but not by heat. Enhancement of the killer action toward sensitive yeast cells by only the nucleotide adenosine 5 '-diphosphate (ADP) was observed after plating on agar medium as well as after incubation in liquid medium. The addition of CaCl 2 reversed the enhancing effect of ADP on killing activity. This action of CaCl 2 was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that protein synthesis is required for recovery of toxin-induced cells {{in the presence of}} CaCl 2. Further, CaCl 2 overcame the decrease in the intracellular level of adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) enhanced by ADP in killer-treated cells and also inhibited leakage of ATP from the cells with immediate response. The mode of killing action is discussed in terms of a transient state of the cells and the action of ADP and CaCl 2...|$|E
