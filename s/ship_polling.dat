5000|$|In 2016, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) {{asked the}} public to vote on names for a new polar {{research}} <b>ship.</b> The online <b>poll</b> was active from 17 March to 16 April 2016 with the name [...] "Boaty McBoatface" [...] garnering 124,109 votes, roughly four {{times more than the}} runner up [...] "Poppy Mai". Despite huge popular demand, Johnson oversaw the decision to name the vessel [...] "RRS Sir David Attenborough", causing Guardian columnist, Stuart Heritage, to lament, [...] "tyrants have crushed the people's will".|$|R
50|$|Before his watch, Austen {{is asked}} by Frenchy to draw his {{portrait}} {{to send to}} his daughter. Frenchy decides to leave the Navy when his enlistment is over and insists on paying for the portrait with gambling winnings, which Austen accepts on the condition it be sent to Frenchys family. The injured Edge sneaks out of his quarters, steals a pistol from a sailor on security duty, and plans to rape and kill both Fowler and Gray in the brig. On watch, the executive officer breaks down completely and insists that every crew member aboard the <b>ship</b> be <b>polled</b> {{to see if they}} hate him. The captain, listening from his sea cabin, relieves the executive officer, and orders Austen to find Edge, who has been seen prowling the ship. Edge intimidates the brig guard into opening the cell but he is thwarted when the prisoner with Fowler is not Gray but Slobodjian, who knows what Edge plans to do. He cuts Edge with a hidden knife to prevent him from using the gun. Edge hides his wound from the guard and leaves, realizing he would be unable to explain his behavior, taking refuge in a stowage compartment. Austen finds him however, and by refusing to fight Edge when challenged, breaks him down psychologically, recovering the pistol and leaving Edge to his own demons.|$|R
5000|$|Gold Ship {{was then}} {{aimed at the}} Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and began his {{preparation}} for the race with a run in the Grade 2 Sapporo Kinen over ten furlongs at Sapporo Racecourse on 24 August. He finished second, beaten three-quarters of a length by Oka Sho winner Harp Star. Sugai {{said that it was}} [...] "no disgrace to fail" [...] when attempting to concede eleven pounds to the three-year-old filly. In the Arc de Triomphe on 5 October, Gold Ship started at odds of 12.9/1 in a three-horse Japanese challenge which also included Harp Star and Just A Way. After becoming agitated in the pre-race parade, he started poorly and raced {{at the back of the}} twenty-runner field for most of the way. He made some progress in the straight but never looked likely to make a serious challenge and finished fourteenth of the twenty runners, seven lengths behind the winner, Treve. Shortly after his return from Europe, Gold <b>Ship</b> topped the <b>poll</b> to decide the runners for the Arima Kinen. At Nakayama on 28 December he started the favourite for the Arima Kinen ahead of Epiphaneia, Just A Way and Gentildonna. He made steady progress on the outside in the straight but was unable to reach the leaders and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a nose by Gentildonna and To The World.|$|R
