50|$|A hay box, <b>straw</b> <b>box,</b> fireless cooker, {{insulation}} cooker, wonder oven or retained-heat cooker is a cooker that utilizes {{the heat}} of the food being cooked to complete the cooking process. Food items to be cooked are heated to boiling point, and then insulated. Over a period of time, the food items cook by the heat captured in the insulated container. Generally, it takes three times the normal cooking time to cook food in a hay box.|$|E
50|$|On April 1, 2010, Konami {{released}} a short promotional video with Patrice Desilets, the {{creative director of}} Assassin's Creed II. The clip, which was an April Fool's Day joke, features Snake performing Altaïr's leap of faith dive into a large pile of hay (the Assassin's <b>Straw</b> <b>Box)</b> and stealthily knocking out enemies. The Easter egg {{is part of the}} game as a special Love Box that players can use to capture enemies, but it can also deteriorate with repeated use. Konami and Ubisoft earlier produced an Assassins Creed-themed April Fool's Day joke for Metal Gear Solid 4 in 2008, which featured Snake wearing an Altaïr costume.|$|E

It was littered with <b>straw</b> and <b>boxes,</b> and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{response}} of Plantago ovata Forsk to organic and inorganic fertilizers a green house experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. Organic fertilizers were cow manure (4 and 8 tons/ha) and municipal waste compost (4 and 8 tons/ha) and inorganic fertilizers were N 30 P 10, N 30 P 20, N 60 P 10 and N 60 P 20 kg/ha respectively. The results indicated that yield and yield components of Plantago ovata in organic fertilizers were higher than inorganic fertilizers. Plant height, spike length, grains weight per spike, grains weight per plant, straw weight per plant and grain and <b>straw</b> yields per <b>box</b> were highest in 8 tons/ha municipal waste compost.

Our objective was to determine the role of postingestive feedback from macronutrients on the ingestion of a low-quality forage by sheep (Ovis aries). We compared the ingestive behaviour of two groups of lambs conditioned with intraruminal infusions of starch (100 g/lamb/day; Group 1) or water (250 ml/lamb/day; Group 2) while they grazed wheat straw (held erect in wooden frames; 30 cm height; Trials 1, 2 and 3) or consumed wheat <b>straw</b> from food <b>boxes</b> (1 – 2 cm particle size; Trial 4). Lambs were conditioned as individuals during Trials 1 and 4, in pairs during Trial 2, and as two groups (Groups 1 and 2) during Trial 3. Ingestive behaviour – intake, intake rate, number of bites, bite size, bite rate — was assessed during individual tests that lasted 5 min/lamb. After conditioning and testing, all animals had restricted access (80...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{conducted}} {{together with the}} environmental- and health department in Halmstad community. The thesis is about allowance of bedding and water supply for pig farms in Halmstad community. These farms are chosen randomly {{from all of the}} pig farms in Halmstad community. It includes inspection of 27 pig farms and writing of a report. During the inspections I study the amount of bedding, what kind of bedding, water supply and injuries like lameness, shoulder-bone sore, ear-, flank- and pig tail biting. Also the amounts of dirty boxes were documented. The reason for this thesis depends on the new regulation about bedding that came out the first of October 2007. The regulation about free access of water is not new but the community wanted a mapping of these are followed. These inspections show that some of the farmers do not follow the regulation about free access of water to the pigs. According to the amount of observed shoulder-bone sore and pigtail biting the regulation is not followed. According to my investigation there are tendencies of growing amounts of shoulder-bone sore when there is too little straw. Sows that get 0 - 300 grams of <b>straw</b> per <b>box</b> per day have a share of 5 % shoulder-bone sore, if the amount of straw increases to 300 - 600 grams straw per day the amount of shoulder-bone sore halves. If the amount of straw increases to more than 600 grams per day the amount of shoulder-bone sore halves according to the sows that get 300 - 600 grams straw per day. My studies in this subject have shown that pig tail biting only existed when the water flow were 3, 3 litres per minute or lower. The low water flow together with little straw increases the pig tail biting. In the boxes with only 0 - 300 gram straw per day the amount of pigtail biting was 4, 5 %. If the amount of straw increased to more than 300 gram per box a day the amount of pigtail biting was decreased by 50 %. Lameness mostly exists on those pigs that get 0 - 300 grams of straw...|$|R
