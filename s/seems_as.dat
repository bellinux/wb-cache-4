5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if nature joins with the narrator in {{mourning}} for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if {{the dog is}} cured, in {{that he is now}} {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} {{for the sixth}} season, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, {{to try to win}} Blaine back.|$|E

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience {{and goes on to}} steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued {{his work as a}} royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. When it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{tenacity}} (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads {{to trying to}} ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.|$|E

25|$|An independent, {{critical}} {{voice on}} politics, literature, science, {{and the arts}} <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> much needed {{today as it was}} when Barbara Epstein and I put out the first edition of the New York Review fifty years ago – perhaps even more so. Electronic forms of communication grow rapidly in every field of life but many of their effects on culture remain obscure and in need of new kinds of critical scrutiny. That will be a central concern of the Review for the years to come.|$|E
25|$|Far less {{is known}} about the history of {{southern}} Sudan. It <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> though it was home to a variety of semi-nomadic tribes. In the 16th century one of these tribes, known as the Funj, moved north and united Nubia forming the Kingdom of Sennar. The Funj sultans quickly converted to Islam and that religion steadily became more entrenched. At the same time, the Darfur Sultanate arose in the west. Between them, the Taqali established a state in the Nuba Hills.|$|E
25|$|In 1590 when Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill (Red Hugh O'Donnell) {{was held}} in Dublin Castle, his half-brother, Domhnall, {{attempted}} to wrest Tír Conaill from his father Aodh. Aodh Ruadh's mother in response mustered a large force of Scots and also the Mac Suibhne branches of Na Tuatha and Fanad to oppose Domhnall. During this time Donnchadh. lord of Banagh took Domhnall's side, along with Ó Baoighill. The opposing forces met near Glencolumbkille, in September 1590, and Domhnall's force was defeated. By 1592 Aodh Ruadh was in power of Tír Conaill and it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if Donnchadh was pardoned for opposing him, as Donnchadh was present at Aodh Ruadh's inauguration at Kilmacrenan.|$|E

25|$|T-72Z/Type 72Z/Safir-74 - Iranian {{upgraded}} T-54/55 and Type-59 (Chinese {{copy of the}} T-54A), T-72Z {{being the}} name given to the upgraded T-55s, Safir 74 being the name given to the upgraded T-54s and Type 72Z being the name given to the upgraded Type-59s. The upgrades Include the new fire control system Fotona EFCS-3B (with laser rangefinder, cross-wind sensor, ballistic computer and gunner's passive night vision device), a 105mm tank gun, side skirts, smoke grenade launchers, ERA package, a new power-pack with 780hp 12-cylinder V-46-6 diesel engine and new tracks. Iranian sources state {{there was also a}} plan to arm the tanks with a 2A46 125mm tank gun, but it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if this project was canceled.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of having a}} judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any checks and balances in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

25|$|Psycho-physical {{parallelism}} is a {{very unusual}} view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps only truly, advocated by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of occasionalism, stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz's idea is that God has created a pre-established harmony such that it only <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence the term parallelism is used to describe this view.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{industry}} is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public. In the world of fashion, it often <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% “felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny”, with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin. Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models, while 46% will strive to achieve it. The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing “the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued”. For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the {{international}} media reported on increasing levels of anti-Semitic hate-crime in Malmö, the country's third-largest city, in southern Sweden. The reports cited desecrations, {{the burning of}} a chapel and worshippers being taunted with 'Hitler' chants. In 2009 the Malmö police received reports of 79 anti-Semitic incidents, {{double the number of}} the previous year (2008). For example, on January 13, 2009 Molotov cocktails were thrown inside and outside the funeral chapel at the old Jewish cemetery in the city of Malmö, in what <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> an anti-Semitic act. It was the third time the chapel has been attacked in the few weeks before this incident. On September 28, 2012, an explosion occurred at Malmö Jewish community building, again as what seems to be an anti-Semitic act. Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmö Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. “Malmö is a place to move away from,” he said, citing anti-Semitism as the primary reason.|$|E
