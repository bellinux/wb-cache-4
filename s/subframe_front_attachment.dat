50|$|The car was {{designed}} by Centro Stile Alfa Romeo (Style Centre) and developed by Alfa Romeo.The chassis is composed of a central carbon fiber tub, with aluminium <b>subframes</b> <b>front</b> and rear. The carbon fiber tub is produced by TTA (Tecno Tessile Adler) in Airola, as {{a joint venture between}} Adler Plastic and Lavorazione Materiali Compositi. The carbon fiber components that make up the chassis are cut using CNC technology.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} utilises a {{front engine}} transaxle design with engines and gearboxes mounted transversly on a subframe. Only straight 5 engines were offered.A <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> and <b>front</b> MacPherson struts were used and either Volvo's patented Deltalink rear axle on FWD models or Volvo's Multi-Link rear suspension with an independent rear subframe on AWD models.|$|R
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was fully}} independent, with MacPherson struts, pressed steel lower control arms, and an anti-roll bar. The front suspension, {{together with the}} major mechanicals (engine and transmission) is remotely mounted on a <b>front</b> <b>subframe.</b> On <b>front</b> wheel drive models, the rear suspension is semi independent, consisting of a torsion beam axle linked to trailing arms, with double conical coil springs and direct acting telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers, with certain models also having an anti roll bar.|$|R

50|$|Sling {{attachment}} {{points are}} mounted {{on each side}} of the rifle, so it can be carried flat against the back and used comfortably by left- and right-handed users. A <b>front</b> <b>attachment</b> point is situated below the fore end and can be used to anchor a target style sling or replaced by an adapter for a Harris bipod.|$|R
5000|$|The Pulsar Digisight N550 (which ceased {{production}} in September 2012, {{and has now}} {{been replaced by the}} Pulsar N750 Digisight) had performance comparable to Gen2 and resolution comparable to lower-end Gen3 systems, but {{at a fraction of the}} price. The Pulsar Digisight, and recently released Pulsar Forward DFA75 and Pulsar DN55 digital <b>front</b> <b>attachment</b> are further advances ...|$|R
5000|$|Shovels {{normally}} {{consist of}} a revolving deck with a power plant, driving and controlling mechanisms, usually a counterweight, and a <b>front</b> <b>attachment,</b> such as a crane ("boom") which supports a handle ("dipper" [...] or [...] "dipper stick") with a digger ("bucket") at the end. [...] "Dipper" [...] is also sometimes {{used to refer to}} the handle and digger combined. The machinery is mounted on a base platform with tracks or wheels. Modern bucket capacities range from 8 m3 to nearly 80 m3.|$|R
50|$|The major {{components}} {{included in a}} loader are the engine (diesel in almost all cases), the hydraulic components (pumps, motors, valves and so on) and the transmission components (gearbox, axles, wheels/tracks, pumps, motors, etc.). The engine runs both the hydraulics and the transmission and these in turn move the <b>front</b> <b>attachment</b> (a bucket, forks, sweeper, etc.) to manipulate the material which we are handling (sand, gravel, cereal, manure or anything else) and the wheels or tracks to move the machine around the jobsite.|$|R
50|$|A large {{proportion}} of the high development cost was due to the Mondeo being a completely new design, sharing very little, if anything, with the Ford Sierra. Unlike the Sierra, the Mondeo is front-wheel drive in its most common form, with a rarer four-wheel drive version available on the Mk I car only. Over optimistically the floor pan was designed to accept virtually any conceivable drivetrain, from a transverse four to a longitudinal V-8. This resulted in a hugely obtrusive and mostly disused bellhousing cover and transmission tunnel. The resulting interior front of the car, especially the footwells, feel far more cramped than would be expected from a vehicle of this size. The Mondeo featured new manual and automatic transmissions and sophisticated suspension design, which give it class-leading handling and ride qualities, and <b>subframes</b> <b>front</b> and rear to give it executive car refinement. The automatic transmission featured electronic control with sport and economy modes plus switchable overdrive. The program manager from 1988, and throughout its early development, was David Price.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in February 1970, the second-generation Camaro was {{produced}} through the 1981 model year, with cosmetic changes made in 1974 and 1978 model years. The car was heavily restyled and became somewhat larger and wider {{with the new}} styling. Still based on the F-body platform, the new Camaro was similar to its predecessor, with a unibody structure, <b>front</b> <b>subframe,</b> an A-arm <b>front</b> suspension, and leaf springs to control the solid rear axle. Road & Track picked the 1971 SS350 {{as one of the}} 10 best cars in the world in August 1971. RS (shown to the right), SS package was dropped in 1972 and reintroduced in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The pistol uses an {{integral}} suppressor, which, unlike most similar systems, {{consists of two}} parts. This allows the pistol to be carried and kept concealed without the front part of the suppressor attached, and for the suppressor to be quickly deployed prior to use. The pistol may also be fired safely without the additional suppressor attachment, which may be important in critical situations. Without the <b>front</b> <b>attachment,</b> the pistol has a similar sound to the Makarov pistol. The detached suppressor is carried in a special compartment of the holster which was designed for the PB.|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} model of a car <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> has been {{calibrated}} against test data. Stepped-sine testing {{has been used to}} give frequency response function estimates on an ensemble of seemingly identical subframes. Therefore, the deviation between test data and simulation results can be compared in a meaningful way by the outcome of model calibration and cross-validation. Emphasis has been put on the preparation of the test pieces for high fidelity testing and on bettering the chances of getting a calibration outcome that provides insight into the physical processes that govern the <b>subframe</b> dynamics. The <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> model has more than 200, 000 degrees-of-freedom and 17 model calibration parameters. The efficiency of the calibration procedure under these conditions is reported. To achieve efficiency, a calibration with a smooth deviation metric is used together with a damping equalization method that eliminates the need for matching of experimental and analytical eigenmodes. The method is combined with surrogate model frequency response evaluation based on model reduction for increased speed. The Matlab based open-domain software tool FEMcali that employs the Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer with randomized starts has been used for calibration and an unregularized Gauss-Newton minimizer has been used in the cross-validation...|$|R
5000|$|Like its {{predecessor}} the Dyna X and the Panhard Dynavia concept that influenced its design, the Dyna Z's body was originally aluminium with steel tube <b>subframes</b> <b>front</b> and rear joined by steel plate reinforcements in the sills. The {{decision to use}} aluminium sheeting for car bodies had been taken {{at a time when}} a sudden drop off in demand for fighter planes had left the producers with a glut of the metal, but in subsequent years the relative cost advantage of sheet steel had increased steadily. In Summer 1954 the cost penalty of persisting with aluminium bodywork had become financially insupportable, and in fall 1955 the latest Dynas Type [...] "Z1" [...] had a steel bodywork (the doors, trunk and hood were still in aluminium though). [...] The switch to sheet-steel body panels, attributed to [...] "various setbacks" [...] ("nombreuses déboires") with the aluminium body of the early Type Z1, imposed an instant weight penalty and was accompanied by a substantial redesign of the front suspension and a change to the shock absorbers, though cost savings were too late to avoid the need for Panhard to sign their ultimately suicidal refinancing [...] "agreement" [...] with Citroën in April 1955.|$|R
50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Endeavor is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’s PS platform. It uses RISE unibody {{structure}} that employs extensive reinforcement for additional passenger {{protection in the}} event of a collision. Robust <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> members are connected with a dash panel crossmember and a strong, front steel crossmember to help create a rigid, boxed <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> area. Reinforced side sill members also help disperse energy {{in the event of}} a collision. High-strength steel crossmembers across the floor also help absorb side impact energy and help protect occupants. Extensive use of energy absorbing materials appear on the interior and headliner and are used to cover the inside of the front center and rear pillars and help reduce the possibility of injury during a collision.|$|R
50|$|The early Robin Hood S7 {{used the}} <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> and {{mechanical}} components from any Dolomite, {{attached to a}} monocoque body made out of Stainless Steel. Later Robin Hoods were Ford based. The Latham F2 used the Dolomite mechanicals (usually Sprint), but attached to a fibreglass sports car body.|$|R
50|$|The ambidextrous {{laminated}} plywood stock features an adjustable butt plate {{that can be}} regulated for length of pull, height and pitch and has a height and length adjustable cheek comb. A fiber glass reinforced polymer stock was also offered. A <b>front</b> <b>attachment</b> point is situated at the foreend for mounting an integral folding bipod and the stock is prepared for mounting an integral rear monopod. The length of both bipod legs is independently adjustable and the rear monopod folds into the stock. A carrying handle can {{be attached to the}} stock in order to prevent the operator from grasping the rifle by its aiming optics during quick position changes or on the march.|$|R
5000|$|Berlina 2C (Tipo 818.100/101): 1964-69. Improved, more {{powerful}} Berlina launched late in 1963, with a [...] engine fitted with double twin-choke Solex carburettors. The body-shell also had revised <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> mountings. Distinguished by an enamelled [...] "2C" [...] badge on the radiator grille and rear [...] "Fulvia 2C" [...] script.|$|R
50|$|The {{weather and}} the battle between Kris Meeke and Guy Wilks {{dominated}} the weekend with Meeke winning the rally on the road. However, due to a technical infringement involving the <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> of Meeke's car, Meeke was excluded giving the rally win to Wilks. This was the first IRC win for Guy Wilks.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1976 GM began {{developing}} the J-body, an economy car platform {{intended to be}} shared across all its passenger car divisions. [...] It had a 101.2 in (2,570 mm) wheelbase, torsion beam rear suspension, and standard 4-cylinder engine. The unibody's <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> carried a MacPherson strut front suspension and transverse engine/transmission unit.|$|R
5000|$|The Coupé is a {{mid-engined}} two-seater {{sports car}} {{designed to give}} outstanding performance for its time, and impeccable handling. The design composed of two Mini <b>front</b> <b>subframes,</b> with traditional Mini rubber cone suspension, linked by a sheet steel semi-monocoque chassis. The chassis' deep centre tunnel backbone is supplemented by two generous sills. The car is mid-engined: the rear subframe contained the engine as in a Mini with the steering arms locked in position with adjustable rods and ball joints. This is {{held in place by}} a 1" [...] square tubular space frame, {{all the way from the}} rear bulkhead. The <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> carried the steering rack, fuel tank and radiator. Brakes and wheels remained as per the options available to the Mini, post April 1982 GTM coupes being designed to allow fitment of 13" [...] wheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{body is a}} two-door, two-seat Targa top design, {{meaning a}} portion of the roof may be removed and stored under the bonnet. The chassis is made from kevlar-reinforced carbon fiber. The kevlar-reinforced carbon fiber {{semi-monocoque}} is attached to a steel <b>subframe</b> at the <b>front</b> of the chassis, and an aluminum subframe at the rear.|$|R
2500|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium <b>front</b> <b>subframe.</b> Aluminium {{is used for}} the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of [...] V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the heavier steel subframe.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{passenger}} car use include the 1967-1981 GM F platform, the numerous years and models {{built on the}} GM X platform (1962), GM's M/L platform vans(Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, which included an all-wheel drive variant), and the unibody AMC Pacer that incorporated a <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> to isolate the passenger compartment from engine, suspension, and steering loads.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium <b>front</b> <b>subframe.</b> Aluminium {{is used for}} the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of 21 kg. V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the heavier steel subframe.|$|R
50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Galant is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’ PS platform. It uses a {{straight}} frame-rail RISE design body that absorbs and disperses {{energy in the}} event of a collision and offers improved structural rigidity to prevent longitudinal twisting. It features integrated, energy absorbing crumple zones and strategically applied reinforcements at key body points and steel side impact door beams. Every opening in the body, including doors, boot and engine compartment, is reinforced to help resist the bending and twisting forces. The body employs higher tensile strength steel panels to reduce body weight and increase body rigidity. Robust <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> members are connected with a dash panel crossmember and strong, front steel crossmember to help create a rigid boxed section <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> area. Reinforced side sill members also help disperse energy {{in the event of}} a collision. High-strength steel cross members across the floor absorb side impact energy.|$|R
50|$|The revolutionary {{monocoque}} transverse engined {{front wheel}} drive 1959 Austin Mini, that set the template for modern {{front wheel drive}} cars, used <b>front</b> and rear <b>subframes</b> to provide accurate road wheel control while using a stiff lightweight body. The 1961 Jaguar E-type or XKE used a tubular spaceframe type <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> to mount the engine gearbox and long bonnet / hood, to a monocoque 'tub' passenger compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The MG 6 is a {{mid-size}} {{car that}} has been produced by MG Motor from 2010 onwards. It {{is derived from the}} Roewe 550, hence being distantly related to the Rover 75, sharing its <b>front</b> <b>subframe.</b> It was initially announced in April 2009 at the Shanghai Auto Show, as a five door hatchback/fastback and in October 2010 at Shanghai Expo as a four door notchback saloon model.|$|R
50|$|Featuring {{a design}} unusual among modern submachine guns, the MPi 69 is cocked by a dual-purpose lever also {{used as the}} <b>front</b> sling <b>attachment</b> point. The forward {{handgrip}} and vertical pistol handgrip are all one large plastic molding, forming the front and center bottom part of the weapon. The receiver proper is a square metal tube which partly nestles inside the plastic handgrip.|$|R
2500|$|The XJ6, using 2.8-litre (...) and 4.2-litre (...) straight-six {{cylinder}} {{versions of}} Jaguar's renowned XK engine, replaced most of Jaguar's saloons – which, in the 1960s, had expanded to four separate ranges. Apart from the engines, other main assemblies carried over from previous models were the widest version of Jaguar's IRS unit from the Mark X and the <b>subframe</b> mounted independent <b>front</b> suspension first {{seen in the}} 1955 2.4-litre with new anti-dive geometry.|$|R
50|$|Created from an all {{fibreglass}} {{monocoque body}} reinforced with kevlar and carbon fibre at the mountings for extra strength. It used a classic mini <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> and A-Series engine at the front, whilst {{at the rear}} a galvanised beam axle was used with classic mini radius arms and coilover suspension. The car had four seats and a boot area which could be accessed by tilting the rear seats.|$|R

25|$|One notable {{change was}} the <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> {{assembly}} — {{as compared with}} Ford, Chrysler and AMC, in whose cars the entire front suspension was integrated with the bodyshell, a separate subframe housing the powertrain and front suspension (similar to the front part of the frame of GM's full-size, full-framed vehicles) replaced the earlier style. Although the <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> design was unique for the Nova, the Camaro introduced a year earlier {{was the first to}} incorporate such a design; the redesigned Nova was pushed a year ahead to 1968 instead of 1969. The sales brochure claimed 15 powertrain choices for coupes and a dozen for sedans. Options included power brakes and steering, Four-Season or Comfort-Car air conditioning, rear shoulder belts, and head restraints. There were a few Chevrolet Novas built with the 194 ci (3.1 L), the same motor that had been used in the previous generations of the Chevy II. Sales of the 1968 Chevy Nova fell by half. In 1969 Chevrolet dropped the Chevy II portion of its compact car's name; it was now known simply as the Chevrolet Nova.|$|R
50|$|The Accord's body now {{utilizes}} 55.8% {{high strength}} steel, {{a total of}} 17.2% are either of 780, 980 or 1,500 MPa yield strength types which were not used in the previous generation. The Accord's previous steel <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> has been replaced with an aluminum and steel component that weighs 14 lb less and is manufactured using friction stir welding (hybrid models use an all-aluminum subframe and hood). Overall the body weight sheds 55 lb.|$|R
50|$|The medial surface articulates {{with the}} hamate bone by a smooth, concave, oblong facet, which {{occupies}} its posterior and superior parts; it is rough in <b>front,</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of an interosseous ligament.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{excavator}} is {{used for}} not only civil engineering but also building demolition, scrap recycling and so on. The reason is thought {{that it has a}} general-purpose power supply system and is able to move by itself. In other words, it could be considered a kind of high-powered robot. As a whole, it consists of several modules. Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a fork grapple and a loader bucket are equipped as a working module. And to carry the objectives quickly to destination, wheeled traveling system is equipped. As a result, we have produced a multi-functional handling machine which has double <b>front</b> <b>attachments</b> and wheels. Then if operators cooperate the modules effectively, {{they will be able to}} handle their work more efficiently...|$|R
50|$|The {{approximate}} alloying {{composition of}} 531 tubing is 1.5% Mn, 0.25% Mo, 0.35% C, and {{is similar to}} the old British BS970 En 16/18 steel (EN 16 is similar to grade BS970 605M36). Its mechanical properties and response to heat treatment are broadly similar to the AISI 4130 standard alloy steel, also used for bicycle frames, motorcycles, as well as aviation and motor-sport. This material was used to form the <b>front</b> <b>subframes</b> on the Jaguar E-Type of the 1960s.|$|R
