Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands.

If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible.

2500|$|The {{primitive}} {{attempt in}} dealing with differential equations had in view a reduction to quadratures. As {{it had been the}} hope of eighteenth-century algebraists to find a method for solving the general equation of the nth degree, so it was the hope of analysts to find a general method for integrating any differential equation. Gauss (1799) showed, however, that the differential equation meets its limitations very soon unless complex numbers are introduced. Hence, analysts began to substitute the study of functions, thus opening a new and fertile field. Cauchy was the first to appreciate the importance of this view. [...] Thereafter, the real question was to be not whether a solution is possible by means of known functions or their integrals but whether a given differential equation suffices for the definition of a function of the independent variable or variables, and, if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> characteristic properties of this function.|$|E

The opening shot {{would have been the}} entire original series cast crammed into an elevator aboard the Enterprise-B, happy to be back together. The Enterprise-D's end also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale [...] "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale. Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that [...] "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." [...] After the idea of killing off a Next Generation cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that [...] "we all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it.' [...] " [...] The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.|$|E

[...] Finally, how to orient X-, Y- and Z-axis directions? [...] The axis of Earth's spin provides a natural direction strongly associated with [...] "up vs. down", so positive Z can adopt the direction from geocenter to North Pole.
