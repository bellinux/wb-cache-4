5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorder.</b> In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment.

40|$|To date, little {{attention}} has been paid to changes in neuropsychological function in <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> (SAD). In this study, we investigated the performance of 30 patients with SAD on a wide range of cognitive variables before and after 2 weeks of light treatment with either white or placebo red light, as well as later in the summertime. Performance of subjects with SAD on neuropsychological tests was compared with a group of 29 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects. The most consistent deficits associated with SAD were on tests of cognitive failures, visual memory, and visual-construction skills. In contrast to specific bright light effects on psychiatric measures, reports of cognitive failures did not change with either light treatment. Visual memory and constructional deficits responded nonspecifically to treatment with either white or the presumed placebo red light. Surprisingly, visual memory deficits were seen again in the summer, at a time when mood, cognitive failures, and other cognitive functions appeared at normal levels. These data suggest that cognitive functioning is affected by SAD. In addition, light treatment may have differential effects on mood and cognition...|$|R
40|$|The core {{symptom of}} the burnout {{syndrome}} is emotional exhaustion, which leads to impaired functioning on the job. Studies of sufferers of <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> and of healthy people show that energy levels can be improved by exposing them to bright light. It is hypothesized that energy levels of patients with burnout complaints can similarly be improved by exposure to bright light. In a small study, the effects of light treatment in burnout sufferers were researched. A comparison was made between a treatment condition (n = 16) and a waiting list condition (n = 14). The effects were assessed by means of several self-rating instruments. Patients' energy levels were seen to improve significantly according to the scores on {{two out of three}} instruments. If light treatment is administered prior to any other treatment, it is postulated that the results of the second treatment will take effect more quickly. Conclusions can only be preliminary due to the small sample size, but they are encouraging nevertheless. Replication in a study with a larger sample size is desirable.

40|$|The present review {{discusses}} {{two types}} of biological rhythms, namely, circadian rhythms and circannual rhythms. Humans possess a circadian rhythm of approximately 24 hours, which is regulated by neural and hormonal processes. The synchronisation of this rhythm with the solar day and night is maintained through entrainment mainly by light. Dark environments completely lacking windows may {{have a negative effect}} on well-being and work capacity. During shift work the biological clock tends to maintain its normal 'diurnal' rhythm, which may lead to extreme tiredness and increased risk of accidents. Negative effects such as these may be partially alleviated by means of bright light during the night. During air travel across several time zones there is little time for the biological clock to adjust, but the resulting 'jet lag' may possibly be overcome by means of appropriately timed exposure to bright light. In countries situated far from the equator, the biological clock may become seriously disrupted during the short days of the dark season. Characterised by fatigue, sadness and sleep problems, these <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> may be cured or alleviated by means of regular periods outdoors, better lighting indoors, or, in the most serious cases, light therapy...|$|R

40|$|Hippocrates was {{the first}} to suggest the healing power of food; however, {{it was not until the}} medieval ages that food was {{considered}} a tool to modify temperament and mood, although scientific methods as we know them today were not in use at the time. Modern scientific methods in neuroscience began to emerge much later, leading investigators to examine the role of diet in health, including mental well-being, with greater precision. This review shows how short- and long-term forced dietary interventions bring about changes in brain structure, chemistry, and physiology, leading to altered animal behavior. Examples will be presented to show how diets alter brain chemistry, behavior, and the action of neuroactive drugs. Most humans and most animal species examined in a controlled setting exhibit a fairly reproducible pattern of what and how they eat. Recent data suggest that these patterns may be under the neurochemical and hormonal control of the organisms themselves.

An important question, however, is that of directly linking the signals coming from Twitter with other sources of evidence about average mood changes.

Results show that all of these signals are highly correlated and strongly seasonal, being under-expressed in the summer and over-expressed in the other seasons, with interesting differences and similarities across them. Anxiety signals, extracted from both Twitter and from Health product purchases, peak in spring and autumn, and correlate also with the purchase of stress remedies, while Twitter sadness has a peak in the Winter, along with Twitter anger and remedies for fatigue. Surprisingly, purchase of remedies for fatigue do not match the Twitter fatigue, suggesting that perhaps the names we give to these indicators are only approximate indications of what they actually measure.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com “Illumination and mood ” (Kripke 2011) {{has been the}} common theme of three recent contributions to the journal. In August 2010, Dr. Hoaki and colleagues reported that, among 56 healthy volunteers, higher illuminances {{during the day and}} greater variability in sleep times predicted hyperthermic temperament scores (Hoaki et al. 2011). With regard to “light”, Dr. Kripke asked whether the converse applied to the sample as well, namely that low illumination and depression were linked (Kripke 2011). In October 2010, Terao and Hoaki concluded from additional analyses “that light can ameliorate low mood in healthy people ” and closed with the suggestion that “further studies are required to prospectively investigate whether light can prevent the occurrence of depression in healthy people ” (Terao and Hoaki 2011). Such–and more related–studies with regard to the critical role of light for “hyperthermic temperament”, “hypomania or mania ” and “depression ” to which Dr. Kripke points, may benefit from recent results by Ciarleglio et al.

The {{incidence}} of psychiatric disorders and depressive symptoms was examined in {{a cohort of}} American {{men and women who}} spent an austral winter at two different research stations in Antarctica to determine whether extended residence of nonindigenous inhabitants in a polar region is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Study Design. Debriefings interviews with 220 men and 93 women we-re conducted by 3 psychiatrists and 1 clinical psychologist at McMurdo Station and South Pole Station {{at the end of the}} austral winter between 1994 and 1997. Crewmembers were assigned a DSM-IV diagnosis if they satisfied diagnostic criteria.

Thirty-nine (12. 5 %) crewmembers presented with symptoms that met the criteria for one or more DSM-IV disorders. After weighting the prevalence to account for the low participation rate of ci-vilian personnel, the {{incidence of}} DSM-IV disorders was 5. 2 %. Mood disorders were the most common diagnoses, accounting for 30. 2 % of all diagnoses, followed by adjustment disorders (27. 9 %), sleep-related disorders (20. 9 %), personality disorders (11. 6 %), and substance-related disorders (9. 3 %). Depressive symptoms as measured by the SAD-SIGH were significantly associated with female gender, military occu-pation, station, year of expedition, and DSM-IV diagnosis. Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract: Explaining {{movements}} in daily stock prices {{is one of}} the most difficult tasks in modern finance. This paper contributes to the existing literature by documenting the impact of geomagnetic storms on daily stock market returns. A large body of psychological research has shown that geomagnetic storms have a profound effect on people's moods, and, in turn, people's moods have been found to be related to human behavior, judgments and decisions about risk. An important finding of this literature is that people often attribute their feelings and emotions to the wrong source, leading to incorrect judgments. Specifically, people affected by geomagnetic storms may be more inclined to sell stocks on stormy days because they incorrectly attribute their bad mood to negative economic prospects rather than bad environmental conditions. Misattribution of mood and pessimistic choices can translate into a relatively higher demand for riskless assets, causing the price of risky assets to fall or to rise less quickly than otherwise. The authors find strong empirical support in favor of a geomagnetic-storm effect in stock returns after controlling for market seasonals and other environmental and behavioral factors. Unusually high levels of geomagnetic activity have a negative, statistically and economically significant effect on the following week's stock returns for all U. S. stock market indices. Finally, this paper provides evidence of substantially higher returns around the world during periods of quiet geomagnetic activity.

40|$|Objective: To test common genetic {{variants}} for {{association with}} seasonality (seasonal changes in mood and behavior) and {{to investigate whether}} there are shared genetic risk factors between psychiatric disorders and seasonality. Method: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were conducted in Australian (between 1988 and 1990 and between 2010 and 2013) and Amish (between May 2010 and December 2011) samples in whom the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) had been administered, {{and the results were}} meta-analyzed in a total sample of 4, 156 individuals. Genetic risk scores based on results from prior large GWAS studies of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia were calculated to test for overlap in risk between psychiatric disorders and seasonality. Results: The most significant association was with rs 11825064 (P = 1. 7 × 10 - 6, β = 0. 64, standard error = 0. 13), an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found on chromosome 11. The evidence for overlap in risk factors was strongest for schizophrenia and seasonality, with the schizophrenia genetic profile scores explaining 3 % of the variance in logtransformed global seasonality scores. Bipolar disorder genetic profile scores were also associated with seasonality, although at much weaker levels (minimum P value = 3. 4 × 10 - 3), and no evidence for overlap in risk was detected between MDD and seasonality. Conclusions: Common SNPs of large effect most likely do not exist for seasonality in the populations examined. As expected, there were overlapping genetic risk factors for bipolar disorder (but not MDD) with seasonality. Unexpectedly, the risk for schizophrenia and seasonality had the largest overlap, an unprecedented finding that requires replication in other populations and has potential clinical implications considering overlapping cognitive deficits in <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> and schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{treatment}} procedures {{are based on}} evidence-based guidelines. According to all of them, a correct diagnosis of depression is required before starting therapy. Within recent years {{many different types of}} antidepressants have been introduced to the pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium. The "newer" antidepressants were developed with a view to reduced side effects. However, the classes of antidepressants currently available differ little in their antidepressant efficacy, thus, all producing treatment responses of 50 - 75 %. Therefore, the selection of a particular antidepressant for the individual patient depends on various factors: patient's prior experience with medication, concurrent medical conditions that may be worsened by selected antidepressants, concomitant use of non-psychiatric medications that may lead to negative drug-drug interactions, a drug's short and long-term side effects, physician's experience with the medication and patient's history of adherence to medication. Importantly, if the patient does not show any improvement after two to four weeks of treatment with an antidepressant dose at the upper level of the standard dose, it becomes less likely that he will respond to this particular medication later. When a partial or non-response is present, several therapeutic options are available: (1) combining two antidepressants from different classes, (2) switch to new antidepressant from a different or the same pharmacological class and (3) augmentation strategies. For patients who are reluctant to take traditional antidepressants, herbal remedies such as hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) provide an alternative for treatment of mild to moderate depression. Besides pharmacological treatment options non pharmacological biological interventions are available. Electroconvulsive therapy and partial sleep deprivation are very effective in the treatment of acute depression. Especially for <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> light therapy is a well established treatment alternative.

40|$|Melatonin is {{a highly}} {{pleiotropic}} signaling molecule, which is released as a hormone of the pineal gland predominantly during night. Melatonin secretion decreases during aging. Reduced melatonin levels are also observed in various diseases, such as types of dementia, some mood disorders, severe pain, cancer, and diabetes type 2. Melatonin dysfunction is frequently related to deviations in amplitudes, phasing, and coupling of circadian rhythms. Gene polymorphisms of melatonin receptors and circadian oscillator proteins bear risks for several of the diseases mentioned. A common symptom of insufficient melatonin signaling is sleep disturbances. It is necessary to distinguish between symptoms that are curable by short melatonergic actions and others that require extended actions during night. Melatonin immediate release is already effective, at moderate doses, for reducing difficulties of falling asleep or improving symptoms associated with poorly coupled circadian rhythms, including <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> and bipolar <b>disorders.</b> For purposes of a replacement therapy based on longer-lasting melatonergic actions, melatonin prolonged release and synthetic agonists have been developed.
