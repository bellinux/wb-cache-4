40|$|Seventy-seven {{persons with}} a variety of {{heritable}} chondrodysplasias were screened for gross rearrangements of the structural gene encoding the major cartilage collagen, collagen II. None was found. Segregation of the locus (COL 2 A 1) was studied in 19 pedigrees using three restriction site dimorphisms (shown by PvuII, HindIII, and BamHI) and a length polymorphism as linkage markers. Discordant segregation between COL 2 A 1 and the mutant locus was seen in pedigrees with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> <b>tarda,</b> hypochondroplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, diaphyseal aclasis, and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome. One pedigree with diastrophic dysplasia was weakly concordant. Autosomal dominant <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> <b>tarda</b> and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (type Schmid) were not informative. We conclude that mutations of the collagen II gene are not a common feature of the heritable chondrodysplasias. Since the chondrocyte binding protein, chondrocalcin, is also encoded at COL 2 A 1 our conclusions apply equally to this gene...|$|E

40|$|Background: Thoracolumbar {{kyphosis}} {{has been}} considered as the first presenting deformity and is often a key diagnostic clue noted in children with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IV (Morquio′s syndrome). However, we observed that the progressive irregularities of the epiphyses of the long bones were the most prominent skeletal pathology, causing effectively the development of diverse forms of lower limbs deformities with extreme variation in age of onset. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (seven children and three adults) {{with an average age}} of 15 years have been enrolled in this study. Age of diagnosis of MPS IVA has a variable age of onset and a MISLEADING rate of severity. Hip dislocations, genu valgum, protrusio acetabuli and osteoarthritis were the most common lower limbs deformities in these patients. Clinical and radiographic phenotypes were the baseline tools of documentation. Urinary screening and genotypic characterizations have been applied accordingly. Results: Combined pelvic and femoral procedures for hip dislocation, epiphysiodeses and supracondylar osteotomy for genu valgum and hip arthroplasty for protrusio acetabuli have been performed. All patients manifested insufficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulphate sulphatase, an enzyme that degrades keratin sulphate and chondroitin- 6 sulphate. Conclusion: The extensive clinical heterogeneity contributed significantly in the delay in establishing the diagnosis particularly in adult patients with MPS IV. The epiphyseal irregularities of the long bones and the progressive flattening pathology of MPS IV A were the reason to falsely diagnose some patients as <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> congenital and/or <b>tarda.</b> Proximal femoral osteotomy, realignment osteotomy and total hip arthroplasty have been performed for coxa vara, genu valgum and protrusio acetabuli, respectively, in children and adult group of patients. The importance of early diagnosis on MPS IV A is to receive enzyme replacement therapy and plan for other therapeutic measures...|$|R

40|$|Spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} (SED) comprises {{a heterogeneous}} group of skeletal dysplasias that primarily affect the epiphyses and vertebral bodies. Patients affected by SED usually exhibit short stature and experience early development of degenerative osteoarthritis. SED is subdivided into congenita and tarda forms {{according to the}} age at onset and clinical severity, and further subdivided into genetically different forms according to the mode of inheritance and the gene involved. We report a 14 -yr-old Korean male who presented with a disproportionately short stature and a short trunk. A pedigree analysis of 3 generations with 6 affected persons revealed an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Mutation analysis of the TRAPPC 2 (previously called SEDL) gene, the only gene associated with X-linked <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> <b>tarda</b> (X-linked SEDT; MIM 313400), was performed, and a splice-donor site mutation in intron 3 of the TRAPPC 2 gene (c. 93 + 5 G>A) was identified in the proband and in his unaffected mother (a heterozygote). This mutation {{is one of the}} 2 most frequent mutations reported in the medical literature, and is known to result in exon 3 skipping.
