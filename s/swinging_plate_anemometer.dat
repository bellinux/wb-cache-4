40|$|Traditionally, {{stiffness}} of <b>swing</b> <b>plates</b> {{has not been}} varied with changes in rock strength. Rock strength has only been of interest {{because of the need}} to know the maximum force exerted by the toggle for energy considerations. Thus a <b>swing</b> <b>plate,</b> stiff enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (q_u) of up to 308 MPa, may be overdesigned (and, most importantly, overweight) for crushing a softer fragmental limestone, amphibolites. Design of lighter weight jaw crushers will require a more precise accounting of the stresses and deflections in the crushing plates than is available with traditional techniques. Efforts to decrease energy consumed in crushing have lead to consideration of decreasing the weight of the <b>swing</b> <b>plate</b> of jaw crushers for easily crushed material. In the present work the design of the <b>swing</b> jaw <b>plate</b> using point-load deformation failure (PDF) relationships along with interactive failure of rock particles as a model for such a weight reduction. The design of the corrugated <b>swing</b> jaw <b>plate</b> is carried out by using CAD i. e. jaw crusher plate has been solid modeled by using CatiaV 5 R 15.

50|$|These are {{the first}} modern anemometers. They consist of a flat plate {{suspended}} from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered {{the inventor of the}} first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. <b>Plate</b> <b>anemometers</b> have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.|$|R
40|$|The {{air chamber}} {{system is a}} kind of method for {{transformation}} from wave energy to mechanical energy. In this system, wave energy operates periodically in the wave power generation plant. In order to improve this system, we propose a new technology with one-way flow and restriction of turbine input. The former is applicable to an impulse turbine, and the latter saves the excess power from the air chamber. In this system, the air duct has a bypath with a turbine. Pressure and flow direction are controlled with only one <b>swing</b> <b>plate</b> valve in the air duct.

50|$|The Stop is for {{use with}} single ropes between 9 and 12 mm in {{diameter}} and is usually attached to the harness via a carabiner. The rope is then threaded through the cam and bobbin by undoing the safety clip and moving the <b>swinging</b> side <b>plate</b> to the side. The <b>swinging</b> side <b>plate</b> facilitates insertion and removal of the rope without the need to disconnect it from the harness, making it {{less likely to be}} dropped on long abseils. As the Stop is a self-braking descender, an unintentional release of the deadman's handle should stop the descent, due to the asymmetric lower cam crimping the rope. This functionality safeguards the user in the event of being knocked unconscious due to a rockfall or illness, though the fine control of rate of descent should be carried out by standard method of manually controlling friction with the hand on the rope below the descender.|$|R

40|$|An {{effect of}} flow on cell {{culture has been}} studied in vitro. A {{silicone}} disk {{was placed in the}} center of culture dish of 52 mm internal diameter to make a doughnut-shaped canal. The dish was placed on a tilted plate, which rotates to make a vortex flow around the silicone disk with a swing motion. Variations were made on the diameter (20 mm, 30 mm, and 40 mm) of the silicone disk and the rotational speed (2. 1 rad/sec, 5. 2 rad/sec) of the <b>swinging</b> <b>plate,</b> which tilts with 0. 1 rad from the horizontal plane. Five kinds of cells were cultured in the vortex flow of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium for seven days: C 2 C 12 (mouse myoblast), L 6 (rat skeletal muscle cell), A 7 r 5 (rat aortic smooth muscle cell), CS- 2 P 2 -C 75 (primary normal porcine aortic endothelial cell), and L 929 (mouse fibroblast). The experiments show the following results. The orientation of cells depends on flow and on kinds of cells. A 7 r 5 and CS- 2 P 2 -C 75 line along the streamline of the flow.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation is to characterize the air distribution of a combined downward jet and to obtain {{a model of the}} velocity distribution. The objective is achieved through analyzing the initial outlet conditions of the diffusers, the velocity decay from the two flows, measuring the deflection of flow and finally modelling the dimensionless velocity profile of the flow using the excess velocity method on the co-flow. The combined downward jet is a possible improvement of the protected occupied zone ventilation, which aim to lower the exposure of contaminants to the occupant. Urbanization and stricter regulation on energy use of ventilation systems increase the risk of indoor exposure to pollutants and airborne pathogens. Ventilation systems that address the problem are needed. A combined downward jet is formed by introducing a plane jet from a slot diffuser and a co-flow from a perforated <b>plate</b> diffuser. <b>Anemometers</b> and a smoke machine is used to measure and analyze the flow. The combined downward jet deflects away from the co-flow and the deflection angle increase with higher co-flow velocity, while the velocity decay decrease. The expansion rate of the velocity profile, measured at y 1 / 2, increase up to 2. 5 times that of a plane jet without co-flow. There is likely the plane jet steal momentum from the co-flow, and the rate increase with the co-flow velocity. The excess velocity method show promise in creating a model for the combined downward jet, however with unanswered potential limitations. Future work need to analyze the interaction the plane jet has on the co-flow, and the co-flow needs accurate models for its velocity decay...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} made of transition to turbulence in the free convective flows on a heated plate. Observations have been made with the plate vertical and inclined at angles up to about 50 ° to the vertical, both above and below the <b>plate.</b> A fibre <b>anemometer</b> was used to survey the region of intermittent turbulence. Information has thus been obtained about the range of Grashof numbers over which transition takes place. Even when the plate is vertical the region of intermittent turbulence is long. When it is inclined, this region becomes still longer in the flow below the plate {{as a result of the}} stabilizing stratification, a Richardson number effect. It is possible to have a whole flow such that it should be described as transitional, not laminar or turbulent. It was noticed that in this flow and the vertical plate one, the velocity during the laminar periods could be either of two characteristic values, one of them close to zero. The behaviour above an inclined plate could be interpreted largely as a trend towards the behaviour described in a preceding paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{importance}} of aviation industry in modern era is long familiar. The industrial sector has been suffering energy crises from decades and consequently paves {{way for the}} need of energy regeneration and utility. Runways are heart of an airport and currently runways are used as pathways for airplane takeoff and landing. The proposed idea emphasizes use of residual mechanical vibrational energy from aircraft during takeoff and landing. Air Wakes are huge source of vibrational energy and these vibrations are harnessed using energy regenerative engineering technology. The lifting aircraft produces turbulent air wakes, which strike light weight <b>swinging</b> elliptical dish <b>plates</b> along sides of the runway. These are made to vibrate continuously and impact the piezoelectric media which consequently produces electric potential. Varieties of efficient piezoelectric harnessers are being developed using different vibration analysis and many have embarked upon the idea. But this paper is unparallel to those in many ways...|$|R

40|$|Subsuns, Bottlinger's rings, and {{elliptical}} halos are simulated {{by the use}} of a Monte Carlo model; {{reflection of}} sunlight from almost horizontal ice crystals is assumed. Subsuns are circular or elliptical spots seen at the specular reflection point when one flies over cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Bottlinger's rings are rare, almost elliptical rings centered about the subsun. Elliptical halos are small rings of light centered around the Sun or the Moon that rarely occur with other halo phenomena. Subsuns and Bottlinger's rings can be explained by reflection from a single crystal, whereas elliptical halos require reflection from two separate crystals. All three phenomena are colorless and vertically elongated with an eccentricity that increases with increasing solar zenith angle. For several cases of Bottlinger's rings the simulations are compared with density scans of photographs. Clouds that consist of large <b>swinging</b> or gyrating <b>plates</b> and dendritic crystals, which form near- 15 'C, seem the most likely candidates to produce the rings and elliptical halos. Meteorological evidence is presented that supports these conditions for elliptical halos. Simulations suggest that the most distinct elliptical halos may be produced by hybrid clouds that contain both horizontal and gyrating crystals...|$|R
2500|$|Airy's coal pit experiments: Starting in 1826, using methods {{similar to}} Bouguer, British {{astronomer}} George Airy attempted {{to determine the}} density of the Earth by pendulum gravity measurements at {{the top and bottom of}} a coal mine. [...] The gravitational force below the surface of the Earth decreases rather than increasing with depth, because by Gauss's law the mass of the spherical shell of crust above the subsurface point does not contribute to the gravity. The 1826 experiment was aborted by the flooding of the mine, but in 1854 he conducted an improved experiment at the Harton coal mine, using seconds pendulums <b>swinging</b> on agate <b>plates,</b> timed by precision chronometers synchronized by an electrical circuit. He found the lower pendulum was slower by 2.24 seconds per day. This meant that the gravitational acceleration at the bottom of the mine, 1250ft below the surface, was 1/14,000 less than it should have been from the inverse square law; that is the attraction of the spherical shell was 1/14,000 of the attraction of the Earth. From samples of surface rock he estimated the mass of the spherical shell of crust, and from this estimated that {{the density of the}} Earth was 6.565 times that of water.

Fleet as a deer, he was across the bag before the infielder reached the ball. Hollis was next up. On the first pitch, as Dreer got a fast start for second, Hollis bunted down the first-base line. Pitcher and baseman ran for the bunt; Hollis was safe, and the sprinting Dreer went to third without even drawing a throw. A long pealing yell rolled over the bleachers. Dale sent coaches to the {{coaching}} lines. Hickle, big and formidable, hurried to the <b>plate,</b> <b>swinging</b> a long bat. He swung it as if he intended to knock the ball out of the field. When the pitcher lifted his arm Dreer dashed for home-base, and seemed beating the ball. But Hickle deftly dumped it down the line and broke for first while Dreer scored. This bunt was not fielded at all. How the bleachers roared! Then followed bunts in rapid succession, dashes for first, and slides into the bag. The pitcher interfered with the third-baseman, and the first-baseman ran up the line, and the pitcher failed to cover the bag, and the catcher fell all over the ball. Every varsity man bunted, but in just the place where it was not expected. They raced around the bases. They made long runs from first to third. They were like flashes of light, slippery as eels. The bewildered infielders knew they were being played with. The taunting [...] "boo-hoos" [...] and screams of delight from the bleachers were as demoralizing as the illusively daring runners. Closer and closer the infielders edged in until they were right on top of the batters. Then Dale and his men began to bunt little infield flies over the heads of their opponents. The merry audience cheered wildly. But Graves and Raymond ran back and caught three of these little pop flies, thus retiring the side. The old varsity had made six runs on nothing but deliberate bunts and daring dashes around the bases.|$|R
