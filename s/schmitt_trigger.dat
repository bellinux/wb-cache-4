25|$|A {{comparator}} {{can be used}} {{to build}} a relaxation oscillator. It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> configuration. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.|$|E
2500|$|Another typical {{configuration}} of op-amps is with positive feedback, which takes {{a fraction of}} the output signal back to the non-inverting input. An important application of it is the comparator with hysteresis, the <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger.</b> [...] Some circuits may use positive feedback and negative feedback around the same amplifier, for example triangle-wave oscillators and active filters.|$|E
40|$|At the outset, {{a couple}} of new CMOS <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> are {{introduced}} using Current Sink and Pseudo Logic structures and their characteristics are evaluated both analytically and numerically. The hysteresis curves of the proposed <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> are also presented. The <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> enlisted are most sought after for low-voltage and high-speed applications. The performances of the proposed new <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> are examined using PSPICE and the model parameters of a 0. 18 µm CMOS process. Current Sink and Pseudo Logic structures are suitable for VLSI implementation. Simulation results are presented...|$|R

50|$|<b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> {{are common}} in many {{switching}} circuits for similar reasons (e.g., for switch debouncing).|$|R
2500|$|If the {{comparator}} {{does not}} have internal hysteresis or if the input noise {{is greater than the}} internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input of the comparator. The resulting <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> circuit gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E
50|$|By {{using an}} RC network to add slow {{negative}} {{feedback to the}} inverting <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger,</b> a relaxation oscillator is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> output to oscillate in an endless symmetric square wave (i.e., the <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> in this configuration is an astable multivibrator).|$|E

50|$|<b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> are {{typically}} used in open loop configurations for noise immunity and closed loop configurations to implement function generators.|$|R
50|$|The {{symbol for}} <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> in circuit {{diagrams}} is a triangle with a symbol inside representing its ideal hysteresis curve.|$|R
50|$|Hysteresis can {{be found}} in physics, chemistry, engineering, biology and economics, and so on. It is {{incorporated}} in many artificial systems: for example, in thermostats and <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers,</b> it prevents unwanted frequent switching.|$|R
50|$|The emitter-coupled <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> has not {{low enough}} level at output logical zero and needs an {{additional}} output shifting circuit. The collector-coupled <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> has extremely low (almost zero) output level at output logical zero.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> is a {{bistable}} multivibrator, {{and it can}} be used {{to implement}} another type of multivibrator, the relaxation oscillator. This is achieved by connecting a single RC integrating circuit between the output and the input of an inverting <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger.</b> The output will be a continuous square wave whose frequency depends on the values of R and C, and the threshold points of the <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger.</b> Since multiple <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> circuits can be provided by a single integrated circuit (e.g. the 4000 series CMOS device type 40106 contains 6 of them), a spare section of the IC can be quickly pressed into service as a simple and reliable oscillator with only two external components.|$|E

50|$|<b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> are {{commonly}} implemented using an operational amplifier or a dedicated comparator. An open-loop op-amp and comparator {{may be considered}} as an analog-digital device having analog inputs and a digital output that extracts {{the sign of the}} voltage difference between its two inputs. The positive feedback is applied by adding a part of the output voltage to the input voltage in series or parallel manner. Due to the extremely high op-amp gain, the loop gain is also high enough and provides the avalanche-like process.|$|R
50|$|The CDTA is {{not free}} from {{parasitic}} input capacitances and it can operate in a wide frequency range due to current mode operation. Some voltage and current mode applications using this element have already been reported in literature, particularly from the area of frequency filtering: general higher-order filters, biquad circuits, all-pass sections, gyrators, simulation of grounded and floating inductances and LCR ladder structures. Other studies propose CDTA-based high-frequency oscillators. Nonlinear CDTA applications are also expected, particularly precise rectifiers, current-mode <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> for measuring purposes and signal generation, current-mode multipliers, etc.|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} {{we will show}} that <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers,</b> one {{consisting}} of an operational amplifier and one consisting of two transisitors, undergo {{the same type of}} bifurcation when inputs are considered as distinguished parameters and outputs as state variables. These are very simple and illustrative examples of the singularity theory applied for bifurcations developed by Golubitsky and Schaeffer ([1]). It is interesting that two apparently different circuits have the same mathematical principle corresponding to the function of the circuits. Furthermore, we can identify the unfolding parameters so that the possible local behaviors of the perturbed circuits are determined...|$|R

For every request {{received from}} a client, a merge element may send {{a request to}} its parent, and for each acknowledgement received from its parent, the merge element may send an acknowledgement to a client. We show that that a merge-element can provide bounded time response if its parent also has bounded time response. We present two new implementations of a merge: one that uses an arbiter, and one that uses <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> but no arbiters. Based on these designs, we explore a class of concurrent computations that can be performed in guaranteed bounded time, and we raise some new questions about what is possible in asynchronous design...|$|R
40|$|Abstruct- A Hopfield-type {{neural network}} {{approach}} {{which leads to}} an analog circuit for implementing the A/D conversion is presented. The solution of the original symmetric connection Hopfield A/D converter sometimes may reach a “spurious state” that does not correspond to the correct digital representation of the input signal. An A/D converter based {{on the model of}} nonsymmetrical neural networks is proposed to obtain the stable and correct encoding. Due to the infeasible conventional RC-active implementation, a cost-effective switched-capacitor imple-mentation by means of <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers</b> is adopted. It is capable of achieving high performance as well as a high convergence rate. Finally, a simulation using a tool called SWITCAP is conducted to verify the validity and performance of the proposed implementation. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} time-delay microwave frequency doubler is proposed. A voltage controlled delay line (VCDL) {{in the proposed}} frequency doubler compensates the time-delay mismatching between input and delayed signal. With the delay matching and waveform shaping using adjustable <b>Schmitt</b> <b>triggers,</b> the unwanted fundamental component (f 0) and the higher order harmonics such as third and fourth are diminished excellently. In result, only the doubled frequency component (2 f 0) appears dominantly at the output port. The frequency doubler is designed at 1. 15 GHz of f 0 and fabricated with TSMC 0. 18 mum CMOS process. The measured output power of 2 f 0 is 2. 67 dBm when the input power is 0 dBm. The obtained suppression of f 0, 3 f 0, and 4 f 0 to 2 f 0 are 43. 65, 38. 65 and 35. 59 dB, respectively...|$|R

Other symbols show a hysteresis curve (which may be inverting or non-inverting) {{embedded in a}} buffer followed by a bubble, {{which is similar to}} the traditional symbol for a digital inverter that shows a buffer followed by a bubble. In general, the direction of the <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> (inverting or non-inverting) is not necessarily clear from the symbol because multiple conventions are used, even with the same manufacturer. There are several factors leading to such ambiguity, These circumstances may warrant a closer investigation of the documentation for each particular <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger.</b>|$|E

Data from individual {{tests on the}} components of this system, including the servo valve and the actuator, is used for analogue computer simulations. The simulations are shown to model the experimental system {{over a wide range}} of conditions. A simple linear equation is shown to model many aspects of the behaviour of the system. This equation is presented in a form which enables the importance of many system parameters to be easily assessed. An all pneumatic linear-motion servo using discrete fluidic components is described.

Today, {{to further the}} frontiers of integrated circuit scaling, the semiconductor industry boldly considers structural renovation in classical material stacks, processes and planar single-gate MOSFET architecture. In this work, options for emerging Multiple-Gate MOSFETs are studied for circuit design. In {{the first part of}} the work, independent gate technology option is proposed to design noise-tolerant <b>Schmitt</b> <b>Triggers</b> with reduced transistor count, to achieve high-performance/lowpower datapaths, and to improve sizing granularity for high-performance/low-power circuit synthesis. In the second part, zero body effect and high RS/D disadvantages of connected-gate topology in FinFET architecture is addressed. Independent gate technology is demonstrated in conventional Static Random Access Memories (SRAM) to build low leakage large cache arrays, and in varactor design to improve quality factor and tuning range. Though, independent gate technology increases the cost of fabrication by adding extra process step(s) /mask(s), it is expected to be a key enabler to further miniaturization. ...|$|R
