40|$|PURPOSE. Lens {{epithelial}} cells transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts during {{the formation of}} anterior subcapsular <b>cataracts</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>cataracts.</b> One of the defining characteristics of myofibroblasts is the expression of �-smooth muscle actin (�-SMA). This study investigated some {{of the factors that}} influence �-SMA expression in lens {{epithelial cells}}. METHODS. Bovine, rabbit, and human lens epithelial explants or cells were cultured with or without serum. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to detect and quantitate �-SMA expression. RESULTS. Cells from all species studied expressed �-SMA in primary explant culture with or without serum. Immunostaining for �-SMA first appeared in a diffuse granular pattern, then accumulated at the cell cortex, and eventually was detected along stress fibers. When lens epithelial cells migrated onto cell-free regions of the capsule or were transferred to a plastic culture dish, �-SMA expression increased significantly. Expression of �-SMA positively correlated with cell size and cell migration. CONCLUSIONS. Expression of �-SMA is a common feature of cultured mammalian lens epithelial cells. Because �-SMA expression occurred without the addition of exogenous factors, the fibrosis seen in anterior subcapsular <b>cataracts</b> or <b>secondary</b> <b>cataracts</b> may reflect the intrinsic properties of len...|$|R

This study analysed if this might stimulate <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> following cataract extraction.  METHODS—This historical cohort study included 197  eyes of 197  patients (99  with and 98  without PEX) that underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation (PMMA optic) between 1985  and 1991.  Secondary cataract {{was defined as}} opacification of the axial posterior capsule and decrease of visual acuity by two or more lines. Mean follow up was 23. 8  months. For statistical analysis, the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used.  RESULTS—Secondary cataract was observed within 24  months in 35 % (SD 7 %) of all eyes, and was significantly more frequent in eyes with PEX (45  (11) %) than in eyes without PEX (24  (9) %, p< 0. 03).

5000|$|CPRA is {{also known}} as retinal pigment {{epithelial}} dystrophy (RPED). The cause of this condition is the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium's ability to effectively process the photoreceptor outer segment (POS) and subsequent accumulation of POS material in the RPE and loss of function. The loss of function of the RPE leads to photoreceptor degeneration. [...] Vitamin E deficiency {{may play a role in}} the development of CPRA. [...] It is characterized by accumulation of pigment spots in the retina surrounded by retinal atrophy and a mottled appearance of the pigmented nontapetal fundus. The pigmented spots eventually coalesce and fade as the atrophy of the retina increases. It is an inherited condition (in the Labrador Retriever it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance). [...] CPRA occurs in older dogs. Peripheral vision is retained for a long time. Vision is better in low light and better for moving or distant objects. Not all affected dogs go blind. <b>Secondary</b> <b>cataracts</b> are common.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} results of {{cataract}} surgery in children with radiation-induced cataract after treatment for retinoblastoma. METHODS: Retrospective interventional case series. Six consecutive patients diagnosed with <b>secondary</b> <b>cataracts</b> due to radiation therapy for retinoblastoma.

METHODS: The medical records of 122 patients, aged 1. 5 mo to 9 y, who had undergone cataract extraction with primary intraocular lens implantation between January 1993 and August 2011 were reviewed. Fourteen patients (17 eyes) with strabismus before cataract surgery were excluded. Patients were divided into those with congenital bilateral cataracts (64 patients, 128 eyes) and those with unilateral cataracts (44 patients, 44 eyes). The associations between the development of strabismus and age at cataract surgery, pre- and post-cataract extraction corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), interocular CDVA difference, nystagmus, surgical method, and <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: Factors significantly associated with the development of strabismus included age at cataract surgery (≤ 1 y), preoperative mean CDVA ≤ 20 / 100, presence of nystagmus in the bilateral cataract group and postoperative interocular CDVA difference ＞ 20 / 70 in the unilateral group.

The intraocular lens (IOL) is a polymer implant designed to replace the natural lens in the cataract surgery. The materials for IOL require excellent optical properties for light transmission, mechanical properties for folding injection during surgery, and biological properties for preventing body rejection. The biocompatibility - or more specified, bio-inert - {{seems to be the}} prerequisite in selecting the materials. [1] However, the bioinert materials could not satisfy the unmet need in the <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> control. Posterior capsular opacification (PCO, or <b>Secondary</b> <b>Cataract),</b> characterized by a thick and cloudy layer of lens epithelial cells (LECs), is the most common postoperative complication. In 1997, a “Sandwich Theory” model was proposed to elucidate the developmental process of PCO. [2] In this model, the residual LECs between the lens capsular bag and the IOL undergo proliferation, migration, as well as transdifferentiation and finally induce PCO if the affinity to the IOL material is low. In our research, a bioactive molecule is introduced to the conventional acrylic hydrophilic polymer pHEMA(Poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) by covalent conjugation. The RGD peptide sequence, being well-known for its tissue integration ability, is designed to stimulate the biointegration between the LECs and the IOL. [3].

40|$|Purpose: is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of YAG laser posterior lens capsule dissection in patients with secondary cataract with concurrent intraocular pathology. Patients and methods : retro- and prospective analysis of the results of the YAG — laser treatment of <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> in the 196 eyes, including the intraocular concomitant pathology (myopia, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa operated retinal detachment, chronic uveitis in remission, peripheral chorioretinal degeneration). Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by checking visual acuity and dynamics of complaints as aberration, glare, distortion in the central field of view without proper disease of the macula. Complex preoperative studies included: refractometry, visometry with correction, perimetry, tonometry, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, ultrasound examination of the eyeball (if necessary). The examination results should demonstrate convincing evidence that posterior capsular opacification is the main reason for the decrease of visual acuity. Results:, Visual acuity, at average increased from 0. 4 ‑ 0. 6 to 0. 8 ‑ 1. 0 in 50 cases after dissection, Visual acuity improved to 2 ‑ 3 lines in 66 ‑ 4 – 5, 24 ‑ 6 ‑ 7 lines in 74 cases. Visual acuity remains the same, but contrast sensitivity was increased in 6 cases. The IOL location after disruption was evaluated by β-scanning and biomicroscopy. In case of the initial correct IOL position in all 195 (100 %) cases, there were no dislocation in the postoperative period.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the long-term visual outcomes and causes of poor vision in the cataract population in Brazil {{treated in the}} Cataract-Free Zone Project. Methods: Project A subjects (62 patients) were recruited in Taquaritinga, SP, 26 months after surgery. Project B subjects (34 patients) were recruited in São João da Boa Vista, SP, 43 months after surgery. All patients underwent visual screening and eye examination (examination 1). They were classified according to visual acuity in the operated eye and the causes of poor vision were diagnosed and referred for treatment. The results of these interventions were collected (examination 2) and analysed by Chi-square test. Results: At examination 1 in project A, 47 of 62 patients (75. 6 %) had visual acuity 20 / 100. The main causes of poor vision were refractive error (31. 9 %) and posterior capsule opacification (17. 0 %), with or without refractive error. At examination 1 in project B, 22 of 34 patients (64. 7 %) had visual acuity 20 / 100. The main causes of poor vision were again posterior capsule opacification (50. 0 %) and refractive error (9. 0 %). After posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser and prescription of new corrective eyeglasses, visual acuity Ω 20 / 80 was obtained in 64. 5 % of patients in project A (ORΩ 0. 18, CIΩ 0. 07 – 0. 41) and 70. 5 % of patients in project B (ORΩ 0. 19, CIΩ 0. 06 – 0. 60) at examination 2. The causes of blindness in the remaining patients were identified. Conclusion: This type of project is effective in reducing blindness caused by cataracts in developing countries. However, long-term scheduled follow-up of operated patients is {{an effective means of}} avoiding consecutive blindness result-ing from <b>secondary</b> <b>cataracts</b> and refractive changes.

40|$|Posterior capsule {{opacification}} (PCO, <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract,</b> after cataract) is {{a nagging}} postsurgical complication following extracapsular cataract surgery (ECCE) and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. PCO should be eliminated {{since it has}} deleterious sequelae and Neodynium: Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Nd: YAG) laser treatment often is an unnecessary financial burden {{on the health care}} system. PCO following cataract surgery could be a major problem, since patient follow-up is difficult and the Nd:YAG laser is not always available. Advances in surgical techniques, IOL designs/biomaterials have been instrumental in bringing about a gradual and unnoticed decrease in the incidence of PCO. We strongly believe that the overall incidence of PCO and hence the incidence of Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy is now rapidly decreasing - from 50 &#x 0025; in the 1980 s and early 1990 s to less than 10 &#x 0025; currently. Superior tools, surgical procedures, skills and appropriate IOL designs have all helped to significantly reduce this complication. In this article, we review the aetio pathogenesis, experimental and clinical studies and propose surgical and implant-related factors for PCO prevention. Careful application and utilisation of these factors by surgeons could lead to a significant reduction is <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract,</b> the second most common cause of visual loss worldwid...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} various methods of managing the posterior capsule and anterior vitreous on the rate of posterior capsular opacification in children implanted with posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PC IOL). METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 20 eyes of 15 children (1. 5 - 12 years) who underwent primary cataract surgery with PC IOL in the last 5 years. The posterior capsule and anterior vitreous were managed in a variety of ways: in 5 eyes the posterior capsule was left intact, and 15 eyes underwent posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PCCC) -nine cases without and 6 with anterior vitrectomy. In 8 eyes posterior optic capture was performed, 3 with and 5 without vitrectomy. The follow-up ranged from 1 to 4. 5 years (mean: 2 years). RESULTS: Visually significant <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> developed in all 5 eyes with intact posterior capsules and in the 4 eyes that underwent PCCC without vitrectomy and without posterior optic capture (i. e., the optic was left in the capsular bag). The optical axis remained clear in all 6 eyes that underwent PC IOL implantation with vitrectomy (with or without posterior optic capture). Initially, all optic capture cases without vitrectomy also remained clear, but after 6 months 4 out of 5 developed opacification. CONCLUSIONS: In this series posterior capsulorhexis with anterior vitrectomy was the only effective method of preventing or delaying <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> formation in infants and children...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this case report was to present the development of implantation cyst following the perforating corneal injury, the problems related to the treatment, including total surgical excision of the cyst, the <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction, iridoplasty and the artificial intraocular lens reposition. A patient first presented with perforating corneal injury inflicted by a piece of wood, with the iris prolapse. Primary wound management, reposition of prolapsed iris and corneal sutures were performed {{four days after the}} injury. Eight months later, the patient was rehospitalized due to an implantation iris cyst and traumatic cataract. The cyst was excised, the extracapsular cataract extraction was done and the anterior chamber lens was implanted. Postoperative visual acuity was normal. Three years later, the patient presented for a follow-up examination, with the cyst filled up again, occupying two thirds of the anterior chamber. This time, the cyst was completely excised, all fibrous remnants of the <b>secondary</b> <b>cataract</b> were removed, and the iridoplasty was necessary due to large iris coloboma. Reposition of the anterior chamber lens was carried out. Histological examination revealed an implantation iris cyst covered by multilayered squamous epithelium. Normal visual acuity was achieved. The patient has been followed-up for six months uneventfully. Management of perforating corneal wound with iris prolapse may lead to development of an implantation iris cyst. Puncture of the cyst as well as incomplete excision will not solve the problem. Complete surgical removal of the iris cyst is the treatment of choice...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Lenticular reduced glutathione, {{diminished in}} {{all forms of}} human cataract, {{requires}} flavin adenine dinucleotide as a coenzyme for glutathione reductase. Deficiency of riboflavin, a precursor of flayin adenine dinucleotide, has been believed {{by some to be}} associated with cataract formation. We evaluated the riboflavin nutritional status of healthy young adults, presenile and senile cataract patients, and young and older patients with clear lenses. We found no evidence of an association between riboflavin deficiency and early cataract formation, either idiopathic or <b>secondary.</b> Older <b>cataract</b> patients had more riboflavin deficiency. An absence of riboflavin deficiency was found in our older patients with clear lenses. The degree of riboflavin deficiency encountered in the general population {{does not appear to be}} cataractogenic. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 34 : 861 - 863, 1981.

40|$|Wilm's-aniridia {{syndrome}} with transient hypo-y-globulinaemia of infancy Aniridia is {{the only}} congenital malformation linked in significant numbers with the subsequent development of Wilm's tumour (Miller, Fraumeni, and Manning, 1964). Though aniridia is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant, with 2 of 3 affected children having 1 affected parent, children with the Wilm's-aniridia syndrome only very rarely have a parent with aniridia (Miller, 1968; Fraumeni and Glass, 1968). The syndrome is characterized by aniridia, <b>secondary</b> <b>cataracts,</b> microcephaly with mental retardation, a folding-over of the pinna, and anomalies of the urinary tract with Wilm's tumour. We report a case of Wilm's-aniridia syndrome where development of the tumour was preceded by development and recovery from transient hypo-y-globulinaemia of infancy. Case report The patient was the second child of normal parents. There was no parental consanguinity. He weighed 3 * 7 kg at birth and 9 * 3 kg {{at the age of}} 1 year. The mother's brother had had a bad chest until the age of 7 years, but there was no family history of eye trouble, tendency to infection, or malignant disease. At birth he would not open his eyes, and later the mother noticed that the eyes had no colour. Bilateral aniridia was diagnosed at the age of 9 weeks {{and at the same time}} two large lacunae of the left occipitoparietal region and a large anterior fontanelle were noted. The top of the pinnae were folded over. Later he developed bilateral buphthalmos, glaucoma, and lens opacities. At 9 weeks he developed croup. Subsequently he required repeated anaesthetics for the management of the eye condition, and several of these were complicated by postoperative chest symptoms with an asthmatic element. For this reason it was necessary to postpone the operation on several occasions. Investigations showed deficiency of serum IgG (Table). At 5 months of age he had eczema of the face and neck, and a napkin rash. On a milk-free diet the skin manifestations cleared and there was no recurrence of the wheeziness for several months. He was sub-sequently troubled by recurrent coughs and colds and was treated with antibiotics. At the age of 14 months it was thought that a single injection of y-globulin (10 ml...|$|R
40|$|A 13 -year-old male {{patient with}} a recent history of {{hyperglycemia}} developed an acute bilateral posterior subcapsular cataract, consisting of fine feathery streak-like opacities. On examination, his uncorrected visual acuity was 20 / 50 and J 4 at near in both eyes. Under cycloplegia, a moderate hypermetropic refraction was noted in both eyes. He was diagnosed with acute posterior subcapsular <b>cataract</b> <b>secondary</b> to diabetes mellitus. Two weeks after resolution of the hyperglycemic state, the bilateral feathery streak-like posterior subcapsular opacities regressed completely, hypermetropic refraction decreased and uncorrected visual acuity improved to 20 / 20 and J 1 in both eyes...|$|R
