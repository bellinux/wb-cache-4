On September 5, 1972, three retired U.S. Army officers—Allan D. Bell Jr., Wilson H. Ford, and Charles R. McQuiston—filed a U.S. patent under their corporation name, Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. for their “physiological response analysis method and apparatus.”. Bell's expertise was in counterintelligence, Ford's was in electronics, and McQuiston's was in polygraphy. Ford had invented an electronic device that utilized the theory of Lippold, Halliday, and Redfearn in which he tape-recorded the human voice, slowed it down to one-third or one-fourth its normal rate, and fed it through several low pass filters which then fed the signal into an EKG <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder.</b> The <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> then made chart tracings on heat-sensitive paper. Their Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE) was the first commercially available VSA.

5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorders,</b> a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|R

40|$|Signature {{recognition}} {{is the problem}} of identifying an event or events from its time series. The generic problem has numerous applications to science and engineering. At NASA's Johnson Space Center, for example, mission control personnel, using electronic displays and <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorders,</b> monitor telemetry data from three-phase electrical buses on the Space Shuttle and maintain records of device activation and deactivation. Since few electrical devices have sensors to indicate their actual status, changes of state are inferred from characteristic current and voltage fluctuations. Controllers recognize these events both by examining the waveform signatures and by listening to audio channels between ground and crew. Recently the authors have developed a prototype system that identifies major electrical events from the telemetry and displays them on a workstation. Eventually the system will be able to identify accurately the signatures of over fifty distinct events in real time, while contending with noise, intermittent loss of signal, overlapping events, and other complications. This system {{is just one of many}} possible signature recognition applications in Mission Control. While much of the technology underlying these applications is the same, each application has unique data characteristics, and every control position has its own interface and performance requirements. There is a need, therefore, for CASE tools that can reduce the time to implement a running signature recognition application from months to weeks or days.

40|$|Facilities and Systems - Design of the lysimetric {{facility}} of {{the project}} began in 1966. During 1967, soil cores were taken for the lysimeters, and in 1968 an unforseen temperature problem in the lysimeters was solved. A total of 9 undisturbed soil cores were made into lysimeters. Since cores were procured, the lysimeters have the "natural" soil properties. Such lysimeters will be valuable tools for further studies. The lysimeters were designed for either visual or recorded readout of data. Initially, plans were made to use a datalogger owned by the USWB to collect the data. However, it is not reliable, and a system of <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> had to be procured to record the data. This proved to be time consuming, and subjected the data to possible human error when it was reduced to numerical form from the <b>strip</b> <b>charts.</b> Research-Results - Either the combination method of van Bavel or the Bowen Ratio will provide a fair estimate of evaporation from a wet soil surface in the area. In general, the combination method tends to overestimate while the Bowen Ratio tends to underestimate evaporation. This {{is due to the}} fact that the combination method places a strong emphasis on this parameter. Average wind speeds in the area commonly exceed 4 m/sec. Conductivity Studies - The conductivity of the Olton loam soil is very low at fairly low soil water pressures corresponding to high contents. This is an asset in preventing evaporation losses, but may be detrimental to crop production in that the crops need to develop extensive root systems to use the stored soil moisture. Canopy Effects on Evaporation - Evaporation within a cotton crop canopy following rains is related to the net radiation reaching the soil surface. After the surface dries, the moisture content of the soil surface is the limiting parameter. Effects of Crude Oil on Evaporation - Crude oil applied to the wet soil surfaces of the lysimeters following rains suppressed evaporation immediately following the rains. However, the value of the crude oil in preserving soil moisture over long periods needs further investigation. Diurnal Changes in Soil Moisture - Soil water content in the upper 30 cm (12 inches) of the soil apparently changes diurnally with major diurnal changes in soil temperature. Such changes may cause stress in young crop seedlings...|$|R

As part of the quality-control program, an accurate, rapid, and simple chroma tography system is required to assess the radiopurity of these products. We have developed a rapid, simple, chromato graphic method for measuring purity of radiophar maceuticals that uses instrumentation commonly available in most radioisotope laboratories and costs less than $ 1, 000 if purchased new. EQUIPMENT AND METHODS The distribution of radioactivity along the chroma tographic paper strip is determined {{by means of a}} Geiger-Muller (G-M) tube and a rate meter [Picker, Model No. 624081 (10 K range increased to lOOK) ] and the results are recorded on a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> (Picker, Model No. PRR- 600 -O 90) (Fig. I).

40|$|Monitoring {{systems can}} have {{numerous}} uses in the mine. They can {{aid in the}} efficient management of the mine by providing environmental trend data, production and maintenance control, and communications. In some cases, they can provide justification to petition the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fog a variance {{of one of the}} mandatory safety standards. They may also increase the gross revenues of the mine by increasing the amount of coal produced or increase profits by reducing the cost of producing that coal. No single system will satisfy the requirement of all mines. Some may require simple hard-wired status-reporting systems; others, multipurpose computer-based systems that collect, analyze, and store data and perhaps control some mine functions. Even though systems vary in complexity, they are all composed of three functional components. The first component is sensors that measure the environmental or production parameters and produce an electrical signal that is fed into the telemetry. The second is telemetry devices that receive the signal from the sensors and transmit it in either analog or digital format to the third com 2, analysis and display equipment. This equipment receives the transmitted signal and either stores it for later analysis or displays it. The analysis-display equipment ranges from simple <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> with preset alarms to computers, cathode-ray tubes (CRT's), and line printers that can also provide production reports. 4. 2 Uses of a Mine Monitoring System A list of potential uses for mine monitoring systems, including both production-related functions and those related to health and safety, was used to develop a questionnaire. It was presented to representatives of the mining community to determine their current monitoring priorities. The responses indicated that the industry's priorities fall into the following two categories: First priority- Production and haulage Maintenance Second priority- Ventilation Communication Fire monitoring Personnel The survey shows that production-oriented systems were the most appealing to the questionnaire respondents.

The system had {{to be capable of}} collecting and processing both FM and PCM data streams from analog tape and/or a telemetry receiver. The hardware and software was to be off the shelf whenever possible. The integration was to result in a stand alone telemetry collection and processing system. The Test Data Processing System (TDPS) provides real-time preprocessing and display of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) and Frequency Modulation (FM) aircraft test data. The FM front end equipment consists of FM demodulators, tunable filters, <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorders,</b> an array processor and a PCM encoder. PCM equipment includes a wide band demodulator, four tunable bit synchronizers and a preprocessor. The Integrated Telemetry Analysis System (ITAS), preprocessor which is Veda proprietary equipment offers functional redundancy with the HP 1000 real-time computer. This allows TDPS personnel to monitor selected real-time parameters in the event of HP 1000 system failure. All pertinent signals are routed through the system distribution panel to facilitate rapid changes in the system configuration. The HP 1000 real-time computer system provides computer control for the front end equipment, storage capability for incoming test data, data reduction algorithms for real-time data analysis, and also provides control of peripheral devices.
