40|$|The notch {{fracture}} toughness of Fe 75 Mo 5 P 10 C 8. 3 B 1. 7 monolithic bulk metallic glass (BMG) and Fe 77 Mo 5 P 9 C 7. 5 B 1. 5 and Fe 79 Mo 5 P 8 C 6. 7 B 1. 3 BMG matrix composites with α-Fe as reinforcing phase, fabricated by <b>suction</b> <b>mould</b> casting, were evaluated. It {{was found that}} the monolithic BMG has a toughness of 27 MPa m 1 / 2, while the Fe 77 Mo 5 P 9 C 7. 5 B 1. 5 BMG composite reinforced by single α-Fe dendrite phase exhibits a higher toughness of nearly 40 MPa m 1 / 2. However, for the Fe 79 Mo 5 P 8 C 6. 7 B 1. 3 alloy with more dendrites, the toughness decreased up to 25 MPa m 1 / 2. Microstructure investigation reveals that the simultaneous formation of Fe-Mo-P hard brittle phase apart from α-Fe dendrites in the Fe 79 Mo 5 P 8 C 6. 7 B 1. 3 alloy is the reason for the degradation of the {{fracture toughness}}.

40|$|The {{solidification}} pathways of Nb rich Nb-Si alloys when processed under non-equilibrium conditions require understanding. Continuing {{with our}} earlier work on alloying additions in single eutectic composition 1, 2], we report a detailed {{characterization of the}} microstructures of Nb-Si binary alloys with wide composition range (10 - 25 at% Si). The alloys are processed using chilled copper <b>mould</b> <b>suction</b> casting. This has allowed us to correlate the evolution of microstructure and phases with different possible solidification pathways. Finally these are correlated with mechanical properties through studies on deformation using mechanical testing under indentation and compressive loads. It is shown that microstructure modification can significantly influence the plasticity of these alloys...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} that Zr 50 Cu 42 Al 8 bulk {{metallic}} glass (BMG) exhibits excellent glass forming ability and mechanical properties. Zr 50 Cu 42 Al 8 glassy rods with a diameter of 3 mm were prepared using conventional copper <b>mould</b> <b>suction</b> casting. The glassy rod exhibits a modulus of about 115 GPa and a fracture strength of about 2 GPa, and, as compared with other large-scale BMGs, it has excellent room-temperature plasticity of up to 20 % under compression. The fracture mechanism of the rod was investigated by microstructural investigations, and {{it was found that}} the large plasticity of the as-cast rod is closely related to the in situ formation of nano-crystalline particles embedded in the amorphous matrix.

40|$|Este trabalho apresenta os resultados experimentais de um estudo em que se procurou desenvolver compósitos de matriz cimentícia reforçada com polpa de bambu. Foram usados dois tipos de polpa: refinada e sem refino. Fez-se variar o teor de fibras de 0 a 16 % em massa de cimento e se desenvolveu um processo com sucção, moldagem e prensagem para fabricação dos compósitos. As relações constitutivas dos compósitos foram definidas através de ensaio a compressão e tração de corpos-de-prova cilíndricos de 5 x 10 cm e do ensaio de flexão em três pontos. A partir delas, foi obtida a capacidade de absorção de energia. Determinaram-se, também, algumas propriedades físicas, como absorção, porosidade aparente, densidade seca e úmida dos compósitos. Os resultados mostraram melhor {{performance}} dos compósitos com fibras refinadas em relação àquelas com fibras sem refino e também indicaram que o teor ótimo de fibras refinadas se situou em torno de 8 %, quando promoveram notáveis melhoramentos das propriedades mecânicas dos compósitos em relação à matriz plena. This work {{presents the}} experimental {{results of a}} study which intended to develop a composite with cementations matrix reinforced with bamboo pulp. Two types of pulps were used: refined and unrefined pulps. The fibre content varied between 0 and 16 % cement (weight basis). After the preparation of fresh composite mix the experimental specimens were prepared applying a specially developed process based on Hastshek method using <b>suction</b> then <b>moulding</b> and pressing. The compression, tension and the flexural behavior and their constitutive relations were established using 5 cm diameter by 10 cm high cylindrical specimens and three point bending tests at respectively. The energy absorbing capacity of the new composites was also established. Physical properties such as water absorption, apparent porosity, dry and humid density were also obtained. The results showed a better performance of composites with refined fibres when compared to those with unrefined ones. It was observed that the optimum fibre content was approximately 8 % of refined fibre which improved the mechanical properties of the composites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{composition}} {{characteristics of}} maraging stainless steels were {{studied in the}} present work investigation using a cluster-plus-glue-atom model. The least solubility limit of high-temperature austenite to form martensite in basic Fe–Ni–Cr corresponds to the cluster formula [NiFe 12]Cr 3, where NiFe 12 is a cuboctahedron centered by Ni and surrounded by 12 Fe atoms in FCC structure and Cr serves as glue atoms. A cluster formula [NiFe 12](Cr 2 Ni) with surplus Ni was then determined to ensure the second phase (Ni 3 M) precipitation, based on which new multi-component alloys [(Ni,Cu) 16 Fe 192](Cr 32 (Ni,Mo,Ti,Nb,Al,V) 16) were designed. These alloys were prepared by copper <b>mould</b> <b>suction</b> casting method, then solid-solution treated at 1273 K for 1 h followed by water-quenching, and finally aged at 783 K for 3 h. The experimental {{results showed that the}} multi-element alloying results in Ni 3 M precipitation on the martensite, which enhances the strengths of alloys sharply after ageing treatment. Among them, the aged [(Cu 4 Ni 12) Fe 192](Cr 32 (Ni 8. 5 Mo 2 Ti 2 Nb 0. 5 Al 1 V 1)) alloy (Fe 74. 91 Ni 8. 82 Cr 11. 62 Mo 1. 34 Ti 0. 67 Nb 0. 32 Al 0. 19 V 0. 36 Cu 1. 78 wt%) has higher tensile strengths with YS= 1456 MPa and UTS= 1494 MPa.

40|$|The microstructure, {{mechanical}} behaviour, and biocompatibility (cell culture, morphology, {{and cell}} adhesion) of nanostructured Ti 45 Zr 15 Pd 35 - x Si 5 Nbx with x[*]=[*] 0, 5 (at. %) alloys, synthesized by arc melting and subsequent Cu <b>mould</b> <b>suction</b> casting, {{in the form}} of rods with 3 mm in diameter, are investigated. Both Ti-Zr-Pd-Si-(Nb) materials show a multi-phase (composite-like) microstructure. The main phase is cubic β-Ti phase (Im 3 m) but hexagonal α-Ti (P 63 /mmc), cubic TiPd (Pm 3 m), cubic PdZr (Fm 3 m), and hexagonal (Ti, Zr) 5 Si 3 (P 63 /mmc) phases are also present. Nanoindentation experiments show that the Ti 45 Zr 15 Pd 30 Si 5 Nb 5 sample exhibits lower Young's modulus than Ti 45 Zr 15 Pd 35 Si 5. Conversely, Ti 45 Zr 15 Pd 35 Si 5 is mechanically harder. Actually, both alloys exhibit larger values of hardness when compared with commercial Ti- 40 Nb, (HTi-Zr-Pd-Si ≈ 14 GPa, HTi-Zr-Pd-Si-Nb ≈ 10 GPa and HTi- 40 Nb ≈ 2. 7 GPa). Concerning the biological behaviour, preliminary results of cell viability performed on several Ti-Zr-Pd-Si-(Nb) discs indicate that the number of live cells is superior to 94 % in both cases. The studied Ti-Zr-Pd-Si-(Nb) bulk metallic system is thus interesting for biomedical applications because of the outstanding mechanical properties (relatively low Young's modulus combined with large hardness), together with the excellent biocompatibility...|$|R
40|$|Unsaturated soils can be often {{encountered}} in practical applications. In particular, even though index properties of a soil as construction material are left unchanged, the compaction procedure (moulding water content, compaction energy, etc.) influences the mechanical {{response of the}} resulting material, its after compaction degree of saturation (i. e. suction) and, more generally, the earth constructions behaviour (Vinale et al., 1999). This paper tries {{to contribute to the}} discussion of the above mentioned aspects of soil behaviour presenting the results of a series of suction controlled triaxial tests performed on an optimum water content and wet of optimum compacted soil. Details on the used apparatus are reported in Rampino et al. (1999). The experimental program was conceived in order to analyse the effects of both suction and fabric on soil behaviour. Overall, it consisted of 23 tests, i. e. isotropic compression, constant mean net stress (p-ua) shear and “standard” shear tests, all carried out under drained conditions and constant suction. The investigated suction levels were 0, 100, 200, 300 kPa for the optimum compacted soil and 0, 100, 200 kPa for the wet compacted material. The optimum and the wet compacted specimens exhibited very different behaviour in all the stages of the tests. For example, during the equalisation stages, the optimum material swelled and absorbed water, while the wet soil shrunk and expelled water. This behaviour is explained by the measurements of the after compaction suction (ua-uw) o. Using the Imperial College tensiometer (ua-uw) o was measured as high as 800 kPa for the optimum material (then causing wetting during equalisation) and as low as 60 kPa for the wet specimens (then causing drying during equalisation) – a relevant effect of moulding procedure. The results of the isotropic compression tests highlight a strong effect of suction on soil compressibility. In particular, the compressibility index decreases about 25 % from 0 to 200 kPa of suction. The greatest amount of this effects occurs in a limited suction range (0 - 100 kPa) while tends to a threshold value for (ua-uw) greater than 200 kPa. Comparing experimental findings on the optimum and the wet specimens, it is observed that an increase in moulding water content induces a severe increase in compressibility. In addiction, data indicate that both the shape and the position of the after compaction loading-collapse loci (LC) are largely affected by moulding water content. Thus, soil susceptibility to collapse strongly depends on preparation water content. The data of shear tests show that suction significantly affects large strain shear stiffness and resistance. For instance, in the range 0 - 200 kPa of suction, the strengthening with (ua-uw) is expressed by an apparent cohesion varying from 0 to 200 kPa for the optimum and from 0 to 150 kPa for the wet compacted soils. The results seems to be well grouped for suction levels and can be interpreted by straight fitting lines having the same M coefficient in the q:(p-ua) plane. The effect of moving from the optimum to the wet compaction water content is then a decrease in stiffness and in apparent cohesion, as well as a reduction {{of the size of the}} after compaction yield surface. The large series of experimental results obtained on Metramo silty sand can be satisfactorily modelled by the modern theories for unsaturated soils (Alonso 1990, Wheeler & Sivakumar 1995), if it is assumed that the different preparation procedures yield to different soils. The influence of <b>suction</b> and <b>moulding</b> water content on the observed behaviour clearly emerged in all the tests phases and highlights the need of carefully considering these two variables in handling engineering problems involving compacted soils as construction materials...|$|R
