40|$|The European Union (EU) {{is built}} on the {{principle}} of freedom of establishment, meaning that companies have the possibility to establish themselves as a company or by setting up a <b>secondary</b> <b>establishment</b> in other Member States. This right has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice through case law. A basic feature in domestic tax legislation is that losses are allowed to be set off against profits when calculating the tax liability of a company. At the moment cross-border loss compensation within the EU is restricted, unfeasible or just accepted on a temporary basis. This lack of recognition of loss-offset gives the fact that double taxation may occur and claims form two or more national tax systems leads to uncertainty in the way a company will be taxed. Depending on whether the <b>secondary</b> <b>establishment</b> is a subsidiary or a branch, the rules relating to loss compensation differs. Taxation of secondary establishments is based {{on the principle of}} {{whether or not they are}} considered as a resident or a non-resident of the state. In regards to taxation of secondary establishments, the PE is considered to be a non-resident and a subsidiary considered to be a resident. However, the European Court of Justice approach of non discriminatory treatment and equal treatment that has been developed and seen in the history of case law leads to the question if the Marks & Spencer ruling that concerned secondary establishments in form of subsidiaries can be applied to permanent establishments. The most vital difference between a subsidiary and a permanent establishment is connected to the taxation of the two. The subsidiary is considered to become a resident of the establishing state while the permanent establishment is seen as a non-resident. This legal difference between the two leads to different treatment under tax law. Taxation under a tax treaty leads to the situation where one of the contracting states will either credit or exempt the income deriving from the permanent establishment. Permanent establishments are often taxed under the method of exemption. In the Marks & Spencer case it was held that losses and profits were two sides of the same coin. Applying this statement to permanent establishments gives the notion that if a contracting state exempts an income, there will be a set off of the symmetry of having losses and profits within the same tax system. This lead to the fact that if applying the Marks & Spencer ruling on permanent establishments that are taxed under the exemption method, allowing terminal losses to be taken into account at the head office will set off the symmetry. Therefore it can be considered as the Marks & Spencer ruling shall not apply to permanent establishments...|$|E

40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Lichen-forming fungi produce diverse {{vegetative}} tissues, some closely resembling {{those of}} plants. Yet {{it has been}} repeatedly affirmed that none is a true parenchyma, in which cellular compartments are subdivided from all adjacent neighbors by cross walls adjoining older cross walls. METHODS: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we tested this assumption by examining patterns of septum formation in the parenchyma-like cortex of three lichens of different phylogenetic affinities: Sticta canariensis, Leptogium cyanescens, and Endocarpon pusillum. KEY RESULTS: In the cortex of all three lichens, new septa adjoined perpendicularly or obliquely to previous septa. Septal walls possessed an electron-transparent core (median) layer covered on both sides by layers of intermediate electron density. At septal junctures, the core layer of the newer septum was not continuous {{with that of the}} older septum. Amorphous, electron-dense material often became deposited in the core region of older septal walls, and the septum gradually delaminated along its median into what could then be recognized as the distinct walls of neighboring cells. However, cells maintained continuity at pores, where adjacent remnants of the electron-transparent core layer suggested septal partition rather than <b>secondary</b> <b>establishment</b> of a lateral wall connection via anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although fungal tissues first arise by the coalescence of filaments early in lichen ontogeny, the mature cortical tissues of some lichens are comparable to true parenchyma in the unrestricted orientation of their septal cross walls and the resulting ontogenetic relationship among neighboring cell compartments.

The importance of this principle also takes a great place in field of company law, especially in the area of “freedom of establishment of the companies” in the European Single Market (hereinafter ESM). Freedom of establishment of companies is closely related to the general concept of “free movement of people, capital, goods and services,” in ESM. In fact, freedom of establishment is a substantive {{part of the process of}} creation the internal market in EU. The freedom of establishment is based on the Treaty of the functioning of EU (hereinafter TFEU). According to article 49 from TFEU (previously article 43 et seq. EC Treaty), restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be prohibited. This prohibition also applies to restrictions on setting-up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of any Member State. In-depth exploration of this issue is conditioned by the interpretation of the Court of justice of European Union (hereinafter CJEU), which embodies the real legal regime of freedom of establishment. Freedom of establishment of companies is closely related to the principles of healthy and fair competition and equal access of the companies too. This article seeks to elaborate fundamental theoretical aspects of this issue, considering certain case - study analyze of CJEU judgements.

Article 49 and 54 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) grants persons and companies the right to set up establishments and pursue economic activity within the Member States of the European Union, the articles are however complicated and the Court of Justice has in many case explained how these articles are to be interpreted.

A new distinction of transfer was introduces in the latest ruling in the Cartesio case. A company can transfer from one Member State to another if it intends to convert to a company form of the new state, however, only if the legislation of new state allows it. The Court of Justice allowed a new kind of transfer and it must now be regulated in order for companies to be able to take advantage of this increase in corporate mobility...|$|E
