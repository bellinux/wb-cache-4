5|$|In 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam {{relocated}} to Worcester, Massachusetts, where they operated a successful luncheonette. At {{the end of}} June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to her attention the trio's first opportunity for political action: the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, workers at a <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> in Homestead, Pennsylvania were locked out when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory {{on the morning of}} July6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} moments that brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by Andrew Carnegie {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of the escalation in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. <b>Steel</b> <b>plant</b> in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston.|$|E

5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem <b>Steel</b> <b>plant</b> {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Iron ore {{and coal}} {{together}} {{account for about}} 72 % of cost of input materials in Indian <b>steel</b> <b>plants.</b> Moreover, sourcing iron ore and coal for <b>steel</b> <b>plants</b> is posing multitude of challenges including availability, quality and logistics. At present {{it is found that}} high quality input materials are hard to reach and easy to reach ones are of lower quality. Hence efficient utilisation of lower quality input materials has assumed greater significance for the sustainability of the <b>steel</b> <b>plants.</b> Accordingly the focus should be on beneficiation and agglomeration of lower quality input materials and development & application of new technologies for efficient use of the same in the <b>steel</b> <b>plants.</b> It also requires a paradigm shift from adopting technology dependent primarily on high quality input materials to introducing and absorbing alternate and mixed routes of production, which can efficiently utilise lower quality input materials...|$|R
