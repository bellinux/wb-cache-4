5|$|Ralph {{was the son}} of Seffrid d'Escures and {{his first}} wife Rascendis, and a half brother of Seffrid I, Bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145. The surname of de Turbine, by which he is {{sometimes}} known in older <b>scholarship,</b> <b>is</b> only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with William de Corbeil, Ralph's successor at Canterbury. Ralph studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec before entering the abbey of St Martin at Séez in 1079. St. Martin was a house founded by the Montgomery and Bellême families, and was still under their lordship. He became abbot of the house in 1091, and his election was attended by Anselm, abbot of Bec.|$|E
5|$|Another theory, {{which was}} {{put forward by}} early Serbian historians and has {{subsequently}} lost support in Serbian <b>scholarship,</b> <b>is</b> that despot Michael is {{to be identified with}} mid-15th-century Serbian noble Mihailo Anđelović, a brother of Ottoman statesman Mahmud Pasha Angelović. However, in-depth research of the frecoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to the 1450s, as the artistic style, the clothing and hairstyles in the portraits are uncommon for this period. Furthermore, the church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of the Morava school, which dominated 15th-century Serbian architecture. It has also been revealed that in 1454–1455, Donja Kamenica was controlled by the Ottomans and in possession of a certain Yusuf, rather than part of the Serbian Despotate, and Mihailo Anđelović was never titled despot.|$|E
