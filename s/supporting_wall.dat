Platform 5 {{is inside the}} main train shed while 6 is a southerly extension and 7 and 8 were added outside the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> in the 1930s. Platform 5 is used by trains towards Cardiff and platform 7 to Portsmouth; platforms 6 and 8 are the main platforms for Weston-super-Mare and stations to Penzance. Between platforms 5 and 7 are the two spur sidings that are long enough to stable a single Class 153 DMU.|$|E

25|$|Elevated roadways are {{typically}} built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns. If the soil fails where a bridge terminates, the bridge may become {{disconnected from the}} rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add additional reinforcement to any <b>supporting</b> <b>wall,</b> or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Bramante's {{plan for}} the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and {{like that of the}} Pantheon, was {{designed}} to be constructed in Tufa Concrete for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> becomes a drum raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a peristyle.|$|E
25|$|Many Coptic monasteries {{and churches}} {{scattered}} throughout Egypt are built of mudbrick on the basilica plan inherited from Graeco-Roman architectural styles. They usually have heavy walls and columns, architraves and barrel-vaulted roofs, and {{end in a}} tripartite apse, but many variant plans exist. Domes are small compared to Byzantine churches, and from the 10th-century naves are often roofed with domed cupolas. The dome raised on a circular <b>supporting</b> <b>wall,</b> which is so characteristic of later Byzantine architecture, is rarely used. Massive timber is often used across the nave, sometimes to support a flat roof, and sometimes to give structural strength to the walls. Inside the churches are richly decorated with frescoed murals and reliefs.|$|E

500|$|Brown ran as a moderate, {{stressing}} {{his ability}} to cross party lines and highlighting his votes for the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and to repeal [...] "don't ask, don't tell". Warren campaigned on a platform championing the middle class, and <b>supporting</b> <b>Wall</b> Street regulation. Warren criticized Brown for continually voting with Republican leadership, and argued {{that he was not}} the bipartisan moderate he claimed to be. A staple of Brown's attack tactics against Warren was his consistent reference to her as [...] "Professor Warren", in attempt to portray her as an elitist academic. Brown faced blowback after the second debate, during which he claimed conservative Antonin Scalia was a [...] "model" [...] Supreme Court Justice, prompting boos from the debate audience.|$|E
500|$|The MPGA {{were not}} {{consulted}} about the proposal, {{and the following}} week Lord Meath wrote to The Times and the City Press {{to complain about the}} scheme. He argued that the MPGA had devoted large amounts of time and money to prevent the park from being built on, and that while Watts's proposal was [...] "worthy of all encouragement and support", Postman's Park, at less than [...] and surrounded by tall buildings, was an inappropriate site. The three-sided design was abandoned, in favour of a [...] long and [...] tall wooden loggia with a tiled roof, designed by Ernest George. The <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> contained space for 120 memorial tablets. St Botolph's Aldersgate secured the necessary funds to complete the purchase of the CPF land, and Watts agreed to pay the £700 (about £ as of [...] ) construction costs himself.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February, Wyld asked Welch {{to retire}} from the project, {{promising}} {{that he would be}} paid for the work he had done so far. Wyld then contracted Abraham to produce new plans. Abraham's designs included a new <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> for the globe itself (correcting what he saw as Welch's error of leaving the trusses unsupported), as well as buildings to cover the whole area of the gardens which Wyld would be able to rent out to recoup some of his costs. Despite what he had told the residents' committee, Wyld had set a budget of £2,000 for the entire building work and so could not afford the outlying buildings. Abraham's designs– minus the additional buildings, but with a [...] circular Moorish corridor designed by G.A. Jermyn– got the final go-ahead on 15 March 1851, even though the new bids for the contract were substantially higher than they had been for Welch's original plans. George Myers' firm was again the cheapest at £2,755 and he was contracted to continue with the work. Both Welch and Abraham were eventually forced to sue to get their fees.|$|E

2500|$|The building, {{which was}} {{reminiscent}} of the Coliseum in Regent's Park, was entered through the newly laid out gardens via one of four loggias facing north (the main entrance), south, east and west, which opened into a large vestibule paved with [...] "patent lava" [...] and from there through turnstiles into Jermyn's circular corridor. This corridor was hung with examples of Wyld's maps and there were examples of his guides and globes on display tables. The corridor was decorated with blue arabesques and lit by globe-shaped lamps with crimson tassels hung from ornate beams. The internal pillars were painted in a rich brown and decorated with copies of Moorish architectural designs from the Alhambra in Granada. The inner wall of this corridor was comprised {{in part by the}} rendered exterior surface of the Globe itself; the portion visible from within the corridor was painted blue with the positions of the stars in the night sky picked out in silver. The value of the star map as an educational tool was diminished as only a little of the convex face of the Globe was visible above the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and much of that was obscured by the numerous beams and supports criss-crossing the interior of the corridor.|$|E

60|$|I was in {{the very}} act of {{breaking}} the window finally with my stick, incensed with this very sinister mystery, when Rupert held my arm hard, held it with a curious, still, and secret rigidity as if he desired to stop me, but did not desire to be observed to do so. I paused a moment, and in the act swung slightly round, so that I was facing the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> of the front door steps. The act froze me into a sudden stillness like that of Rupert, for a figure almost as motionless as the pillars of the portico, but unmistakably human, had put his head out from between the doorposts and was gazing down into the area. One of the lighted lamps of the street was just behind his head, throwing it into abrupt darkness. Consequently, nothing whatever could be seen of his face beyond one fact, that he was unquestionably staring at us. I must say I thought Rupert's calmness magnificent. He rang the area bell quite idly, and went on talking to me with the easy end of a conversation which had never had any beginning. The black glaring figure in the portico did not stir. I almost thought it was really a statue. In another moment the grey area was golden with gaslight as the basement door was opened suddenly and a small and decorous housemaid stood in it.|$|E
