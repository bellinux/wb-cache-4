25|$|Problems {{that can}} arise from <b>selective</b> <b>harvesting</b> are smaller {{reproducing}} adult fish, {{as well as}} the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several age classes, allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946–2005 was 8mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs. If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11–29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.|$|E

The previous studies mostly applied the spatially lumped models {{and focused on}} different harvested species. In this research, the stochastic cellular automata based predator–prey model (EcoCA) was upgraded to investigate the difference between random <b>harvest</b> and the <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> strategies of the predator–prey complex. Three groups of numerical experiments have been conducted: (1) joint harvest with a constant effort and a density limitation, (2) joint harvest with constant quota, (3) joint harvest with a constant effort and without density limitation. In each group, both random <b>harvest</b> and <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> have been adopted to examine their differences. The statistical results of the simulations showed that the <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> is more stable than random <b>harvest.</b> Moreover, the <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> resulted in a longer cyclic period. For both random and <b>selective</b> <b>harvest,</b> the system is more stable if a density limitation is imposed. When the constant quota was adopted, the system is unstable. However, it collapsed more slowly for <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> than for random harvest.

50|$|Standing Stem Harvesting, a <b>selective</b> <b>{{harvesting}}</b> method within Heli-Logging, {{was invented}} by Philip Jarman of Port Alberni, British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple {{which was to be}} operated by a K-Max Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted, jettisonable sled carrying a hydraulic power pack, to operate the grapple.Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a grapple designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively.|$|E
40|$|Minimising the {{potential}} impact of forest management requires an understanding of the key elements that maintain forest diversity and its role in ecological processes. Invertebrates are the most diverse of all biota and play important roles in maintaining forest processes. However, little is known about invertebrates in New Zealand's beech forests or the degree to which <b>selective</b> beech <b>harvest</b> might impact on their diversity and ability to carry out ecosystem processes. Studying ecosystem responses to disturbance is considered vital for understanding how ecosystems are maintained. One of the main objectives of this research was to assess whether litter-dwelling invertebrates were susceptible to the impacts of <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> and, if so, whether they could be used as indicators of forest health. Changes in invertebrate diversity could have important implications for nutrient cycling and primary production in forests. Litter-dwelling invertebrates contribute to the process of decomposition by increasing the surface area of the leaves, mixing soil organic matter and by infecting leaf particles with soil microbes. This investigation into the function of invertebrates in beech forest was carried out in the context of ecological theories which relate diversity to ecosystem stability and resilience. A replicated study was established in Maruia State Forest (South Island, New Zealand) to assess {{the potential}} biotic and abiotic impacts of sustainable beech harvest. Litter-dwelling invertebrates and environmental factors were monitored during 1997, before harvest, to determine how much variability there was between study sites. Specifically, litter pH, light intensity, litter fall, litter temperature, moisture as well as invertebrate abundance and diversity were compared before and after <b>selective</b> <b>harvest.</b> On 17 January 1998, two to three trees were selectively harvested from three of the nine study sites. On 15 February 1998 a similar number of trees were winched over or felled manually to create artificial windthrow sites. The remaining three undisturbed sites were used as controls. Invertebrates belonging to the detritivore guild were assessed from litter samples and a series of litter-bags containing pre-weighed leaf litter which were placed in each of the sites to assess rates of litter decomposition. Millipedes (Diplopoda: Polyzoniidae, Schedotrigonidae, Dalodesmidae, Habrodesmidae, Sphaerotheridae), earthworms (Oligochaeta: Annelida), tipulid larvae (Diptera: Tipulidae), weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), moth larvae (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae, Tortricidae and Psychidae), slaters (Isopoda: Styloniscidae), Oribatid mites (Acarina: Cryptostigmata) and landhoppers (Crustacea: Amphipoda) were extracted from the litter-bags and their abundance and diversity was compared between the three treatments. Weight loss from the litter-bags and the carbon and nitrogen content of litter were used to measure the rate of decomposition in each treatment. An additional study investigated whether exclusion of invertebrates from leaf litter resulted in reduced rates of decomposition. The results indicated that there was an increase in light intensity and a small increase in temperature following <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> and artificial windthrow. There {{was no significant difference in}} litter moisture or the amount of litter fall between the treatments. Invertebrate abundances were significantly affected by season but did not appear to be affected by <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> or artificial windthrow. The diversity of invertebrates remained relatively constant throughout the year, as did the rate of decomposition. When invertebrates were excluded from the leaf litter there was no consequential effect on the rate of litter decomposition. This suggests that there may be compensatory mechanisms taking place between the trophic levels of the food web to maintain processes and that direct links between invertebrates and decomposition are relatively weak. In conclusion, it appears that the effects of <b>selective</b> beech <b>harvest</b> on forest-floor processes were minimal and are comparable to those created by natural windthrow disturbance. It also appears that macroclimatic effects such as seasonal climatic effects have a large effect on forest biota. As none of the invertebrates studied appeared to be detrimentally affected by <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> and as there was no direct link demonstrated with decomposition, it was considered inappropriate to advocate the use of this group of invertebrates as indicators of sustainable forest management. The results from this study provide information which may help inform decisions on the future management of diversity in beech forest ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{dynamics}} of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) in a sparsely populated Alaskan valley were examined for management of subsistence firewood and houselog harvest. Site index, disturbance history, current productivity, and population age structure of white spruce were determined at 26 sites on five landform units. Human residents were interviewed to characterize local harvest patterns. Site index averaged 59 {{and was not}} significantly different among landforms. Current productivity, which ranged from 0. 20 to 2. 22 m 3 /ha/yr, was reduced by a 5 -year old spruce beetle outbreak that killed up to 42 % of the standing volume in some stands. Forests consisted of even-age stands initiated by deglaciation (20 % of study area), wildfire (13 %), and anthropogenic fire (26 %), and mixed-age stands characterized by small gap-forming disturbances (41 %). The latter stands exhibited old-growth characteristics. A demographic model based on age-structure in the old-growth stands showed that current recruitment was too low to maintain current tree density under conditions of natural mortality, and that removal of live trees by <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> or beetle outbreaks will diminish tree density. Current annual firewood demand of 61. 5 cords/year is adequately supplied by beetle-killed spruce, but demand for live trees will rise as beetle-killed trees decay and become unusable.

Most salmon populations include several age classes, allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550 mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946-2005 was 8 mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs. If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11-29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.|$|E

The earliest spring log drives floated up to [...] of logs in Pine Creek at one time. These logs floated to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills near the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport. Hemlock wood was not widely used until the advent of wire nails, but the bark was used to tan leather. After 1870 the largest tanneries in the world were in the Pine Creek watershed, and required 2000 lb of bark to produce 150 lb of quality sole leather.|$|E
5000|$|As the 19th century progressed, fewer pines {{were left}} and more hemlocks and {{hardwoods}} were cut and processed locally. By 1810 there were 11 sawmills in the Pine Creek watershed, and by 1840 there were 145, despite a flood in 1832 which wiped out {{nearly all the}} mills along the creek. <b>Selective</b> <b>harvesting</b> of pines was replaced by clearcutting of all lumber in a tract. The first lumbering activity close {{to what is now}} Colton Point was in 1838 when William Dodge and partners built a settlement at Big Meadows and formed the Pennsylvania Joint Land and Lumber Company.

These logs floated to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills near the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport. Log drives could be dangerous: just north of the park is Barbour Rock, named for Samuel Barbour, who lost his life on Pine Creek there after breaking up a log jam.

40|$|A {{harvested}} prey-predator {{model with}} density-dependent maturation delay and stage structure for prey is proposed, where <b>selective</b> <b>harvest</b> effort on predator population is considered. Conditions which influence positiveness and boundedness of solutions of model system are analytically investigated. Criteria for existence of all equilibria and uniqueness of positive equilibrium are also studied. In order to discuss effects of maturation delay and harvesting on model dynamics, local stability analysis around all equilibria {{of the proposed}} model system is discussed due to variation of maturation delay and harvest effort level. Furthermore, global stability of positive equilibrium is investigated by utilizing an iterative technique. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to show consistency with theoretical analysis...|$|R
