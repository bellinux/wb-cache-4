40|$|Conventional {{compression}} ignition engines can easily be converted to a dual fuel mode of operation using natural gas as main fuel and diesel oil injection as pilot to initiate the combustion. At the same time, {{it is possible to}} increase the output power by increasing the diesel oil percentage. A detailed performance and combustion characteristic analysis of a heavy duty diesel engine has been studied in dual fuel mode of operation where natural gas is used as the main fuel and diesel oil as pilot. The influence <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature on knock occurrence and the effects of initial swirl ratio on heat release rate, temperature-pressure and emission levels have been investigated in this study. It is shown that an increase in the initial swirl ratio lengthens the delay period for auto-ignition and extends the combustion period while it reduces NOx. There is an optimum value of the initial swirl ratio for a certain mixture <b>intake</b> temperature and <b>pressure</b> conditions that can achieve high thermal efficiency and low NOx emissions while decreases the tendency to knock. Simultaneous increase <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and initial swirl ratio could be the solution to power loss and knock in dual fuel engine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: One of the {{effective}} ways to reduce both NOx and PM {{at the same time}} in a diesel CI engine is to operate the engine in low temperature combustion (LTC) regimes. In general, two strategies are used to realize the LTC operation-dilution controlled LTC and late injection LTC- and in this study, the former approach was used. In the dilution controlled regime, LTC is achieved by supplying a large amount of EGR to the cylinder. The significant EGR gas increases the heat capacity of in-cylinder charge mixture while decreasing oxygen concentration of the charge, activating low temperature oxidation reaction and lowering PM and NOx emissions. However, use of high EGR levels also deteriorates combustion efficiency and engine power output. Therefore, it is widely considered to use increased <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> as a way to resolve this issue. In this study, the effects <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> variations on performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder diesel engine operated in LTC regimes were examined. LTC operation was achieved in less than 8 % O 2 concentration and thus a simultaneous reduction of both PM and NOx emission was confirmed. As <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> increased, combustion efficiency was improved so that THC and CO emissions were decreased. A shift of the peak Soot location was also observed to lower O 2 concentration while NOx levels were kept nearly zero. In addition, an elevation <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> enhanced engine power output as well as indicated thermal efficiency in LTC regimes. All these result...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLonger chain alcohols, such as butanol, possess major physiochemical {{advantages}} over ethanol as bio-components for gasoline, including higher energy content, better engine compatibility, and less water solubility. In this study, two butanol isomers (n-butanol and isobutanol) are investigated as potential fuels for Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines. Wide ranges <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and equivalence ratio are investigated {{and the results}} are presented in comparison to ethanol and gasoline as reference fuels. Under all tested conditions, the butanol isomers require lower intake temperatures for a fixed combustion phasing, indicating higher HCCI reactivity. Both isomers show single-stage ignition behavior at all test points and behave similarly in regard to the combustion stability. Engine operation using n-butanol is slightly more stable under all conditions and misfiring occurs slightly later under very lean and naturally aspirated conditions. Similar to gasoline, n-butanol shows a higher heat release rate (HRR) at the beginning of combustion. The intermediate temperature heat release (ITHR) lowers the coefficient of variation (CoV) of IMEPg (gross indicated mean effective pressure), especially at retarded combustion timing and lean mixtures. However, the knock resistance of n-butanol is lower compared to isobutanol and the other tested fuels. The exhaust emissions of the two butanol isomers are in the same range as the two reference fuels. Overall, the results indicate that butanol is suited for use as a fuel in HCCI engines, either in neat form or in blend with gasoline...|$|R

The maneuverability of the F- 16 was defined using three factors: Mach number, angle of attack and angle of sideslip. The values of pressure recovery and distortion were measured at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP). Two sets of simulations were conducted: one to compare the sea level and 10 km altitude flight condition and another to correlate the required air intake and engine performance with pressure recovery and distortion at the AIP. Results of the flight level comparisons showed a slightly higher pressure recovery at 10 km of 0. 985 compared to sea level condition value of 0. 983. Distortion coefficient values for both conditions were however similar at 0. 120. The difference in recovery values is attributed to the less viscous characteristic of air at higher altitude. This resulted in lower secondary flow formations in the intake. With increasing altitude, temperature plots showed a linear decreasing profile throughout the intake.

This simulated interest in alcohol-fueled diesel engines because it is renewable bio-based resource and it is oxygenated, thereby providing the potential to reduce particulate emissions in diesel engines and ethanol diffusion flames produce virtually no soot. But due to alcohols higher latent heat of vaporization, the higher temperatures available in the Insulated engine (IE) are used for vaporizing the alcohols and this decreases the ignition delay and aids combustion. With the higher temperatures in the insulated engines there will be drop in volumetric efficiency and this further increases the frictional horse power due to thinning of lubricant. So the volumetric efficiency drop is to be compensated by turbocharging to improve the thermal efficiency of insulated engine. Hence the present experimental work is planned accordingly. In the turbocharger the exhaust gases are expended in a turbine which is further coupled to engine. Further the turbine forces more air, proportionately more fuel into the combustion chamber, thereby enhancing the power output without increasing the cylinder capacity.

40|$|Transportation {{accounted}} for 28 % {{of the total}} U. S. energy demand in 2011, with 93 % of U. S. transportation energy coming from petroleum. The large impact of the transportation sector on global climate change necessitates more-efficient, cleaner-burning internal combustion engine operating strategies. One such strategy that has received substantial research attention {{in the last decade}} is Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). Although the efficiency and emissions benefits of HCCI are well established, practical limits on the operating range of HCCI engines have inhibited their application in consumer vehicles. One such limit is at high load, where the pressure rise rate in the combustion chamber becomes excessively large. Fuel stratification is a potential strategy for reducing the maximum pressure rise rate in HCCI engines. The aim is to introduce reactivity gradients through fuel stratification to promote sequential auto-ignition rather than a bulk-ignition, as in the homogeneous case. A gasoline-fueled compression ignition engine with fuel stratification is termed a Gasoline Compression Ignition (GCI) engine. Although a reasonable amount of experimental research has been performed for fuel stratification in GCI engines, a clear understanding of how the fundamental in-cylinder processes of fuel spray evaporation, mixing, and heat release contribute to the observed phenomena is lacking. Of particular interest is gasoline's pressure sensitive low-temperature chemistry and how it impacts the sequential auto-ignition of the stratified charge. In order to computationally study GCI with fuel stratification using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemical kinetics, two reduced mechanisms have been developed. The reduced mechanisms were developed from a large, detailed mechanism with about 1400 species for a 4 -component gasoline surrogate. The two versions of the reduced mechanism developed in this work are: (1) a 96 -species version and (2) a 98 -species version including nitric oxide formation reactions. Development of reduced mechanisms is necessary because the detailed mechanism is computationally prohibitive in three-dimensional CFD and chemical kinetics simulations. Simulations of Partial Fuel Stratification (PFS), a GCI strategy, have been performed using CONVERGE with the 96 -species reduced mechanism developed in this work for a 4 -component gasoline surrogate. Comparison is made to experimental data from the Sandia HCCI/GCI engine at a compression ratio 14 : 1 at <b>intake</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> 1 bar and 2 bar. Analysis of the heat release and temperature in the different equivalence ratio regions reveals that sequential auto-ignition of the stratified charge occurs in order of increasing equivalence ratio for 1 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and in order of decreasing equivalence ratio for 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure.</b> Increased low- and intermediate-temperature heat release with increasing equivalence ratio at 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> compensates for decreased temperatures in higher-equivalence ratio regions due to evaporative cooling from the liquid fuel spray and decreased compression heating from lower values of the ratio of specific heats. The presence of low- and intermediate-temperature heat release at 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> alters the temperature distribution of the mixture stratification before hot-ignition, promoting the desired sequential auto-ignition. At 1 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> the sequential auto-ignition occurs in the reverse order compared to 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and too fast for useful reduction of the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI. Additionally, the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites before the highest-equivalence ratio regions. Conversely, at 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites last, after the higher-equivalence ratio regions. More importantly, the sequential auto-ignition occurs over a longer time period for 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> than at 1 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> such that a sizable reduction in the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI can be achieved...|$|R

They allow the increase <b>of</b> the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and {{are associated with a}} charge air cooler (CAC). The main disadvantage of a downsized turbocharged engine (compared to a naturally aspirated one) is the deterioration of low-end torque caused by the lack of enthalpy of the exhaust gas at low engine speed and load. To investigate this issue, the <b>intake</b> line <b>of</b> a turbocharged Diesel engine was analyzed, focusing on the pressure waves at the inlet [1] [2] which are most often overlooked on these engines in favor of pressure loss reduction. A first step of the study is to identify the potential resonance for the establishment of standing waves at low engine speeds. Experimental tests with different pipe lengths upstream and downstream of the charge air cooler (CAC) were performed on an electrically driven engine test bench (pulse generator). This was done to study the influence of pressure waves on the air filling of the engine and determine the optimal length of the air circuit. In a second step, and to better understand the dynamic phenomena at the intake, the reflection coefficient at the interface of the CAC is calculated (method of pressure wave decomposition) from measurements on the engine test bench (with combustion). This allows to characterize the unsteady behavior of this element and to better discern the influence of the upstream and downstream ducts on engine filling. Finally, a new active system is proposed, it consists of a long pipe designed for acoustic tuning (low end torque) and a short pipe to minimize losses (high speed power generation). The acoustic response of this element is compared to that obtained with an equivalent length of straight pipe on the dynamic bench [3]...|$|R
50|$|A {{sequential}} turbo {{can also}} be of use to a system where the output pressure must be greater than can be provided by a single turbo, commonly called a staged twin turbo system. In this case, multiple similarly sized turbochargers are used in sequence, but both operate constantly. The first turbo boosts pressure {{as much as possible}} (for example to three times the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure).</b> Subsequent turbos take the charge from the previous stage and compresses it further (for example to an additional three times <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> for a total boost of nine times atmospheric pressure). This configuration is commonly found on piston engine aircraft which usually do not need to rapidly raise and lower engine speed (and thus where turbo lag is not a primary design consideration), and where the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> is quite low due to low atmospheric pressure at altitude, requiring a very high pressure ratio. High-performance diesel engines also sometimes use this configuration, since diesel engines do not suffer from pre-ignition issues and can use significantly higher boost pressure than Otto cycle engines.|$|R
