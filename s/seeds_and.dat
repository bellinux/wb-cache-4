Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> the insect larvae.|$|E

Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood.

40|$|Field {{observations}} and few physiological studies {{pointed out that}} peach embryogenesis and fruit development are strictly related. In fact, attempts to stimulate partenocarpic fruit development by means of external tools failed. Moreover, physiological disturbances during the early embryo development lead to <b>seed</b> abortion <b>and</b> fruitlet abscission. Later on, the interactions between <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> fruit development become less stringent. Genetic and molecular information about <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> fruit development in peach is limited and coming exclusively from a microarray approach. The identification of genes differentially expressed in <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> fruit was done {{by means of a}} comparative analysis of the transcription profiles carried out in peach <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> mesocarp throughout development using the first peach microarray (µPEACH 1. 0). It has been shown that the transcription factor families (TFs) more involved were the MADS-box, AUX/IAA and bZIP. Some members of these families showed a differential expression pattern according to the organ and developmental phase, being more expressed in embryo at early development and in mesocarp at ripening. Among the isolated TFs, a bZIP, homologous to Arabidopsis ATB 2, which controls transcription in <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> fruit, and similar to bZIPs highly abundant in ripe fleshy fruit of several species. Other factors deeply involved in the regulation of <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> fruit development are the plant hormones.
