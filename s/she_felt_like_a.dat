500|$|Jenny's {{character}} was unpopular with both fans and critics {{throughout the entire}} series because of her frequent narcissistic tendencies, her prima donna ways, her egotistical attitude, irresponsibility, frequent self-pity and selfish persona. She has also been labeled a [...] "love to hate" [...] character. The majority of critics have been intrigued by her [...] "polarising personality" [...] and branded {{it as one of}} the main reasons to watch the series. New York magazine gave a large amount of praise to Jenny and on one occasion stated: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show." [...] Kirshner received critical praise for her portrayal of the character. Kirshner has stated she loved playing Jenny because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brand new character during each season. She has also stated that it is difficult for people to like the character as she can be [...] "very despicable" [...] and even the LGBT community does not like her because of her [...] "duplicity and confusion".|$|E
60|$|Rose blushed {{up to her}} hat brim, and stood, looking, as <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fool, while Mrs. Clara {{hastened to}} explain.|$|E
60|$|There {{were several}} scenes (during which <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> beggar {{about to be}} arrested) between Mr. Schwirtz and the landlord, before her husband paid part of a bill whose size astounded her.|$|E
5000|$|She {{has said}} that while growing up <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider, recalling, [...] "We lived in this nice Jewish neighborhood...Everyone had Mercedes and Jaguars, and I was going to school in a Pinto." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cantares gallegos: This {{work was}} {{developed}} during Rosalía's stay in Castile while she longer for her homeland of Galicia. In Castile <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exile because, according to her, {{there was little}} respect things Galician. Cantares gallegos was a work of simple poems with popular themes and rhythms. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> nostalgia for her homeland and desired to return: ...|$|R
60|$|Sally drew back. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> infidel who intrudes {{upon the}} celebration of strange rites. This was Man's hour, and women must keep in the background. She had the {{sensation}} of being very small and yet {{very much in the}} way, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puppy who has wandered into a church. The novelty and solemnity of the scene awed her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child again. She trembled {{a little}} as she sat down by his side. It was not in this fashion that she had {{intended}} {{to hear what he}} had to say.|$|E
60|$|When {{twilight}} came {{she went}} out to the front steps and leaned her aching head against the honeysuckle trellis. The sun had just set and the whole world swam in dusky golden light. The wonderful beauty frightened her. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blot on it.|$|E
60|$|Fan listened, readily assenting to everything; but in {{her heart}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bird newly escaped from captivity. That restful state she had been hearing about, {{in which there was}} no {{perpetual}} distrust of self, vigilance, heart-searching, wrestling in prayer, looked infinitely attractive, and suited her disposition and humble intellect.|$|E
5000|$|Reinig {{began as}} a lyric poet, and her voice is {{frequently}} allegorical and metaphysical, as well as characterised by black humor, irony, brash, life-affirming sarcasm, and an [...] "extremely refined simplicity". She {{was known as a}} rebel, who went her own way. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider both in East Germany, despite her proletarian background, and in the feminist movement.|$|R
60|$|Susie went to {{the shelves}} to which he vaguely waved, and looked with a {{peculiar}} excitement at the mysterious array. She ran her eyes along the names. It {{seemed to her that}} she was entering upon an unknown region of romance. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> adventurous princess who rode on her palfrey into a forest of great bare trees and mystic silences, where wan, unearthly shapes pressed upon her way.|$|R
50|$|Godoy was crowned Miss Universe Guatemala 2012 by Alejandra Barillas (Miss Universe Guatemala 2011) at the Convention Center Light, Real Life Evangelical Church, Zone 10 of Guatemala City on November 25, 2011. Godoy said that, as <b>a</b> beauty queen, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{ambassador}} for her country. She said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{a great deal}} of pressure moving forward to the Miss Universe pageant because she was representing Guatemala instead of just representing herself.|$|R
60|$|No {{need to say}} {{how often}} Lucilla {{would have liked to}} have {{recalled}} that note for addition or diminution, how many misgivings she suffered on her peculiar mode of catching Robins, how frequent were her disgusts with her cousin, and how often <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> captive--the captive of her own self-will.|$|E
60|$|The {{intoxication}} that Fitzpiers had, as usual, {{produced in}} Grace's brain during the visit passed off somewhat with his withdrawal. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{woman who did}} not know what she had been doing for the previous hour, but supposed with trepidation that the afternoon's proceedings, though vague, had amounted to an engagement between herself and the handsome, coercive, irresistible Fitzpiers.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head slowly and looked into her eyes. She bore the ordeal well, but she never forgot it. It seemed to her {{afterwards}} {{that he must have}} read every thought which had flashed through her brain. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little child in the presence of some mysterious being, thoughts of whom had haunted her dreams, now visible in bodily shape for the first time.|$|E
50|$|By 1920 an {{interest}} was growing for Native American art, either made by or influenced by Native Americans. Pop Chalee, who originally came from Taos Pueblo, ended up {{running away from}} her mothers home in Utah {{when she was only}} sixteen years old. She and her family settled in Taos Pueblo where, for the most part, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider. These clashing feelings made Chalee and her family decide to move back to Utah.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, {{her father}} {{took a job}} as vice {{president}} of the Linz Glass Company in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. “It was there that Jane Alpert first became {{aware of the fact that}} she was an outsider, not only because she was Jewish, but also because she was from the city and unaccustomed to country ways." [...] When she was twelve, they moved back to New York, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider once again.|$|R
50|$|During {{the photo}} shoot, Nina {{appeared}} topless and she didn't help Lianna when Lianna couldn't choose her trousers. The following {{day after the}} photo shoot, they got their makeovers and there were inevitable tears. Sophia realized that her hair wasn't Strawberry Blonde; Tamar was shocked when her hair was dyed brown. Lianna said that Sophia didn't like her cut or color at all and that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old woman. Sophia tried to convince Lisa that she really liked it {{and that she was}} pleased, despite being in tears.|$|R
60|$|So she flitted along, {{keeping an}} {{illusion}} {{that she was}} unnoticed. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bird that has flown {{in through the window}} of a hall where vast warriors sit at the board. Between their grave, booming ranks she was hastening, assuming she was unnoticed, till she emerged, with beating heart, through the far window and out into the open, upon the vivid green, marshy meadow.|$|E
60|$|She {{found no}} further {{chance to say}} anything, but from that moment Emma {{began to think of}} letting Sarah know how much she needed her. She planned to hang out the cloth as she used to. She exaggerated its {{importance}} in the way of an invalid, until it attained the significance of an act of treason. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> criminal even in thinking about it.|$|E
6000|$|The half-indignant remonstrance that vibrated in Deronda's voice came, {{as often}} happens, from {{the habit of}} inward {{argument}} with himself rather than from severity toward Gwendolen: {{but it had a}} more beneficial effect on her than any soothings. Nothing is feebler than the indolent rebellion of complaint; and to be roused into self-judgment is comparative activity. For the moment <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shaken child--shaken out of its wailing into awe, and she said humbly-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Williams {{attended}} Learning Unlimited and Ecole Francaise {{for elementary}} and middle school and then attended Fort Hayes High School. She was a relatively happy child until high school where she joined the [...] "punk" [...] scene. Williams grew up without much money, so she [...] "saw the disparity between the rich and the poor". <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider, and the punk scene was a way of choosing to reject society instead of letting it reject her. Also, she enjoyed the music the punk scene offered because it made her feel [...] "cool".|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> exactly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tired child, {{now that}} she had been made so comfortable, and she liked Maurice so much, oh! so much! no brother could have been dearer.|$|R
5000|$|Loveless {{was born}} in Coshocton, Ohio, in the Newcastle area. She is the {{daughter}} of Parker Chandler and has two older sisters, Eleanor Sinacola and Jessica, who now performs under the stage name [...] "Jessica Wabbit". Loveless grew up on a farm in a rural area outside of Coshocton and was home-schooled. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outcast in a town that emphasized religion and conformity until she moved to Columbus, Ohio when she was 14. She enjoyed Hank Williams III and punk-influenced country music, while also embracing popular music and rock and roll and [...] "pretty much anything on Kemado Records." ...|$|R
60|$|When the {{windshield}} was closed it became so filmed with rain that Claire fancied she was piloting a drowned car in dim spaces under the sea. When it was open, drops jabbed {{into her eyes}} and chilled her cheeks. She was excited and thoroughly miserable. She realized that these Minnesota country roads had no respect for her polite experience on Long Island parkways. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> woman, not like a driver.|$|E
60|$|Silent, blushing, tousled by {{the hands}} of her decorators, Berrie {{permitted}} hats to be perched {{on her head and}} jackets buttoned and unbuttoned about her shoulders till <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> worn clothes-horse. Wayland beamed with delight, but she was far less satisfied than he; and when at last selection was made, she still had her doubts, not of the clothes, but of her ability to wear them. They seemed so alien to her, so restrictive and enslaving.|$|E
60|$|When Helena {{arrived home}} on the Thursday evening she found {{everything}} repulsive. All the odours of the sordid street through which she must pass hung about the pavement, having crept out in the heat. The house was bare and narrow. She remembered children sometimes to have brought her moths shut up in matchboxes. As she knocked at the door <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> numbed moth which a boy is pushing off its leaf-rest into his box.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to Time magazine: [...] "People {{misunderstood}} that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-à-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. I said he was being treated <b>like</b> <b>a</b> black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race." [...] In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> American for the first time. She said, [...] "I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> kid." ...|$|R
5000|$|Srsen also {{explained}} that the album is about a transformative experience in her life that followed the ending of a long-term relationship. She states that [...] "there was a little moment where I fell into a toxic, dysfunctional time" [...] {{that resulted in a}} learning process whereby <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> [...] "adult" [...] afterwards. During the creation process for the album, Srsen was influenced by American academic Joseph Campbell, mythology and Balkan folk music. Srsen also revealed that she is most comfortable in [...] "bare" [...] aesthetic surroundings and, in relation to the writing period for All Day Venus: [...] "I’m very simple and I <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lot of space and calm. But I seem to just stumble upon things quite passively." ...|$|R
60|$|Mechanically she {{followed}} Chauvelin {{down the corridor}} and along the passages which she had traversed a brief half-hour ago. From some distant church tower a clock tolled the hour of ten. It had then really only been little more than thirty brief minutes since first she had entered this grim building, which seemed less stony than the monsters who held authority within it; to her it seemed that centuries had gone over her head during that time. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old woman, unable to straighten her back or to steady her limbs; she could only dimly see some few paces ahead the trim figure of Chauvelin walking with measured steps, his hands held behind his back, his head thrown up {{with what looked like}} triumphant defiance.|$|R
6000|$|That {{gave her}} a blank sense of actual loss. She had lived in dreams and he in realities. Right now she could not dispel her dream--see and {{understand}} all that he seemed to. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child, then, growing old swiftly. The strange past longing for a mother surged up in her like a strong tide. Some one to lean on, some one who loved her, some one to help her in this hour when fatality knocked {{at the door of}} her youth--how she needed that! ...|$|E
60|$|Nelly {{swallowed}} the cold drops and caught her breath, for a dreadful pain shot through {{her from her}} head to her feet, while the mermaids chanted some strange words and waved their hands over her. It was gone in an instant, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cork floating on the water. She wondered, till glancing down she saw that her little white legs were changed to a fish's tail of many colors, which gently steered her along as the waves rippled against her breast.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great {{criminal}} {{and a great}} fool; {{at the same time}} she was vexed with the stupid child which she had meant so well by, and indignant with Mrs. Bolton, whose flight with it had somehow implied a reproach of her behaviour. When she could govern herself, she went out to Mrs. Bolton's room, where she found the little one quiet enough, and Mrs. Bolton tying on the long apron in which she cleared up the dinner and washed the dishes.|$|E
60|$|In September the Old Lady {{looked back}} on the summer and owned to herself {{that it had been}} a strangely happy one, with Sundays and Sewing Circle days {{standing}} out like golden punctuation marks in a poem of life. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> utterly different woman; and other people thought her different also. The Sewing Circle women found her so pleasant, and even friendly, that they began to think they had misjudged her, and that perhaps it was eccentricity after all, and not meanness, which accounted for her peculiar mode of living. Sylvia Gray always came and talked to her on Circle afternoons now, and the Old Lady treasured every word she said in her heart and repeated them over and over to her lonely self in the watches of the night.|$|R
25|$|Von Mahlsdorf {{was born}} Lothar Berfelde, to parents Max Berfelde and Gretchen Gaupp in Berlin-Mahlsdorf, Germany. At {{a very young}} age <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> girl, and {{expressed}} more interest in the clothing and articles of little girls. She helped a second-hand goods dealer clear out the apartments of deported Jews and sometimes kept items.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with {{the warmth of his}} kiss upon it, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{moisture}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tear.|$|R
