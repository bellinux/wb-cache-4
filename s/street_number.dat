He was married to Nazmiye Hanım (surname: Türe, death 1951) and had two daughters, Semiha Hanım (1896–1950) and Memduha Hanım (1904–1970). Semiha Hanım was married to Hüseyin Pasha, Memduha Hanım was married to Major General Eşref Alpdoğan (1327-P. 19). Some {{researchers}} including Uğur Mumcu confused him with the Governor of the Fourth Inspectorate-General Lieutenant General Hüseyin Abdullah Alpdoğan (1310-P. 12).|$|E

25|$|For example, {{suppose we}} wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an {{expensive}} district (house No. 1000). A simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th <b>street</b> <b>number</b> along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly {{along the length of}} the street, representing all of these districts. (Note that if we always start at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows are}} mullioned and transomed, with {{originally}} {{eight or ten}} lights. The mullions and transoms are in wood and have ovolo mouldings with narrow fillets. Two eight-light windows are believed to date from the 17th century. The High Street bays have modern shop windows to the ground floor. The visible beams are ovolo moulded and feature brattishing, a form of decorative cresting. There is a slate roof, although like the other rebuilt merchants' houses on the High <b>Street,</b> <b>number</b> 46 probably originally had a tiled rather than thatched roof, a sign of wealth that was also an effective protection against the fires that destroyed parts of Hospital Street and Welsh Row in the 17th century. The timber frame uses soffit tenons with diminished haunch, a particularly high-quality type of carpentry joint invented early in the 16th century.|$|E

Initially named [...] Alberto Henschel & Cia, the studio became Photographia Allemã (German Photography), next changing to a new address on the Matriz de Santo Antônio square, number 2. Because {{he was able to}} build up his business quickly when he came, it is assumed that Henschel was already an experienced photographer and intended to build a promising business in photography in this new market that was still so little explored.|$|E
500|$|In 1870, Henschel opened another {{subsidiary}} of his atelier, {{this time in}} Rio de Janeiro, on Ourives street (nowadays Miguel Couto <b>street,</b> <b>number</b> 40). It was in Rio, capital of the Empire, where he started his prosperous partnership with Francisco Benque. With the name of Henschel & Benque, it specialized in the production and marketing of portraits, [...] landscapes, and [...] the photopaintings made by Karl Ernst Papf, whose presence in Brazil was due to Henschel.

2500|$|When {{the city}} of Atlanta was {{converting}} Centennial Olympic Stadium into a new baseball stadium, many local residents hoped the stadium would be named for Hank Aaron. When the stadium was instead named Turner Field (after Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner), a section of Capitol Avenue running past the stadium was renamed Hank Aaron Drive. The stadium's <b>street</b> <b>number</b> is 755, after Aaron's total number of home runs; the 755 <b>street</b> <b>number</b> was retained for Turner Field's replacement, SunTrust Park. In April 1997, a new baseball facility for the AA Mobile Bay Bears constructed in Aaron's hometown of Mobile, Alabama was named Hank Aaron Stadium. Georgia State University acquired Turner Field and its surrounding parking lots in 2017, and university officials {{plan to build a}} new baseball park on the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium site, incorporating the left field wall where Aaron hit his record-breaking home run.|$|E

2500|$|In America in {{the late}} 1960s, {{graffiti}} {{was used as a}} form of expression by political activists. Gangs such as the Savage Skulls, La Familia, and Savage Nomads used graffiti to mark territory. JULIO 204 was a Puerto Rican graffiti writer, one of the first graffiti writers in New York City. He {{was a member of the}} [...] "Savage Skulls" [...] gang, and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as 1968. In 1971 the New York Times published an article ("'Taki 183' Spawns Pen Pals") about another graffiti writer with similar form, TAKI 183. According to the article Julio had been writing for a couple of years when Taki began tagging his own name all around the city. Taki also states in the article that Julio [...] "was busted and stopped." [...] Writers following in the wake of Taki and Tracy 168 would add their <b>street</b> <b>number</b> to their nickname, [...] "bomb" [...] (cover) a train with their work, and let the subway take it—and their fame, if it was impressive, or simply pervasive, enough—"all city". Julio 204 never rose to Taki's fame because Julio kept his tags localized to his own neighborhood.|$|E
