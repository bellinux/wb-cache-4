40|$|Abstract [...] A new {{mixed signal}} {{integrated}} circuit (IC) for frontend readout electronics of position sensitive solid state detectors has been developed. It is called RENA- 2 {{and can be}} used for readout of position sensitive solid state detectors such as CdTe, CdZnTe, Ge, GaAs, HgI 2, PbI 2, Se and Si <b>strip,</b> <b>pad</b> and pixel detectors, with large numbers of channels. It is designed to have very low noise and, therefore, high energy resolution. It has numerous possible applications in astrophysics, medical and industrial imaging, security such as baggage inspection and nuclear physics. The RENA- 2 chip is a monolithic integrated circuit and has 36 channels with low noise, high input impedance charge sensitive amplifiers. The RENA- 2 chip can be optimized for individual applications. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} pixel {{detectors}} has grown strongly {{in recent years}} through progress in CMOS technology, which permits many hundreds of transistors to be implemented {{in an area of}} 50 - 200 um 2. Pulse processing electronics with noise of the order of 100 e- RMS permits to distinguish photons of a few keV from background noise. Techniques are under development, which should allow single chip systems (area ~ 1 cm 2) to be extended to larger areas. This paper gives an introduction into the concept of quantum imaging using direct conversion in segmented semiconductor arrays. An overview of projects from this domain using <b>strip,</b> <b>pad</b> and in particular hybrid pixel detectors will be presented. One of these projects, the Medipix project, is described in more detail. The effect of different correction methods like threshold adjustment and flat field correction is illustrated and new measurement results and images presented...|$|E

30|$|To detect PCT by LFIA, the {{sandwich}} scheme of analysis was applied (Fig.  1). The specific antibodies were immobilized {{in the test}} zone of the analytical membrane, and the conjugate pad was impregnated with the paired detection antibodies labeled with gold nanoparticles. The application of the solution containing the antigen to the test <b>strip</b> (sample <b>pad)</b> resulted in the binding of paired antibodies labeled with gold nanoparticles to PCT in the sample to form labeled antigen–antibody complex. This complex moved by capillary forces through the area containing the test zone, wherein the labeled complex attached to the immobilized specific antibodies and formed a sandwich complex. This sandwich complex may be observed as a colored band, and the color intensity of the band was directly proportional to PCT concentration in the samples.|$|R

The frequency, amplitude and pulse duty cycle were changed. The strip resistance {{was measured by the}} four-terminal method, the resistance of the contact between <b>strips</b> and <b>pads</b> using the three-terminal method.

40|$|We are {{developing}} CMOS circuits for readout of interpolating cathode <b>strip</b> and <b>pad</b> chambers for the GEM experiment at the SSC. Because these detectors require position resolution of about 1 % {{of the strip}} pitch, the electronic noise level must be less than 2000 electrons. Several test chips have been fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving the combination of low noise, speed, and wide dynamic range in CMOS. Results to date show satisfactory noise and linearity performance. Future development will concentrate on radiation-hardening the central tracker ASIC design, optimizing the shaper peaking time and noise contribution, providing more user-configurable output options, and packaging and test issues.

Urine test strips {{are one of the}} most commonly used POCT tools, however their manual interpretation can be challenging, particularly for the elderlies and people with eye disorders. In this study, we propose a smartphone application designed to automatically perform semi-quantitative colorimetric analysis on urine strips by using just one image of the strip, placed on a specially designed reference card. Virtually no shooting restrictions apply while the system is able to adapt to different smartphones and varying ambient light conditions. For the detection of the card, we match ORB keypoints between the captured image and the reference card in memory, and use RANSAC to calculate the projective transform. Then, the <b>strip’s</b> rectangular <b>pads</b> are precisely detected and their chromaticity CIELUV components are compared to the manufacturer’s reference after being corrected using SVM regression. We tested the application on the analysis of pH values, using three different smartphones on various lighting conditions and obtained promising results that prove its concept.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the technology of position sensitive silicon detectors and the corresponding electronics allow the construction of fast time response thermal neutron detectors. These detectors also exhibit excellent position resolution and good efficiency by combination of Silicon sensors with Gadolinium converter foils. The neutron detection {{is based on the}} (n,y) reaction in Gd which produces a quite complex conversion electron spectra with significant energy lines between 29 keV and about 200 keV, which can be detected in the Si sensors. Due to the high absorption cross section of Gd the converter can be made very thin. Hence the range of the conversion electrons is sufficient to reach the Si-sensor. This thin converter together with the short charge collection time in Si ensures the good time resolution of the device. We constructed several one- and two-dimensional prototype detectors, using DC and AC coupled silicon <b>strip</b> detectors, <b>pad</b> detectors and different VLSI readout electronics.
