25|$|Silk moths {{lay eggs}} on {{specially}} prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh mulberry leaves. After about 35 days and 4 moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched and {{are ready to}} begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over the tray of caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in sericin, a water-soluble protective gum, and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2–3 days, the caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to metamorphose into moths to breed {{the next generation of}} caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the sericin holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since a <b>single</b> <b>thread</b> is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a <b>single</b> <b>thread</b> of silk.|$|E
25|$|Cotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type {{of cotton}} that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is {{composed}} of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a <b>single</b> <b>thread.</b> The yarn is spun {{so that it is}} compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now Lille), hence its name.|$|E

When a <b>single</b> <b>threaded</b> application is running, the CPU can turn {{off one of}} its cores and overclock the active core. In this way the CPU maintains the same Thermal Profile as it would when both cores are active. Santa Rosa performs well as a mobile gaming platform due to its ability to switch between <b>single</b> <b>threaded</b> and multithreaded tasks. Other power savings come from an Enhanced Sleep state where both the CPU cores and the chipset will power down.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} IEEE 754 standard, however, {{failed to}} recommend operations to handle such sets of arithmetic exception flag bits. So while these were implemented in hardware, initially programming language implementations typically {{did not provide}} a means to access them (apart from assembler). Over time some programming language standards (e.g., C99/C11 and Fortran) have been updated to specify methods to access and change status flag bits. The 2008 version of the IEEE 754 standard now specifies a few operations for accessing and handling the arithmetic flag bits. The programming model {{is based on a}} <b>single</b> <b>thread</b> of execution and use of them by multiple threads has to be handled by a means outside of the standard (e.g. C11 specifies that the flags have thread-local storage).|$|E
25|$|Silk is {{produced}} year-round in Thailand by {{two types of}} silkworms, the cultured Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the rice harvest in the southern and northeastern parts of the country. Women traditionally weave silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to their daughters, as weaving {{is considered to be}} a sign of maturity and eligibility for marriage. Thai silk textiles often use complicated patterns in various colours and styles. Most regions of Thailand have their own typical silks. A <b>single</b> <b>thread</b> filament is too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a reeling machine for this task, but some silk threads are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.|$|E

500|$|Mature female bolas spiders of {{the genus}} Mastophora build [...] "webs" [...] that consist of only a single [...] "trapeze line", which they patrol. They also {{construct}} a bolas made of a <b>single</b> <b>thread,</b> tipped with a large ball of very wet sticky silk. They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths, and then swing the bolas at the moths. Although they miss on about 50% of strikes, they catch about the same weight of insects per night as web-weaving spiders of similar size. The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes, rest for a while, and then make new bolas. Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas. Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies, and catch them with their front pairs of legs.|$|E
500|$|In 1842, Doubling Mill and Fireproof Mill {{were built}} {{on the corner of}} Redhill Street and Bengal Street. Doubling Mill is five storeys high with an engine house {{designed}} to contain a 40hp beam engine. Doubling Mill was used for doubling – the process of combining two or more lengths of yarn into a <b>single</b> <b>thread</b> – cotton produced in the company's earlier mills, giving the mill its name. Fireproof Mill, again as its name suggests, was designed to be fireproof by using cast-iron beams and columns rather than timber; it was the first mill in the mill complex to have been built to resist fire. The mill is four storeys high and may have been used as a warehouse. The two new mills were also linked to the original complex by tunnels under Bengal Street. The firm [...] "doubled more or less" [...] in size during the early to mid nineteenth century and expanded into the fine yarn markets around Nottingham, the growth of the firm {{led to the creation of}} the Doubling and Fireproof Mills.|$|E

In the parallel version we were decoding the video on an additional parallel thread with the main thread empty or partially utilized with user interface tasks that cannot be executed in parallel. We measured the performance in desktop web browsers and on the ten most common mobile devices on the market. We evaluated the effect of parallelism on the decoding and rendering speed. We show that parallelism improves performance when the main thread executes heavy tasks related to the user interface. In the case when the main thread's load is fully offloaded to the parallel thread the performance does not improve...|$|R

Future CMPs must deliver thread-level parallelism when software provides threads to run, but must also continue to deliver performance gains for <b>single</b> <b>threads</b> by exploiting instructionlevel parallelism and memory-level parallelism. However, power limitations will prevent conventional cores from exploiting both simultaneously. This work presents the Forwardflow Architecture, which can scale its execution logic up to run <b>single</b> <b>threads,</b> or down to run multiple threads in a CMP. Forwardflow dynamically builds an explicit internal dataflow representation from a conventional instruction set architecture, using forward dependence pointers to guide instruction wakeup, selection, and issue. Forwardflow’s backend is organized into discrete units that can be individually (de-) activated, allowing each core’s performance to be scaled by system software at the architectural level. On <b>single</b> <b>threads,</b> Forwardflow core scaling yields a mean runtime reduction of 21 % for a 37 % increase in power consumption.
