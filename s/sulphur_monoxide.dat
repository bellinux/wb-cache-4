40|$|Many sulphur-bearing {{species have}} been {{detected}} in different astronomical environments and have allowed to derive important information about the chemical and physical composition of interstellar regions. In particular, these species have also been showed to trace and probe hot-core environment time evolution. Among the most prominent sulphur-bearing molecules, SO, <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> radical, {{is one of the}} more ubiquitous and abundant, observed also in its isotopic substituted species such as $^{ 34 }$SO and S$^{ 18 }$O. Due to the importance of this simple diatomic system and to face the challenge of modern radioastronomical facilities, an extension to THz range of the rare isotopologues of <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> has been performed. High-resolution rotational molecular spectroscopy has been employed to extend the available dataset of four isotopic species, SO, $^{ 34 }$SO, S$^{ 17 }$O, and S$^{ 18 }$O up to the 1. 5 THz region. The frequency coverage and the spectral resolution of our measurements allowed a better constraint of the molecular constants of the four species considered, focusing especially for the two oxygen substituted isotopologues. Our measurements were also employed in an isotopically invariant fit including all available pure rotational and ro-vibrational transitions for all SO isotopologues, thus enabling accurate predictions for rotational transitions at higher frequencies. Comparison with recent works performed on the same system are also provided, showing the quality of our experiment and the improvement of the datasets for all the species here considered. Transition frequencies for this system can now be used with confidence by the astronomical community well into the THz spectral region. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, to be published in Ap...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{have been}} made of the 5 6 - 4 5 high {{excitation}} rotational transition of <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> in the Orion -KL region.

Chemical kinetic models have been used to investigate the chemistry of sulfur in particular on how the SO/SO 2 ratio varies as a function of sulfur depletion and on the initial C/O ratio. A link has been found between SO/SO 2 and C/O and the data is consistent with a depletion of gas-phase oxygen. In the Orion plateau source, however, enhanced abundances of both SO and SO 2 may be caused by an oxygen-rich molecular outflow but are certainly not explained by cold cloud chemistry or by shock chemistry. In addition, a methanol line and an unidentified line appear in the Orion data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{extended}} our study of <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> towards other less opaque cirrus cores and have clearly detected 3 out of 6 sources observed, for the Draco cloud, LVC- 127 + 20, and MBM 32. We find {{for at least}} one further cloud (MBM 32) that SO is extended. Assuming that the lines are optically thin we derive column densities of about N(SO) = 510 12 cm − 2. Based on the visual extinction estimates we derive abundances X(SO) = 2 10 − 9, thus again higher than can be predicted by chemical models with standard assumptions on a low initial S abundance in the gas phase. Our new observations therefore confirm our previous conclusion, that in cirrus clouds sulphur must be essentially undepleted to explain the amount of SO detected. For MCLD 126. 6 + 24. 5 we present an analysis of our extensive SO (NJ = 10 → 01) mapping. The SO emission reveal...|$|E
40|$|The flash vacuum {{thermolysis}} and photolysis of {{a number}} of cyclic sulphones have been studied with a view to developing these reactions as possible synthetic processes. A number of 2 - substituted thietan sulphones have been shown to give the appropriately substituted cyclopropanes in high yields. The corresponding reactions of 3 -substituted theitan sulphones are not quite so clean however, and a number of products are formed. Attempts have been made to synthesise sulphoximides based on the thiochroman nucleus; however, without success. The flash thermolyses of thiochroman- 4 -one sulphones have been studied. The products of these reactions are generally ?,?- unsaturated ketones, and the mechanism has been probed by deuterium labelling experiments. The flash thermolyses of some substituted ?-sultines have been studied in detail. Generally, sulphur dioxide is extruded and the products are derived from the remaining biradical species. In one case however, one of the products is derived from a loss of <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> from the starting material. The conformational equilibria of various cis and trans 3 -substituted thietan 1 -oxides have been studied using n. m. r. spectroscopy and a lanthanide shift reagent technique.

40|$|The {{assignment}} {{and analysis of}} high resolution spectra of transient species in the gas phase leads to the unambiguous identification of the carrier of the spectra. Such spectra can only be observed provided a detectable steady state concentration, depending on the particular spectroscopic technique being employed, can be generated. The {{first half of this}} thesis is concerned with three methods of producing detectable concentrations by utilising (i) microwave discharge, (ii) electrical discharge, (iii) carbon dioxide laser photolysis with an associated photosensitiser, sulphur hexafluoride. The high resolution electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of iodine and fluorine atoms and the <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> and nitrogen difluoride radicals serve as examples of species produced by these methods and some characteristics of the laser photolysis technique are described in Chapter IV.

40|$|Some well-studied Herbig Haro objects have {{associated}} with them one or more cold, dense, and quiescent clumps of gas. We propose that such clumps near an HH object {{can be used as}} a general measure of clumpiness in the molecular cloud that contains that HH object. Our aim is to make a survey of clumps around a sample of HH objects, and to use the results to make an estimate of the clumpiness in molecular clouds. All known cold, dense, and quiescent clumps near HH objects are anomalously strong HCO+ emitters. Our method is, therefore, to search for strong HCO+ emission as an indicator of a clump near to an HH object. The searches were made using JCMT and SEST in the HCO+ 3 - 2 and also H 13 CO+ 1 - 0 lines, with some additional searches for methanol and <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> lines. The sources selected were a sample of 22 HH objects in which no previous HCO+ emission had been detected. We find that half of the HH objects have clumps detected in the HCO+ 3 - 2 line and that all searches in H 13 CO$+ 1 - 0 lines show evidence of clumpiness. All condensations have narrow linewidths and are evidently unaffected dynamically by the HH jet shock. We conclude that the molecular clouds in which these HH objects are found must be highly heterogeneous on scales of less than 0. 1 pc. An approximate calculation based on these results suggests that the area filling factor of clumps affected by HH objects is on the order of 10 %. These clumps have gas number densities larger than 3 e 4 cm- 2. Comment: 11 pages, 14 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|E
40|$|Results from submm/mm radio astronomical observations, {{using the}} astronomy/-aeronomy {{satellite}} Odin and the 20 m telescope at the Onsala Space Observatory, are presented. Analysis of spectroscopic data of interstellar rotational emission lines from gaseous H 2 O residing in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), reveal important new {{clues about the}} chemistry and spatial distribution of water molecules in these regions, including estimates of the water abundance in molecular outflows associated with massive star formation. In an extensive study of the DR 21 GMC, involving a multitude of molecular lines, {{it is argued that}} spatial variations in the emission from a multiply split rotational transition of the cyanogen radical (CN), reflect differences in the excitational context which governs the level populations in the rotational states. It is further argued that this reflects variations in the general physical conditions across the region. Together with observations of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) isotopologues, the CN mapping data are also interpreted to delineate regions of increased photochemical activity. Results from uniquely sensitive Odin searches {{in a number of different}} Milky Way molecular clouds, for the 2. 5 mm line from the ground state transition of molecular oxygen, have been analysed and used to calculate new, lower upper limits to the interstellar molecular oxygen abundance (all O 2 observations yet have resulted in non-detections). A study based on observations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> (SO) isotopologues indicates that the elemental oxygen isotopic ratio, 16 O/ 18 O, is much lower than previously thought in the interior of massive star forming regions, probably as a result of 18 O-enriched ejected material from earlier generations of massive stars being returned to and mixed with the local ISM. This result may have implications for analyses relying on observations of other isotopically substituted oxygen bearing molecules, such as H 2 18 O and C 18 O (commonly used to estimate total gas column densities) ...|$|E
40|$|Sulphur-bearing {{volatiles}} {{are observed}} {{to be significantly}} depleted in interstellar and circumstellar regions. This missing sulphur is postulated to be mostly locked up in refractory form. With ALMA we have detected <b>sulphur</b> <b>monoxide</b> (SO), a known shock tracer, in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk. Two rotational transitions: J= 7 _ 7 - 6 _ 6 (301. 286 GHz) and J= 7 _ 8 - 6 _ 7 (304. 078 GHz) are detected in their respective integrated intensity maps. The stacking of these transitions results in a clear 5 σ detection in the stacked line profile. The emission is compact but is spectrally resolved and the line profile has two components. One component peaks at the source velocity {{and the other is}} blue-shifted by 5 km s^- 1. The kinematics and spatial distribution of the SO emission are not consistent with that expected from a purely Keplerian disk. We detect additional blue-shifted emission that we attribute to a disk wind. The disk component was simulated using LIME and a physical disk structure. The disk emission is asymmetric and best fit by a wedge of emission in the north east region of the disk coincident with a `hot-spot' observed in the CO J= 3 - 2 line. The favoured hypothesis is that a possible inner disk warp (seen in CO emission) directly exposes the north-east side of the disk to heating by the central star, creating locally the conditions to launch a disk wind. Chemical models of a disk wind will help to elucidate why the wind is particularly highlighted in SO emission and whether a refractory source of sulphur is needed. An alternative explanation is that the SO is tracing an accretion shock from a circumplanetary disk associated with the proposed protoplanet embedded in the disk at 50 au. We also report a non-detection of SO in the protoplanetary disk around HD 97048. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A on 12 / 12 / 1...|$|E

CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure is independently associated with admission in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction population...|$|R
