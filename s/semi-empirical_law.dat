Existence of such effective distribution implies {{that not all}} clasts participate to the permeable network resisting to gas flow and that clasts smaller than the minimal effective size are elutriated.

The presence of an experimentally calibrated constant and the necessary absence of segregation during fluidization limit the extrapolation of the proposed law to any pyroclastic bed.

The following parameters were varied, in order to assess their influence on wettability: a) exposure time; b) air flow rate; c) voltage. Among the parameters studied, the most important in determining the wettability was the treatment time. The air flow rate and voltage were far less effective, despite each of these parameters was allowed to vary within a quite large range. The variation in the wettability with exposure time followed a trend well described by a sigmoidal curve: negligible variations in the treated surface were recorded within the first three minutes, whereas the wettability strongly increased afterwards, achieving its maximum value after about five minutes. Tests were also performed to verify the stability of the treatment after exposure in air at ambient temperature. To this aim, the variation of wettability after the treatment was measured at predefined time intervals. It was found that the effect of plasma exposure is rapidly loosen, with the wettability coming back to the original untreated value within about 15 min. The experimental data showed that the characteristic time of decay depends on both the air flow rate and the voltage used during the plasma treatment. In particular, higher voltages and gas flow rates result in longer decay times. A <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>law,</b> assuming an exponential decay of the wettability with time, was assesse...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{that accounts for}} the isothermal drying process of hardened cement-based materials. It constitutes a further development of previous works. The equations of isothermal drying are derived (i) from mass balance equations written for the liquid water phase, water vapour and dry air, (ii) from the Fick's law governing the relative diffusion process of water vapour and dry air to the gaseous mixture, and (iii) from the Darcy's law describing the transport of wet air and liquid water. Intrinsic liquid water (Kl) and gas (Kg) permeabilities are distinguished, since the concept of intrinsic permeability, which is independent of the fluid nature, is not relevant for a cementitious material. New laws for gas transfers are introduced according to measurements on concrete specimens. Thus, a <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>law</b> gives the effective diffusion coefficient of water vapour vs. porosity and degree of liquid water saturation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{classical}} {{theory of}} elasticity and plasticity {{does not recognize}} explicitly {{the existence of a}} "transition zone" between elastic and plastic states, which instead, makes extensive use of ad-hoc, <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>laws,</b> such as yield conditions, at the "yield surface" to match both the extreme states. In the present investigation, it is shown that these ad-hoc, <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>laws</b> turn out to be totally unnecessary if one appreciates the existence of a "transition zone" introduced by Seth in recent years, which is quite realistic {{from the point of view}} of physical considerations. A transition phenomenon, being an asymptotic one, should be dealt with as a limiting process, and so the transition state should be obtainable from the basic system of equations characterizing the elastic state as a limiting case. The plastic state is similarly to be obtained from the transition state when a certain parameter is made to approach zero. In order to appreciate the existence of a transition state, it is basically important at the outset to identify the "transition points" from the differential system which characterizes the physical phenomenon. It is examined in this thesis how and in what manner transition is to be understood in the case of physical phenomena. It is found that there are three ways in which a transition could be identified analytically: at transition, the differential system characterizing the elastic state should attain some criticality, the complete breakdown of the macroscopic structure at transition should correspond to the degeneracy of the material or spatial strain ellipsoid, if we consider the plastic state as an image of the elastic state, then at transition the Jacobian of transformation is bound to behave singularly. The last condition turns out to be the most general one from which a general yield condition is deduced and it is found that most of the yield conditions present in current literature come out as special cases. Also, it has been seen that our results take into account Bauschinger's effect, while neither Tresca's yield condition nor von- Mises yield condition does. It has also been shown that transition fields naturally being non-linear in character, are sub-harmonic (super-harmonic) fields. Once one recognizes the "transition zone" as a separate state, the natural question of determining the constitutive equation also arises. In order to answer this question and to illustrate the procedure, four problems of practical interest are discussed in detail. The problems of elastic-plastic transition of shells and tubes subjected to external pressure are solved. Further, by considering the effect of a steady state temperature, the problems of thermo-elastic-plastic transition of shells and tubes are also solved. No yield conditions have been assumed. It is found that if they exist, they come out of the differential system as a consequence of the transition analysis. Some of the results have been compared with those of the classical theory. Possible scope of future work, where the transition concept may be profitably exploited, has also been discussed...|$|R

We define in this paper the parameters of a possible solution taking advantage of an early separation scheme optionally supplemented by a weak crab crossing.

This concept offers high performance for a moderate increase of complexity. An open issue {{is the possibility of}} integrating dipoles inside the detectors. MOTIVATION & CONCEPT Increasing the beam intensity in the LHC is extremely challenging. We rather investigate here the potential of increasing the focusing of the beam at the crossing point (IP). It indeed only requires a localized modification of the machine with the potential of a fast and reliable increase of performance. To prevent parasitic beam interactions in the common sections, the crossing angle shall however increase with the focusing, cancelling {{the best part of the}} performance improvement. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the use of an early separation scheme [1] that may optionally be backed by a weak crab crossing scheme [2]. A long-range wire or electron lens compensation may further reduce the required residual crossing angle. It has been shown [3] that this class of solution offers a large luminosity increase. Two solutions are studied here for two distances l * of the triplet from the IP (23 and 13 m) and the planned ultimate bunch charge.

There {{is no doubt that}} melt is thermodynamically stable and present in the LAB, but how they can impact on mantle electrical conductivity remains debated. In addition, gravitational segregation and fast melt upwelling, being expected if melt fraction exceeds 2 vol. %, is thought to seriously restrict the role of partial melting {{at the level of the}} LAB. Petrological studies realized some 30 years ago have shown that peridotites exposed at the P-T-fO 2 conditions of the LAB produced H 2 O and CO 2 rich-melts. The segregation of such melts is not expected since they constitute only about 0. 5 vol. % of the peridotite, but electrical conductivities of these melts are poorly known. Therefore, electrical conductivity experiments have been performed in piston cylinder on H 2 O-CO 2 rich melts. Different melt compositions have been explored, from carbonated melts to basalts. The effects of chemical compositions and volatiles on these melts have been determined. The electrical conductivity measurements have shown that hydrous carbonated melts are very conductive, and the incorporation of basalt decreases the conductivity. With these new data, a <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>law</b> predicting the conductivity as a function of H 2 O and CO 2 contents has been produced. Based on this law and the electrical conductivity of olivine, 1 D conductivity profiles were constructed. With these profiles, the effect of volatiles content (partitioned between the melt and in the solids), melt fractions (mixing law and interconnection of the melt) and different temperature regimes on conductivity are discussed. These calculations are conducted on oceanic and continental settings with different ages.

In the case of an isolated single resonance, the problem is homothetic to the so-called Berk-Breizman (BB) problem, which is an extension of the classic bump-on-tail electrostatic problem, including external damping to a thermal plasma, and collisions. A semi-Lagrangian simulation code, COBBLES, is developed to solve the initial-value BB problem. The nonlinear behavior of instabilities in experimentally-relevant conditions is categorized into steady-state, periodic, chaotic, and frequency-sweeping (chirping) regimes. The chaotic regime is shown to extend into a linearly stable region, and a mechanism for such subcritical instabilities is proposed.

In each drift different sections have been instrumented to monitor the hydro-mechanical behavior of the rock mass formation. Continuous monitoring of the excavated zone around the drifts in the main level (- 490 m) revealed the development of a fractured zone (extensional and shear fractures) induced by the excavation. The extent of this fractured zone depends on the drift orientation regarding the in-situ stress field. Accordingly, the convergence measurements showed an anisotropic closure which depends also on the drifts’ orientations. Moreover, marked overpressures and an anisotropic pore pressure field around the drifts have been also observed. The approach proposed in this work is mainly based on a direct analysis of the convergence measurements, for studying the anisotropic response of the rock formation during and after excavation. The convergence evolution is analyzed {{on the basis of the}} <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>law</b> proposed by Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. The monitoring and analysis of convergence data can provide a reliable approach of the interaction between rock mass and support. Therefore, the anisotropy and the variability of the closure are analyzed taking into account different field cases: drifts excavated in two different orientations (i. e. influence of the initial stress state), different methods, sizes and rates of excavation and different supports systems with different conditions of installation. This broad range of cases permits to refine the analysis for reliable predictions of the convergence evolution in the long term. This approach can thus be used for the design of various types of support and the evaluation of its performance in the long term. On the other hand, the pore pressure evolution induced by excavation of drifts as recorded in situ has been analyzed. The anisotropic response observed in-situ suggests that the intrinsic anisotropy of the material plays a key role in the response of the rock formation. To understand these phenomena, an anisotropic poroelastic analysis of the pore pressure evolution induced by the drift excavation is performed. The main goal is to simulate the main trends of the pore pressure evolution with a simple model taking into account the inherent anisotropy of the material. Finally, an analysis of the onset of failure shows the key role of the hydro-mechanical coupling on the extension of the failed zone around the driftsL'Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs (Andra) a commencé en 2000 la construction du Laboratoire Souterrain de Meuse / Haute-Marne (LS-M/HM) avec l'objectif principal de démontrer la faisabilité d’un stockage géologique dans l’argilite du Callovo-Oxfordien. Un réseau de galeries expérimentales a été excavé, principalement en suivant les directions des contraintes horizontales (majeure et mineure), avec des variations sur : la méthode d'excavation, la géométrie de la structure et le soutènement. Chaque galerie a été instrumentée en différentes sections pour suivre le comportement hydromécanique de la roche face à l’excavation. Le suivi de la zone autour des galeries excavées au niveau principal (- 490 m) a révélé le développement d'une zone fracturée (fractures en extension et en cisaillement) induite par l'excavation. La distribution de la zone fracturée dépend à la fois de l'orientation de la galerie et du champ de contraintes in-situ et a une influence importante sur la déformation des galeries. En effet, les mesures de convergence ont montré une fermeture anisotrope de la section de la galerie. De plus, il a été observé un champ de distribution anisotrope de la pression de pores ainsi que des surpressions autour des galeries. Afin d’analyser la réponse anisotrope du massif pendant l’excavation et après celle-ci, les travaux effectués dans le cadre de la thèse sont axés principalement sur une étude directe des mesures de convergence in-situ. Cette analyse s’effectue à l’aide de la loi semi-empirique proposée par Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. A cet égard, différentes galeries excavées dans le LS-M/HM ont été étudiées. Ces galeries présentent certaines différences dans leurs orientations et l’état initial des contraintes, dans la méthode et la vitesse d’excavation ainsi que dans les diamètres de la section et les types de soutènements installées. Cette analyse permet d’obtenir des prédictions fiables de la convergence à long-terme, ce qui peut servir pour le dimensionnement et la prévision de la performance du soutènement à long-terme. En outre, nous avons étudié la réponse anisotrope du champ de pression interstitielle observée in-situ. Cette analyse est basée sur une approche poroélastique anisotrope. L’objectif principal est de reproduire qualitativement l’évolution de la pression des pores autour des galeries avec une approche simple qui prend en compte l’anisotropie intrinsèque du matériau. Enfin, une analyse de l’apparition de la rupture montre le rôle clé que joue le couplage hydromécanique dans l’extension de la zone fracturé...|$|E

40|$|Exploration of {{potential}} geothermal reservoirs: {{use of the}} chemical Na/Li geothermometer and lithium isotopes One of the major applications of water geochemistry in {{the exploration of the}} potential geothermal reservoirs involves estimation of their temperature using chemical and isotopic geothermometers. These tools are based on empirical or <b>semi-empirical</b> <b>laws</b> and commonly use data obtained from chemical and isotopic analyses of surface thermal waters. Unfortunately, the estimations of reservoir temperatures using these tools are not always concordant. The aim {{of this study is to}} better understand the use of the Na/Li geothermometer and more especially, the behavior of the lithium and its isotopes, which can result relevant and decisive tools in numerous cases to estimate or validate the temperature of the fluids in the geothermal reservoirs. By integrating new hydrothermal, geothermal and oil-field data, the three existing Na/Li thermometric equations are re-examined and a new equation relative to the seawater-basalt interaction processes is proposed. Fig. 1 - Molar sodium/lithium ratios as a function of deep temperature for seawater and fluids collected from hydrothermal systems, geothermal and oil fields and sedimentary basins Main Conclusions> In this study, the integration of more than 120 additional temperature and chemical data collected from world geothermal and oil fields, sedimentary basins, oceanic ridges, emerged rifts and island arcs, has allowed to confirm and refine the three existing Na/Li thermometric relationships. A new Na/Li thermometric relationship relative to the processes of seawater-basalt interaction occurring in the oceanic ridges and emerged rifts is proposed. For geothermal exploration, the deep temperatures estimated using these thermometric relationships will have to be compared, discussed and validated with those given by the other chemical and isotopic geothermometers. > The scarcity of the δ 7 Li values analyzed in the geothermal and oil-field fluids and the presently available data indicate that it is necessary to acquire additional data in bot...|$|R

The {{aim is to}} delimit the domain of validity of the major nanoelectrostatic models, and in particular to assess the influence of hydrogel chain mobility on ionic partition. We find that the widely used Gibbs-Donnan model greatly overestimates exclusion of the co-ion probes used. For low molecular weight probes, a much better fit is obtained by {{taking into account the}} electrostatics in the nanometric gel pores by means of the Poisson-Boltzmann framework; the fit is improved slightly when taking into account alginate chain mobility. For high molecular weight probes, we find it essential to take into account local gel deformation due to electrostatic repulsion between the flexible gel strands and the probe. This is achieved by combining Poisson-Boltzmann simulations with heterogeneous pore size distribution given by the Ogston model, or more simply and precisely, by applying a <b>semi-empirical</b> scaling <b>law</b> involving the ratio between Debye length and pore size...|$|R
