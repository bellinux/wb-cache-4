5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> her husband {{was going to leave}} her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E
25|$|Whilst Gregg's {{findings}} {{were met with}} praise in Australia, internationally his peers were not <b>so</b> <b>convinced.</b> British medical journal The Lancet wrote that {{he had failed to}} adequately prove his case, and it was not until Professor Oliver Lancaster of the University of Sydney proved the association between the rubella virus and congenital syndromes in infants was significant, that his research was accepted around the world.|$|E
25|$|The apostate Zaradusht then {{eventually}} {{made his way}} to Balkh (present day Afghanistan) where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. Vishtaspa), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians. Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681–683) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been Sabis) to the Magian religion.|$|E

5000|$|Second, Spilsbury {{said that}} this same Word <b>so</b> <b>convinces</b> the sinner of its truth that its leaven [...] "seasons and sweetens the whole man." [...] The Word {{operates}} like a [...] "fire that breaks forth and discovers itself" [...] with such clarity in [...] "such as have it," [...] that they delineate specific truths from that Word. A confession of faith consisting of particular doctrines naturally develops. Others so prepared [...] "come to {{one and the same}} mind and judgment in it." ...|$|R
25|$|ECT {{treatment}} of severely autistic children with violent, sometimes self-harming behaviour first began {{in parts of}} the US {{during the early years of}} 21st century. Each session reportedly alleviates symptoms for up to 10 days at a time, but it is not claimed as a cure. One practitioner, Charles Kellner, ECT director at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> ECT is effective and safe that he allowed a parent to witness a procedure and the BBC to record the intervention.|$|E
25|$|Bowie and Travis {{agree to}} share command on the 14th. On Feb.16, Ambrosio Rodriquez was warned by his wife's cousin from Laredo, and another warning came again on Feb. 18. Travis was still skeptical. On the 20th, Blas María Herrera from Seguin's own company {{reported}} that Santa Anna had crossed into Texas. Travis held a council {{that night at}} 9 p.m.. The story was told and the same verdict was reached, it couldn't be true. Local families began packing possessions, with intent to leave Béxar. About a dozen of Seguin's men were <b>so</b> <b>convinced,</b> that they requested to leave, in order to remove their families from Santa Anna's path.|$|E
25|$|After the {{evacuation}} of British and French soldiers from Dunkirk and the French surrender on 22 June 1940, Hitler mainly focused his energies {{on the possibility of}} invading the Soviet Union in the belief that the British, defeated on the continent and without European allies, would quickly come to terms. The Germans were <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> of an imminent armistice that they began constructing street decorations for the homecoming parades of victorious troops. Although the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, and certain elements of the British public favoured a negotiated peace with an ascendant Germany, Churchill and a majority of his Cabinet refused to consider an armistice. Instead, Churchill used his skilful rhetoric to harden public opinion against capitulation and to prepare the British for a long war.|$|E

Nor will I try to. Besides, the man is consigned to the living death of life- long imprisonment in the pest-house. You know the beastly hole it is. He loves the dog. He's mad over it. Let him have it. I tell you it's rotten unfair and cruel, and I won't stand for it." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{second trial}} began January 11, 1922, {{with a new}} jury, but with the same legal defense and {{prosecution}} {{as well as the}} same presiding judge. The same evidence was presented, but this time one of the witnesses, Zey Prevon, testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former security guard named Jesse Norgard, who worked at Culver Studios where Arbuckle worked, testified that Arbuckle had once shown up at the studio and offered him a cash bribe in exchange for the key to Rappe's dressing room. The comedian supposedly said he wanted it to play a joke on the actress. Norgard said he refused to give him the key. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was called into question when he was revealed to be an ex-convict who was currently charged with sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and who was also looking for a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. Further, in contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door: Heinrich took back his earlier testimony from the first trial and testified that the fingerprint evidence was likely faked. The defense was <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> of an acquittal that Arbuckle was not called to testify. Arbuckle's lawyer, McNab, made no closing argument to the jury. However, some jurors interpreted the refusal to let Arbuckle testify as a sign of guilt. After over 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned February 3, deadlocked with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, resulting in another mistrial.|$|E
500|$|The crash {{serves as}} a central plot element in the Mad Men season 2 episode, [...] "Flight 1" [...] (episode 2). The father of the {{character}} Pete Campbell {{is one of the}} passengers killed. Later in the episode, accounts man Duck Phillips is so determined to sign American as an account and <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> of Pete's ambition, that he recruits Pete specifically to woo American, while insisting the firm cut all ties with competitor Mohawk. The ploy costs the firm all its airline business, as they drop Mohawk only to be spurned by American.|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} was <b>so</b> <b>convinced.</b> Brasseys Naval Annual, for instance, stated that with vessels as large and expensive as the Invincibles, an admiral [...] "will be certain {{to put them}} in the line of battle where their comparatively light protection will be a disadvantage and their high speed of no value." [...] Those in favor of the battlecruiser countered with two points—first, since all capital ships were vulnerable to new weapons such as the torpedo, armour had lost some of its validity; and second, because of its greater speed, the battlecruiser could control the range at which it engaged an enemy.|$|E

500|$|Charges {{were brought}} by the Carrouges' faction against Le Gris {{in the court of}} Count Pierre but Carrouges and his wife refused to attend the hearing, <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> were they of {{receiving}} unfair treatment from the Count. Count Pierre backed his favourite in the trial, clearing Le Gris and accusing Marguerite of inventing or [...] "dreaming" [...] the charges. Undeterred, Carrouges then visited the court of King Charles VI at the Château de Vincennes and appealed to the King for the right to challenge Le Gris to a judicial duel to allow God to decide the case. The King referred the case to the Parlement of Paris, where both claimants were expected to appear on 9 July.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{in the lab}} at Harvard, Walter's autopsy {{reveals a}} {{synthetic}} compound in Mark's blood, though any link to the cuts is not yet known to them. Olivia receives an email from someone who claims to be John Scott, listing an address for her to visit. Upon arriving she finds boxes, one of which contains a group of toads. At the lab, Walter finds that the toads contain a [...] "psychoactive compound", a hallucinogen that affects the fear center of the brain. They conclude that Mark’s brain was <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> of something happening to his body that actual physical marks appeared. Mark was infected with a large dosage, leading them to attribute his death to murder.|$|E
500|$|By late August 1943, Hartmann had 90 aerial victories. On 19 August, {{in combat}} with Il-2s, his {{aircraft}} was damaged by debris, {{and he was}} forced to land behind Soviet lines. Hartmann's Geschwaderkommodore, Dietrich Hrabak, had given orders to Hartmann's unit to support the dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2, led by the famous Stuka pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel in a counter-attack. The situation had changed, and the flight of eight German fighters engaged a mass of Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 fighter aircraft that were protecting Il-2 Sturmoviks on a ground-attack mission. Hartmann shot down two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and {{he was forced to}} make an emergency landing. He then, in accordance with Luftwaffe regulations, attempted to recover the precision board clock. As he was doing so, Soviet ground troops approached. Realising that capture was unavoidable, he faked internal injuries. Hartmann's acting <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> the Soviets that they put him on a stretcher and placed him on a truck. When Hartmann's Crew Chief, Heinz [...] "Bimmel" [...] Mertens, heard what had happened, he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann.|$|E

50|$|Golem agrees {{and sends}} Rapier with the Hood under {{instructions}} to kill Parker after {{the deal is}} made. Knowing it is a setup, the Hood purchases a similar cloak, {{and goes to the}} rendezvous point. Robbins sets up events so Rapier confronts the FBI, wearing the fake cloak, and she is killed. He tells the living enforcers to tell Golem to leave him alone after he returns the diamonds. They do not want to get in trouble for shooting the woman, <b>so</b> <b>convince</b> King to just say that the Hood was a female, and then releases him.|$|R
500|$|In her 2005 book Gurus in America, author Cynthia Ann Humes {{comments}} {{that although the}} [...] "public falling out" [...] between the Beatles and Maharishi was widely reported, there has been [...] "little mention" [...] of [...] "the continued positive relationship Maharishi maintained" [...] with Harrison and McCartney. During the 1990s both Harrison and McCartney were <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> of the Maharishi's innocence that they offered their apologies. Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party in 1992, and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying, [...] "We were very young" [...] and [...] "It's probably {{in the history books}} that Maharishi 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' – but it's bullshit, total bullshit." [...] Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she [...] "hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, when we had enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi". Asked if he forgave the Beatles, the Maharishi replied, [...] "I could never be upset with angels." [...] McCartney took his daughter, Stella, to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007, which renewed their friendship.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{military}} had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods, these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World WarII, and Australia came under direct attack for the first time. Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24August 1942, at Brisbane, and was accepted. He began training as an aircraft mechanic, but later volunteered for flying service, and commenced initial training at Somers, Victoria, in December 1943. The aircrew interviewer thought he looked [...] "a bit rough" [...] but [...] "should make a fighter". Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage, and studied nights {{to make up for}} it. Keen to be a pilot, he was concerned that he would be allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on. He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber, to which he replied, [...] "I had a very disappointed look on my face, sir!" [...] <b>So</b> <b>convinced</b> was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator, Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected, and had to pay out £15 when he was nevertheless chosen.|$|E

2500|$|The Academy of Nehardea was now {{the only}} one in Babylon, and its director, Samuel, who survived Rab about ten years, was {{regarded}} as the highest authority by the Babylonian Jews. Even Rabbi Yochanan, the most prominent teacher in Palestine, and who at first looked upon Samuel merely as a colleague, became <b>so</b> <b>convinced</b> of his greatness, after Samuel had sent him a large number of responsa on important ritual laws, that he exclaimed, [...] "I have a teacher in Babylon" [...] (Ḥul. 95b).|$|E
