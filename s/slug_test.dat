Although empirical methods for such estimations are longstanding, there is still insufficient comparison of K values among the various approaches. Six grain-size analysis methods were tested on coarse-grained alluvial sediments from 12 water wells in NE Slovenia. Values of K from grainsize methods were compared to those of pumping <b>tests</b> and <b>slug</b> <b>tests.</b> Six grain-size methods (USBR, Slichter, Hazen, Beyer, Kozeny-Carman, and Terzaghi) were used for comparison with the Theis and Neuman pumping test method and the Bouwer-Rice method for <b>slug</b> <b>tests.</b> The results show that the USBR (US Bureau of Reclamation) method overestimates K values and there is no correlation with other results, so its use is not advised. Conversely, whilst the Slichter method gives much lower estimates of K, it is the only one to completely fulfill the grain size requirements. Other methods (Hazen, Beyer, Kozeny- Carman, and Terzaghi) result in intermediate values and are similar to the Slichter method; however they should be used for smaller-sized sediments. Due to their high transmissivity and small radius of inffiuence, <b>slug</b> <b>tests</b> should be avoided in the analysis of gravels, as they only test {{a small portion of the}} aquifer compared to pumping tests.

40|$|Some {{regions of}} the Greenland ice sheet, where snow {{accumulation}} and melt rates are high, currently retain substantial volumes of liquid water within the firn pore space throughout the year. These firn aquifers, found between ~ 10 and 30 m below the snow surface, may significantly affect sea level rise by storing or draining surface meltwater. The hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity control flow of meltwater through the firn. Here we describe the hydraulic conductivity of the firn aquifer estimated from <b>slug</b> <b>tests</b> and aquifer tests at six sites located upstream of Helheim Glacier in southeastern Greenland. We conducted <b>slug</b> <b>tests</b> using a novel instrument, a piezometer with a heated tip that melts itself into the ice sheet.

40|$|Hydraulic {{conductivity}} (K) {{is a key}} parameter {{required for}} the accurate prediction of contaminant transport in an aquifer. Traditionally, pump <b>tests,</b> <b>slug</b> <b>tests,</b> grain size analysis and, to a lesser extent, tracer tests have been employed to estimate the K of an aquifer. These methods have disadvantages in respect to assessing the K of a contaminated aquifer, for example, pumping tests generate large quantities of potentially contaminated water, <b>slug</b> <b>tests</b> interrogate {{only a small portion}} of aquifer to generate K values, and tracer tests are costly to perform. The recirculating well pair (RWP) system, assessed in this study, attempts to minimise these disadvantages while producing accurate estimates of K. The RWP system uses two wells, each screened in two positions; one screen injects water and the other extracts water from the aquifer. One well extracts water from the lower screen and injects it into the aquifer via the upper screen, whereas the second well extracts water from the upper screen and injects it through the lower screen. When these two wells are pumped in tandem a recirculation system is created within the aquifer. No water is lost or gained from the aquifer in this system...|$|R

Two Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurement campaigns were conducted in the area for evaluating the reasons of failures.

In this paper the integration of borehole logging and <b>slug</b> <b>testing</b> is presented as a solution to add more information and to enhance the interpretation of ERT models.

40|$|A forced {{gradient}} tracer experiment indicated a rapid transport of a solute tracer, chloride, through a 13 -m thick fractured till - silty sand lens system to an underlying sandy aquifer in Ringe, Denmark. Chloride {{was applied to}} a 4 × 4. 8 m 2 area on the ground surface and chloride breakthrough was monitored in horizontal filters at depths of 2. 5 m (till), 4 m (till), 5. 5 m (silty sand lens), and 20 - 20. 5 m (sandy aquifer). This paper {{is an extension of}} the research undertaken by Sidle et al. (Water Resources Research, 34 (1998) 2515) and focuses only on the chloride breakthrough data from the silty sand lens (embedded in the till) and the sandy aquifer, and on the scale dependency of saturated hydraulic conductivity tests. The rapid chloride transport shows that the fracture and macropore flow is significant in the non-weathered till between the silty sand lens and the sandy aquifer. The first arrival of chloride in the sandy aquifer occurred 8 days after the start of the tracer injection and the "peak concentration" was reached after 3 weeks. In addition, <b>slug</b> <b>tests,</b> free flow tests, and large-scale infiltration tests were conducted to assess the spatial variability of the hydraulic characteristics of the interconnected aquitard/silty sand lens system and the underlying aquifer. The large-scale infiltration tests and the free flow tests yielded substantially higher K values than the <b>slug</b> <b>tests,</b> where the <b>slug</b> <b>tests</b> represented a small-scale sampling volume and only a localized fracture network. The infiltration tests captured the decrease in bulk K from the uppermost, bioturbated till to the underlying fracture-dominated till. K values varied in the till with depth by up to 3 orders of magnitude from 1 × 10 - 7 to 1 × 10 - 4 m s- 1 with the highest permeabilities in the uppermost 2. 5 m. The high permeabilities explain the fast breakthrough of the solute in the underlying aquifer. The present study indicates that at high flow rates diffusive exchange of solute tracer mass did not significantly influence the solute transport, particularly in the non-weathered till. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

The results of the multilevel <b>slug</b> <b>tests</b> provided the basis for hydraulic conductivity zonation within a two-dimensional finite-element model, which simulated nitrate transport in cross section.
