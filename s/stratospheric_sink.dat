40|$|We {{present the}} first upper tropospheric and stratospheric global {{distributions}} of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) observed from space using solar occultation measurements {{made by the}} Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) satellite Fourier transform spectrometer during 2004 – 2006. We observe high OCS mixing ratios (> 400 pptv) within the tropical stratosphere owing to convected tropospheric air. Stratospheric mixing ratios decrease more rapidly with altitude {{moving away from the}} Equator, creating a poleward gradient. Elevated OCS concentrations observed at low southern latitudes are consistent with a significant pyrogenic source. Using coincident ACE measurements of CFC- 11 and CFC- 12 we determine a global OCS stratospheric lifetime of 64 ± 21 years corresponding to a <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sink</b> of 63 – 124 Gg OCS yr- 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterization}} of two-dimensional transport {{is applied}} to photochemical models of stratospheric trace species. It is shown that in a first approximation, tracer transport in the meridional plane may be treated as an advective rather than a diffusive process. The concept of residual mean meridional circulation (Andrews and McIntyre, 1976; Boyd, 1976) {{is used in the}} model and shown to be a modified Eulerian mean, a good approximation to the Lagrangian mean motion. A simple example in which the equilibrium distribution is computed for a tracer with a uniform tropospheric source and a <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sink</b> proportional to the local mixing ratio demonstrates the potential of the proposed parameterization. The resulting distribution is found to agree qualitatively with the observed stratospheric distribution of trace species whose sources are in the troposphere...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCarbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an {{important}} precursor of sulfate aerosols and consequently a key species in stratospheric ozone depletion. SPIRALE and SWIR balloon-borne instruments have flown in the tropical region and in the Arctic polar region, and ground-based measurements have been performed by QualAir FTS instrument in Paris. Partial and total columns and vertical profiles have been obtained to study the OCS variability with altitude, latitude and season. The annual total column variation in Paris reveals a seasonal variation with a maximum in April-June and a minimum in November-January. Total column measurements above Paris and from SWIR balloon-borne instrument are compared with several MkIV measurements, several NDACC stations, aircraft, ship and balloon measurements to highlight the OCS total column decrease from tropical to polar latitudes. OCS high resolution in situ vertical profiles have been measured {{for the first time}} in the altitude range between 14 and 30 km at tropical and polar latitudes. OCS profiles are compared with ACE satellite measurements and show good agreement. Using OCS:N 2 O correlation from SPIRALE, OCS stratospheric lifetime has been accurately determined. We find a stratospheric lifetime of 70 ± 20 years at polar latitude and 58 ± 14 years at tropical latitude leading to a global <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sink</b> of 54 ± 14 Gg S yr- 1...|$|E
40|$|Amounts of source gases with <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sinks</b> (CFCs, N 2 O, CH 4) are {{affected}} by changes in Brewer–Dobson circulation. Source gases and their degradation products are important for atmospheric chemistry and climate. With a simple model, we examine how amounts and lifetimes of source gases and products depend on speed of the circulation. Transient results differ from steady-state and stratospheric results differ from those for stratosphere plus troposphere. Increases in speed increase the stratospheric burden of source gases, but reduce products and reduce total burdens and lifetimes of source gase...|$|R
40|$|The flux of {{idealized}} trace gases {{across the}} thermal tropopause is quantified {{as a function}} of their chemical lifetime using the Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH) driven by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses. The flux is computed in the limit of instant stratospheric chemical loss, and tropospheric chemistry is idealized as decay with a constant lifetime, τc. Emissions are idealized as time independent, with either a generic anthropogenic pattern or a uniform ocean source. We find that the globally averaged flux into the stratosphere normalized by surface emissions is ∼ 1 % for τc= 8 days and ∼ 30 % for τc[*]∼ 140 days, slowly approaching the long-lived limit of balance between <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sinks</b> and surface sources. The qualitative τc dependence of the globally averaged flux is captured by a simple one-dimensional model. The flux patterns computed with MATCH for the NCEP reanalyses are insensitive to τc and reveal preferred pathways into the stratosphere: The divergent circulation feeding isentropic cross-tropopause transport, storm tracks in the winter hemisphere, and isentropic transport to high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Isotopic {{fractionation}} of mono-substituted N 2 O species by the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sinks,</b> photolysis {{and reaction}} with O(1 D), {{has been investigated}} previously by atmospheric and laboratory measurements. Here, we report on photolysis of the most abundant poly-substituted isotopologue, 15 N 15 N 16 O. The associated fractionation constant equals the sum of individual fractionation constants at central and terminal nitrogen sites. Based on statistical considerations, a more general “additivity rule” is proposed that extends to the remaining poly-substituted N 2 O species and is compared to predictions from two theories. Atmospheric mixing effects do not lead to measurable deviations from random isotope distributions since variations of isotope ratios are too small. Fractionation by the O(1 D) sink likely also follows the “additivity rule”. Consequently, the stratospheric 15 N 15 N 16 O abundance is expected to reflect its statistically dictated value. The value of 15 N 15 N 16 O as a potential new tracer of stratospheric processes may thus be limited, but this remains to be verified by actual measurements...|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a {{significant}} greenhouse gas and main contributor to stratospheric ozone destruction. Surface measurements of N₂O mole fractions {{have been used to}} attribute source and sink strengths, but large uncertainties remain. Stable isotopic ratios of N₂O (here considered ¹⁴N¹⁵N¹⁶O, ¹⁵N¹⁴N¹⁶O, ¹⁴N¹⁴N¹⁸O, relative to the abundant ¹⁴N¹⁴N¹⁶O) linked to source and sink isotopic signatures can provide additional constraints on emissions and counter-balancing <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sink.</b> However, the isotopic composition in the troposphere has been regarded and measured as a fixed value, limited by insufficient measurement precision and few data. This thesis provides the foundation for high-frequency, high-precision measurements and utilization of N₂O tropospheric isotopic composition. This is achieved through {{the development of a new}} measuring capability with sufficient precision to detect the subtle signals of N₂O isotopic composition in tropospheric air and uniquely fully-automated and high-frequency capable. This instrument was applied to produce the first set of tropospheric air observations gathered at a remote research station covering a full annual cycle, paired with air origin information, and providing a valuable assessment of tropospheric composition and its potential utility. The first regional model of tropospheric N₂O isotopic composition was developed for further assessment of expected variability and utility of isotopic composition data. The optimized fully-automated, liquid-cryogen-free pre-concentration device coupled to continuous flow IRMS resulted in ¹⁵N site-specific precisions markedly improved over other systems of 0. 11 and 0. 14 0 / 00 (1 [sigma]) for [delta]¹⁵N[alpha] and [delta]¹⁵Nbulk, respectively, and among the best bulk composition precisions of 0. 05 and 0. 10 0 / 00 for [delta]¹⁵Nbulk and [delta]¹⁸O, respectively. The high-precision, non-continuous flask observations of N₂O ¹⁵N site-specific composition (January 2010 to January 2011; Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station, Ireland) detected statistically significant signals on short-term and annual timescales, and when analyzed with air history information showed consistencies with source-receptor relationships. No seasonal cycle could be detected in the low-frequency observations, but regional model scenarios of the stratospheric seasonal signal resulted in amplitudes at the cusp of current measurement capabilities. This thesis illustrated detectable variations in tropospheric N₂O isotopic composition which can potentially reduce uncertainty in the N₂O budget with high-frequency, high-precision observations, now feasible by the instrumentation developed here. by Katherine Ellison Potter.

40|$|A global climatological {{distribution}} of tropospheric OH is computed using observed distributions of O 3, H 2 O, NO t  (NO 2  +NO + 2 N 2 O 5  + NO 3  + HNO 2  +HNO 4), CO, hydrocarbons, temperature, and cloud optical depth. Global annual mean OH is 1. 16 × 106  molecules cm− 3 (integrated {{with respect to}} mass of air up to 100 hPa within ± 32 ° latitude and up to 200 hPa outside that region). Mean hemispheric concentrations of OH are nearly equal. While global mean OH increased by 33 % compared to that from Spivakovsky et al.  [1990], mean loss frequencies of CH 3 CCl 3  and CH 4  increased by only 23 % because a lower fraction of total OH resides in the lower troposphere in the present distribution. The value for temperature used for determining lifetimes of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by scaling rate constants [Prather and Spivakovsky, 1990] is revised from 277 K to 272 K. The present {{distribution of}} OH is consistent within a few percent with the current budgets of CH 3 CCl 3  and HCFC- 22. For CH 3 CCl 3, it results in a lifetime of 4. 6 years, including stratospheric and ocean sinks with atmospheric lifetimes of 43 and 80 years, respectively. For HCFC- 22, the lifetime is 11. 4 years, allowing for the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sink</b> with an atmospheric lifetime of 229 years. Corrections suggested by observed levels of CH 2 Cl 2  (annual means) depend strongly on the rate of interhemispheric mixing in the model. An increase in OH in the Northern Hemisphere by 20 % combined with {{a decrease in the}} southern tropics by 25 % is suggested if this rate is at its upper limit consistent with observations of CFCs and  85 Kr. For the lower limit, observations of CH 2 Cl 2  imply an increase in OH in the Northern Hemisphere by 35 % combined with a decrease in OH in the southern tropics by 60 %. However, such large corrections are inconsistent with observations for  14 CO in the tropics and for the interhemispheric gradient of CH 3 CCl 3. Industrial sources of CH 2 Cl 2  are sufficient for balancing its budget. The available tests do not establish significant errors in OH except for a possible underestimate in winter in the northern and southern tropics by 15 – 20 % and 10 – 15 %, respectively, and an overestimate in southern extratropics by ∼ 25 %. Observations of seasonal variations of CH 3 CCl 3, CH 2 Cl 2, 14 CO, and C 2 H 6  offer no evidence for higher levels of OH in the southern than in the northern extratropics. It is expected that {{in the next few years}} the latitudinal distribution and annual cycle of CH 3 CCl 3  will be determined primarily by its loss frequency, allowing for additional constraints for OH on scales smaller than global...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new 4 D-Var inversion framework for nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{based on the}} GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and its adjoint, and apply it {{in a series of}} observing system simulation experiments to assess how well N 2 O sources and sinks can be constrained by the current global observing network. The employed measurement ensemble includes approximately weekly and quasicontinuous N 2 O measurements (hourly averages used) from several long-term monitoring networks, N 2 O measurements collected from discrete air samples onboard a commercial aircraft (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container; CARIBIC), and quasi-continuous measurements from the airborne HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaigns. For a 2 -year inversion, we find that the surface and HIPPO observations can accurately resolve a uniform bias in emissions during the first year; CARIBIC data provide a somewhat weaker constraint. Variable emission errors are much more difficult to resolve given the long lifetime of N 2 O, and major parts of the world lack significant constraints on the seasonal cycle of fluxes. Current observations can largely correct a global bias in the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sink</b> of N 2 O if emissions are known, but do not provide information on the temporal and spatial distribution of the sink. However, for the more realistic scenario where source and sink are both uncertain, we find that simultaneously optimizing both would require unrealistically small errors in model transport. Regardless, a bias in the magnitude of the N 2 O sink would not affect the a posteriori N 2 O emissions for the 2 -year timescale used here, given realistic initial conditions, due to the timescale required for stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). The same does not apply to model errors in the rate of STE itself, which we show exerts a larger influence on the tropospheric burden of N 2 O than does the chemical loss rate over short (< 3 year) timescales. We use a stochastic estimate of the inverse Hessian for the inversion to evaluate the spatial resolution of emission constraints provided by the observations, and find that significant, spatially explicit constraints can be achieved in locations near and immediately upwind of surface measurements and the HIPPO flight tracks; however, these are mostly confined to North America, Europe, and Australia. None of the current observing networks are able to provide significant spatial information on tropical N 2 O emissions. There, averaging kernels (describing the sensitivity of the inversion to emissions in each grid square) are highly smeared spatially and extend even to the midlatitudes, so that tropical emissions risk being conflated with those elsewhere. For global inversions, therefore, the current lack of constraints on the tropics also places an important limit on our ability to understand extratropical emissions. Based on the error reduction statistics from the inverse Hessian, we characterize the atmospheric distribution of unconstrained N 2 O, and identify regions in and downwind of South America, central Africa, and Southeast Asia where new surface or profile measurements would have the most value for reducing present uncertainty in the global N 2 O budget...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is of twofold {{significance}} for the atmosphere: In the troposphere it con-tributes about 6 % to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect (IPCC, 1995). Simultaneously, it {{plays an important role}} in stratospheric ozone chemistry through the photochemical produc-tion of nitric oxide. However, the ongoing increase of atmospheric N 2 O concentrations is not well explained by our knowledge about the global N 2 O budget. Especially the strength of the individual N 2 O sources (nitrification and denitrification processes in waters and soils) is ill-constrained. The <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sinks</b> (photolysis and photodissociation) in contrast are rela-tively well quantified. One method to improve our current understanding of biogeochemical processes involving N 2 O is to trace the molecule through the atmosphere by measuring the abundance of its stable isotopes: 15 N, 17 O and 18 O. Hence, we perform isotopic analyses of tropospheric, stratospheric and firn air samples, laboratory experiments on sink and source reactions of N 2 O and possibly field studies of N 2 O sources. Recently developed mass spectrometric techniques allow to de-termine the intramolecular distribution of 15 N in the linear NNO molecule and quantification of the so-called mass-independent enrichment of 17 O in N 2 O.

40|$|Carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl 4) is an ozone-depleting substance, {{which is}} controlled by the Montreal Protocol and for which the atmospheric abundance is decreasing. However, the current observed rate of this decrease is known to be slower than expected based on reported CCl 4 emissions and its estimated overall atmospheric lifetime. Here we use a three-dimensional (3 -D) chemical transport model to investigate the impact on its predicted decay of uncertainties in the rates at which CCl 4 is removed from the atmosphere by photolysis, by ocean uptake and by degradation in soils. The largest sink is atmospheric photolysis (74  % of total), but a reported 10  % uncertainty in its combined photolysis cross section and quantum yield has only a modest impact on the modelled rate of CCl 4 decay. This is partly due to the limiting effect of the rate of transport of CCl 4 from the main tropospheric reservoir to the stratosphere, where photolytic loss occurs. The model suggests large interannual variability in the magnitude of this <b>stratospheric</b> photolysis <b>sink</b> caused by variations in transport. The impact of uncertainty in the minor soil sink (9  % of total) is also relatively small. In contrast, the model shows that uncertainty in ocean loss (17  % of total) has the largest impact on modelled CCl 4 decay due to its sizeable contribution to CCl 4 loss and large lifetime uncertainty range (147 to 241 years). With an assumed CCl 4 emission rate of 39  Gg year − 1, the reference simulation with the best estimate of loss processes still underestimates the observed CCl 4 (overestimates the decay) over the past 2 decades but to a smaller extent than previous studies. Changes to the rate of CCl 4 loss processes, in line with known uncertainties, could bring the model into agreement with in situ surface and remote-sensing measurements, as could an increase in emissions to around 47  Gg year − 1. Further progress in constraining the CCl 4 budget is partly limited by systematic biases between observational datasets. For example, surface observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) network are larger than from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network but have shown a steeper decreasing trend over the past 2 decades.
