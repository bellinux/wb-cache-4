500|$|Free {{from his}} EMI {{contract}} on 9 May 1972, Barrett signed {{a document that}} ended his association with Pink Floyd, and any financial interest in future recordings. Barrett attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by Pete Brown and former Cream bassist Jack Bruce in October 1973. Brown arrived at the show late, and saw that Bruce was already onstage, along with [...] "a guitarist I vaguely recognised", playing the Horace Silver tune [...] "Doodlin'". Later in the show, Brown read out a poem, which he dedicated to Syd, because, [...] "he's here in Cambridge, and he's {{one of the best}} songwriters in the country" [...] when, to his surprise, the guitar player from earlier in the show <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No I'm not". By the end of 1973, Barrett had returned to live in London, staying at various hotels and, in December of that year, settling in at Chelsea Cloisters. He had little contact with others, apart from his regular visits to his management's offices to collect his royalties, and the occasional visit from his sister Rosemary.|$|E

We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked up and said, {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of the}} soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E

After speaking, Senator Charles Sumner, both a friend of Ferry's and the {{proposer}} of the bill, <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mr. Ferry, your speech is far the most damaging blow my measure has yet received". The Civil Rights Act would eventually pass, but was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, {{on the basis that}} Congress did not have the power to regulate the conduct of individuals. His last speech in Congress was considered an uncommonly eloquent dissertation on his former friend, William Alfred Buckingham.|$|E

A document from the London Metropolitan Police, submitted to the first inquest, said the Schiller Institute and LaRouche Youth Movement blamed the Jewish people for the Iraq war and other global issues, and that [...] "Jeremiah's lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [...] ideology."

2500|$|Back in London, Huxley {{consulted}} with every {{expert on the}} brain that he knew, and that included Flower. His conclusions were made public in 1860 in lectures and publications, {{but most of the}} demonstrations were done by Flower using monkey brains rather than the scarce ape brains. Over the years, Flower published papers on the brains of four species of monkey, and acted as Huxley's partner in demonstrations at subsequent BA meetings. At the 1862 meeting in Cambridge when Owen read a paper maintaining his claims, Flower <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I happen to have in my pocket a monkey's brain"– and produced the object in question!

Lu Su told Guan Yu, [...] Before Lu Su could finish what he was saying, an unnamed person interrupted him and said, [...] "Whoever has the ability to govern the land shall have control over it. Isn't it so?" [...] Lu Su angrily rebuked that person in a firm and stern tone. Guan Yu drew his sword, <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "This is a state-level problem.

2500|$|... "Will I?", a song {{which takes}} place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was {{inspired}} by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.|$|E

2500|$|There are no {{verbatim}} transcriptions of Henry's {{speech in}} opposition to the Stamp Act. Texts are reconstructions, for the most part based on recollections decades later by which time both the speech and Henry had become famous. For example, Jefferson, still in his studies at the nearby College of William and Mary, recalled the splendor of Henry's oratory. No attempt was made to reconstruct Henry's words until 1790, when James Madison wrote to former burgess Edmund Pendleton, but Madison learned that Pendleton had not been present; a second attempt did not occur until Wirt began work on his biography of Henry in 1805 [...] A French traveler, whose name is not known, and whose journal was discovered in 1921, recorded at the time of Henry's speech that [...] "one of the members <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he had read that in former times Tarquin and Julius had their Brutus, Charles had his Cromwell, and he did not doubt but some good American would stand up, in favour of his country".

In 1991, Manning was humiliated at a Reform Party rally when a Reform Party supporter spoke in support of Manning in racist terms, saying “You’re a fine white person. You know, we are letting in too many people from the Third World, the low blacks, the low Hispanics. They’re going to take over the province”. Later in the same rally another Reform Party supporter <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> “Let them [...] go. We don’t need Quebec.” Long-time Progressive Conservative member and political commentator Dalton Camp observed the 1994 Reform Party convention in Ottawa and was personally disgusted with what he heard, saying: [...] "The speechifying gives off acrid whiffs of xenophobia, homophobia, and paranoia—like an exhaust—in which it seems clear both orator and audience have been seized by some private terror: immigrants, lesbians, people out of work or from out of town and criminals." [...] In the Reform Party policy convention in 1995, Manning urged members to avoid extremism, and a motion was passed by the vote of the delegates that the Reform Party recognized the equality of every individual, but only after the delegates demanded that the words [...] "without discrimination" [...] be removed from the motion. The 1995 convention went on to Reform party delegates controversially called for the removal of group specification in all human rights legisiation which was accepted in the convention by a 93 percent vote in favour. Another controversial motion in the 1995 convention called for tighter regulation of people infected with HIV which was supported by 84 percent of the delegates. One Reformer delegate raised concern that such a policy on HIV would make the party look anti-homosexual, but another delegate responded to this saying [...] "I did not join the Reform Party to bow down at the altar of political correctness".|$|E

Bass guitarist John Entwistle remarked that he [...] "couldn't think of anything to play." [...] On another occasion, Astley recalled, [...] "I was doing a drum track, and he hadn't learned the song.
