5|$|The {{reliability}} of William Branham's primary source biographical material <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> with caution. This is because Branham's autobiographical stories were often embellished, and sometimes contradictory. Other sources, written by his associates or followers, are apologetic and hagiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} about how people attempt to see the future through various superstitious means. Then the narrator tries to convince the reader that resignation about death is necessary. However, such resignation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as pushing the self towards redemption and the eternal life in the next world. By acting properly, one {{would be able to}} overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{therapy for}} {{coronary}} artery disease has also improved since the 1970s, and for many kinds of patients may be as successful as stenting or surgery.

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of responsible government in 1848, Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine became the first truly democratic leaders of what would eventually become the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in present-day Canada, and some modern historians, most notably John Ralston Saul, have promoted {{the idea that they}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as Canada's true first Prime Ministers.|$|E
25|$|The {{discussion}} whether aging <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as {{a disease}} or not has important implications. It would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.|$|E
25|$|African {{music has}} been {{a major factor in the}} shaping of what we know today as Dixieland, the blues and jazz. These styles have all {{borrowed}} from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic Ocean by slaves. African music in Sub-Saharan Africa is mostly upbeat polyrhythmic and joyful, whereas the blues <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as an aesthetic development resulting from the conditions of slavery in the new world.|$|E

Definitive treatment can be excision of the tissue, however, recurrence of these infections is high. Pericoronitis, while a small area of tissue, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> with caution, because it lies near the anatomic planes of the neck and can progress to life-threatening neck infections.|$|E
25|$|Buddhists, Jains, Advaita Vedantins and Nyāya {{philosophers}} {{considered the}} Charvakas {{as one of}} their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approach Charvakas deployed were significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/Lokāyata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> critically.|$|E
25|$|In short, Unitarian Universalists {{respect the}} {{important}} religious texts of other religions. UUs {{believe that all}} religions can coexist if viewed {{with the concept of}} love for one's neighbor and for oneself. Other church members who do not believe in a particular text or doctrine are encouraged to respect it as a historically significant literary work that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> with an open mind. It is intended that in this way, individuals from all religions or spiritual backgrounds could live peaceably.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the multi-component model, some researchers believe that STM <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as a unitary construct. In this respect, visual, spatial, and verbal information {{are thought to be}} organized by levels of representation rather than the type of store to which they belong. Within the literature, it is suggested that further research into the fractionation of STM and WM be explored. However, much of the research into the visuo-spatial memory construct have been conducted in accordance to the paradigm advanced by Baddeley and Hitch.|$|E
25|$|In the United States alone, {{electricity}} {{accounts for}} US$210 {{billion in annual}} sales. Asia's electricity sector attracted US$93 billion in private investment between 1990 and 1999. These figures take into account only current prices. Proponents of ITER contend that an investment in research now <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> {{as an attempt to}} earn a far greater future return. Also, worldwide investment of less than US$1 billion per year into ITER is not incompatible with concurrent research into other methods of power generation, which in 2007 totaled US$16.9 billion.|$|E
25|$|Link grammar {{is based}} on the {{dependency}} relation, but link grammar does not include directionality in the dependencies between words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/constituency grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes – see for example the Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank. The derivation trees of tree-adjoining grammar are dependency-based, although the full trees of TAG are constituency-based, so in this regard, {{it is not clear whether}} TAG <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> more as a dependency or constituency grammar.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{study by}} the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, levees and floodwalls {{surrounding}} New Orleans—no matter how large or sturdy—cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events. Levees and floodwalls <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that completely eliminate risk. For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures—such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox rabbis Shmuley Boteach and Zev Farber have {{publicly}} {{questioned the}} opposition of Orthodox groups to government recognition of same-sex civil marriages, arguing that although Judaism as they understand it does not condone homosexuality, governments should not enforce any particular religion's view of marriage, and that conferring civil benefits to committed homosexual couples <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as promoting family values. Open orthodox (which is closer to conservative ideology) Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz declared that the Jewish values of justice, equality, and dignity lead him to support the cause of gay rights and advocate for same-sex civil marriage.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court did {{not rule}} that all income taxes were direct taxes. Instead, the Court held that {{although}} generally income taxes are indirect taxes (excises) authorized by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, taxes on interest, dividends and rents in the 1894 Act {{had a profound effect}} on the underlying assets. The Court ruled that the tax on dividends, interest and rent <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as a direct tax, as they fell on the property itself, rather than as an indirect tax. Direct taxes were required to follow the rule of apportionment found in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3.|$|E
