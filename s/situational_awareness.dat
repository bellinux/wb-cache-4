5|$|Voss {{was awarded}} the Pour le Mérite on 8 April 1917. It was {{customary}} to award a month's leave to a Pour le Mérite winner, so Voss immediately left for his vacation, and {{did not return to}} combat until 5 May. By the time of this leave, Voss had gained impressive marksmanship and <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Situational</b> <b>awareness</b> {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the {{aircraft}} location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding <b>situational</b> <b>awareness,</b> marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E

5|$|In March 1993, {{under the}} September 1990 Tripartite MoU between the U.S., Italy, and Spain, eight EAV-8B Plus Matadors were ordered, {{along with a}} twin-seat TAV-8B. Deliveries of the Plus-standard {{aircraft}} started in 1996. On 11 May 2000, Boeing and the NAVAIR finalized a contract to remanufacture Spanish EAV-8Bs to bring them up to Plus standard. Boeing said the deal required it to remanufacture two EAV-8Bs, with an option for another seven aircraft; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft. The remanufacture allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs, enhanced the pilot's <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> through the installation of new radar and avionics, and provided a new engine. Eventually, five aircraft were modified, the last having been delivered on 5 December 2003.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1919, one of {{the largest}} engagements of the {{intervention}} occurred, taking place at Seltso and the surrounding villages along the Dvina. In a confused battle through the marshy swamps Sadlier-Jackson's brigade battled a large Bolshevik force, with the Fusiliers—including the two Australian companies of the 45th Battalion—fighting their way through with their bayonets and re-occupying Seltso. Perhaps as many as 1,000 prisoners were taken and 19 field guns captured. Due to the terrain the Fusiliers had been unable to manoeuvre their mountain guns through the swamp, whilst Sadlier-Jackson had to use an observation balloon for <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> During this battle an Australian, Corporal Arthur Sullivan, won the Victoria Cross (VC) for saving a group of drowning men while under fire.|$|E

In late 2009, a contract for Block C upgrades upon the V-22 was awarded to Bell Boeing. In February 2012, the Marine Corps received the first Block C Ospreys; these aircraft feature a new radar, along with additional mission management and electronic warfare equipment. In 2015, options for upgrading all aircraft to the V-22C standard were examined.|$|E

40|$|Through {{assessing}} the triggers, motivators and barriers for leading a more sustainable lifestyle, behavioural and/or attitudinal change in {{students at the}} University of Southampton has been investigated. Using existing theory-based literature and extensive primary data collection and analysis, links between waste-related behaviour and attitude have been found. It is observed that pro-environmental behaviour can exist independently to pro-environmental attitude, depending on where barriers occur within the chain of causality, {{and based on the}} level of both specific and general environmental awareness. It is suggested that in order to alter behaviour, awareness must be increased, with an associated reduction in <b>situational</b> barriers. <b>Awareness</b> can be altered through the provision of relevant information. Furthermore, although some level of behavioural change was achieved; additional monitoring and a sustained behavioural change programme over a longer time period is proposed...|$|R
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E
5|$|To evade enemy {{detection}} and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were {{operated by the}} air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2014, a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) {{emergency}} meeting {{concluded that the}} RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the next day, when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E

40|$|An efficient, {{secure and}} {{interoperable}} data platform solution {{has been developed}} in the TESSA project to provide fast navigation {{and access to the}} data stored in the data archive, as well as a standard-based metadata management support. The platform mainly targets scientific users and the <b>situational</b> sea <b>awareness</b> high-level services such as the decision support systems (DSS). These datasets are accessible through the following three main components: the Data Access Service (DAS), the Metadata Service and the Complex Data Analysis Module (CDAM). The DAS allows access to data stored in the archive by providing interfaces for different protocols and services for downloading, variables selection, data subsetting or map generation. Metadata Service {{is the heart of the}} information system of the TESSA products and completes the overall infrastructure for data and metadata management. This component enables data search and discovery and addresses interoperability by exploiting widely adopted standards for geospatial data.

5|$|The Canadians {{subsequently}} occupied Hill 677 {{and began}} digging-in, deploying their six Vickers medium machine-guns in sections to add depth, and using defensive fire tasks {{to cover the}} gaps in their positions. Meanwhile, the Australians occupied Hill 504, with D Company holding the summit itself, A Company the spur-line which ran down to the north-west, and B Company the small hill by the river, while C Company was in reserve on the rear spur. In response to US IX Corps requirements Burke directed Ferguson to site his headquarters in the low ground of the valley {{in the vicinity of}} the hamlet of Chuktun-ni, so as to control the withdrawing South Koreans. However, this would limit Ferguson's <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> and his ability to control the battle, while also leaving them exposed to infiltration. The afternoon was spent on the lightly scrub-covered slopes digging-in and building sangers where the rocky ground proved too hard. In only a few hours the Australians managed to prepare hasty defensive positions, although defensive fire tasks were unable to be registered as the artillery Forward Observers were unable to reach the company positions until after dark.|$|E
5|$|White {{departed}} {{his home}} in Romney for Charleston, West Virginia, where he was entirely dependent upon himself and his own resources. There, White commenced his career in public service in 1886 when he began serving as a messenger {{in the office of}} West Virginia Secretary of State Henry S. Walker. He received successive promotions within the Secretary of State's office beginning with clerk, then to stationery clerk, and finally to chief clerk of the office during the latter part of Walker's term in office. White was retained as the chief clerk of the office by Walker's successor, William A. Ohley. White was affiliated with the Secretary of State's office for seven years. He continued to fulfill that position until March 8, 1893, when he was appointed to serve as the private secretary to West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle. As a representative of Governor MacCorkle, White traveled across the state to high-profile events, such as the June 1895 strikes at the Crozier Works on Elkhorn Creek in McDowell County, to urge calm and to provide the governor with <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> on the strike. White performed as Governor MacCorkle's private secretary for four years until the end of his administration's term in 1897.|$|E

It is very important that applications of smart grid should always be monitored. The wireless sensors in combination with actuators in the smart grid network would significantly advance the existing networks and could perform more comfortable application preferential control actions. The smart grid needs an efficient medium access approach based on the data prioritization and delay responsiveness. The wireless sensor communication within smart grid system is based on data rate, delay, latency, congestion and so on. The data is collected in a reliable and timely manner from the entire system and based on collected data the entire system is monitored for more advanced controlling schemes. This article surveys a sample of algorithms that can be adaptable for smart grid applications. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} spatial mapping for autonomous mobile robots that are to operate among, and interact with, non-expert human users. We argue that our approach of conceptual spatial mapping helps {{bridge the gap between}} the representations needed for low-level control of the robot, and the conceptualtopological representations of space humans have. Our approach maintains spatial knowledge on multiple interconnected layers. We show that a process for map acquisition, human-augmented mapping, which combines bottom-up and top-down influences from different modalities, will yield a rich multi-layered spatial representation. This representation enables the robot to perform complex actions in a human-populated environment. We show that our approach can be used to establish a notion of <b>situational</b> and functional <b>awareness...</b>|$|R
40|$|Training {{emergency}} response decision makers using live, virtual and/or constructive simulations {{can be highly}} complex since certain situations can generate stimulusresponse cycles that depend significantly on unpredictable human judgments. In particular, effective training scenarios require a combination of content contributed via pre-authored scripts and content generated dynamically during the training exercise. Large-scale exercises require multiple domain experts contributing oversight and content to the scenario as it proceeds. Such real-time adaptation requires <b>situational</b> and group <b>awareness</b> based on an understanding of pre-scripted materials and the adaptations of others. This thesis describes the evolution and evaluation of a collaborative graphical timeline system, called the Scenario Timeline System (STS), which facilitates asynchronous and synchronous collaborative timeline management, and its application in large-scale, computer-supported {{emergency response}} training exercises...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} {{of studies on}} mindfulness produced varying theoretical models, each {{based in part on}} how mindfulness is assessed. These models agree, however, that mindfulness encompasses moment-to-moment or situational experiences. Incongruence between dispositional and situational assessment would be problematic for theory and empirical research. In particular, it remains to be established whether situational measurement is an accurate method for mindfulness assessment and whether dispositional measures are able to accurately detect mindfulness skills in various situations. The association between dispositional and situational mindfulness processes (i. e., <b>situational</b> attention <b>awareness</b> and emotion acceptance) was examined in two studies. In Study 1 (N = 148), independent groups who reported high and low levels of dispositional mindfulness skills were compared on a continuous measure of situational mindfulness skills. In Study 2 (N = 317), dispositional mindfulness questionnaires were used to predict situational use of mindfulness skills. Results suggest not only that situational measures accurately detect use of mindfulness skills, but also that dispositional measures can predict one’s use of situational mindfulness skills. Findings from both studies were consistent across both positive and negative situations. Moreover, neither neuroticism nor extraversion was shown to have a moderating effect on the relationship between dispositional and situational use of mindfulness skills. The implications of these findings for clinical practice and future investigations pertaining to measurement validity in this area are discussed...|$|R
