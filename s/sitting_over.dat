5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged onto water after <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an {{area of low pressure}} that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Evelyn Fisher {{wrote of}} how {{women living in}} a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles {{intended}} for Roman Catholic ceremonies to dilate the cervix {{in an effort to}} self-induce abortion. Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, sticks, knives, and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States. Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> a pot of steam into the early 20th century. Abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930.|$|E
25|$|As {{the role}} of the {{orchestra}} and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did {{the role of}} leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the concertmaster, would lead the orchestra while <b>sitting.</b> <b>Over</b> time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of music director became termed the conductor, and a podium was used {{to make it easier for}} all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the orchestra pit and the singers up on stage.|$|E

500|$|At 8:32a.m. {{local time}} {{the next day}} (18 May), an {{earthquake}} measuring magnitude 5.1 rocked the area, triggering the landslide that started the main eruption. In a matter of seconds, vibrations from the earthquake loosened [...] of rock on the mountain's north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With {{the loss of the}} confining pressure of the overlying rock, Mount St. Helens began to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted laterally, sending swift pyroclastic flows down its flanks at near supersonic speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars. Before being struck by a series of flows that, at their fastest, would have taken less than a minute to reach his position, Johnston managed to radio his USGS co-workers with the message: [...] "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" [...] Seconds later, the signal from the radio went silent, and all contact with the geologist was lost. Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and farther north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the ColdwaterII observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly, [...] "Gentlemen, the uh... camper and the car <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> to the south of me is covered. It's gonna get me, too. I can't get out of here..." [...] before his radio went silent.|$|E

2500|$|The Boxkite was a two-bay biplane with an {{elevator}} carried on booms {{in front of}} the wings and [...] an empennage consisting of a pair of fixed horizontal stabilisers, the upper bearing {{an elevator}}, and a pair of rudders carried on booms behind the wing. There were no fixed vertical surfaces. [...] Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both upper and lower wings. These were single-acting, the control cables arranged to pull them down only, relying on the airflow to return them to the neutral position. [...] The wings and [...] fixed rear horizontal surfaces were covered by a single layer of fabric: the other surfaces were covered on both sides. Power was usually provided by a [...] Gnome rotary engine, although other engines were also used. [...] This was mounted on a pair of substantial wooden beams mounted above the lower wing: these continued forward to carry the seats, which were arranged in tandem, with the pilot <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> {{the leading edge of the}} wing. [...] The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long skids, each bearing a pair of wheels sprung by bungee cords, and a single sprung tailskid mounted below the leading edge of the lower tailplane.|$|E
2500|$|On April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors {{aboard the}} Spanish ships noticed {{a group of}} Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly {{abandoned}} camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named “El Robledal," [...] meaning [...] "The Oakgrove" [...] in Spanish. After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, {{the same year as}} the Pez-Sigüenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andrés de Arriola y Guzmán (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the Tristán de Luna y Arellano colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.|$|E

2500|$|Ellison, one of {{only two}} African-American state lawmakers at the time (the other being Rep. Neva Walker of District 61B), became the {{spokesman}} of the DFL group that filed with the Ethics Committee against Lindner. Besides Ellison the group consisted of Representatives Karen Clark, Frank Hornstein (whose mother is a Holocaust survivor), Margaret Anderson Kelliher, Neva Walker, Lyndon Carlson, Ron Latz, and House Minority Leader Matt Entenza. The complaint held “that when Lindner expressed his belief that homosexuals may not have been persecuted during the Nazi Holocaust, his conduct violated ‘accepted norms of House behavior’ and that his comments ‘bring the House into dishonor or disrepute.’” Ellison stated that they sought “censure of Lindner and his removal as chair of the Economic Development and Tourism Division of the House Commerce, Jobs, and Economic Development Policy Committee.” Ellison’s group exhibited letters from out-of-state residents who said they cancelled vacation plans in Minnesota after learning of Lindner's comments. Ellison stated “There’s a question mark hanging over the State Office Building. The question is ‘Do {{the people of the state}} of Minnesota and the legislators that represent them share the viewpoint that people who were victims of Nazi persecution were in fact not victims of Nazi persecution?’ Mr. Lindner has insulted not only the House but members of the community at large.” [...] The Session Weekly reported “‘The fact of the matter is his conduct calls for discipline,’ said Ellison, who added that a censure penalty does not prohibit Lindner from saying what he believes. ‘It would just be a denunciation, a condemnation, of what he said.’” Ellison told Minnesota Public Radio [...] "That question mark <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> this building is whether we represent all the people of this state or not. And whether or not an elected official, a person who holds an election certificate can spout bigoted language, mean-spirited, untrue statements designed to injure members of the community and members of this body. That is the issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] <b>sitting</b> <b>over</b> there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
