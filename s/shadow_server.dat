Rocket Software claims that their <b>Shadow</b> <b>server</b> will allow 99% of the integration processing, such as SQL to non-relational data queries and Web services/SOA workloads, to be zIIP eligible and run {{outside of the}} General Purpose Processor. Ivory Server for z/OS from GT Software, Inc. provides zIIP support for XML parsing, XML payload construction and data conversion processing. Additionally Ivory Server supports the zAAP processor using the optional IBM z/OS XML Services and the IFL processor with zLinux. Ivory Server and Ivory Studio (the Ivory IDE) provide options that allow clients to manage the workload offloaded to the zIIP Specialty CPU from the GP CPU.|$|E
40|$|Infrastructure {{wireless}} network has one big problem, {{especially those that}} open access to the public, such as the security issue is a hotspot, where many attacks {{by one or more}} of the attackers (attacker) fine on server hotspot providers or users. Thus it takes a tack or technical safeguards in order to tackle the problem. The subject of this research is the application of security system {{wireless network}} hotspots. The methods used in this research is the study of the library (Library Research) and observation i. e. doing observations are right against the UAD hospot network. The analysis was carried out to obtain results as well as data that can be used as a reference in order to implement a system of honeypot-based hotspot network security and snort. Habghsil implementation of the system was tested with two methods, namely Alpha and Beta Test test. The results of this research is the combination of the Honeypot and IDS with Honeyd and Snort it provides a layered security system with meengalihkan intruder into the <b>shadow</b> <b>server</b> and detect attacks intended to network hotspots...|$|E

This allows RTR to process multiple transactions on the shadow without compromising dependency violations.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an;approach of {{distributed}} presentation {{architecture of}} thin tlient computing has been proposed. This approach tries {{to achieve its}} goal via object reconstruction. Each widget will have two instances, one is its <b>shadow</b> on the <b>server</b> side, which {{does not have any}} gmphical presentation and the other is on the client side with full gmphical representation. This approach tries to combine two other tmditional approaches, one is web-based approach and the other is remote fmme buffer approach. In our proposed approach, it is ezpected thatithe network tmfic will be less than the remote fmme buffer approach but higher than the web-based approach. For small wireless devices, this approach may be considered as a viable solution to thin client computing. ...|$|R
