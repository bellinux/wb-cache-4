40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} social safety-net programs in Bangladesh run {{by the government and}} nongovernmental organizations to mitigate seasonal deprivation in the country's highly vulnerable northwest region. Specifically, the paper explores whether <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> are limited to averting seasonal deprivation or can also address seasonality of income and employment more generally. Using a recent survey from the greater Rangpur (northwest) region, the paper finds that <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> {{have a positive effect on}} mitigating both seasonal and non-seasonal food deprivation. The results are robust, owing to the recent expanded coverage of social safety-net programs run by nongovernmental organizations active in the region. But given the annual recurrence of monga (seasonal food insecurity) in the northwest region owing to agricultural seasonality and an overwhelming dependence on agriculture for livelihoods, <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> are not a reliable tool for monga eradication. Programs are also needed to promote the income and productivity of the poor through diversification of income and employment. <b>Safety</b> <b>Nets</b> and Transfers,Rural Poverty Reduction,Food&Beverage Industry,Regional Economic Development,Housing&Human Habitats...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} unresolved task of {{the ongoing}} economic transformation in Central European countries is the reformulation of <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> and income transfers to prepare for accession to the European Union.

If Central European states adjust their <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> to those prevailing among the EU members, the results will involve employment-fostering programs, as well as future income transfers, unemployment benefits and other elements not currently provided.

Existing <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets,</b> however, suffer from shortcomings: they often fail to reach the intended target group, they fail to generate a sustained decrease in poverty, they often involve many uncoordinated or duplicative transfer programs, they can be inefficient and costly, and the transfers are often too small.

The advantages and challenges of disability targeting are then discussed. The paper proceeds to analyze different ways {{that can be used}} to include disability considerations in the implementation of mainstream <b>safety</b> <b>nets,</b> through the reduction of physical, communication, and social barriers surrounding such programs, and through the careful design and evaluation of <b>safety</b> <b>nets.</b> The use of disability targeting versus, or in combination with disability mainstreaming is thendiscussed. ...|$|R

These included raising the minimum wage, infrastructure stimulus, and tax reform.|$|E
25|$|However, much {{empirical}} {{research in the}} field of happiness economics, such as that by Benjamin Radcliff, professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, supports the contention that (at least in democratic countries) life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net,</b> pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions. Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.|$|E

25|$|In {{domestic}} politics the government tackled {{the world economic}} crisis by introducing currency controls, and through a comprehensive economic crisis package agreed with Venstre {{in the early months}} of 1933. At the same time a series of social reforms were carried out, which laid the earliest foundations that today's welfare state would be built upon. These reforms created a rudimentary <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net,</b> and did much to lessen the appeal of totalitarian and anti-democratic political movements during the crisis years. The government also enacted a new criminal code in 1930, which abolished capital punishment and de-criminalised homosexuality, and which, although amended many times, remains in force today.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{plentiful}} resources, {{the country}} lacks sustainable pragmatic policies to combat poverty. Hania Sholkamy, an {{economist for the}} Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo, disclosed that although the government had subsidized 270 million loaves of bread/day at 19 Piasters/piece, 29 {{percent of the children}} in Egypt remained malnourished. Although these policies were adopted in an attempt to reduce economic burdens on the poor, they benefited the rich more which caused more problems to the poor and increased the burdens of the government. In fact, 83 percent of food subsidy, 76 percent of electricity subsidy, 87 percent of petroleum subsidy and 76 percent of the <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> subsidy went to the non-poor instead of the poor.|$|E
25|$|Equal {{economic}} opportunity, a base <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> {{provided by}} the welfare state, and strong labor unions have historically been {{at the heart of}} Democratic economic policy. The welfare state supports a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, social security, universal health care, public education, and public housing. They also support infrastructure development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation, while stimulating private sector job creation. Additionally however, since the 1990s the party has at times supported centrist economic reforms, which cut the size of government and reduced market regulations. The party has continuously rejected laissez-faire economics as well as market socialism, instead favoring Keynesian economics within a capitalist market-based system.|$|E

25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself {{has done little to}} reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E
25|$|While the American {{working class}} has {{lost much of}} its {{political}} strength with the decline of labor unions, it remains a stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues as {{an essential part of the}} Democratic base. Today, roughly a third of the American public is estimated to be working class with around 52% being either members of the working or lower classes. Yet, as those with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote, the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of clerical and blue-collar workers. Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net,</b> make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base. The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the majority of those with low incomes and little education vote for the Democratic Party.|$|E
500|$|Friedman argued {{further that}} other {{advantages}} of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system, would be less costly, and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net.</b> Friedman reiterated these arguments 18 years later in Free to Choose, with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced {{the current system of}} welfare programs rather than augment it. According to economist Robert H.

Based on income data, including average presumptive agricultural incomes and state sector wages, there is a significant rise in real income in rural areas and a decline in real income in urban areas.
