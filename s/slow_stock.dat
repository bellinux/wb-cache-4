Property {{owners in the}} villages of Norwood and Pleasant Ridge, wishing to develop their land as suburbs, put forward a proposition to relocate the line to the east through their land in exchange for free right-of-way, and to build a steam dummy line between Norwood and the horse car lines in Walnut Hills, which would provide Miami Valley passengers with a more direct entrance to downtown Cincinnati than the circuitous M However, in August, an even more direct route south of Norwood, through the rugged Deer Creek Valley, was suggested, by which the Miami Valley could obtain its own access to Cincinnati. After imposing heavy restrictions, which would require the construction of several trestles and a tunnel, the Cincinnati City Council granted the right-of-way through the valley, including Eden Park, to the railroad company. The owners of the old CL grade sold it in April 1876 for $8,000 in stock of the new company, {{and most of the}} land outside Cincinnati had been bought by that summer. [...] The Miami Valley resolved in May 1876 to build only north to Waynesville, a village southwest of Xenia, where the projected Waynesville, Port William and Jeffersonville Railroad and Jeffersonville, Mt.

40|$|Recent housing-market {{studies have}} modeled <b>slow</b> <b>stock</b> and price {{adjustment}} with some success. However, the empirical procedures {{used in these}} models break down if housing stocks or prices are driven by stochastic growth. In this paper I suggest an error-correction model for analyzing housing supply and demand under conditions of stochastic growth for a regional housing market. The model {{is applied to the}} housing market in Boulder, Colorado from 1981 through 1995 —a period of rapid growth in housing values in the area. Long-run housing supply and demand are shown to be inelastic with respect to changes in the price of housing. The results indicate that developers respond more accurately to housing-market disequilibrium attributable to supply-side disturbances than to disturbances generated by changes in the demand for housing. On the other hand, price appreciation is driven primarily by demand disturbances. Copyright 2000 Blackwell Publishers...|$|E
40|$|This study, part of {{a broader}} {{investigation}} of the history of exploitation of right whales, Balaena glacialis, in the western North Atlantic, emphasizes U. S. shore whaling from Maine to Delaware (from lat. 45 °N to 38 ° 30 'N) in the period 1620 – 1924. Our broader study of the entire catch history is intended to provide an empirical basis for assessing past distribution and abundance of this whale population. Shore whaling may have begun at Cape Cod, Mass., in the 1620 ’s or 1630 ’s; it was certainly underway there by 1668. Right whale catches in New England waters peaked before 1725, and shore whaling at Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket continued to decline {{through the rest of the}} 18 th century. Right whales continued to be taken opportunistically in Massachusetts, however, until the early 20 th century. They were hunted in Narragansett Bay, R. I., as early as 1662, and desultory whaling continued in Rhode Island until at least 1828. Shore whaling in Connecticut may have begun in the middle 1600 ’s, continuing there until at least 1718. Long Island shore whaling spanned the period 1650 – 1924. From its Dutch origins in the 1630 ’s, a persistent shore whaling enterprise developed in Delaware Bay and along the New Jersey shore. Although this activity was most profi table in New Jersey in the early 1700 ’s, it continued there until at least the 1820 ’s. Whaling in all areas of the northeastern United States was seasonal, with most catches in the winter and spring. Historically, right whales appear to have been essentially absent from coastal waters south of Maine during the summer and autumn. Based on documented references to specific whale kills, about 750 – 950 right whales were taken between Maine and Delaware, from 1620 to 1924. Using production statistics in British customs records, the estimated total secured catch of right whales in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania between 1696 and 1734 was 3, 839 whales based on oil and 2, 049 based on baleen. After adjusting these totals for hunting loss (loss-rate correction factor = 1. 2), we estimate that 4, 607 (oil) or 2, 459 (baleen) right whales were removed from the stock in this region during the 38 -year period 1696 – 1734. A cumulative catch estimate of the stock’s size in 1724 is 1, 100 – 1, 200. Although recent evidence of occurrence and movements suggests that right whales continue to use their traditional migratory corridor along the U. S. east coast, the catch history indicates that this stock was much larger in the 1600 ’s and early 1700 ’s than it is today. Right whale hunting in the eastern United States ended by the early 1900 ’s, and the species has been protected throughout the North Atlantic since the mid 1930 ’s. Among the possible reasons for the relatively <b>slow</b> <b>stock</b> recovery are: the very small number of whales that survived the whaling era to become founders, a decline in environmental carrying capacity, and, especially in recent decades, mortality from ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear...|$|E

The lead offscreen talent had {{all worked}} with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs— cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino, [...] "e had $8 million [...] I {{wanted it to}} look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it {{to look like a}}n epic. It's an epic in everything— in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag." [...] The film, he says, was shot [...] "on 50 ASA film stock, which is the <b>slowest</b> <b>stock</b> they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest thing we have to 50s Technicolor." [...] The largest chunk of the budget— $150,000— went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set. It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in Reservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before Pulp Fictions premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a [...] "story by" [...] credit, so the line [...] "Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino" [...] could be used in advertising and onscreen.|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} a grazing model linking privately optimal stocking rates to their long-term {{impacts on the}} succession of plant species on rangeland. The fast (annual) dynamics of a grazing-decision component are put in phase with the slow (decade-long) dynamics of a plant-succession component via the "slow-manifold " theory of dynamical systems. The model provides the context for analytically approximating "successional thresholds, " partitioning rangeland conditions into those gravitating toward socially desirable or socially undesirable plant compositions over time. These thresholds are instrumental in determining whether grazing management alone can restore rangeland to a socially desired plant composition. Key words: environment, plant succession, rangeland, <b>slow</b> dynamics, <b>stocking</b> rate, threshold analysis. Millions of acres of rangeland in the inter-mountain region of the United States are domi-nated by alien annual grass species ("annuals"), principally cheatgrass (Evans and Young). Cheatgrass is not valueless in livestock produc-tion, but several drawbacks render it less pro-ductive than native perennial grass species ("perennials"), such as bluestem, grama, and bunch grasses. Cheatgrass also promotes sev-eral environmental problems. It is more superfi-cially rooted than the relatively large fibrous root systems of perennials; thus it is not well suited for soil binding. This promotes soil ero-sion that, among other problems, harms riparian habitat for fish and wildlife (Stewart and Hull). Overgrazing of vegetation by livestock is generally identified as the culprit behind the successful invasion of rangeland by annuals. Ungrazed rangeland tends {{to be dominated by}} perennials as understory species to sagebrush. However, selective grazing by livestock on pre-ferred perennials reduces the competitive vigor of these grasses, and thus their ability to with-stand the invasion of the highly competitive an-nuals (Evans and Young).

The increased consumption of shrimp could not occur, of course, without a similar increase in supply. The two sources of supply are land-ings by domestic fishermen and imports from foreign countries. From small beginnings in the 1940 's, domes-tic shrimping has emerged as the leading U. S. fishery, measured in value of landings. By 1968 shrimp landings were valued at about $ 100 million, representing approximately one-fourth of the value of all landings of major U. S. fish-eries.

Other analysts argue that history is no longer a true guide because fundamental changes in the economy have made stocks more attractive to investors, justifying a higher price-earnings ratio. > Shen examines the historical relationship between price-earnings ratios and subsequent stock market performance and discusses why history might not repeat itself this time. She finds strong historical evidence that high price-earnings ratios have been followed by disappointing stock market performance in the short and long term. Specifically, high price-earnings ratios have been followed by slow long-run growth in stock prices. Moreover, when high price-earnings ratios have reduced the earnings yield on stocks relative to returns on other investments, short-run stock market performance has suffered as well. Despite this evidence, however, she concludes that we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} these historical relationships are of little relevance today due to fundamental changes in the economy.

5000|$|Beekeepers in Western {{countries}} have been reporting <b>slow</b> declines of <b>stocks</b> for many years, apparently due to impaired protein production, changes in agricultural practice, or unpredictable weather. In early 2007, abnormally high die-offs (30-70% of hives) of European honey bee colonies occurred in North America; such a decline seems unprecedented in recent history. This has been dubbed [...] "colony collapse disorder" [...] (CCD); {{it is unclear whether}} this is simply an accelerated phase of the general decline due to stochastically more adverse conditions in 2006, or a novel phenomenon. CCD is unique {{due to the lack of}} evidence as to what causes the sudden die-off of adult worker bees, as well as few to no dead bees found around the hive.Research is beginning to determine the causes of CCD, with the weight of evidence leaning towards CCD being a syndrome rather than a disease, as it seems to be caused by a combination of various contributing factors rather than a single pathogen or poison. However, in April 2013, after a report was released by the European Food Safety Authority identifying the significant risks of the class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, the European Union called for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid pesticides. In 2015, an 11-year British study showed a definitive relationship between increasing agricultural use of neonicotinoid and escalating honey bee colony losses at a landscape level. This is the first field study to establish a link between neonicotinoids and CCD.|$|R
40|$|Massive audit {{failures}} {{in the early days}} of the 21 st century led to the passage of one of the most sweeping reforms of public reporting and auditing since the Securities and Exchange Acts were passed {{in the early days of}} the New Deal—the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Passed as emergency legislation focused on <b>slowing</b> the free-falling <b>stock</b> market on the heels of the collapse of Enron and other corporate giants, SOX was enacted to restore confidence in the truthfulness of published financial information, the trustworthiness of the audit process, and the integrity of corporate management. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of SOX legislation on the corporate reporting practices of corporations and how potential changes reflect on the ethics of auditing. Specifically, the research project examines three key elements of corporate reporting: the form of reports provided by corporations (10 -K, traditional free-standing financial statements, or hybrids) and any changes in these reports since 2002, the informativeness of the published financial statement, and the trend in audit fees over the five- year period since the passage of SOX. The results suggest that SOX has in reality resulted in the ethical dilemma called a “Taboo Tradeoff”—companies appear to be substituting 10 -Ks, which are technical and difficult for the average investor to read for traditional reports as a means to offset escalating audit fees. The auditors, who were at the root of the problem, benefit, resulting in what one respondent to the study has defined as “the greatest transfer of societal wealth to a profession” in the history of the United States...|$|R
