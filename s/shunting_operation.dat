40|$|Following subarachnoid hemorrhage, a {{considerable}} number of cases develop disturbances of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. The author studied the criteria of indication of cerebrospinal fluid <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> in clinical cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of intracranial aneurysm. The author conducted (169) Yb-DTPA cisternography in 34 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm, and 0. 3 - 0. 5 mCi of (169) Yb-DTPA was injected by lumbar puncture. Brain scintigrams were taken in various projections at 1, 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours, {{and at the same time}} blood was withdrawn at regular intervals up to the 6 th hour. Then, the transport of (169) Yb-DTPA from the subarachnoid space to the blood was evaluated. Twenty-six cases out of 34 developed disturbance in cerebrospinal fluid dynamics with reflux of (169) Yb-DTPA to the ventricles. Studying further these cases the blood (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve within the period of 1 - 2 hours after (169) Yb-DTPA injection by lumbar puncture, is likely to reflect the (169) Yb-DTPA transport from the intrathecal subarachnoid space to the blood, but cases in which (169) Yb-DTPA absorption from the intrathecal space was poor, had the dilatation of the cerebral ventricles, while those with good absorption except one case had no dilatation. Cases with moderate to marked degree of dilatation of the ventricles, were accompanied with mental, gait disturbance and incontinence, and they were taken the cerebrospinal fluid <b>shunting</b> <b>operation.</b> Cases in which complete lack of cerebral convexity filling of (169) Yb-DTPA was seen in 24 -hour scintigram, were clinically benefited, while cases in which both ventricular dilatation and stasis were seen and moreover convexity filling was observed, were not benefited by <b>shunting</b> <b>operation.</b> From these findings, the considerable dilatation of the ventricles, the ventricular stasis and the complete lack of convexity filling of (169) Yb-DTPA at 24 hours in cisternography, and the malabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid in the intracranial as well as intrathecal space are reliable criteria in determining the indication of the cerebrospinal fluid <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> for the patients with specific clinical symptoms...|$|E

40|$|In trearment of pineal tumors, {{radiotherapy}} with a <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> {{has been}} generally adopted because germinomas {{were the most}} common of pineal tumors, and also because radical resection of these tumors has resulted in high mortality and morbidity.

The authors have recently operated with good results on these recurrent tumors and the residual tumor by infratentorial supracerebellar approach in the concorde position. So, these cases were presented and the treatment for pineal tumor was discussed. Case 1 : A 15 -year-old boy was admitted with increased intracranial pressure (IICP) on May, 1979. Computerized tomography (CT) scans at that time showed pineal and suprasellar tumors with ventricular dissemination. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt followed by radiation therapy was peerformed. The tumors seemed to have almost disappeared after this therapy and the patient continued well until he complained of severe headache and general fatigue in September, 1984. CT scans showed a reccurrent tumor with cystic component. He was operated for the subtotal removal of the tumor on November 26, 1984 and was discharged with slight mental dullness two months postperatively. Histological diagnosis of the specimen was mature teratoma. Case 2 : A 10 -year-old boy was admitted with IICP and in a drowsy state on October 1, 1984.

In rapid transit networks the frequencies are high and distances are relatively short.

What the result indicates is that the DEA cross efficiency evaluating model based on grey incidence analysis can reflect the actual state of the efficiency of shunting locomotives operation in each train service depot. Eventually, based on a projection analysis of non-DEA's three decision-making units, key factors that influence the efficiency of shunting locomotives operation are identified, which can provide decision support for further improvement of the configuration and operation in train service depots...|$|E

It {{is a full}} or partial erection that persists for a period more than 4 hours beyond sexual stimulation and/or orgasm or is unrelated to sexual stimulation. Ischemic priapism should be managed in a step-by-step fashion. Objective: To demonstrate step-by-step management of stuttering refractory ischemic priapism. We report a case of stuttering refractory ischemic priapism. Moreover, we reviewed different approaches to priapism management in the literature. Case presentation: A 53 -year-old male presented with a painful erection of 29 hours’ duration, probably caused by consumption of alcohol. The penile blood gas showed a pH of 7. 08, PCO 2 of 75 mmHg and PO 2 of 39 mmHg. Aspiration was followed by irrigation of an α-adrenergic, Winter and T-shunt operations were preformed, and finally a semi-rigid penile prosthesis was implanted to overcome the refractory stuttering ischemic priapism. Conclusion: In case of stuttering refractory ischemic priapism, immediate implantation of a penile prosthesis is a simple and effective procedure that manages both the acute episode and the inevitable erectile dysfunction that would otherwise occur, while preserving penile length.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the situation of}} rearranging freight trains in a shunting yard with a hump and several tracks. Here, an elementary <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> is to push a all cars of one track over the hump. On {{the way back to}} the tracks the cars can be guided individually to an arbitrary track. The goal is to create one or several trains that have their cars in a particular order. We measure the efficiency of a shunting plan by the number of elementary shunting operations, and to a lesser extent by the total number of car movements. We find optimal shunting operations in the following situations: – The incoming trains are unsorted and the shunting yard has sufficiently many tracks but the length of the tracks is limited (capacities). – The order of the cars in a single incoming train is given, the tracks of the shunting yard are sufficiently long, but there is only a limited number of tracks. In contrast, we show that the following problems are N P-complete: – There are several incoming trains and for each the order of the cars is given, but the order in which to start shunting the trains can be chosen. – There is one train with given order of the cars, and the lengths of the tracks is limited. These results are based on expressing the shunting task as finding a suitable set of codes. The results will perhaps not solve the practical problem directly, but rather provide some first structural insights and complexity limits that can guide the search for practical algorithms. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{utilization}} of the installed power capacity of internal combustion engines (ICE) in motive power units (especially in shunting locomotives and locomotives for industrial transport) is very low. The ICE mean power in this operational mode is about 15 – 20 % of its installed one. The result is that during most of its operational time {{the internal combustion engine}} works in the regimes that are far from optimum mode. It means that the specific fuel consumption is high. Some examples of the measured operational regimes of locomotives in <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> and other motive power units are given in the paper. Kinetic energy of a classic diesel locomotive as well as the DMUs and trains is transformed into thermal energy during the braking process. Normally {{it is not possible to}} utilize this kinetic energy in a reasonable way. The kinetic energy should be transformed into a suitable form and stored for future uses. The improvement can be achieved by using the rail vehicles ’ unconventional traction drive. One of possible ways is the use of a hybrid traction drive. The hybrid drive includes ICE and an energy storage device. In this case, the ICE power can be substantially lower than in the classic traction. The parameters of such traction drive must be based on the analysis of the vehicles ’ real operational regimes. These parameters are the following: ICE power, power of traction motors, capacity and power of energy storage devices (accumulators). There are other ways of improving fuel utilization at railway vehicles, e. g. by better {{utilization of}} heat released from the fuel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a Train Shunting problem which occurs in cargo train organizations: We have a locomotive travelling along a track segment {{and a collection}} of n cars, where each car has a source and a target. Whenever the train passes the source of a car, it needs {{to be added to the}} train, and on the target, the respective car needs to be removed. Any such operation at the end of the train incurs low shunting cost, but adding or removing truly in the interior requires a more complex <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> and thus yields high cost. The objective is to schedule the adding and removal of cars as to minimize the total cost. This problem can also be seen as a relaxed version of the well-known List Update problem, which may be of independent interest. We derive polynomial time algorithms for Train Shunting by reducing this problem to finding independent sets in bipartite graphs. This allows us to treat several variants of the problem in a generic way. Specifically, we obtain an algorithm with running time O(n^{ 5 / 2 }) for the uniform case, where all low costs and all high costs are identical, respectively. Furthermore, for the non-uniform case we have running time of O(n^ 3). Both versions translate to a symmetric variant, where it is also allowed to add and remove cars at the front of the train at low cost. In addition, we formulate a dynamic program with running time O(n^ 4), which exploits the special structure of the graph. Although the running time is worse, it allows us to solve many extensions, e. g., prize-collection, economies of scale, and dependencies between consecutive stations...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. One of the {{priorities}} of station sorting complex functioning improvement is the breaking-up process energy consumptions reduction, namely: fuel consumption for train pushing and electric energy consumption for cut braking. In this regard, an effective solution {{of the problem of}} energy consumption reduction at breaking-up subsystem requires a comprehensive handling of train pushing and cut rolling down processes. At the same time, the analysis showed that the current task of pushing process improvement and cut rolling down effectiveness increase are solved separately. To solve this problem it is necessary to develop the complex simulation model of train breaking up process at humps. Methodology. Pushing process simulation was done based on adapted under the shunting conditions traction calculations. In addition, the features of shunting locomotives work at the humps were taken into account. In order to realize the current pushing mode the special algorithm of hump locomotive controlling, which along with the safety <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> requirements takes into account behavioral factors associated with engineer control actions was applied. This algorithm provides train smooth acceleration and further movement with speed, which is close to the set speed. Hump locomotive fuel consumptions were determined based on the amount of mechanical work performed by locomotive traction. Findings. The simulation model of train pushing process was developed and combined with existing cut rolling down model. Cut initial velocity is determined during simulation process. The obtained initial velocity is used for further cut rolling process modeling. In addition, the modeling resulted in sufficiently accurate determination of the fuel rates consumed for train breaking-up. Originality. The simulation model of train breaking-up process at the humps, which in contrast to the existing models allows reproducing complexly all the elements of this process in detail and evaluate accurately its quality, was improved by the author. Practical value. The developed model can help to determine a rational processing mode of sorting complex.

When compared with a control group of 14 age matched healthy volunteers, the group of NPH patients was characterised by an enlarged subcortical low-flow region, significantly reduced rCBF and enhanced side-to-side asymmetry of rCBF in the central white matter, and enhanced side-to-side asymmetry in the inferior and mid-temporal cortex. Global CBF was normal. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> reduced the mean area of the ventricles on CT and of the subcortical low-flow region on SPECT. Global CBF was unchanged.
