Instead of a hook, they are equipped with a specialized handling tool called a spreader. The spreader can be lowered on top of a container and locks onto the container's four locking points ("corner castings") using a twistlock mechanism. Cranes normally transport a single container at once, but some newer cranes have the capability to pick up two to four 20-foot containers at once.|$|E

[...] These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers {{reduce the amount of}} boilerplate code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.|$|E

While available models and evaluation techniques provide valuable input to decision-making, the complex nature of urban water systems requires more than just social and economic criteria to be considered as part of decision <b>support</b> <b>frameworks.</b> The authors believe that current decision <b>support</b> <b>frameworks</b> need to be presented in a way that incorporates adaptive management and integrated urban water management strengths at the strategic and operational level.

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} clinical effectiveness of our proposed clinical decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> through clinical case {{studies in the}} cardiovascular domain. The proposed ontology and machine learning driven hybrid clinical decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> exploits functionality provided by each of its key components. Moreover, it brings/integrate them together in an intelligent manner to deliver a cost effective, holistic and efficient cardiovascular clinical risk assessment mechanism. The proposed clinical decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> could also be utilised in the clinical risk assessment of other chronic illnesses. We have also explained the functionality of a comparative machine learning and feature selection techniques, used {{in the development of}} the prognostic system. The MLDPS is validated by clinical domain experts in the RACPC, heart disease and breast cancer domains.|$|R

40|$|Software is an {{indispensable}} {{part of our}} modern lifestyle. Users of software in business and society rely on software to support the tasks they need to, or want to achieve. Unfortunately, software fails, and the human and economic consequences can be devastating. High quality software can help minimise the consequences of software failures. Software testing {{is one way to}} improve software quality, and thereby provide high quality software. A comprehensive review of the literature has shown that, within the parameters of the boundary and focus of this research, support for test managersâ€™ decision making in software testing is scarce. In particular, research addressing decision support for the software test manager is especially lacking in planning and risk management of successful software testing. This research investigates the need for a decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> for software test managers: with a focus on the planning and risk management done by software test managers for successful software testing. The research findings developed during this project are based on concepts, issues and ideas, grounded in evidence, reasons, and experience. The major contribution of this research is the development and application of a decision <b>support</b> <b>framework.</b> Software test managers can use the decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> in assisting them to plan and provide risk management for successful software testing. The research contribution falls into two parts. The first part is the design and development of a decision <b>support</b> <b>framework,</b> which is described and discussed. The components of the framework are detailed, and the topology of those components is illustrated graphically. The second part of the research contribution is the application of the decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> by software test managers, establishing a basis for risk management. Application of the decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> is a two-step procedure. The software test manager first assigns relevant input to the framework, and this input allows the test manager to use the framework to model their particular software testing situation, set {{in the context of their}} organisation. Next, the software test manager using one or more analytical techniques, developed from two different evaluation perspectives, evaluates the model built in the first application step. The analytical techniques are presented and their potential use by software test managers is illustrated. In summary, this research has produced a decision <b>support</b> <b>framework,</b> a practical and useful tool for the software test manager to plan for and manage the risk in successful software testing. It is envisaged that software test managers can apply the decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> to their specific organisational and software testing circumstances...|$|R

50|$|Hericium is a genus of edible {{mushrooms}} in the Hericiaceae family. Species in this genus are white and fleshy and grow on dead or dying wood; fruiting bodies resemble {{a mass of}} fragile icicle-like spines that are suspended from either a branched <b>supporting</b> <b>framework</b> or from a tough, unbranched cushion of tissue. This distinctive structure has earned Hericium species a variety of common namesâ€”monkey's head, lion's mane, and bear's head are examples. Taxonomically, this genus was previously placed within the order Aphyllophorales, but recent molecular studies now place it in the Russulales.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{resources}} {{management in}} Thailand requires {{consideration of the}} trade-off related to social, economic and environmental outcomes of resource use decisions. This type of decision making also requires coordination of various government agencies engaged in areas associated with the management of these resources. This paper describes the decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> being developed {{as a part of}} the second phase of the IWRAM project. This project involves the coordination and collaboration of a wide range of government agencies in the development and application of a decision <b>support</b> <b>framework,</b> with teams of researchers working both in Thailand and Australia. The decision <b>support</b> <b>framework</b> considers issues such as the impact of deforestation on streamflow, erosion and household income and subsistence production. This allows the trade-off relating to various management scenarios to be considered. The framework further develops concepts arising from Stage 1 of the IWRAM project, in such as way as to allow the decision support tool to be used by extension officers of key agencies in Thailand...|$|R

A term previously used for UIP in the British literature is cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, a term that has fallen out of favor since the basic underlying pathology is now thought to be fibrosis, not inflammation.|$|E
