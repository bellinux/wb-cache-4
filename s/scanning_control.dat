We explored whether olfactory identification is related to in vivo measures of Aβ burden using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET. Nineteen control, 24 aMCI, and 20 AD participants completed an olfactory identification task and underwent PiB PET <b>scanning.</b> <b>Control</b> participants performed better on olfactory identification and showed lower PiB binding than aMCI patients.

40|$|Fast-continuous-rotation is an {{effective}} measure to improve the scanning speed and decrease the radiation dose for cone-beam CT. However, because of acceleration and deceleration of the motor, {{as well as the}} response lag of the <b>scanning</b> <b>control</b> terminals to the host PC, uneven-distributed and redundant projections are inevitably created, which seriously decrease the quality of the reconstruction images. In this paper, we first analyzed the aspects of the theoretical sequence chart of the fastcontinuous- rotation mode. Then, an optimized sequence chart was proposed by extending the rotation angle span to ensure the effective 2 pi-span projections were situated in the stable rotation stage. In order to match the rotation angle with the projection image accurately, structure similarity (SSIM) index was used as a control parameter for extraction of the effective projection sequence which was exactly the complete projection data for image reconstruction.

40|$|A {{differential}} phase scanning acoustic microscope (DP-SAM) was developed, fabricated, and tested in this project. This includes the acoustic lens and transducers, driving and receiving electronics, scanning stage, scanning software, and display software. This DP-SAM can produce mechanically raster-scanned acoustic microscopic images of {{differential phase}}, differential amplitude, or amplitude {{of the time}} gated returned echoes of the samples. The differential phase and differential amplitude images provide better image contrast over the conventional amplitude images. A specially designed miniature dual beam lens was used to form two foci to obtain the differential phase and amplitude information of the echoes. High image resolution (1 micron) was achieved by applying high frequency (around 1 GHz) acoustic signals to the samples and placing two foci {{close to each other}} (1 micron). Tone burst was used in this system to obtain a good estimation of the phase differences between echoes from the two adjacent foci. The system {{can also be used to}} extract the V(z) acoustic signature. Since two acoustic beams and four receiving modes are available, there are 12 possible combinations to produce an image or a V(z) scan. This provides a unique feature of this system that none of the existing acoustic microscopic systems can provide for the micro-nondestructive evaluation applications.

40|$|Dual-energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) imaging {{is considered}} to provide a valid and reliable estimation of body composition when stringent scanning protocols are adopted. However, applied practitioners are not always able to achieve this level of control and the subsequent impact on measurement precision is not always taken into account when evaluating longitudinal body composition changes. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to establish the reliability of DXA in an applied elite sport setting to investigate whether real body composition changes can be detected. Additionally, the performance implications of these changes during the training year were investigated. Forty-eight well-trained athletes (from four diverse sports) underwent two DXA scans using a ‘real-world’ approach (with limited pre <b>scan</b> <b>controls),</b> typically within 48 h, to quantify typical error of measurement (TEM). Twenty-five athletes underwent further scans, before and after specific training and competition blocks. ‘True’ body composition changes were evaluated using 2 xTEM thresholds. Twelve bob skeleton athletes also performed countermovement jump and leg press tests at each time point. Many ‘true’ body composition changes were detected and coincided with the primary training emphases (e. g., lean mass gains during hypertrophy-based training). Clear relationships (r ± 90 % CI) were observed between performance changes (countermovement jump and leg press) and changes in lean mass (0. 53 ± 0. 26 and 0. 35 ± 0. 28, respectively) and fat mass (0. 44 ± 0. 27 and 0. 37 ± 0. 28, respectively).
