5000|$|A {{distinctive}} {{sound of}} some Native American flutes, particularly traditional flutes, {{is called the}} [...] "warble" [...] (or [...] "warbling").The <b>warble</b> <b>sounds</b> as if the flute is vacillating {{back and forth between}} distinct pitches. However, it is actually the sound of different harmonic components of same sound coming into dominance at different times.|$|R
50|$|Pufflings: A sub-species {{of smaller}} Popples.

50|$|Multiphonics is the {{technique}} of playing more than one note at once. A special fingering combination causes the instrument to vibrate at two different pitches alternately, creating a <b>warbling</b> <b>sound.</b> A similar effect can also be created by 'humming' while playing a note, although not very popular it is still used by musicians who can master it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rima! Rima!" [...] I called, and {{instantly}} my call was repeated like an echo. Again and again I called, {{and still the}} words flew back to me, and I could not decide whether it was an echo or not. Then I gave up calling; and presently the low, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound</b> was repeated, and I knew that Rima was somewhere near me.|$|R
60|$|No sooner was it dark {{than all}} {{were in bed}} and asleep; not one square path of yellow light was visible. To enjoy the {{sensation}} I went out and sat down, and listened alone to the liquid rippling, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound</b> of the swift-flowing streamlet--that sweet low music of running water to which the reed-warbler had listened thousands of years ago, striving to imitate it, until his running rippling song was perfect.|$|R
50|$|The South Korean {{government}} broadcasts several bizarre-sounding jamming <b>sounds</b> (usually <b>warbling</b> or chugging) in {{an attempt}} to prevent their citizens from hearing radio broadcasts from the North. The medium-wave jamming by the South is sometimes too weak to completely block the North Korean broadcasts (the jamming transmission power seems to be between 20 and 50 kilowatts, while the targeted North Korean transmissions are of much higher transmission power—typically over 500 kilowatts). Using a decent quality radio, a listener can sometimes nullify the South Korean jammer by re-orienting the set so its ferrite antenna points in a different direction. On shortwave, jamming is not as severe; only a very few North Korean frequencies are slightly jammed. FM jamming is also carried out, but it is not very effective.|$|R
60|$|A soft, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound,</b> {{uttered by}} no bird, {{came up from}} the shadowy bushes far below; and in that {{direction}} I ran on; then pausing, called again. The sweet sound was repeated once more, but much lower down now, and so faintly that I scarcely heard it. And when I went on further and called again and again, there was no reply, and I {{knew that she had}} indeed gone on that long journey alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} tremolo-tuned harmonica {{is that it has}} two reeds per note, with one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. This provides a unique wavering or <b>warbling</b> <b>sound</b> created by the two reeds being slightly out of tune with each other and the difference in their subsequent waveforms interacting with each other (its beat). The Asian version, which can produce all 12 semitones, is used often in East Asian rock and pop music.|$|R
60|$|Again that low, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound,</b> {{or series}} of sounds, {{seemingly}} {{from a distance}} of a few yards. I was not disturbed at her not replying in Spanish: she had always spoken it somewhat reluctantly, and only when at my side; but when calling to me from some distance she would return instinctively to her own mysterious language, and call to me as bird calls to bird. I knew that she was inviting me to follow her, but I refused to move.|$|R
60|$|So great was {{my desire}} to possess the clothes that I was about to double the offer, which struck me as poor, and add that I would give ten sovereigns; but when I had spoken he dropped the piece he held in his hand upon the table, and stared fixedly at me, {{assisted}} by all the others. Presently, in the profound silence which ensued, a low, silvery gurgling became audible, as of some merry mountain burn--a sweet, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound,</b> swelling louder by degrees until it ended in a long ringing peal of laughter.|$|R
5000|$|Wood plays both {{upright and}} {{electric}} basses. One technique he uses on the upright bass involves using a drumstick as a slide near {{the bridge of}} the bass. Wood bows between the drumstick and the bridge to produce a high-pitched, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound,</b> similar to a theremin. Wood is also known to insert a sheet of notation paper behind and between the strings of his bass which creates a unique [...] "snare bass" [...] sound, an adaption of a technique devised on the double bass by Bertram Turetzky. This is featured on the Medeski, Martin, and Wood recording of [...] "Paper Bass" [...] on the album [...] "Friday Afternoon in the Universe" [...] (1995).|$|R
5000|$|Tremolo harmonicas are {{a type of}} harmonica, {{distinct}} {{by having}} two reeds per note. In a tremolo harmonica the two reeds are tuned slightly off a reference pitch, one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. This gives a unique wavering or <b>warbling</b> <b>sound</b> created by the two reeds being not exactly in tune {{with each other and}} difference in their subsequent waveforms acting against one another. The degree of beating can be varied depending on the desired effect. Instruments where the beating is faster due to the reeds being farther apart from the reference pitch are called [...] "wet", whereas those where the beating is slower and less noticeable due to the reeds being more closely in tune are called [...] "dry".|$|R
5000|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, Spin {{described the}} album as [...] "a pleasure, {{but not a}} revelation." [...] and that [...] "almost all the tunes are instantly catchy, if not especially inspired."Spin praised the groups vocalist stating that [...] "in lead singer Aimee Mann {{they may have a}} star. ... she has her own look and a voice that's evocative, thought not yet distinctive enough to stake out its own turf in the crowded field of female vocalists." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a B- rating, stating that the group rolls [...] "out synth-pop hooks like vintage A Flock of Seagulls, but Aimee Mann's throaty <b>warble</b> <b>sounds</b> almost human. And while the generalization level of her aggressively banal lyrics signals product, not expression, every one lands square on a recognizable romantic cliché." ...|$|R
50|$|The grey-hooded parakeet is a gregarious bird, forming small {{flocks of}} about twenty birds, several of which groups may gather {{together}} at watering places. The flocks roam the countryside in rapid low, undulating flight, sometimes resting {{on top of}} or among the branches of shrubs and small trees, making twittering and <b>warbling</b> <b>sounds</b> rather similar to those made by a barn swallow. They feed in low vegetation, consuming grass seeds, seeds of plants in the aster family, berries and fruits, also foraging {{on the ground for}} fallen seeds and fruits. Breeding takes place in November. The nest is situated in a hole excavated in an earth bank, in a crevice, in a hole in a cactus or sometimes in a ruined building. Several nests are sometimes grouped together semi-colonially. Clutches are usually of four or five eggs.|$|R
60|$|I {{was glad}} {{enough to go}} with her then; and for the next two hours we rambled {{together}} in the wood; that is, together in her way, for though always near she contrived to keep out of my sight most of the time. She was evidently now in a gay, frolicsome temper; again and again, when I looked closely into some wide-spreading bush, or peered behind a tree, when her calling voice had sounded, her rippling laughter would come to me from some other spot. At length, somewhere about the centre of the wood, she led me to an immense mora tree, growing almost isolated, covering with its shade a large space of ground entirely free from undergrowth. At this spot she all at once vanished from my side; and after listening and watching some time in vain, I sat down beside the giant trunk to wait for her. Very soon I heard a low, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound</b> which seemed quite near.|$|R
60|$|Early {{next day}} I {{was back in}} the wood full of {{delightful}} anticipations, and had no sooner got well among the trees than a soft, <b>warbling</b> <b>sound</b> reached my ears; it was like that heard on the previous day just before catching sight of the girl among the ferns. So soon! thought I, elated, and with cautious steps I proceeded to explore the ground, hoping again to catch her unawares. But I saw nothing; and only after beginning to doubt that I had heard anything unusual, and had sat down to rest on a rock, the sound was repeated, soft and low as before, very near and distinct. Nothing more was heard at this spot, but an hour later, in another place, the same mysterious note sounded near me. During my remaining time in the forest I was served many times in the same way, and still nothing was seen, nor was there any change in the voice.|$|R
50|$|The Sula hanging parrot {{is usually}} present in areas below 450 meters in old-growth forest, {{secondary}} forest, near agricultural land with scattered trees, plantations, and forest edges. It is usually found singly {{or in small}} groups. Pairs usually nest in tree and stump burrows, as they prefer narrow, long burrows with small holes. To carry back nesting materials to build a nest inside the burrow, this species tucks in materials such as small twigs under its wing and then carries it back to their nesting site. Breeding usually takes place from January to April while a second season happens from July to September. During breeding season the male performs an elaborate courtship display to attract a female. In the display, the male approaches the female with small steps and hops while making a <b>warbling</b> <b>sound.</b> He also extends his neck to show of his blue throat patch while raising his rump, displaying his tail feathers. The species also engages in courtship feeding. Females lay a clutch of 2 to 4 eggs. The female incubate the eggs for approximately 20 days while the male feeds her. Eggs are usually 15 - 18 mm long. Young birds fledge at around 32 days of age and are usually fully independent in 10-11 days.|$|R
40|$|The warble song of male budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) is an {{extraordinarily}} complex, multi-syllabic, learned vocalization that is produced continuously in streams lasting {{from a few}} seconds to a few minutes without obvious repetition of particular patterns. As a follow-up of the warble analysis of Farabaugh et al. (1992), an automatic categorization program based on neural networks was developed and used to efficiently and reliably classify more than 25, 000 warble elements from 4 budgerigars. The relative proportion of the resultant seven basic acoustic groups and one compound group is similar across individuals. Budgerigars showed higher discriminability of warble elements drawn from different acoustic categories and lower discriminability of warble elements drawn from the same category psychophysically, suggesting that they form seven perceptual categories corresponding to those established acoustically. Budgerigars also perceive individual voice characteristics in addition to the acoustic measures delineating categories. Acoustic analyses of long sequences of natural warble revealed that the elements were not randomly arranged and that warble has at least a 5 th-order Markovian structure. Perceptual experiments provided convergent evidence that budgerigars are able to master a novel sequence between 4 and 7 elements in length. Through gradual training with chunking (about 5 elements), birds are able to master sequences up to 50 elements. The ability of budgerigars to detect inserted targets taken in a long, running background of natural warble sequences appears to be species-specific and related to the acoustic structure of <b>warble</b> <b>sounds...</b>|$|R
60|$|In this {{direction}} I had been pushing resolutely on for over half an hour, finding it no easy matter {{to make my}} way without constantly deviating to this side or that from the course I wished to keep, when I came to a much more open spot. The trees were smaller and scantier here, owing to the rocky nature of the ground, which sloped rather rapidly down; but it was moist and overgrown with mosses, ferns, creepers, and low shrubs, all of the liveliest green. I could not see many yards ahead owing to the bushes and tall fern fronds; but presently I began to hear a low, continuous sound, which, when I had advanced twenty or thirty yards further, I made {{out to be the}} gurgling of running water; and at the same moment I made the discovery that my throat was parched and my palms tingling with heat. I hurried on, promising myself a cool draught, when all at once, above the soft dashing and gurgling of the water, I caught yet another sound--a low, warbling note, or succession of notes, which might have been emitted by a bird. But it startled me nevertheless--bird-like <b>warbling</b> <b>sounds</b> had come to mean so much to me--and pausing, I listened intently. It was not repeated, and finally, treading with the utmost caution so as not to alarm the mysterious vocalist, I crept on until, coming to a greenheart with a quantity of feathery foliage of a shrub growing about its roots, I saw that just beyond the tree the ground was more open still, letting in the sunlight from above, and that the channel of the stream I sought was in this open space, about twenty yards from me, although the water was still hidden from sight. Something else was there, which I did see; instantly my cautious advance was arrested. I stood gazing with concentrated vision, scarcely daring to breathe lest I should scare it away.|$|R
60|$|After {{the middle}} of June the common began to attract me more and more. It was so {{extensive}} that, standing on its border, just beyond the last straggling cottages and orchards, the further side was seen only as a line of blue trees, indistinct in the distance. As I grew to know it better, adding each day to my list from its varied bird life, the woods and waterside were visited less and less frequently, and after the bird-scaring noises began in the village, its wildness and quiet became increasingly grateful. The silence of nature was broken only by bird sounds, and the most frequent sound {{was that of the}} yellow bunting, as, perched motionless on the summit of a gorse bush, his yellow head conspicuous at a considerable distance, he emitted his thin monotonous chant at regular intervals, like a painted toy-bird that sings by machinery. There, too, sedentary as an owl in the daytime, the corn bunting was common, discharging his brief song at intervals--a sound as of shattering glass. The whinchat was rarely seen, but I constantly met the small, prettily coloured stonechat flitting from bush to bush, following me, and never ceasing his low, querulous tacking chirp, anxious for the safety of his nest. Nightingales, blackcaps and white-throats also nested there, and were louder and more emphatic in their protests when approached. There were several grasshopper-warblers on the common, all, very curiously as it seemed to me, clustered at one spot, so that one could ramble over miles of ground without hearing their singular note; but on approaching the place they inhabited one gradually became conscious of a mysterious trilling buzz or whirr, low at first and growing louder and more stridulous, until the hidden singers were left behind, when by degrees it sank lower and lower again, and ceased to be audible at a distance of about one hundred yards from the points where it had sounded loudest. The birds hid in clumps of furze and bramble so near together that the area covered by the buzzing sound measured about two hundred yards across. This most singular <b>sound</b> (for a <b>warbler</b> to make) is certainly not ventriloquial, although if one comes to it with the sense of hearing disorganized by town noises or unpractised, one is at a loss to determine the exact spot it comes from, or even to know from which side it comes. While emitting its prolonged sound the bird is so absorbed in its own performance that it is not easily alarmed, and will sometimes continue singing with a human listener standing within four or five yards of it. When one is near the bird, and listens, standing motionless, the effect on the nerves of hearing is very remarkable, considering the smallness of the sound, which, without being unpleasant, is somewhat similar to that produced by the vibration of the brake of a train; it is not powerful enough to jar the nerves, but appears to pervade the entire system. Lying still, with eyes closed, and three or four of these birds singing near, so that their strains overlap and leave no silent intervals, the listener can imagine that the sound originates within himself; that the numberless fine cords of his nervous network tremble responsively to it.|$|R
