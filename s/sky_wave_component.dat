For a long period, the sky-wave over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) has {{difficulty}} in detecting ship under {{the background of}} sea clutter, {{and it is difficult}} to apply the existing sea clutter model established in surface wave propagation mode to the sky-wave OTHR sea clutter suppression. Therefore, the difference between surface <b>wave</b> and <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> propagation mode is analyzed firstly, then the scope of grazing angle about <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> beam is calculated, finally the backscattering coefficients of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from sea surface are derived by perturbation method and the backscattering mechanisms of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from sea surface are analyzed. Results show that the mechanisms observe Bragg scattering mechanism. The backscattering coefficients of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from sea surface which are given in this paper for the first time are significant for sky-wave OTHR sea clutter suppression...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a possible}} explanation {{for some of the}} time variations of the night-time <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> at distances between 80 and 160 km from low-medium-frequency transmitters. In the postulated model this variation is explained in terms of interference between the signals travelling along many paths from the transmitter to the receiver via a lower ionosphere disturbed by the passage of a ducted acoustic wave. A rigorous solution to this model is not possible, but by using reasonable approximations a solution is obtained which is suitable for analysing experimental records of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> variations. These experimental records were obtained by using an interferometer technique to separate the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from the ground wave. Some extremely good agreement was found between theory and experiment showing that this could be a useful technique for studying ducted acoustic waves. Certainly some, at least, of the variations commonly observed in the night-time <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> signal are caused in this way...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} ray {{theory and}} transfer matrix method-based {{model for a}} lightning electromagnetic pulse (LEMP) propagating in Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG) is proposed and tested. The model involves the presentation of a lightning source, parameterization of the lower ionosphere, derivation of a transfer function representing all effects of EIWG on LEMP <b>sky</b> <b>wave,</b> and determination of attenuation mode of the LEMP ground wave. The lightning source is simplified as an electric point dipole standing on Earth surface with finite conductance. The transfer function for the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> is derived based on ray theory and transfer matrix method. The attenuation mode for the ground wave is solved from Fock's diffraction equations. The model is then applied to several lightning sferics observed in central China during day and night times within 1000 km. The {{results show that the}} model can precisely predict the time domain <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> for all these observed lightning sferics. Both simulations and observations show that the lightning sferics in nighttime has a more complicated waveform than in daytime. Particularly, when a LEMP propagates from east to west (Phi = 270 degrees) and in nighttime, its <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> tends to be a double-peak waveform (dispersed <b>sky</b> <b>wave)</b> rather than a single peak one. Such a dispersed <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> in nighttime may be attributed to the magneto-ionic splitting phenomenon in the lower ionosphere. The model provides us an efficient way for retrieving the electron density profile of the lower ionosphere and hence to monitor its spatial and temporal variations via lightning sferics.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} retrieving individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> in a multi-directional sea wave model. To solve this problem, a currently and commonly used method is three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3 D DFT) {{on the radar}} image sequence. However, the uniform frequency and the uniform wavenumber in a wavenumber frequency domain can not always strictly satisfy the dispersion relation, and the spectral leakage in both temporal and spatial domains exists due to the limited analysis area selected from an image sequence. As a result, the DFT method incurs undesirable error performance in retrieving directional <b>wave</b> <b>components.</b> By deeply investigating the data structure of the multi-directional sea wave model, we obtain a new and decomposable matrix representation for processing the <b>wave</b> <b>components.</b> Then, a novel successive cancellation method is proposed to efficiently and effectively extract individual <b>wave</b> <b>components,</b> whose frequency and wavenumber rigorously satisfy the liner dispersion relation. Thus, it avoids spectral leakage in the spatial domain. The algorithm is evaluated by using linear synthetic wave image sequences. The validity of the proposed novel algorithm is verified by comparing the retrieved parameters of amplitude, phase, {{and direction of the}} individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> with the simulated parameters as well as those obtained by using the 3 D DFT method. In addition, the reconstructed sea field using the retrieved <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> is also compared with the simulated remote sensing images as well as those attained using the inverse 3 D DFT method. All the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is more effective and has better performance for retrieving individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> from the spatio-temporal remote sensing image sequences than the 3 D DFT method...|$|R

The parameters of a typical AM broadcast antenna are presented first. Then the design proposed by Richard L. Biby is studied by numerical modeling with the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC). Biby's proposed design involves a ring of short radiators with a conventional monopole operating over finite ground. To analyze the behaviour of Biby's proposed ASW antenna, a generic radiator study is conducted to test the ability of different sized radiators to launch the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> and the ground wave first as isolated elements and then as closely coupled radiators with cancelling phasing.

40|$|The {{propagation}} data of JG 2 AS 40 kHz (Japanese Standard Frequency), Loran C 100 kHz radio waves, and meteorological {{data were analyzed}} to study the association of propagation characteristics of LF radio waves with the atmospheric circulation in the mesosphere. The monthly averaged electric fields were depicted on the complex plane for typical summer and winter months, June and November. The locus traced out by the electric field vector during daytime is nearly circular. This is because during daytime the amplitude of the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> remains nearly constant while its phase changes {{in accord with the}} height change of the reflection layer, and thus the electric field vector traces out a circular locus with its center {{at the tip of the}} supposed ground wave vector. The locus has a loop during the sunrise or sunset period, which seems to arise from interference of two waves reflected by two different layers. In June the amplitude of the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> decreases rapidly before the dawn or increases after the dusk. In November such rapid change is not observed. During nighttime, the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> phase changes in such a way as to suggest that the reflection height moves upwards with time before midnight or lowers after midnight in November. In June it changes similarly before midnight, but after midnight it varies erratically. These characteristics are closely related to the structure of the D region, which is clearly shown by simulating the loci traced out by electric fields...|$|R

The magnitudes of the residual undulations are also investigated for mono-, bi- and multichromatic waves over different time segments. Several sets of wave data are analysed to perceive the energy due to natural frequency of the basin, energy transferred to the side bands and the damping rate of the residual waves in the tank with respect to the chosen incident wave conditions. In the analysis it is observed that the energy damping rate varies with the incident wave condition but seems much faster than that of 20 minutes traditional waiting time in between two runs in the OEB. The energies for tank's natural frequency components and other free waves were found to be very small compare to the incident primary wave energies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{electron}} correlation {{on different}} pairing symmetries {{are discussed in}} details where the electron correlation has been treated within the slave boson formalism. It is shown that for a pure s or pure d wave pairing symmetry, the electronic correlation suppresses the s wave gap magnitude (as well as the T_c) {{at a faster rate}} than that for the d wave gap. On the otherhand, a complex order parameter of the form (s+id) shows anomalous temperature dependence. For example, if the temperature (T_c^d) at which the d <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> of the complex order parameter vanishes happens to be larger than that for the s <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> (T_c^s) then the growth of the d <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> is arrested with the onset of the s <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> of the order parameter. In this mixed phase however, we find that the suppression in different components of the gap as well as the corresponding T_c due to coulomb correlation are very sensitive to the relative pairing strengths of s and d channels as well as the underlying lattice. Interestingly enough, in such a scenario (for a case of T_c^s > T_c^d) the gap magnitude of the d <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> increases with electron correlation but not T_c^d for certain values of electron correlation. However, this never happens in case of the s <b>wave</b> <b>component.</b> We also calculate the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap along both the high symmetry directions (Γ - M and Γ - X) in a mixed s+id symmetry pairing state and the thermal variation of the gap anisotropy (Δ_Γ - M/Δ_Γ - X) with electron correlation. The results are discussed with reference to experimental observations. Comment: 22 pages, latex, 12 figures (attached in ps /eps) Journal : Accepted for publication in Euro. J. Phys...|$|R
