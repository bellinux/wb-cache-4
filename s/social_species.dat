5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5|$|The larvae of wasps {{resemble}} maggots, and are {{adapted for}} life in a protected environment; {{this may be the}} body of a host organism or a cell in a nest, where the larva either eats the provisions left for it or, in <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> is fed by the adults. Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably so that they do not foul their cell).|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a <b>social</b> <b>species</b> and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal is a <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> the basic social unit of {{which consists of}} a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E
5|$|The egg is {{generally}} oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In {{the case of}} solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In <b>social</b> <b>species</b> of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from {{a hole in the}} ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E

50|$|B. lecheguana {{belongs to}} the Epiponini tribe of Polistinae wasps, {{sometimes}} referred to as Polybiinae wasps. It is a Neotropical <b>social</b> wasp <b>species</b> that falls under the genus Brachygastra.|$|R
5|$|A few spider {{species that}} build webs live {{together}} in large colonies and show social behavior, although not as complex as in social insects. Anelosimus eximius (in the family Theridiidae) can form colonies of up to 50,000 individuals. The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality: all known American species are social, and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social. Members of other species {{in the same family}} but several different genera have independently developed social behavior. For example, although Theridion nigroannulatum belongs to a genus with no other <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> T. nigroannulatum build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co-operate in prey capture and share food. Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species (family Uloboridae), Agelena consociata (family Agelenidae) and Mallos gregalis (family Dictynidae). Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites ("thieves"), and larger colonies are more successful in this. The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings. Even widow spiders (genus Latrodectus), which are notoriously cannibalistic, have formed small colonies in captivity, sharing webs and feeding together.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many <b>social</b> <b>species</b> pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
50|$|In many <b>social</b> insect <b>species,</b> <b>social</b> {{behavior}} {{can increase the}} disease resistance of animals. This phenomenon, called social immunity, exists in carpenter ants. It is mediated through the feeding of other individuals by regurgitation. The regurgitate can have antimicrobial activity, which would be spread amongst members of the colony. Some proteases with antimicrobial activity {{have been found to}} exist in regurgitated material. Communal sharing of immune response capability is likely to play a large role in colonial maintenance during highly pathogenic periods.|$|R
25|$|Mate {{selection}} is quite complex and accompanied with much social {{play in the}} Corvidae. Youngsters of <b>social</b> corvid <b>species</b> undergo a series of tests, including aerobatic feats, before being accepted as a mate by the opposite sex.|$|R
50|$|According to its website, IUCN {{works on}} the {{following}} themes: business, climate change, economics, ecosystems, environmental law, forest conservation, gender, global policy, marine and polar, protected areas, science and knowledge, <b>social</b> policy, <b>species,</b> water and world heritage.|$|R
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, be it a solitary or <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests {{on the underside of}} leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that sexual {{activity}} plays a large part in the interaction of <b>social</b> <b>species.</b> Joan Roughgarden, in her book Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People, postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other <b>social</b> <b>species.</b> She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.|$|E

5000|$|Anelosimus eximius are {{classified}} as a <b>social</b> spider <b>species</b> because they engage in shared brood care and cooperate to capture prey within their web, which allows them to capture prey much larger than a single individual would be able to.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{dress code}} of paper wasps, {{like that of}} humans, is related to their <b>social</b> habits: <b>species</b> with a {{flexible}} nest-founding strategy have highly variable black-and-yellow markings.

25|$|Coalitionary {{violence}} {{has also been}} observed in <b>social</b> <b>species</b> besides humans, including other primates. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) males demonstrate similar violent behavior: groups of males form coalitions that patrol the borders of their territory and attack neighboring bands. Chimpanzees also have patrilocal living patterns, which aid with forming close coalitions, as all males are likely kin.|$|E
25|$|As {{humans are}} a highly <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> {{there are many}} {{adaptive}} problems associated with navigating the social world (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making). Researchers in the emerging field of evolutionary social psychology have made many discoveries pertaining to topics traditionally studied by social psychologists, including person perception, social cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, group dynamics, leadership, motivation, prejudice, intergroup relations, and cross-cultural differences.|$|E
25|$|Highly unusual among spiders, {{the flat}} huntsman spider is a <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> even sharing prey. They are often found under loose bark (their flat shape is an {{adaption}} for this) in colonies up to 300, {{but they are}} highly aggressive and commonly cannibalistic toward members from other colonies. They hunt their food rather than spin webs for it. They are timid towards humans and bites are infrequent, and when they occur, symptoms are usually very minor.|$|E
30|$|These {{observations}} {{suggest that}} bats may potentially use this sexual dimorphism in echolocation pulse parameters for <b>social</b> communication and <b>species</b> and sex identification.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} <b>social</b> ant <b>species,</b> in acrobat ants a queen mates {{with a single}} male during a nuptial flight. During this flight, the winged queen and winged male will mate, and the male will die shortly afterwards. The female will {{eventually}} land and remove her own wings, which she will no longer need.|$|R
5000|$|Galea is in {{the family}} Caviidae and its members are {{described}} as cavies; they have sometimes also been called [...] "guinea pigs". Cavies are widespread throughout South America. The high diversity of habitats of different species is paralleled by a high diversity of <b>social</b> organizations. <b>Species</b> differences between habitats and reproduction may shed light on evolutionary history.|$|R
25|$|The plains zebra is {{a highly}} <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; there are also {{bachelor}} groups. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators rather than attempting to hide; they bark or snort {{when they see a}} predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem. The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.|$|E
25|$|Anelosimus spiders {{are also}} model organisms, {{used for the}} study of sociality, its evolution, and its {{ecological}} and evolutionary causes and consequences. They are particularly important for such studies as the genus contains species varying from solitary to permanently social, and because sociality has evolved frequently within the genus allowing comparative studies across species. These spiders are also a promising model {{for the study of}} inbreeding as their mating system co-varies with sociality, and all permanently <b>social</b> <b>species</b> are highly inbred.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>social</b> <b>species,</b> V. maculifrons colonies {{depend on}} collaboration. However, {{polyandry}} tends to create subfamilies with lower relatedness, {{which can lead}} to conflict within the colony. Yet, V. maculifrons queens, and many other species’ queens, mate multiply. This occurrence is explained because potential conflict between subfamilies is offset by the reproductive success of queens; the mate number of queens is correlated to the number of queen cells a colony creates. This phenomenon may occur due to higher genetic diversity, which could lead to genetically varying workers that are more efficient at their jobs.|$|E
25|$|C.torquatus is {{the only}} <b>social</b> bat <b>species</b> that {{utilizes}} majority time in roosting services. They are nocturnal, extremely migratory and colonial. Hunting starts {{early in the morning}} where they leave their roost and begin preying on larger insects compared to other small bats who cannot. On their hunting grounds, they develop precautionary skills to protect against predators, echolocation is used whilst this behavior.|$|R
50|$|As in {{most other}} <b>social</b> insect <b>species,</b> {{individual}} interaction is heavily influenced by the queen. The queen can influence individuals with odors called pheromones, which can have different effects. Some pheromones {{have been known to}} calm workers, while others have been known to excite them. Pheromonal cues from ovipositing queens have a stronger effect on worker ants than those of virgin queens.|$|R
50|$|The golden-brown {{mouse lemur}} (Microcebus ravelobensis), {{also known as}} the Lac Ravelobe mouse lemur or the Ravelobe mouse lemur, is part of the family, Cheirogaleidae. These are the {{smallest}} species of lemur and are all arboreal, nocturnal, and typically <b>social.</b> All <b>species</b> of Lemur are native to the island of Madagascar. The golden-brown mouse lemur, Microcebus ravelobensis, was first discovered in 1994.|$|R
