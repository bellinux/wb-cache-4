50|$|Over {{time the}} term Blunt came to {{describe}} any cigar {{wrapped in a}} <b>single</b> <b>continuous</b> leaf. However, in the 1970s a new manner of producing cigars was invented. This manner is known as spiral binding. No longer did cigars have to be rolled in a <b>continuous</b> <b>single</b> leaf but instead a continuous spiral wrap from base to tip could be employed. The basic shape of a blunt remained unchanged although the burn characteristics of a spiral wrapped cigar {{is not the same}} as a <b>single</b> <b>continuous</b> leaf. However spiral wrapping is much less expensive than using a full single tobacco leaf. Spiral wrapping gives a better seal than a <b>single</b> <b>continuous</b> leaf as overlapping can be done (much like wrapping an arm in a bandage, spiral wrapping is easier to seal than a <b>single</b> <b>continuous</b> bandage).|$|R
