Insofar the beating department has been designed, on the basis of workmanship demands. It has been studied the bleaching phase determining the machines that realize such process. For the drying process a study has been performed aimed to the optimal management of the thermodynamic exchange to be performed, with minimum energy cost. Finally for the wrapping phase, it has been considered a procedure that allowed the reduction at the minimum values of the encumbrance volumes of the final product. Subsequently the sizing of the stores has been realized for raw material and final products...|$|R

A <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and twisted in twisting machine. Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of <b>carding</b> <b>machine,</b> it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From twisting machine testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> and twisting machine developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|R
