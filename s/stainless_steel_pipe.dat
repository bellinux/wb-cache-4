25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the good}} {{mechanical}} properties of forged parts, the forging process plays a decisive role in the manufacturing of seamless <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> for {{oil country tubular goods}} (OCTG) lines. Tough competition between manufacturers gives them plenty of incentive to make their processes in raw material and energy usage more and more efficient. In this context the expansion process is one of the critical production steps in the manufacturing of seamless <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> This work presents a sensitivity analysis of a finite element method (FEM) for the simulation of the expansion of the alloy UNS N 08028. The input parameters ram speed, tool angle, initial ID and final ID of the billet as well as temperature were used to describe responses like tool wear and material loss. With the aim to minimize the tool wear and to reduce the material waste, a study of influence of the input parameters on the mentioned responses were performed. This development is supported by experimental work in order to validate the simulation model. The sector demand for new materials with specific properties and the cost-intensive experimental trials justifies the use of such simulation tools and opens great opportunities for the industry...|$|R

40|$|When a flaw is {{detected}} in the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> at nuclear power plants during in-service inspections, the limit load estimation method provided in the codes such as JSME Rules on Fitness-for-Service for Nuclear Power Plants or ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XI {{can be applied to}} evaluate the integrity of the flawed pipe. However, in these current codes, the limit load estimation method is only derived for pipes containing a flaw with uniform depth, although many flaws with complicated shapes, such as stress corrosion cracks, have actually been detected in pipes. In order to evaluate the integrity of the flawed pipes in a more rational way, a limit load estimation method has been proposed by authors considering the complicated circumferential surface flaw in its shape. In this study, failure bending experiments are performed for <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> containing a circumferential surface flaw with a complicated asymmetrical shape. The proposed method is verified by comparing with experimental results of failure bending moments obtained in this study and in previous experiments.

5000|$|Increased {{corrosion}} potential - Following operation or testing, dry-pipe sprinkler system piping is drained, but residual water collects in piping low spots, and moisture is also {{retained in the}} atmosphere within the piping. This moisture, coupled with the oxygen available in the compressed air in the piping, increases internal pipe corrosion, eventually leading to pin-hole leaks or other piping failures. The internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems (in which the piping is constantly full of water) is much lower, {{as the amount of}} oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower. Corrosion can be combated by using copper or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> which is less susceptible to corrosion, or by using dry nitrogen gas to pressurize the system, rather than air. Nitrogen generators {{can be used as a}} permanent source of nitrogen gas, which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas. These additional precautions can increase the up-front cost of the system, but will help prevent system failure, increased maintenance costs, and premature need for system replacement in the future.|$|E
