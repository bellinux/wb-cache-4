25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child {{and his or her}} family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and <b>sultiame</b> have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E

2500|$|In Europe, {{up until}} 1963, {{it was not}} {{uncommon}} to prescribe primidone and phenobarbital in combination, often with a stimulant. They were believed to be the most useful for seizures occurring upon awakening, while phenytoin was the most useful for nocturnal seizures. Primidone and phenobarbital were prescribed in combination with phenytoin in diffuse epilepsies. They were third and fourth line-agents, respectively, in the treatment of partial seizures. By 1963, carbamazepine was marketed in most of Europe. It soon became clear that its efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic seizures was the same as phenytoin, that its ability to control partial seizures was superior, along with its tolerability. Sodium valproate was approved in France in 1967. Because the doses were so low (200â€“400mg/day), it was viewed as a moderately effective anticonvulsant whose best quality was its nonsedating nature. In spite of the availability of carbamazepine and valproate, physicians practicing in Mediterranean countries still preferred phenobarbital. Other medications were seen as not usually necessary. Phenytoin was to be used as adjunctive therapy only. In spite of these advances, primidone was still considered to be a [...] "sheet-anchor" [...] anticonvulsant in the United Kingdom as late as 1969, along with phenobarbital and phenytoin, for the treatment of pediatric epilepsy in spite of its side effects and one of two drugs (the other being <b>sultiame)</b> that were tried in adult patients if a combination of phenytoin and phenobarbital failed to control seizures. A review published that same year stated that carbamazepine did not live up to the claims of those who advocated its use in epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>sultiame</b> {{has been}} used to treat partial seizures. In Australia, it is {{currently}} registered for behavioural disorders associated with epilepsy; hyperkinetic behaviour; temporal lobe epilepsy; myoclonic seizures; grand mal attacks; and Jacksonian seizures. In contrast to other sulfonamide drugs, <b>sultiame</b> is devoid of antibacterial activity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sultiame</b> taken {{together}} with primidone {{may lead to}} severe side-effects, including psychotic reactions. The addition of sulthiame to phenytoin therapy has shown {{to be followed by}} a rise in the serum levels of phenytoin. <b>Sultiame</b> may also lead to a rise of phenobarbitone blood levels. Alcohol must not be consumed during treatment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sultiame</b> became {{established}} as a second-line drug for treatment of partial epilepsy in the 1960s and 1970s and was often used {{in combination with the}} established anticonvulsant phenytoin. Temporal lobe seizures appeared particularly responsive to <b>sultiame.</b> Doubts subsequently arose as to whether <b>sultiame</b> has intrinsic anticonvulsant properties. After discovering sultiame's ability to raise the blood levels of phenytoin, it was assumed that <b>sultiame</b> would only act in combination with phenytoin. This finding, together with the equivocal results of a study in the US, resulted in a quick decline of sultiame's use. It was only in 1988, that the German child neurologist Hermann Doose discovered its specific effects in benign focal epilepsies of childhood. Today, sulthiame is the drug of choice for benign focal epilepsies of childhood (such as benign rolandic epilepsy) in the German-speaking countries and Israel. There is renewed interest in sultiame's other potential uses, e.g., in West syndrome and other refractory epilepsies ...|$|E

50|$|Sultams are cyclic sulfonamides. Bioactive sultams {{include the}} {{antiinflammatory}} ampiroxicam and the anticonvulsant <b>sultiame.</b> Sultams are prepared analogously to other sulfonamides, {{allowing for the}} fact that sulfonic acids are deprotonated by amines. They are often prepared by one-pot oxidation of disulfides or thiols linked to amines. An alternative synthesis of sultams involves initial preparation of a linear sulfonamide, followed by intramolecular C-C bond formation (i.e. cyclization), a strategy that was used in the synthesis of a sultam-based deep-blue emitter for organic electronics.|$|E
