50|$|The act {{is divided}} into a prologue and two scenes. In the prologue, the Earth Mother and a <b>Snow</b> <b>Owl</b> duet before being joined by Abraham Lincoln in a prayer for peace. In Scene A, Giuseppe Garibaldi (who fought for the {{unification}} of Italy) sings while his soldiers face off against a group of Hopi dancers. Scene B is dominated by two spoken narrations: the first by Robert E. Lee (who spins weightlessly as if in outer space as he speaks), and the second by the grieving, mentally ill Mary Todd Lincoln. Throughout, an octet of characters from Greek mythology comments with excerpts from Hercules Furens and Hercules Oetaeus by Seneca the Younger.|$|E

50|$|This bird {{does not}} breed every year due to {{fluctuations}} in food supply and conditions. Courting occurs in January or February. Laying of eggs begins {{as early as}} mid-March, when ground and trees are still covered with <b>snow.</b> These <b>owls</b> prefer nesting in hollow tree cavities in Japan and Russia. Mature forests {{with a mixture of}} coniferous and deciduous trees is usually the preferred nesting habitat. In Russia, trees selected for nesting can consist of elm (Ulmus ssp.), Japanese poplar (Populus maximowiczii), willow (Salix ssp.), chosenia (Chosenia arbutifolia), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), ash (Sorbus ssp.), and stone birch (Betula ermanii). Nest height range is 2 - 18 m, but normally is at least 12 m of the ground. Reports of nesting on fallen tree trunks and on the forest floor are very rare occurrences at best and possibly untrue. Other than nest cavities, there are very isolated records of nesting on cliff shelves and in old black kite (Milvus migrans) nests.|$|R

25|$|Clues to the {{location}} of Martin's sword, as well as his shield and the sword's scabbard, have been built into the Abbey. Matthias recovers the shield and sword scabbard, and with Methuselah's help eventually divines where the sword is hidden. Unfortunately, it isn't there any longer, having been stolen by a wild sparrow tribe that dwells on the Abbey roof but Matthias discovers that soon after that it was stolen from them by Asmodeus. When trying to escape from the lair of the Sparra tribe with the help of Jess Squirrel, Matthias is attacked by the king of the sparrows. The two of them end up falling from the Abbey roof, resulting in the sparrow's death. After recovering, Matthias continues to the lair of the gigantic snake Asmodeus, acquiring several allies along the way: Log-a-Log, one of a local band of shrews; Basil Stag Hare, wandering do-gooder and general cad, and Warbeak Sparra, the new queen of the aforementioned sparrow tribe. He also befriends Captain <b>Snow,</b> an <b>owl,</b> and Squire Julian Gingivere, a cat. Matthias, Log-a-Log and two other Shrews succeed in retrieving the sword from Asmodeus Poisonteeth's cave but not before the Adder kills the other two, Matthias kills the snake after it tries to hypnotise him, but Martin's spirit guides him, and Matthias rushes back to Redwall to save his friends after being alerted to the fall of the abbey by the Sparra tribe.|$|R
40|$|Voles are {{the most}} {{preferred}} prey of Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in Northern Europe, where the extensive snow cover may decrease the availability of voles. Snow cover may thus cause changes in the diet from what is expected {{on the basis of}} prey abun-dance alone. Food hoarding behaviour of Pygmy Owls was examined in relation to <b>snow</b> cover. Pygmy <b>Owls</b> hoard small birds and mammals in tree holes and nest boxes on their autumn and winter territories. During five winters, we examined hoarded prey items from artificial hoarding boxes provided to Pygmy Owls in central Finland. The most intensive food hoarding periods occurred before the fall of snow, during which 73 % of prey items were hoarded. Presence or absence of snow cover did not affect the number of hoarded birds, but snow cover dramatically lowered the number of hoarded voles. Pygmy Owls began to exploit caches before the beginning of the snowy season and stopped exploita-tion in spring. According to the high utilization degree of the hoarded prey, especially dur-ing the period with permanent snow cover, we suggest that the Pygmy Owl’s food hoard-ing behaviour acts as a buffer for seasonal variation in food supply. 1...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the range, {{small rodents}} form the great {{majority}} of great horned owl prey by number. Weighing a mere 14 to 31.5 g and 20 to 58 g on average, the nine species of New World mice in Peromyscus and eight species voles in Microtus recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable. In 14 studies accumulated for comparison from across North America, Microtus and Peromyscus were each the most numerous prey in 5 of the studies (together 10 out of 14). By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, Peromyscus mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the <b>snow.</b> Other <b>owls,</b> most notably the great grey owl, habitually crash into the surface of the snow to access voles in their tunnels, a habit only rarely recorded in great horned owls presumably due to its less refined hearing. Notably, the house mouse (Mus musculus), of about as {{the same size as the}} Peromyscus ssp., although taken readily when available, is a relatively minor aspect of the diet as they tend to live much closer to human development than the owls do. Brown rats, despite a similar association with humans and their habitat alterations, also occasionally settle along the fringes of farm fields and meadows and hold much more dietary significance than the house mouse, i.e. the rats were seven times more abundant in pellets from the Upper Midwest. In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest. In 2134 pellets collected from 17 counties in Pennsylvania, the brown rat was the most common prey species by number, making up to 24%. Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.|$|R
50|$|Among others, mammal {{species that}} inhabit the greater West Island region include white-tailed deer, coyote and cottontail rabbits. the current {{population}} of white-tailed deer is quite substantial, It {{is estimated that}} there is over a thousand individuals in the deer population. It {{is not uncommon for}} moose to occasionally cross the ice onto the island in winter. Other species endemic to the western portion of the island include grey squirrels, red squirrels, flying squirrels, mink, chipmunks, raccoons, beaver, skunks, porcupines, martens, woodchucks, muskrat, otters, and fox. The number of bird species varies according to season and migration. During spring and fall many species pass through the area on their way to southern breeding grounds. During winter months, depending on climatic conditions and availability of food in the northern Quebec, many species of birds will take up temporary residence, such as great grey <b>owls,</b> <b>snow</b> buntings, snowy owls,and others. The West Island has enough variation in suitable habitats, such as marsh, ponds, forest and field that many species of birds nest here. Various species of reptiles which can be found include garter snakes, red bellied, brown, milk and the northern water snake. Species of turtles include painted, map and snapping turtle. Amphibians include bullfrogs, green frogs, leopard frogs, spring peepers, wood frogs, and others. Salamanders such as the eastern newt, red backed salamander, blue spotted salamander are also found in the more humid habitats. In the surrounding waters of the west island, notably the Lake St. Louis side, large fish species such as northern pike, sturgeon, garfish, carp, catfish, muskellunge can be found. Given the Saint Lawrence's heavy traffic and years of mis-use, the ecoregion is negatively effected by high pollution which in turn has resulted in diminished local populations of native fauna. That said, residential development in the greater West Island suburban region (including the Vaudreuil-Soulanges area and parts of Eastern Ontario), has resulted in occasional sightings of black bears, wolves, lynx and cougars (which are generally believed to be extinct though sightings and some physical evidence suggest otherwise) as they themselves are pushed out of their habitats.|$|R
