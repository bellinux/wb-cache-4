5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E
5|$|A variant {{from the}} Gibson area has an upright habit and leaves. Otherwise, Banksia speciosa shows little {{variation}} across its range. Combined with its vigour and prominence in its habitat, {{this has led}} George to <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> it is a recent development among its relatives.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, astronomers {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} , an object {{half the size of}} Sedna in a 4200-year orbit similar to Sedna's and a perihelion within Sedna's range of roughly 80AU, which led some to <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> it offered evidence of a trans-Neptunian planet.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery, competence, and uprightness. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Jake might {{be trying to}} undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian {{mechanics}} {{to predict}} {{the position of the}} then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.

5|$|Reptile's {{appearance}} caused fans to <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} be unlocked and used as a controllable character.

5000|$|Witkowski <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Die Glocke {{ended up}} in a [...] "Nazi-friendly South American country". Cook, on the other hand, <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> it was moved to the United States as part of a deal made with SS General Hans Kammler.

5|$|Researchers <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Davidson Seamount is {{an ideal}} habitat for deep-sea corals and sponges because it has {{favorable}} bottom rock (bare lava rock), a steady food supply (supplied by a water current favoring the seamount; see the section above), {{and has not been}} disturbed by strong bottom currents than often bother other seafloor areas.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> the {{functional}} significance of long head hair may be adornment, {{a by-product of}} secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E

5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{generally}} <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> the New World Order {{is being}} implemented gradually, citing {{the formation of}} the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the Order {{stated that it}} was {{entering}} {{the second stage of}} its development, in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within the occult community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> the ONA had become defunct.|$|E
5|$|Judith and Thomas {{had three}} children: Shakespeare, Richard, and Thomas. Shakespeare Quiney died at {{six months of}} age, and neither Richard nor Thomas lived past 21.

5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E
5|$|Researchers <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> {{acoustical}} mimicry {{is related}} to the level of interaction between the host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently spend much of their life hiding in pockets of the brood nest.|$|E

5000|$|Ramachandran has <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> synesthesia and {{conceptual}} metaphors may {{share a common}} basis in cortical cross-activation. In 2003 Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard published a paper in which they <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the angular gyrus is at least partially responsible for understanding metaphors. More recently (2014), Baland Jalal and Ramachandran published a paper in which they <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> {{there is evidence of}} [...] "metaphor blindness" [...] in a small subset of college students; [...] "Metaphor blindness" [...] refers to the reduced ability in otherwise normal individuals to comprehend metaphors of language, while showing no signs of other language deficits.|$|R
5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E

At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the week of May, and the media began to <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> he could score 1000runs in one month, something {{that had been done}} on a tour only by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{is one of}} the world's oldest {{prepared}} beverages, possibly {{dating back}} to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC , when cereal was first farmed, and is recorded in the written history of ancient Iraq and ancient Egypt. Archaeologists <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations. Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.|$|E
