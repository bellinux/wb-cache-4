50|$|As a body, the Senate {{tends to}} afford great {{deference}} to any member's objection regarding a nominee {{to a federal}} office having geographical ties to that member's state, especially when the objecting member has the same party affiliation as the president. Objections {{from members of the}} party in opposition to the president generally are not afforded the same weight. However, the blue <b>slip</b> <b>policy</b> of the Judiciary Committee allows even members of the president's opposition party to block nominees to positions as federal district and appellate court judges, U.S. attorneys, and federal marshals.|$|E
5000|$|This custom {{generally}} affords each senator {{some role}} {{in the process of}} nomination and confirmation of federal office holders, conditional on a matching political party affiliation between the president and the senator. Where each is of the same political party, the president will consult the senator prior to submitting a nomination for any federal posting geographically tied to that senator's state. Such consultation can help the president avoid a politically costly and embarrassing rejection of the nominee. This consultation can be one of soliciting the senator for recommendations regarding whom the president should nominate, whereby the senator can reward political supporters from their state who are qualified for the position, or of quietly seeking the senator's advance approval or rejection of a nominee the president already has in mind for the vacancy prior to making that nomination. As U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy described the enterprise, [...] "Basically, it's senatorial appointment with the advice and consent of the president." [...] While not afforded the advisory role given to senators of the president's party, the blue <b>slip</b> <b>policy</b> of the Senate Judiciary Committee guarantees that even senators of the opposition party receive at least a consultative role regarding appointments of federal district and appellate court judges, U.S. attorneys, and federal marshals whose jurisdictions are geographically tied to the senator's state.|$|E
40|$|Investment {{in plant}} and {{equipment}} per worker by Canadian businesses is picking up relative to counterparts elsewhere after years of underperformance. Canada’s relative improvement owes much to outperformance by resource-rich provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador being the most recent star, while Ontario continues to <b>slip.</b> <b>Policies</b> that increase competitive pressures to invest and remove biases against non-residential investment could boost capital spending by businesses and improve Canadian workers’ prospects for higher incomes in the future.

40|$|Wire {{energy has}} become the major {{contributor}} to energy in large lower level caches. While wire energy is related to wire latency its costs are exposed differently in the memory hierar-chy. We propose Sub-Level Insertion <b>Policy</b> (<b>SLIP),</b> a cache management policy which improves cache energy consump-tion by {{increasing the number of}} accesses from energy efficient locations while simultaneously decreasing intra-level data movement. In SLIP, each cache level is partitioned into sev-eral cache sublevels of differing sizes. Then, the recent reuse distance distribution of a line is used to choose an energy-optimized insertion and movement policy for the line. The policy choice is made by a hardware unit that predicts the number of accesses and inter-level movements. Using a full-system simulation including OS interactions and hardware overheads, we show that SLIP saves 35 % energy at the L 2 and 22 % energy at the L 3 level and performs 0. 75 % better than a regular cache hierarchy in a single core system. When configured to include a bypassing <b>policy,</b> <b>SLIP</b> reduces traffic to DRAM by 2. 2 %. This is achieved at the cost of storing 12 b metadata per cache line (2. 3 % overhead), a 6 b policy in the PTE, and 32 b distribution metadata for each page in the DRAM (a overhead of 0. 1 %). Using SLIP in a multiprogrammed system saves 47 % LLC energy, and reduces traffic to DRAM by 5. 5 %. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Pearlman {{alludes to}} two other cases where [...] "lying cops don't {{automatically}} kill a case". She {{is trying to}} convince Levy, but to be more precise, those cases really concern {{the legality of the}} evidence obtained. In the second case mentionned, Ceccolini - 435 US 268 (1978), the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals ruling that the illegal search performed by an officer during one of his breaks when entering a shop (that had been under previous surveillance for illegal gambling), examining an envelope containing <b>policy</b> <b>slips</b> on the cash register and asking the clerk whose envelope it was, that led to the conviction of the shop owner based on the testimony of the clerk, had to have its findings suppressed along with the guilty verdict. In the first case however, Everhart - 274 Maryland 459 (1975), the Court of Appeals reversed the Court of Special Appeals ruling that an initial illegal search, which was deemed to be the basis for probable cause for the issue of a search and seizure warrant, did not make the latter illegal, and thus, in this case the final ruling does not support Pearlman's point.|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO has previously established that the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) acquisition policy reflects many sound program management practices intended to mitigate the risks of cost growth and schedule <b>slips.</b> The <b>policy</b> largely reflects the knowledge-based approach used by leading commercial firms, which do not pursue major investments without demonstrating, at critical milestones, that their products are likely to meet cost, schedule, and performance objectives. DHS policy requires that important acquisition documents be in place and approved before programs are executed. For example, one key document is an acquisition program baseline, which outlines a program's expected cost, schedule, and the capabilities to be delivered to the end user. However, in September 2012, GAO found that the department did not implement the policy consistently, and that only 4 of 66 programs had all of the required documents approved in accordance with DHS's policy. GAO made five recommendations, which DHS concurred with, identifying actions DHS should take to mitigate the risk of poor acquisition outcomes and strengthen management activities. Further, GAO reported {{that the lack of}} reliable performance data hindered DHS and congressional oversight of the department's major programs. Officials explained that DHS's culture had emphasized the need to rapidly execute missions more than sound acquisition management practices. GAO also reported that most of the department's major programs cost more than expected, took longer to deploy than planned, or delivered less capability than promised. DHS has taken steps to improve acquisition management, but as part of its ongoing work, GAO found that DHS recently waived documentation requirements for 42 programs fielded for operational use since 2008. DHS explained it would be cost prohibitive and inefficient to recreate documentation for previous acquisition phases. GAO plans to obtain more information on this decision and its effect on the management of DHS's major acquisitions. DHS's July 2013 status assessment indicated that, as of the end of fiscal year 2012, many major programs still face cost and schedule shortfalls. DHS expects to provide another update in the near future. ...|$|R
5000|$|By the 1950s {{there were}} 8 rival numbers games {{operating}} in black sections of Cleveland, including [...] "California Gold", [...] "Mound Bayou" [...] and [...] "T. & O." [...] The winning three-digit number from 000 to 999 {{was determined by}} the closing stock market results in the evening papers, with one digit each being taken from the totals for advances, declines, and unchanged. Bets of up to $2 would be placed with hundreds of numbers writers around the city, who would keep 25% of the money bet as their fee. In the mid-afternoon a runner (locally known as the pickup man or woman) would rendezvous with the writers to collect the <b>policy</b> <b>slips</b> and cash, which would be taken to a central location and totaled on adding machines prior to determining the winners. The runners kept 10% of the money bet as their fee. 65 cents on every dollar bet would be delivered to the [...] "clearinghouse" [...] parlors, which calculated the winners and paid off at 500 to 1 odds, keeping 15 cents on the dollar, on an average day when no [...] "hot" [...] number hit, for themselves. In the evening the runner would make the rounds again to deliver the cash winnings to those writers whose customers had hit the winning number, and winners would be paid. A number of bars, private clubs and taverns around town, including the [...] "Tia Juana", served as centers of the action where bettors and writers would congregate and wait for the winners to be announced.|$|R
40|$|Governments {{have decided}} collectively {{that the world}} needs to limit the average global {{temperature}} increase {{to no more than}} 2 o C and international negotiations are engaged to that end. Yet any resulting agreement will not emerge before 2015 and new legal obligations will not begin before 2020. Meanwhile, despite many countries taking new actions, the world is drifting further and further from the track it needs to follow. The energy sector is the single largest source of climate-changing greenhouse-gas emissions and limiting these is an essential focus of action. The World Energy Outlook has published detailed analysis of the energy contribution to climate change for many years. But, amid major international economic preoccupations, there are worrying signs that the issue of climate change has <b>slipped</b> down the <b>policy</b> agenda. This Special Report seeks to bring it right back on top by showing that the dilemma can be tackled at no net economic cost. The report: � Maps out the current status and expectations of global climate and energy policy – what is happening and what (more) is needed? � Sets out four specific measures for the energy sector that can be quickly and effectively implemented, at no net economic cost, to help keep the 2 o C target alive while international negotiations continue. � Indicates elements of action to achieve further reductions, after 2020. � Demonstrates that the energy sector, in its own interest, needs to address now the risks implicit in climate change – whether they be the physical impacts of climate change or the consequences of more drastic action later by governments as the need to curb emissions becomes imperative.
