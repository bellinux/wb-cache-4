In the course of my research I began to notice that {{some of the people who}} were voicing some of the harshest hostility were themselves Jews, especially Jews on the radical Left.

25|$|I {{watched him}} as a student of politics, rather than someone {{involved}} in politics, and he always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> someone who was a statesman {{as well as a}} politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.|$|E

According to Daniels, drama lessons at O-levels {{gave him a}} voice, and when he attended sixth form studies at Stratford College between 1980 and 1982, doing A-levels in theatre studies and English literature, he attended Royal Shakespeare Company performances. A fellow student recalled that Daniels, whom he knew as Dave, [...] "was very serious about his work, and <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> incredibly intelligent... you got the sense his mind was working; the cogs were ticking over". Daniels subsequently trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) for three years.|$|E

During the offseason, they live {{on a farm in}} North Carolina that is about thirty minutes from where he grew up in the old furniture manufacturing area of the state, and during the season in a condo in San Francisco. Bumgarner has been a Baptist since his childhood. Andrew Baggarly, a reporter who covers the Giants, wrote of Bumgarner, [...] "While I wouldn't describe him as outgoing, he <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being smart, well spoken and polite. He is deeply Christian and seems to be very grounded." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, the Duke {{admitted}} {{in his memoirs}} that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: [...] " [...] Führer <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions." [...] In the 1950s, journalist Frank Giles heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for helping to [...] "precipitate the war through his treatment of Mussolini... that's what [...] did, he helped to bring on the war... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews". During the 1960s the Duke said privately to a friend, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, [...] "I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap." ...|$|E
500|$|ZANU-PF {{claim to}} be {{influenced}} by Marxism-Leninism although Onslow and Redding stated that in contrast to the Marxist emphasis on the urban proletariat as the main force of socio-economic change, Mugabe's party accorded that role to the rural peasantry. As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU-PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias. The English academic Claire Palley met Mugabe in 1962, later noting that [...] "he <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist", while Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was [...] "just rhetoric" [...] with [...] "no genuine vision or belief behind it". Carington noted that while Mugabe used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, [...] "of course he didn't actually practice what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist".|$|E

500|$|Amanda Tapping {{admitted}} {{that it had}} been easier to establish relationships with her co-stars {{at the beginning of the}} series, comparing Nemec's situation to [...] "being the new kid in school; we're still trying to make [...] comfortable, but it's not the same". Nevertheless, the StargateSG-1 actors and producers complimented Corin Nemec and the character. Richard Dean Anderson was impressed with Nemec's performance in [...] "Meridian", saying [...] "he really <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a bright guy, very respectful of the dynamic of the set, but with an awareness of what he wanted to bring." [...] Don S. Davis (General Hammond) noted during the filming of season6 that [...] "Corin is a wonderful [...] young man with a tremendous personality and he's had a great deal of experience in the business", agreeing with writer Robert C. Cooper that Nemec had done a [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "wonderful" [...] job.|$|E
500|$|Friends {{raised the}} money to pay the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but without their consent and {{contrary}} to their wishes. [...] As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening, he was able to forbid the payment of his fine as a matter of conscience, though friends attempted to pay for him as well. [...] As a result, Holmes was taken to the town's whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. [...] He told the magistrates, [...] "You have <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> with roses", and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by resting on his knees and elbows for many days afterwards. [...] Much later, Rhode Island Governor Joseph Jenckes wrote, [...] "Those who have seen the scars on Mr. Holmes' back (which the old man was wont to call the marks of the Lord Jesus), have expressed a wonder that he should live." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Excursions In and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840, the {{geologist}} Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog. [...] "A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal {{was of a}} breed {{very different from what}} we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." [...] wrote Jukes. [...] "These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to [...] "toil" [...] or entice the fish. The whole proceeding <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> remarkable, more especially as they said he had never been taught anything of the kind." ...|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Claire Zulkey for The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "For me, {{there are}} two types of episodes of 30 Rock: the really really good ones, where all the parts come {{together}} to make a wonderful whole, and the pretty good ones, where there memorable jokes and lines are all there, but put all together create a kind of uneven episode. That <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> tonight's type of episode." [...] Though, Zulkey felt that the zombies scene [...] "didn't really work" [...] except for when Liz smashed a picture frame over Pete Hornberger's (Scott Adsit) head. She said that the [...] "funniest part" [...] from [...] "Flu Shot" [...] was the look on Jack and Elisa's faces [...] "as the animals from The Lion King walked through the audience." [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin D. Thompson, in his review of [...] "Flu Shot", said it featured many funny lines.|$|E
500|$|He {{was almost}} exasperated by the {{inventiveness}} of forms in nature; [...] "In my examination of Orchids, hardly any fact {{has so much}} <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> the endless diversity of structure,—the prodigality of resources,—for gaining the very same end, namely, the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another." [...] His focus on detail was justified, as [...] "The use of each trifling detail of structure {{is far from a}} barren search to those who believe in natural selection." [...] The [...] "contrivances and beautiful adaptations" [...] slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection [...] "under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: [...] "For may we not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of {{the vast majority of the}} breeders of our domestic productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,—that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?" ...|$|E
500|$|On October 24, 2012 a {{video was}} {{released}} showing Patrick B. Moran, the Congressman's {{son and a}} field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign. In response to the person's suggestion about trying to cast votes {{in the names of}} 100 inactive voters, Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme, but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills. [...] The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation. Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he didn't want to be a distraction during the election, and stating, [...] "at no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not." ...|$|E

"When I was {{trawling}} {{through the}} entries for the Genesis Opera Prizes 1, amidst an absolute welter of indistinguishable representatives {{of what one}} might call 'academic modernism', Isidora Zebeljan's music <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> immediately <b>as</b> something original, fresh, and above all emotionally expressive - a rare commodity, but an essential one for interesting theatrical story telling."

6000|$|... "I am {{disposed}} to think," [...] said Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, thoughtfully, [...] "that {{it was the}} best thing for her to be thrown on herself. Too much talk has always been the mischief with her, as with many another only child, and it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> to-day <b>as</b> a very good sign that she said so little. There was something very touching in the complete absence of moralizing to-day." ...|$|R
500|$|Some critics, however, were displeased {{with the}} film's long running time {{and lack of}} action scenes. [...] "The film gets mired in the {{inevitable}} red tape of police investigations," [...] wrote Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who also felt that the film [...] "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "seems to {{last as long as}} the Oscars." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer felt that [...] "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure out what he is up to in Zodiac – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for what <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a shaggy-dog narrative." [...] Christy Lemire wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that [...] "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link... But he's never fleshed out sufficiently to make you believe that he'd sacrifice his safety and that of his family to find the truth. We are told repeatedly that the former Eagle Scout is just a genuinely good guy, but that's not enough." ...|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said [...] "last night's episode <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being {{as close to}} 50minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E
60|$|Just then it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that <b>as</b> {{there were}} several posts of an old weir {{in the middle of}} the stream, he must have twisted the line round one of these, broken himself off and left me {{attached}} to it!

6000|$|... "I had no orders, general; but I was {{appointed}} to command the first company that entered, {{and was told that}} we were to turn right and left along the ramparts.

6000|$|... 'Well--it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that, <b>as</b> I {{spoke in}} Gothic, the boy {{might not have}} {{understood}} me, being a Greek. So I walked in at the door, to save questions, and see for myself.

So I walked in.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Paxman was criticised for his {{presentation}} of the BBC documentary [...] "Britain's Great War". While describing how British conscientious objectors were jailed and threatened with the death penalty because killing was against their beliefs, Paxman ventured his own opinion {{that it was the}} objectors themselves who were at fault, and that they were [...] "extreme". The conscientious objectors, Paxman said, [...] "have always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> cranks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cartoonist-journalist Joe Sacco {{expressed}} {{grief for}} the victims in a comic strip, and wrote but... tweaking the noses of Muslims... has never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{anything other than a}} [...] way to use the pen...

2500|$|It {{was also}} at Terry's {{suggestion}} that Violet, on starting a theatrical career, had adopted the stage name Vanbrugh. Irene did the same. Violet's early success encouraged Irene to follow her into the theatrical profession. Sir John Gielgud described the two:The Vanbrugh sisters were remarkably alike in appearance. Tall and imposing, beautifully spoken, they moved with grace ... They were elegantly but never ostentatiously dressed, entering and leaving the stage with unerring authority ... Violet never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a natural comedienne, as Irene was.|$|E
60|$|The person whom I {{addressed}} was a grave man, {{fifty years}} old or thereabout, who had evidently come thither as a looker-on. He <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> immediately <b>as</b> having weighed for himself the true value of life and its circumstances, and therefore as feeling little personal interest in whatever judgment the world might form of them. Before answering my question, he {{looked me in the}} face by the kindling light of the fire.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{things in}} this city have <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> singularly, <b>as</b> peculiarly German: one was a long-legged stork, which I saw {{standing}} on a chimney top, reminding me of the oft-mentioned [...] "dear white stork" [...] of German stories. Why don't storks do so in America, I wonder? Another thing was, waking suddenly {{in the middle of}} the night, and hearing the hymn of the watchman as he announced the hour. I think this is a beautiful custom.|$|R
60|$|A woman, {{followed}} by a man, passed my table, and the two seated themselves diagonally opposite to me. Something in the woman's light footsteps, her free movements, and the graceful carriage of her head, <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> instantly <b>as</b> being familiar. She was dressed very plainly, and she was closely veiled. Their entrance, too, had been unobtrusive, almost furtive. But when she raised her veil and took the carte-du-jour in her hand, I knew her at once. It was Mrs. Smith-Lessing.|$|R
