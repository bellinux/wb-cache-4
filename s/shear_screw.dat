The extrudates were produced using a conical, counter-rotating twin-screw extruder CM 45 -F. A high <b>shear</b> <b>screw</b> type SK 1552 - 300 and low <b>shear</b> <b>screw</b> type SK 1552 - 300 B with different srew speed (60; 70 ' 80 rpm) were used during the experiment.

Rye extrudates produced by high <b>shear</b> <b>screw</b> at 80 rpm were characterized as good products with the lowest bulk density (68. 96 g/dm³), the highest expansion index (7. 98) and the diameter of pores (354. 89 µm), the lowest break force (134. 12 N) and the longest shelf-life. The experiments showed that the application of determined optimal extrusion variables enabled to produce rye extrudates with the highest amount of buckwheat flour (40 %).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science & Industry: Food Science InstituteSajid AlaviOne of {{the worst}} {{pollution}} menaces of modern times is plastic packaging, because of its poor degradability. Packaging materials based on starch utilize the benefits of natural polymerization, abundant availability of raw material, and fast biodegradability. However, the highly hydrophilic nature and poor mechanical properties of starch based films limit their application. This problem was sought to be overcome by forming a nanocomposite of starch and layered silicate clay. This study utilizes melt extrusion processing to synthesize starch-clay nanocomposites for biodegradable packaging films and investigate the effects of chemical compatibility of starch, plasticizer and nanoclay and melt extrusion conditions on the structure and properties of composite films. In {{the first part of}} the study, the influence of clay type, clay content, starch source and amylose content was investigated. Starch-montmorillonite (MMT) hybrids showed an intercalated nanostructure due to the compatibility of the two components and led to cast film with higher tensile strength and better water vapor barrier properties as compared to starch-organically modified montmorillonite (I 30 E) hybrids, as well as native starch only. With increase in clay content (0 - 21 wt%), significantly higher (15 - 92 %) tensile strength (TS) and lower (22 - 67 %) water vapor permeability (WVP) were obtained. The results indicated that nanocomposite technology could be applied to improve the properties of starch-based packaging films. The barrier and mechanical properties of nanocomposite films did not vary significantly with different starch sources (corn, wheat and potato starch), whereas films from regular corn starch showed better properties than either high amylopectin or high amylose-based nanocomposite films. The second part of the study investigated the effects of glycerol content (0 - 20 wt%) and three plasticizers (glycerol, urea, formamide) on the structure and properties of the starch-clay nanocomposite films. With decreasing glycerol content, the extent of clay exfoliation increased. Films with 5 % glycerol exhibited the lowest WVP, and the highest TS and glass transition temperature (Tg). The use of urea and formamide improved the dispersion of clay platelets. Compared to glycerol and urea, formamide has an intermediate hydrogen bond forming ability with starch. However, at the same level of plasticizer (15 wt%), formamide plasticized nanocomposite films exhibited the lowest WVP, highest TS and Tg. Results indicated that a balance of interactions between starch, clay surface modifications and plasticizers might control the formation of nanocomposite structure, and in turn affect the performance of the nanocomposite films. The last part of the study investigated the effects of extrusion conditions (screw configuration, barrel temperature profile, screw speed and barrel moisture content) on the structure and properties of the starch-clay nanocomposite films. Increasing the shear intensity significantly improved the exfoliation and dispersion of clay platelets. The combination of lowest barrel moisture content (20 %) and high <b>shear</b> <b>screw</b> configuration exhibited almost complete clay exfoliation and the lowest WVP and highest TS of all treatments. Increasing the barrel temperature also improved clay exfoliation and performance of films. The results suggested that, when polymer and clay are chemically compatible, optimization of process conditions (shear intensity, temperature etc.) can enable significant improvement in clay exfoliation and dispersion and the performance of nanocomposite films...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal shear {{interaction}} between profiled steel sheeting and concrete in composite slab is obtained through various means, such as frictional resistance due to indentation or embossment in the sheeting, interlocking at the steel and concrete interface resulting from curvature {{and shape of}} the sheeting profile under bending, and anchorage devices such as welded shear studs and crippled sheeting {{at the end of the}} span. Permanent end pour stops may provide some restraining effect to the slipping of the concrete, and hence may enhance the composite action.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single <b>shear</b> <b>screwed</b> connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and screwed connections of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single <b>shear</b> <b>screwed</b> connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single <b>shear</b> <b>screwed</b> connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules.

We then apply this definition to the moving dislocations (following the dynamics of a [1 - 10] dipole of 1 / 2 # 111 # screw dislocations at 0. 001 K) and extract their Peierls energy barrier (E P) and Peierls stress (# P).

40|$|Motivation: Conformational rearrangements during {{molecular}} {{interactions are}} {{observed in a}} wide range of biological systems. However, computational methods aiming at simulating and predicting molecular interactions are still largely ignoring the flexible nature of biological macromolecules as the number of degrees of freedom is computationally intractable when using brute force representations. Results: In this paper we present a computational data structure called the Flexibility Tree (FT) that enables a multi-resolution and hierarchical encoding of molecular flexibility. This tree-like data structure allows the encoding of relatively small, yet complex subspaces of a protein's conformational space. These conformational sub-spaces are parameterized by a small number of variables and can be searched efficiently using standard global search techniques. The FT structure makes it straightforward to combine and nest a wide variety of motion types such as hinge, <b>shear,</b> twist, <b>screw,</b> rotameric side chains, normal modes, essential dynamics, etc. Moreover, the ability to assign shapes to the nodes in a FT allows the interactive manipulation of flexible protein shapes and the interactive visualization of the impact of conformational changes on the protein’s overall shape. We describe the design of the flexibility tree and illustrate the construction of such trees to hierarchically combine motion information obtained from a variety of sources ranging from experiment to user intuition, and describing conformational changes at different biological scales. We show that the combination of various types of motion helps refine the encoded conformational subspaces to include experimentally determined structures, and we demonstrate searching these subspaces for specific conformations. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{residence}} time distributions (RTD) {{of a high}} <b>shear</b> twin <b>screw</b> extruder were measured by an on-line UV fluorescence device. First, by increasing throughput (Q) and screw speed (N), a decrease of the complex viscosity of the studied polypropylene (PP) was observed, revealing chain scissions. It was associated to high viscous dissipation taking place during extrusion, and more particularly under high shear conditions. Then {{the impact of these}} experimental conditions on the RTD was carried out. As expected, an increase of usual throughputs and screw speeds decrease mostly the RTD characteristic data. In this study industrial rate have been studied: throughput varied from 1. 5 up to 22 kg h− 1 and screw speed varied from 200 min− 1 up to 1 200 min− 1. However, by increasing the screw speed over usual values (from 500 up to 1 200 min− 1), the variation of some experimental RTD characteristics were unexpected. Indeed, the slope of the shape of the experimental RTD function E(t) changed significantly. This phenomenon will be called lag or delay time. This result was only observed at low throughputs and high screw rotation speeds. To finish, a modeling software of twin screw extrusion process was used to compare experimental and calculated results. For usual processing conditions (up to 700 min− 1), the simulation predicts nicely the experimental RTDs. However, at high screw speed (N > 800 min− 1) and moderate throughput (Q = 4 kg h− 1), the simulation fails to predict the RDT delay time. Hence, some side effects apparently occurred during high shear extrusion at low throughputs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMethods {{and devices}} for in situ {{establishment}} of mechanical properties of wood have been recently developed {{in cooperation with}} European, US and Japanese researchers. The development of these new methods was motivated by requirements from engineers who need highly accurate data of mechanical properties of specific elements to plan renovations of historic buildings. Reliable data can replace overly conservative values (usually provided by visual strength grading) in structural analysis, which allows the retention of more original material as the behavior of specific elements is safely assessed. The recently developed methods, which are described in this chapter, are tensile strength of small samples, tensile Young’s modulus of mesospecimens, compression strength of cores, compression strength in a drilled hole, mechanical resistance to pin pushing, Young’s modulus derived by measuring the hardness and <b>shear</b> strength of <b>screw</b> withdrawals. Although in general the devices for the testing of mechanical properties by the mentioned methods provide more accurate results than the methods used so far, they are not yet mass produced, which should change soon...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to create a computationally efficient seismic analysis framework for cold-formed steel (CFS) framed-buildings supported by hysteretic nonlinear models for CFS members and screw-fastened connections. Design of CFS structures subjected to lateral seismic forces traditionally relies on the strength of subassemblies subjected to lateral loading of systems, such as strapped/sheathed shear walls and diaphragms, to provide adequate protection against collapse. Enabling performance-based seismic design of CFS buildings requires computationally efficient and accurate modeling tools that predict the nonlinear cyclic behavior of CFS buildings, the individual CFS components and connections. Such models should capture the energy dissipation and damage due to buckling and cross-sectional deformations in thin-walled CFS components subjected to cyclic loads such as those induced by earthquakes. Likewise, models for screw-fastened CFS connections should capture the energy dissipation and damage due to tilting, bearing, or <b>screw</b> <b>shear</b> when subjected to cyclic loading. In this dissertation, an analysis framework for CFS structures that captures the nonlinear cyclic behavior of critical components including axial members, flexural members, and scre...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{multiplex}} shear {{stress on the}} cell nucleation during microcellular foaming process was investigated using a dynamic foaming experimental apparatus. The multiplex oscillatory shear, which is different from previous one-dimensional <b>screw</b> <b>shear</b> in a “stable” extrusion foaming process, {{is applied to the}} polymer melt through an axially vibrated rotor. The experimental results show that, by superimposing an axial vibration on the rotating rotor, the cell density increases and cell size decreases significantly when the shear rate is low. Both the uniformity of cell size and cell distribution are improved under vibration when compared with that without vibration regardless of how the shear rate changes. In addition, a simplified nucleation model based on shear energy has been carried out to qualitatively investigate the effect of both the simple steady shear and the multiplex oscillatory shear on the cell nucleation. Experiments and theoretical predictions all show that cell nucleation could be greatly improved by superimposing the oscillatory shear when the nucleation driving force induced by the steady shear is insufficient. Finally, the shear heat generated by excessive shear and strong vibration should be considered carefully although the isothermal condition was supposed in the present model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} and properties of polypropylene (IPP) and ethylene propylene copolymer (IEPR) blends filled with nanosilica have been investigated. The nanocomposites were prepared via direct melt mixing using high <b>shear</b> corotating twin <b>screw</b> extruder. The {{effects of the}} process as well as adding amaleated-Polyethylene MAPE compatibilizer were assessed by morphology studies, thermal analysis and mechanical testing. From SEM and TEM investigations, a separate dispersion of filler and rubber in the PP matrix prevails in the PP/EPR/SiO 2 systems. Encapsulation of the filler particles into the elastomer takes place when MAPE is used, promoting filler/polymer interactions and resulting in a simultaneous improvement in stiffness and toughness. Interestingly, {{the results indicated that}} high-shear processing is an effective method to improve the dispersion of the EPR phase and fillers through the matrix. The dispersed phase droplet size was reduced with the increase of the shear rate by varying the screw rotation speed from 300 to 800 rpm, which induces a high shear stress exerted onthe materials. To sum up, what is expected from an efficient compatibilization-process association is the reduction of the dispersed elastomer domains characteristic size, their stabilization by creation of an interphase and thus, enhanced mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{dissertation}} is the assessment of technical shear resistance (technological <b>shear)</b> of orthopedic <b>screw</b> made of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, produced using incremental technology {{in the process of}} 3 D printing process. The first part of the work presents incremental techniques in production engineering. The second part of the present work contains specification of the 3 D printing process of samples as well as the description of the used material. The fundamental part of the article is composed out of endurance tests for orthopaedic screws as well as the analysis of the obtained results and conclusions. The method of incremental production SLM using SLM 280 HL metal printer was used during the technological process. The resistance tests were performed using ZWICK/ROELL Z 150 machines. Identical endurance trials were performed for monolithic bars made of titanium alloys (of bar core size) made on a wire electric discharge machine Sodick SL 600 Q for comparative purposes. The obtained test results enabled comparative assessment of the value of shear resistance Rt in the conditions of technological shear. According to the performed tests, the shear resistance Rt of orthopaedic screws is nearly 33 % lower than of monolithic bars of the same core size...|$|R
40|$|Methods for the {{evaluation}} of stress and texture by time-of-flight measurements of ultrasonic waves use of a broad variety of wave types, which include normally incident shear waves and compressional waves, Rayleigh waves, Lamb modes and SH modes. Under field condition, the only means for the excitation of normally incident shear waves and SH modes is to use an electromagnetic-ultrasonic (EMUS) system. Apart from this such a type of ultrasonic system provides a high degree of reproducibility and allows high scanning speeds. These features have {{led to the development of}} several EMUS probes for applications to time-of-flight measurements and of transmit/receive-electronics with a high power solid-state transmitter stage. The probes include a small permanent magnet probe for linearly polarized shear waves, a transducer with a water-cooled electromagnet for the simultaneous exictation of orthogonally polarized shear in turbine axles, and a combined piezoelectric/EMUS probe for the simultan eous excitation of compressional waves and <b>shear</b> waves in <b>screws</b> also at elevated temperatures up to 150 degree C. EMUS transducers for Lamb and SH modes in plates have also been applied to time-of-flight measurements aiming at texture evaluation. The different probes will be described, and their performance including the electronical system will be discussed. All probes provide good accuracy for the time-of-flight measurements (up to 3 x 10 high minus 5) ...|$|R
