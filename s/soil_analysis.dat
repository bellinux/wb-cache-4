5|$|Marketplaces are {{difficult}} to identify archaeologically. However, the Spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in the region. At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls. A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at Chunchucmil. Unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic. Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at {{an increasing number of}} Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and <b>soil</b> <b>analysis.</b> When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.|$|E

Archaeologists used soil stains to discover storage pits, burned tree roots, and postoles; this analysis also yielded fragments of glass, ceramics, and iron which were discovered to have been parts of plates, bottles, and cooking pots.

500|$|On 4 February 2013, the University of Leicester {{confirmed}} that the skeleton was beyond reasonable doubt that of King Richard III. This conclusion was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence, <b>soil</b> <b>analysis,</b> and dental tests (there were some molars missing {{as a result of}} caries), as well as physical characteristics of the skeleton which are highly consistent with contemporary accounts of Richard's appearance. The team announced that the [...] "arrowhead" [...] discovered with the body was a Roman-era nail, probably disturbed when the body was first interred. However, there were numerous perimortem wounds on the body, and part of the skull had been sliced off with a bladed weapon; this would have caused rapid death. The team concluded that {{it is unlikely that the}} king was wearing a helmet in his last moments. Soil taken from the Plantagenet king's remains was found to contain microscopic roundworm eggs. Several eggs were found in samples taken from the pelvis, where the king's intestines were, but not from the skull and only very small numbers were identified in soil surrounding the grave. The findings suggest that the higher concentration of eggs in the pelvic area probably arose from a roundworm infection the King suffered in his life, rather than from human waste dumped in the area at a later date, researchers said. The Mayor of Leicester announced that the king's skeleton would be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral in early 2014, but a judicial review of that decision delayed the reinterment for a year. A museum to Richard III was opened in July 2014 in the Victorian school buildings next to the Greyfriars grave site.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{methods used}} to analyze archaeological sites are {{relevant}} to the analysis of landscapes.

[...] Pollen, soil, faunal, and floral analysis allows the archaeologist to understand the natural vegetation of an area, vegetation that was actively grown by area settlers, and the animal life that also lived in the area. An understanding of the plant and animal life specific to an area can lead to, for example, an analysis of the types of food available to members of the community, an understanding of the actual diet typical for a subset of a population, and site and skeletal dating.

40|$|Scatec Solar’s solar {{photovoltaic}} {{power plant in}} Kalkbult, South Africa, is in an area with excellent properties for harvesting solar energy. Vast areas {{with little or no}} conflict with agriculture and high irradiance. This semi-arid area has low precipitation and dust and soiling can be a problem when accumulating on solar module surfaces. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the power loss from soiling on the solar panels, and to create a model to investigate if, and when, the modules should be cleaned. The <b>soiling</b> <b>analysis</b> will be conducted by analyzing data from a test facility inside the Kalkbult solar plant. The test facility consists of 16 crystalline Silicon modules, and 8 Cadmium-Telluride thin film modules. Current-Voltage data from these modules is used to calculate losses due to soiling by comparing uncleaned reference modules with clean modules. The results from the <b>soiling</b> <b>analysis</b> will be used to calculate a cleaning schedule. In addition, an experimental analysis of a dust sample from the area is analyzed. The period considered in this thesis is November 2016 to April 2017. The <b>soiling</b> <b>analysis</b> showed no <b>soiling</b> losses of the silicon modules, and just 1 % power loss for the thin film modules in early November 2016. This resulted in no cleaning action in this period, as the marginal cost of cleaning per module was much higher than the marginal cost of soiling from the thin film panels. There was quite frequent rainfall in the period, and the cleaning effect of the rain seemed to eliminate power loss from soiling. Data from May to October 2016 was available, and in July there was enough soiling to trigger the cleaning schedule. However, the model assumes that all soiling is eliminated for a whole month, and the power plant is cleaned over a period of 47 days, {{there is reason to believe}} that soiling will occur simultaneously as the cleaning, and the economically viability of cleaning at all is highly questionable. A dust sample was analyzed in a scanning electron microscope to determine the composition and size distribution of the local dust in Kalkbult. The analysis showed that the dust was mostly organic, accompanied by salts and silica.
