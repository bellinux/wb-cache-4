50|$|The {{methods used}} to apply the ink to the cornea differ. In one such method, the {{physician}} applies the ink into the cornea stroma by multiple punctures, covering the needle with ink each time. In another method, the physician would cover a three-edged <b>spatula</b> <b>needle</b> with ink before each puncture. He would then apply the ink into the anterior corneal stroma with each puncture. Samuel Theobald would inject the eye first with a needle and then rub in the ink with a Daviel curet. This would prevent against the often obscure field of operation known to other physicians and also prevent against repetitive irrigation sometimes needed.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{performance}} and results of corneal tattooing {{are described in}} a case series of 11 patients suffering from a disfiguring corneal scar using a technique similar to conventional dermato-graphy. Methods: Drawing ink in different shades was applied into the anterior corneal stroma by punctures performed with a conventional <b>spatula</b> <b>needle.</b> Results: Up to 4 years after surgery all patients still had satisfactory staining of the formerly cosmeti-cally disfiguring corneal scar. Conclusion: Tattooing of unsightly corneal scars {{proved to be an}} efficient and easy to perform tech-nique, yielding acceptable results during follow up. Permanent colouring of unsightly corneal scars has beenknown for almost 2000 years. 1 During the final decade ofthe 19 th and {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century it was a commonly applied technique. 2 – 4 Owing to the tremendous progress in microsurgical reconstructive procedures, corneal tattooing today will only apply for a minor and carefully selected group of patients. We report on a pragmatic approach to this ancient treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all 11 patients undergoing corneal tattooing (Table 1), there was no option of functional improvement by other treatments. An iris print contact lens was either not accepted by the patient or became increasingly uncomfortable. None of the blind patients were willing to undergo enucleation. Using an operating microscope, the colouring agent was applied into the anterior stroma—without previous removal of the corneal epithelium—by bevelled punctures using a three edged <b>spatula</b> <b>needle</b> (CSA- 48 C; asymptotic <b>spatula</b> <b>needle</b> with micropoint) of a conventional 10. 0 nylon suture (Ethilo...|$|E

50|$|Compared to the ENA, the ENB {{phase is}} very similar. The main change is stylistic {{differences}} on pottery. Cardium style pottery {{is still the}} main type. Use of comb impressions in pottery begin to appear. The bone industry became more specified, containing <b>needles,</b> <b>spatulas,</b> and even a ring. Further widening of species of plant remains is evident during the ENB, including barley, peas, and wheat. Herbivore coprolites were {{also found in the}} soil as evidence of the penning of animals in the shelter. This layer is considered to be the main occupation phase of the site.|$|R
5000|$|The Llethryd Tooth Cave, or Tooth Hole cave, is an Early Bronze Age ossuary site in a {{limestone}} cave, about 1500 yd north, {{northwest of}} the Parc Cwm long cairn cromlech, on private land along the Parc le Breos Cwm valley, {{near the village of}} Llethryd. The cave was rediscovered by cavers in 1961, who found human bones. The excavation carried out by D.P. Webley & J. Harvey in 1962 revealed the disarticulated remains (i.e. incomplete skeletons) of six adults and two children, dated to the Early Bronze Age or Beaker culture.

50|$|In the eponymous site {{were found}} {{the remains of}} {{buildings}} with rectangular plan enclosed in a ditch dug in the rock forming an oval space of about 180 x 200 meters. The burials of this culture, found in various places in Sicily, but not in Stentinello, were oval pit carved into the rock in which the deceased lie buried in a crouched position. The material culture includes lithic industry of flint and obsidian, industry of bone (awls, <b>needles,</b> <b>spatulas)</b> and ceramics. The vases, black, or dark in color, are almost always decorated with intricate geometric, or, more rarely, anthropomorphic, patterns etched or engraved. The economy {{was based on the}} cultivation of cereals, particularly wheat and barley, on fishing and shellfish harvesting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tools and}} tackles found {{consisted}} of 118 fragmented and 75 complete ground stone implements, found polished. Some {{of these are}} blades made of flint, stone adzes, pestles, pounders, querns, palettes, grinders, spindle whorls made of clay to spin wool, 400 worked pebbles, black and green serpentines and marbles, all indicative of use in wood crafting, animal skinning, grinding to prepare pigments for decorative pottery; there was about a thousand chipped stone items, mainly consisting of blades, flint flakes, chert and quartz. Bone implements or bone tools consisted of awls, points, <b>needles,</b> <b>spatulas</b> and fish hooks. [...] "Sling bullets, particularly with a fairly standardized ovoid or biconical shape with pouted ends and average length of 5 - 6 cm were found both baked and unbaked. They are common in Early and Middle Neolithic Greece, southeast Europe, and Near East, and have been found variously interpreted for use as fighting or hunting weapons, shepherd implements, equipment used to determine oven temperature or transfer heat to food and possibly to rooms, counters, gaming pieces and even loom weights." ...|$|R
40|$|This BA thesis {{investigates the}} worked-bone {{assemblage}} of Late Bronze Age (LBA) Tell Sabi Abyad (ca. 1230 - 1150 B. C), a settlement mound {{located in the}} Raqqa province of Northern Syria. The LBA settlement comprises a Middle Assyrian stronghold. It was a military and administrative centre which primarily functioned as a fortified farmstead, named a dunnu by the Assyrians. The goal of this thesis {{is to determine the}} character of the assemblage and to shed light on the function and role of the bone artefacts in the LBA society. In addition I have performed a diachronic analysis to find out whether the assemblage changed through time. The worked-bone assemblage is a relatively small but diverse. It comprises approximately 105 artefacts. A preliminary classification, based on morphology, is presented. The assemblage consists of three categories: bone tools, bone ornaments and other bone objects. The category bone tools comprise awls, combs, <b>needles,</b> <b>spatulas</b> and nails. The bone ornaments exist from beads, inlay, plaques and a bracelet. The other bone objects comprise discs, polished knucklebones and a number of miscellaneous objects. First, the function of the artefacts is analysed based on their morphology and when possible, traces of use. For some artefacts, the analysis of the morphology could not shed light on a plausible function. To further elucidate their function and role, the context of the artefacts was analysed. I have tried to elucidate in which areas of the LBA settlement the bone artefacts were used. From the context and morphology it appears that the worked-bone artefacts were used in domestic buildings, workshops and in open areas of the Late Bronze Age settlement. They were probably used for pottery production and in the production of basketry, matting and leather working. The bone objects had a diverse role in society as they were used as tools, jewellery, personal ornaments, game pieces and grave goods. They were present in every phase of the LBA occupation. The worked-bone objects of LBA Tell Sabi Abyad may have been small in numbers but were used in all dimensions of society for a large variety of activities...|$|R
