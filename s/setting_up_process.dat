40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science by ResearchMotor racing games are pushing the boundaries of realism and player experience. Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows developers to create believable opponents. By getting their AI to follow a racing line {{that is similar to}} that taken by real racing drivers, developers are able to create a sense that the AI racers are trained drivers. This paper identifies two methods used in the field: the sector based system and the sensor based system. The sector based approach offers two or more predetermined lines for the AI to follow, with added logic allowing the AI to judge when to switch between lines. The sensor method is able to guide AI vehicles around tracks with sensors, offering more possible behaviours and lines. After implementation, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} both methods are realised. The planning and development of a hybrid system was based on these findings. The resulting system is able to produce a more believable line for the AI.

40|$|The European Union has and {{continues}} to place human rights and democracy {{at the heart of}} its external relations, namely through its activities in the UN human rights system. With the ongoing criticism about the inadequacies of the UN Commission on Human Rights Kofi Annan recommended that this ailing body be replaced with a new and more effective Human Rights Council. In light of the European Union’s desire to further human rights and democracy across the globe it rapidly got involved in playing an active and visible role in the overarching UN human rights reform process. Negotiations for establishing the Human Rights Council in addition to the deliberations of the mandated working groups outlining the details and modalities of the Council involved making difficult and demanding decisions. The different opinions and positions not only led to a delayed inception but also generated concerns that the new Council would not be any more efficient or credible than its predecessor. Many have claimed that its first operational year has produced disappointing results by not taking more concrete action regarding countries facing dire human rights crises such as Zimbabwe. In contrast, others argue that in its first year the Council did achieve a number of successes including the modalities of the Universal Periodic Review process, the review of UN Special Procedures, the adoption of the codes of conduct for mandate holders in addition to the adoption of a number of resolutions of great importance in the Council’s plenary. The European Union actively participated in each phase and in all areas of the Human Rights Council from the <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>process</b> to engaging in the sometimes arduous negotiations of both procedural and substantive matters. While it has indeed been successful in the workings of some areas the EU’s shortcomings have recently overshadowed its achievements. The following study explores the role of the EU in the Human Rights Council from the setting-up process to its contributions in the review of the UN Special Procedures, the UPR process and the plenary sessions since the Council’s inception. Following the highlighting of both the EU’s achievements and shortcomings the study concludes with five core recommendations that have the potential to help rectify the challenges currently faced by the European Union in the Human Rights Council...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring recent decades, {{major public}} road {{authorities}} showed an increasing trend in seeking for alternative ways {{to establish and}} implement road infrastructures concession systems, with the main aim to make it doable in a reliable, socio-economically sustainable and cost effective manner. This phenomenon is mainly due to increasingly higher risks related {{to the establishment of}} road concession system and risk related to the introduction of road toll payment requirements. During the last three years, ANAS International Enterprise S. p. A., a subsidiary company of the Italian Highway Agency ANAS S. p. A., has been appointed for assessing the feasibility and comprehensively structuring road concessions, through the implementation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative, for a large part of road network of the Republic of Colombia. The main activities consisted in (i) the development of a financial model, consistent with the rules and economic parameters related to the Colombian market; (ii) the assessment of the economic and financial feasibility; (iii) carrying out studies and simulations for several concessions scenarios implementation, including analysis of risks and technical, financial and legal assessment; (iv) preparation of tender documentation and delivery of technical support to the National Infrastructure Agency during the public-private partnership awarding process. Along with these activities, the implementation of an innovative road concession system allowed the transfer and application of a number of best practices in various sectors. Indeed, improvement on the following aspects have been achieved:•Innovations in construction, including alternative solutions for road embankment slope stabilization; barriers against rock falls; asphalt concrete mixtures modified with polymers;•Technological innovations, including intelligent transport systems, telecommunications and information infrastructure, subsystem tolls, transport operating centers, subsystem video surveillance cameras hotspots, emergency call subsystem, weighing subsystem, lighting systems in urban areas and tolls;•Innovations in financial structuring, including tailor-made regulating financial planning and monitoring tools, introduction of innovative solutions for the use of appropriate discount rates aimed to ensure investor profitability, assessment tool to manage public- and private-sides risks, assessing tools to ensure value for money, implementation of alternative solutions for public participation in Project Financing initiatives, development and implementation of alternative solutions for private funding in the financing process (including structuring infrastructure bonds), adoption of PPP structure type contracts provisions;In this paper, the Authors describe in detail the concession implementation process, by particularly focusing on criteria adopted in selecting the contract type and related aspects, and highlighting main criticalities identified throughout the concession <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>process.</b> Aiming to give food for thought for further development of road infrastructure concession practice implementation, this paper aims to provide the Reader with an analysis of an actual successful case study and accurate and well-balanced comments on advantages, disadvantages and criticalities faced...|$|E

40|$|This was a {{case study}} that looked at the way a new {{education}} department {{was set up in}} the new Peterborough unitary authority between 1996 and 1998. The aim was to investigate the way in which a new LEA was set up and identify the national and local influences that may have been influential in the decision making process. The research design was constructed to take into account that the case study involved an institution which was being set up over a period of two years. It would be chronologically based and a historical methodology would be the basis of research work. Within this framework, participant observation, interviews and documentary research would be the research tools used. This would also have the advantage that this approach made good use of the experience and skills of the researcher. A number of theoretical models were used in this case study. These included the rational actor model, bounded rationality, disjointed incrementalism, organisational process, bureaucratic politics model, Sabatier's political change model and Bachrach and Baratz's pluralist model. This range of models was adopted in the expectation that each had its own particular focus within the decision making process but taken together they could provide an over-lapping view. The new education department was set up {{at a time when there}} were concerns over the future economic situation of the UK. There was a national debate concerning what public services were needed and how best to provide them. The previous Conservative Government had reduced the powers of the local authorities and the new Labour government was to encourage local authorities to find the best way of providing services. For the new unitary authority, the challenge was to set up a new LEA which met local needs. However, this was a period of national political change and a new central government was formed in the middle of the <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>process.</b> This was to cause the new LEA to re-plan to take into account expected strategic changes. The education department faced a number of challenges. There was local opposition to the setting up of a unitary authority. The city administration favoured policies which were to run counter to central government expectations. Few experienced education officers were available to the new LEA The main findings of the case study were: Central government was the single greatest influence in the setting up of the education department. Government legislation changed the role, responsibilities and structure of the new department. These changes over-stretched the new LEA, especially as central government did not provide a sufficient level of funding to the LEA. The DfEE was an important influence on the early development of the department. At first, the DfEE did not intervene and there was no guidance available to the new LEA. The city council and education department spent a year preparing to set up a new LEA and then found that it had to make significant changes on the election of a new government 12 months before the unitary authority was to be established. Local social and economic issues were ignored by the DfEE?s focus on national targets. These local problems had a significant affect on student achievement so the LEA never met government targets. The institutional culture of the city council was not supportive of the new LEA. This helped to create a shortage of able and experienced senior education officers. The education department received limited support from the local schools. Many schools had opposed unitary authority status and half of all secondary schools were grant maintained by 1996. In 1998 the education department was facing an overspend of nearly Â£ 1 million. Senior education officers resigned their posts and within a year the education department had to be re-organised...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, a {{tool for}} the {{evaluation}} of the resource requirements of pharmaceutical production processes is presented. The pharmaceutical industry consumes a lot of resources for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API’s). Many efforts are made to reduce this resource consumption. Second generation processes as well as new technologies are implemented to replace the current processes. Before implementation, the potential of improvement is however to be quantified. The tool developed and presented in this dissertation allows the assessment of the resource requirements of new and existing processes and technologies. The resource requirements are calculated based on the inputs from existing batch production reports and the knowledge of the chemical reaction mechanisms. Resources are expressed using thermodynamics. Exergy analysis allows a coherent and scientifically sound way of evaluating different kind of resources on one single scale. The evaluation occurs at three different levels, being the process, gate-to-gate and cradle-to-gate level. At these three levels, the resource requirements can be calculated and evaluated for different kind of processes. In this dissertation, first an introduction is given {{about the state of the}} art concerning the environmental sustainability assessment in chemical and more specific the pharmaceutical industry (chapter 2). The currently available environmental sustainability concepts and metrics (green chemistry, LCA, exergy [...] .) are discussed. After this introduction, chapter 3 goes more into detail and focuses on the different advantages of using exergy analysis {{for the evaluation of}} resource consumption at different levels. It is shown that the exergy approach, based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, is applicable as sustainability metric in the field of environmental technology. In chapter 4, a methodology is presented for <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>process</b> specific mass and energy balances over different system boundaries in the pharmaceutical industry. This methodology is the basis for the resource evaluation tool as presented in chapter 5. Combining the mass and energy balance (chapter 4) with an environmental impact assessment methodology, in this case exergy analysis (chapter 3) results in a resource evaluation tool which only requires the input from batch production reports and the chemical reaction pathway. This resource evaluation tool is tested for 5 different cases from Janssen Pharmaceutica, part of the Johnson and Johnson Group. Results are presented for different system boundaries. In chapter 6 and 7; two extensions for the resource evaluation tool as available in chapter 5 are presented. In chapter 6, two new technologies are evaluated using similar principles as used in the evaluation tool. Prep-HPLC is compared with prep-SFC on their resource efficiency. Again exergy analysis over different system boundaries has proven to be a valuable resource evaluation assessment methodology. In chapter 7 the resource requirement for the treatment of an on-site distillation is compared with an off-site incineration. Here the importance of defining a good functional unit and system boundaries is illustrated. These treatment options for waste solvents can be inserted in the resource evaluation tool, together with new technologies as SFC, HPLC, but also microreactor technologies. Overall, it can be concluded that the resource evaluation tool as presented in chapter 5 allows a faster evaluation of specific pharmaceutical processes thanks to the reduced data requirement. The evaluation of the resource consumption over three different system boundaries using exergy analysis has added value for the selection and comparison of specific pharmaceutical production processes. It can be concluded that taking into account resource requirements over different system boundaries gives a more complete and more reliable view on the resource consumption than an approach at the narrow system boundary. This tool will help to reduce the integral resource consumption of specific production processes by pinpointing the major resource consumers and indicating potential improvements. In this way, this tool can contribute to a more environmentally sustainable API production. From chapter 6 and 7, it can however be concluded that the methods used for the development of this tool are also applicable on other cases. In best case, these cases can also be added into the resource evaluation tool resulting in a continually growing and improving calculation tool for evaluation of pharmaceutical production processes...|$|E
