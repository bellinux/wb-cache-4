40|$|Water taro root {{plants are}} wild plants mostly found abundantly in swamp {{area in the}} middle of the jungle and along the Kapuas river bank. Taro root plants are like {{creeping}} roots on trees with the roots dangling down along the tree height, with an estimate length 3 up to 7 metres. The shapes of these plants resemble <b>stem</b> <b>nut,</b> and if the inside part of taro root plants are pared, there is strong root of taro root plants to bind off. At a glance, the plants look like processed rattan, but taro root plants are much better due to their smooth and strong texture of the roots which makes the plants easy to be plaited into various handicraft. These plants are suitable as raw materials for webbing. For webbing handicraft, taro root plants are the typical commodity from West Kalimantan especially because of the raw matarials of these plants can only be found in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the results of}} recent tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These tests address {{the effectiveness of the}} lubricant used on the threaded portion of the valve stem, where the <b>stem</b> <b>nut</b> turns on the stem. Recent testing indicates that an elevated temperature environment can lead to significant increases in the friction coefficient at the stem/stem-nut interface. Most valve actuator qualification tests are performed at room temperature. Similarly, in-service tests are run at ambient plant temperatures, usually 70 to 100 0;F. Since design conditions can lead to valve operating temperatures in the 200 to 300 0;F range, {{it is important to know}} whether a temperature-induced increase in friction at the stem/stem-nut interface will prevent the required operation of critical valves. Lubricant aging is another phenomenon that might have deleterious effects on the thrust output of a valve actuator. Laboratory experience and field experience both indicate that after long periods in elevated temperature environments, the lubricants may lose their lubrication qualities. The scope of the current test program includes testing of five different lubricants on four different valve stems. Pending completion of the testing, results of the tests conducted using two of the four stems are discussed. The test series included collection of baseline data at room temperature, single step temperature tests where the temperature of the test setup was elevated directly to 250 °F, and step testing where the temperature was elevated in steps to 130, 190, and 250 °F, then returned to 70 °F. All greases tested showed evidence of physical change after elevated temperature tests. Except for one particular lubricant, all of the greases tested showed increased coefficients of friction at elevated temperatures. Numerous other preliminary conclusions are presented. Recommendations for future research in the area of aged valve stem lubricant performance at elevated temperatures are also presented...|$|E

The nut sits in a cup during its 18-month maturation; the outside surface of the cup is rough with short spines. The nuts are {{produced}} in clusters of a few together on a single <b>stem.</b> The <b>nut</b> kernel is very bitter, and is inedible for people without extensive leaching, although squirrels eat them.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{antioxidants}} {{can protect}} {{the human body}} from free radicals and retard the progress of many chronic diseases as well as lipid oxidative rancidity in foods. The role of antioxidants has protected effect against free radical damage that may cause many diseases including cancer. Primary sources of naturally occurring antioxidants are known as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Several studies suggest that regular consumption of nuts, mostly walnuts, may have beneficial effects against oxidative stress mediated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The role of antioxidants has attracted much interest {{with respect to their}} protective effect against free radical damage that may cause many diseases including cancer. Juglans regia L. (walnut) contains antioxidant compounds, which are thought to contribute to their biological properties. Polyphenols, flavonoids and flavonols concentrations and antioxidant activity of Leaves, <b>Stems</b> and <b>Nuts</b> extract of Juglans regia L. as evaluated using DPPH, ABTS, Nitric acid, hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation and total oxidation activity were determined. The antioxidant activities of Leaves, <b>Stems</b> and <b>Nuts</b> extract of Juglans regia L. were concentration dependent in different experimental models and it was observed that free radicals were scavenged by the test compounds in all the models...|$|R
50|$|Between each {{developmental}} stage, {{the juvenile}} rests as a chrysalis on a plant.Brevipalpus mites damage their host plants by inserting their relatively long mouthparts into the plant tissue and injecting saliva during feeding. The saliva is toxic to the plant. Damage on grapefruit, for example, {{takes the form}} of circular, discolored lesions on the fruit which darken as they become necrotic. On pistachio, Brevipalpus damage appears as scabby blotches on the leaf petioles, <b>stems,</b> and <b>nuts.</b> Furthermore, several of these mites are vectors for a variety of serious plant viruses.|$|R
40|$|Some motor {{operated}} valves now have higher torque switch settings due to regulatory requirements to ensure valve operability with appropriate margins at design basis conditions. Verifying operability with these settings imposes higher stem loads during periodic inservice testing. These higher test loads increase stresses {{in the various}} valve internal parts which may in turn increase the fatigue usage factors. This increased fatigue is judged to be a concern primarily in the valve disks, seats, yokes, <b>stems,</b> and <b>stem</b> <b>nuts.</b> Although the motor operators may also have significantly increased loading, they are being evaluated by the manufacturers and are {{beyond the scope of}} this study. Two gate valves representative of both relatively weak and strong valves commonly used in commercial nuclear applications were selected for fatigue analyses. Detailed dimensional and test data were available for both valves from previous studies at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Finite element models were developed to estimate maximum stresses in the internal parts of the valves and to identity the critical areas within the valves where fatigue may be a concern. Loads were estimated using industry standard equations for calculating torque switch settings prior and subsequent to the testing requirements of USNRC Generic Letter 89 [...] 10. Test data were used to determine both; (1) the overshoot load between torque switch trip and final seating of the disk during valve closing and (2) the stem thrust required to open the valves. The ranges of peak stresses thus determined were then used to estimate the increase in the fatigue usage factors due to the higher stem thrust loads. The usages that would be accumulated by 100 base cycles plus one or eight test cycles per year over 40 and 60 years of operation were calculated...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, <b>nuts,</b> <b>stems,</b> leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|R

40|$|Small {{quantity}} of energetic material coated {{on the inner}} wall of a polymer tube is proposed as a new method to generate micro-shock waves in the laboratory. These micro-shock waves have been harnessed to develop a novel method of delivering dry particle and liquid jet into the target. We have generated micro-shock waves {{with the help of}} reactive explosive compound high melting explosive (octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine) and traces of aluminium] coated polymer tube, utilising 9 J of energy. The detonation process is initiated electrically {{from one end of the}} tube, while the micro-shock wave followed by the products of detonation escape from the open end of the polymer tube. The energy available at the open end of the polymer tube is used to accelerate tungsten micro-particles coated on the other side of the diaphragm or force a liquid jet out of a small cavity filled with the liquid. The micro-particles deposited on a thin metal diaphragm (typically 100 -mu m thick) were accelerated to high velocity using micro-shock waves to penetrate the target. Tungsten particles of 0. 7 mu m diameter have been successfully delivered into agarose gel targets of various strengths (0. 6 - 1. 0 %). The device has been tested by delivering micro-particles into potato tuber and Arachis hypogaea Linnaeus (ground <b>nut)</b> <b>stem</b> tissue. Along similar lines, liquid jets of diameter 200 - 250 mu m (methylene blue, water and oils) have been successfully delivered into agarose gel targets of various strengths. Successful vaccination against murine salmonellosis was demonstrated as a biological application of this device. The penetration depths achieved in the experimental targets are very encouraging to develop a future device for biological and biomedical applications...|$|R
