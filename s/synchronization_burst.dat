In particular, we analyzed the <b>bursting</b> <b>synchronization</b> of neurons described by two timescales (spiking and bursting activity), and coupled through such a long-range interaction network.

In this paper, we study fast <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> for power line communication (PLC) systems operating below 500 kHz and transmitting data rates of up to about 500 kbps as it is typical in various PLC network applications. In particular, we are concerned with the receiver processing of the preamble signal and the actual design of preambles suitable for fast <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> in such PLC systems. Our approach is comprehensive in that it takes into account the most distinctive characteristics of the power line channel, which are multipath propagation, highly varying path loss, and disturbance by impulse noise, as well as important practical constraints, especially the need for spectral shaping of the preamble signal and fast adjustment of the automatic gain control (AGC). In fact, we regard the explicit incorporation of these various requirements into the preamble design as the main contribution of this work. We devise an optimization criterion and a stochastic algorithm to search for suitable preamble sequences. A comprehensive performance comparison of a designed and two conventional preambles shows that the designed sequence is superior in terms of (a) fast <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> in various transmission environments, (b) fast AGC adjustment, and (c) compliance of its spectrum with the spectral mask applied to the data transmit signal. </p...|$|R

The instantaneous population firing rate (IPFR) $R(t) $, which may be directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing population behaviors in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the case of spiking neurons, realistic thermodynamic order parameter and statistical-mechanical spiking measure, based on $R(t) $, were introduced in our recent work to make practical characterization of spike synchronization. Here, we separate the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales via frequency filtering, and extend the thermodynamic order parameter and the statistical-mechanical measure {{to the case of}} bursting neurons. Consequently, it is shown in explicit examples that both the order parameters and the statistical-mechanical measures may be effectively used to characterize the <b>burst</b> and spike <b>synchronizations</b> of <b>bursting</b> neurons.

A transition to mutual phase synchronization takes place on the bursting time scale of coupled oscillators, while on the spiking time scale, they behave asynchronously. It is shown that phase synchronization is largely facilitated by a large fraction of shortcuts, but saturates when it exceeds a critical value. We also study the external chaotic phase <b>synchronization</b> of <b>bursting</b> oscillators in the small-world network by a periodic driving signal applied to a single neuron.

Thus, noise-induced slow <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> and fasg spike synchronization are found to appear in a synchronized region of the $J-D$ plane. As the rewiring probability $p$ is decreased from 1 (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the region of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the $J-D$ plane, while {{the region of the}} <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> decreases slowly. Population synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in experiments. Instantaneous population firing rate, $R(t) $, which is directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes, is a realistic population quantity exhibiting collective behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales. Through frequency filtering, we separate $R(t) $ into $R_b(t) $ (describing the slow bursting behavior) and $R_s(t) $ (describing the fast intraburst spiking behavior).

40|$|We {{consider}} an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths {{governed by the}} spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying the noise intensity D in the Barabási-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for the case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a few "hubs" (i. e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a "Matthew" effect in synaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing D, {{in contrast to a}} relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In the presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on the SBS for a fixed D. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).

40|$|The {{pathology}} of Parkinson's disease (PD) {{is characterized}} by modified behavior of neuronal networks in the basal ganglia after depletion of dopamine. PD states show bursting neural activity and high synchronization among neurons as well as altered oscillations in local field potentials. These network modifications {{are thought to be}} directly related to PD motor symptoms such as tremor, akinesia and bradykinesia. Computational models of the basal ganglia can reproduce physiological and pathological neuronal behavior depending on certain parameter values [1]. However, it is still a matter of debate what triggers and stabilizes the pathological behavior and how deep brain stimulation (DBS) influences it. In particular, computational models suffer from a lack of experimental data on structure and function. They commonly estimate the degree and course of chemical synapses and do not take electrical synapses (neuronal gap junctions) into account. Gap junctions (GJs), constructed out of connexins (Cxs), are direct electrical connections between cells. In different parts of the brain, neuronal gap junctions {{have been shown to be}} able to lead to <b>synchronization,</b> <b>bursting</b> and oscillations. They are remodeled in a number of different diseases and can change their conductance under the influence of neurotransmitters such as dopamine [2]. Current research also demonstrated activity-dependent plasticity of GJs [3]. In our experiments, we look for the occurence of Cx 36, a neuronal Cx, by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy in rat tissue of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and internal segment (GPi). We found spots of Cx 36 in all three nuclei at a level that is roughly comparable to the Cx 36 level in the striatum, where coupling of neurons via gap junctions is well described in literature. We investigated the impact of gap junctions in a computational model of the basal ganglia, the Rubin-Terman-Model [4] including STN, GPe and GPi. Gap junctions between neighboring neurons were implemented as ohmic resistors inside the three nuclei. At low conductances of the gap junctions, the network showed irregular (physiological) states. After uprising gap junction conductance, STN and GPe showed bursting and the firing rate of the GPi increased. In all neurons, synchronization was enhanced. These states are in high accordance with experimental measurements of neural activity in PD patients and animal models of PD. Our results strongly suggest a role of neuronal gap junctions in PD pathology. The modulation of gap junctions by dopamine might be a candidate for the remodeling of oscillations, <b>synchronization</b> and <b>bursting.</b> A better understanding of these basic processes can in later stages lead to improved therapies such as refined stimulation protocols for DBS or novel medications. Currently we are extending our experiments to human post-mortem tissue of PD patients and controls.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt {{is widely}} held that single cells in {{anterior}} cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) coordinate their activity during attentional processes, although cellular activity that may underlie such coordination across ACC/PFC has not been identified. We thus recorded cells in five ACC/PFC subfields of macaques {{engaged in a}} selective attention task, characterized those spiking events that indexed attention, and identified how spiking of distinct cell populations synchronized between brain areas. ResultsWe found that cells in ACC/PFC increased the firing of brief 200  Hz spike bursts when subjects shifted attention and engaged in selective visual processing. In contrast to nonburst spikes, burst spikes synchronized over large distances to local field potentials at narrow beta (12 – 20  Hz) and at gamma (50 – 75  Hz) frequencies. Long-range <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> was anatomically specific, functionally connecting those subfields in area 24 (ACC) and area 46 (PFC) that are key players of attentional control. By splitting cells into putative excitatory (pE) and inhibitory (pI) cells by their broad and narrow spikes, we identified that bursts of pI cells preceded and that bursts of pE cells followed in time periods of maximal beta coherent network activity. In contrast, gamma bursts were transient impulses with equal timing across cell classes. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that processes underlying burst firing and <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> are candidate mechanisms to coordinate attention information across brain areas. We speculate that distinct burst-firing motifs realize beta and gamma synchrony to trigger versus maintain functional network states during goal-directed behavior...|$|R
