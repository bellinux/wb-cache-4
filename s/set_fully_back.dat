40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{analysis of}} low velocity transverse impact on <b>fully</b> <b>backed</b> sandwich beams with composite faces from Eglass/epoxy and cores from Polyurethane or PVC. Indentation on sandwich beams has been analyzed {{with the existing}} theories and modeled with the FE code ABAQUS, also loadings have been done experimentally to verify theoretical results. Impact on <b>fully</b> <b>backed</b> has been modeled in two cases of impactor energy with SDOF model (single-degree-of-freedom) and indentation stiffness: lower energy for elastic indentation of sandwich beams and higher energy for plastic area in indentation. Impacts have been modeled by ABAQUS. Impact results can describe response of beam in terms of core and faces thicknesses, core material, indentor energy and energy absorbed. The foam core is modeled using the crushable foam material model and response of the foam core is experimentally characterized in uniaxial compression with higher velocity loading to define quasi impact behaviour...|$|R
