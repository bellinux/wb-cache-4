5|$|The Panthers {{were not}} a box office success, and Fuchs planned to move the team to Providence, Rhode Island for the 1926 season, with <b>Stengel</b> to remain in his roles. However, McGraw, with whom <b>Stengel</b> had {{remained}} close, wanted him to take over as manager of the Giants' top affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association, at an increase in salary. He was still under contract, and Fuchs refused to release him. So Manager <b>Stengel</b> resigned, which President <b>Stengel</b> accepted, and the president then released <b>Stengel</b> {{as a player and}} resigned. Fuchs was outraged, and went to Judge Landis, who advised him to let the matter go.|$|E
5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that <b>Stengel</b> would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted <b>Stengel</b> as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, <b>Stengel</b> was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that <b>Stengel</b> took the job to give something back to the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stengel</b> {{had become}} {{famous for his}} humorous and {{sometimes}} disjointed way of speech while with the Yankees, and these skills of showmanship served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. <b>Stengel</b> retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events {{for the rest of}} his life. Although <b>Stengel</b> is sometimes described as one of the great managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during the Yankee years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was only a good manager when given good players. <b>Stengel</b> is remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history.|$|E

5000|$|Particularly as he aged, <b>Stengel's</b> gnarled {{features}} were a calling card. Upon <b>Stengel's</b> death, San Francisco Examiner sportswriter Wells Twombly's obituary began, [...] "On casual inspection, {{the old man}} looked like a woodcarver's first attempt at a gargoyle," [...] before declaring [...] "Up close, {{the old man was}} genuinely beautiful." ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Stengel,</b> hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. <b>Stengel,</b> in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, <b>Stengel</b> {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving <b>Stengel</b> the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. <b>Stengel</b> got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of <b>Stengel,</b> noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{finished}} {{fifth in}} 1935 and seventh in 1936. Dodger management felt <b>Stengel</b> {{had not done}} enough with the talent he had been given, and he was fired during the 1936 World Series between the Yankees and Giants. <b>Stengel</b> was paid for one year left on his contract, {{and he was not}} involved in baseball during the 1937 season. <b>Stengel</b> had invested in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, Randy Moore, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well to do, and they put the profits in California real estate. <b>Stengel</b> considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president Bob Quinn offered him the Boston managerial job in late 1937, and he accepted.|$|E
5|$|The Pirates {{had been}} the only National League team to do worse than the Dodgers in 1917, {{finishing}} last. <b>Stengel</b> met with the Pirates owner, Barney Dreyfuss to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until <b>Stengel</b> proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, <b>Stengel</b> was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had been fighting in World War I for a year, and <b>Stengel</b> enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the Brooklyn Navy Yard's baseball team, driving in the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds. He also occasionally helped paint a ship—he later stated he had guarded the Gowanus Canal, and not a single submarine got into it.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stengel</b> {{also participated}} in Old-Timers' Day {{at a number of}} ballparks, including, regularly, Shea Stadium. In 1970, the Yankees invited him to Old-Timers' Day, at which his number, 37, was to be retired. By this time, the Yankee {{ownership}} had changed, and the people responsible for his dismissal were no longer with the team. He accepted and attended, and <b>Stengel</b> became the fifth Yankee to have his number retired. He thereafter became a regular at the Yankees' Old-Timers' Day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stengel</b> often rotated infielders between positions, {{with the}} Yankees having no real regular second baseman or shortstop between 1954 and 1958. Despite this, the Yankees {{had a strong}} {{defensive}} infield throughout. <b>Stengel</b> gave great attention to the double play, both defensively and in planning his lineup, and the Yankees responded by being first {{in the league in}} double plays as a defense six times in his twelve-year tenure, and the batters hit into the fewest double plays as a team eight times in that era. Having had few players he could rely upon while managing Brooklyn and Boston, <b>Stengel</b> treated his Yankee roster with little sentimentality, trading players quickly when their performance seemed to decline, regardless of past accomplishments. Assured of quality replacements secured by the Yankee front office, the technique worked well, but was not a success with the Mets, where no quality replacements were available, and the technique caused confusion and apathy among the players.|$|E

5|$|The first {{twenty years}} of <b>Stengel's</b> second career brought mostly poor finishes, {{especially}} during his MLB managerial stints with the Dodgers (1934–1936) and Braves (1938–1943). He thereafter enjoyed some success on the minor league level, and Yankee general manager George Weiss hired him as manager in October 1948. <b>Stengel's</b> Yankees won the World Series five consecutive times (1949–1953), {{the only time that}} has been achieved. Although the team won ten pennants in his twelve seasons, and won seven World Series, his final two years brought less success, with a third-place finish in 1959, and a loss in the 1960 World Series. By then aged 70, he was dismissed by the Yankees shortly after the defeat.|$|R
5|$|The Oaks {{finished}} second in the league behind the Seals in 1946, winning {{the first round of the}} playoffs against Los Angeles before losing to San Francisco in the finals. They finished fourth in 1947, beating San Francisco in the first round before losing to Los Angeles. <b>Stengel</b> managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster heavy with former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old shortstop Billy Martin. <b>Stengel</b> was impressed by Martin's fielding, baseball acuity, and, when there were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the Seattle Rainiers to win the Governors' Cup. The Sporting News named <b>Stengel</b> the Minor League Manager of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The World Series {{that year}} was again against the Dodgers, {{who won the}} first two games at Ebbets Field. <b>Stengel</b> lectured the team before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium and the team responded with a victory then and in Game 4. For Game 5, <b>Stengel</b> pitched Don Larsen, who had been knocked out of Game 2, and who responded with a perfect game, the only one in major league postseason history. The Dodgers won Game 6 as the Series {{returned}} to Ebbets Field. Many expected Whitey Ford to start Game 7, but <b>Stengel</b> chose Johnny Kucks, an 18-game winner that season who had been used twice in relief in the Series. Kucks threw a three-hit shutout as the Yankees won the championship, 9–0, Stengel's sixth as their manager.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{started the}} defense of their title in 1954 with an opening day loss to the Washington Senators in the {{presence}} of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Even though the Yankees won 103 games, the most regular season victories they would have under <b>Stengel,</b> they lost by 8 games to the Indians, managed by Stengel's old friend Al Lopez. In spite of the defeat, <b>Stengel</b> was given a new two-year contract at $75,000 per year.|$|E
50|$|Speckbacher and 2,000 irregulars {{attacked}} the Bavarian garrisons {{in the villages}} of Lofer, Luftenstein, Unken, and Mellek on 25 September. Of the 700 soldiers belonging to the Leib Infantry Regiment # 1, 50 were killed and wounded, 300 captured, and 100 missing. The troops were dispersed with only two companies in each village. The detachment in Mellek broke out and retreated north to Bad Reichenhall; the other garrisons were wiped out. On the same day Haspinger with 2,400 Tyrolese and four guns evicted General-Major <b>Stengel's</b> brigade from the Lueg Pass near Golling an der Salzach. The 3,500 Bavarians and three cannons retreated north to Salzburg. Lefebvre, with 2,000 of <b>Stengel's</b> troops attacked Hallein on 3 October. Haspinger's force, which had lingered in the town, was chased back into the mountains, leaving their six cannons behind.|$|R
5000|$|This {{would prove}} to be Casey <b>Stengel's</b> last World Series, as the Yankee club soon sent him into retirement. This led to his famous remark, [...] "I'll never make the mistake of turning 70 again." [...] Mazeroski and Clemente were the last two {{remaining}} Pirate players from the 1960 World Series winners along with manager Danny Murtaugh, when the Pirates won the World Series in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Hemus then {{served as}} a coach with the New York Mets (1962-63) and Cleveland Indians (1964-65). He was on manager Casey <b>Stengel's</b> {{coaching}} staff when the 1962 Mets expansion team {{ended up with a}} record of 40-120, still the most losses by a Major League team in a single season since the nineteenth century. He managed the Mets' top farm club, the Jacksonville Suns of the AAA International League, in 1966 before leaving baseball and entering the oil business in his adopted home city of Houston, Texas.|$|R
5|$|Several other {{managers}} spent long tenures {{with the}} Yankees. Joe McCarthy managed the Yankees from 1931 until {{midway through the}} 1946 season. During his tenure, the Yankees won eight American League titles and won the World Series seven times. He won 1,460 regular season games with the Yankees and lost 867, both {{more than any other}} Yankee manager. Casey <b>Stengel</b> managed the team from 1949 until 1960, winning 10 American League championships, 7 World Series titles, and 1,149 games, which ranks third among Yankee managers. After <b>Stengel</b> was discharged, Ralph Houk managed the Yankees from 1961 through 1963, winning American League titles each season, and winning the World Series twice. He served a second term as Yankee manager from 1966 through 1973.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stengel</b> was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. <b>Stengel</b> faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in {{the top half of the}} standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E
5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before <b>Stengel</b> had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, <b>Stengel</b> brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and <b>Stengel</b> had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E
50|$|Grimes was {{the manager}} of the Dodgers in 1937-38. He {{followed}} Casey <b>Stengel's</b> term as Dodgers manager. He compiled a two-year record of 131-171 (.434), with his teams finishing sixth and seventh respectively in the National League. Babe Ruth was one of Grimes's coaches. Leo Durocher was the team's shortstop in 1937 and a coach in 1938. When Grimes was fired by general manager Larry MacPhail after the 1938 season, Durocher was hired to replace him. MacPhail said that the team's morale had not been right {{for a long period of}} time.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] Coates went 13-3 as a spot {{starter in}} Casey <b>Stengel's</b> much-maligned rotation. After winning his last five {{decisions}} in 1959 {{and his first}} nine this season, Coates finally had his winning streak broken against the Boston Red Sox on July 9, a 6-5 loss in which Vic Wertz drove {{in four of the}} runs. Coates was also named to the All Star team, pitching two scoreless innings in the first of two games played that year (between 1959 and 1962, Major League Baseball had two All-Star games).|$|R
5000|$|Kaasstengels (...) , Kastengel or kue keju is Dutch-Indonesian cheese cookie in {{the form}} of stick, {{commonly}} found in the Netherlands and Indonesia. The name describe its ingredients, shape and origin; kaas is Dutch word for [...] "cheese", while <b>stengels</b> is also Dutch word for [...] "sticks". Unlike most cookies, kaasstengels taste savoury and salty instead of sweet. In Indonesia, owed to its colonial links to the Netherlands, kaasstengels, together with nastar and kue putri salju are the popular kue kering (dried kue or cookie) during festive occasion, such as Natal (Christmas) and Lebaran (Eid al Fitr).|$|R
5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} 79–75 in 1959, {{in third}} place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of <b>Stengel,</b> who {{was viewed as}} too old and {{out of touch with}} the players.|$|E
5|$|The franchise's first {{manager was}} Hall of Famer Harry Wright, who managed {{the team for}} eleven seasons. Frank Selee was the next manager to have managed the team for eleven seasons, {{with a total of}} twelve with the {{formerly}} named Boston Beaneaters. The formerly named Boston Braves made their first postseason appearance under George Stallings in 1914, winning the World Series that year. Several other managers spent long tenures with the Braves. Bill McKechnie managed the Braves from 1930 to 1937, while Casey <b>Stengel</b> managed the team from 1938 to 1942. The franchise was known as the Boston Bees from 1936 to 1940, and was again named the Boston Braves until 1952. <b>Stengel</b> also managed the Braves in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Bolliger & Mabillard {{currently}} manufactures {{nine different}} roller coaster styles: Stand-Up Coaster, Inverted Coaster, Floorless Coaster, Flying Coaster, Hyper Coaster, Dive Coaster, Sitting Coaster, Wing Coaster and Family Coaster.

It has often worked with engineer Werner <b>Stengel,</b> and with designers and management of client theme parks.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>Stengel's</b> success, {{other teams}} began {{implementing}} their own platoons. In the late 1970s through early 1980s, Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver successfully employed a platoon in left field, using John Lowenstein, Benny Ayala, and Gary Roenicke, using whichever player was performing {{the best at}} the time. Weaver also considered other factors, including the opposing pitcher's velocity, and his batters' ability in hitting a fastball. The Orioles continued to platoon at catcher and all three outfield positions in 1983 under Joe Altobelli, as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series, leading other teams to pursue the strategy.|$|R
5000|$|The Yankees, {{winners of}} their 10th pennant in 12 years, outscored the Pirates 55-27 in this Series, outhit them 91-60, outbatted them [...]338 to [...]256, hit 10 home runs to Pittsburgh's four (three of which came in Game 7), got two complete-game shutouts from Whitey Ford—and lost. The Pirates' {{inconsistent}} pitching and <b>Stengel's</b> controversial {{decision not to}} start Ford in Games 1 and 4 resulted in the peculiar combination of close games and routs. Ford (Games 3 and 6) and Vern Law (Games 1 and 4) were both excellent, while Pirates relief pitcher Roy Face was {{a major factor in}} three games.|$|R
5000|$|... "Casey's Revenge", by Grantland Rice (1907), gives Casey {{another chance}} against the pitcher who had struck {{him out in}} the {{original}} story. It was written in 1906, and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine The Speaker in June 1907, under the pseudonym of James Wilson. In this version, Rice cites the nickname [...] "Strike-Out Casey", hence the influence on Casey <b>Stengel's</b> name. Casey's team is down three runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes—with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.|$|R
