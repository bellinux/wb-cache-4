It is shown that <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> neither reinforce nor substitute for traditional regulatory approaches. Far from encouraging more <b>sustainable</b> forest management, <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> such as an inappropriate tax policy can actually undermine it. The paper uses the arguments {{at the root of}} the Faustmann solution to draw conclusions on the incentives for sustainable tropical forest exploitation.

The recent Greek debt crisis provides {{a unique opportunity to}} test whether sustainability tests produce what they ought to produce: We know that the Greek debt is unsustainable, so do the sustainability tests show the same? We use several common approaches such as Johansen approach, DOLS, Engle-Granger approach, Bohn test and finally Trehan-Walsh approach. Our results are mixed and in contrast with our expectations, because the majority of the tests indicate <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy in both tested periods. One reason for the non-performance of the sustainability tests may be that they do not include information provided by rating agencies (which may not always be rational). Another important limitation of the present value budget constraint is the assumption of infinite growth of the economy.

40|$|Extending Gali and Monacelli (2004), {{we build}} an N-country open economy model, where each economy {{is subject to}} sticky wages and prices and, potentially, has access to sales and income taxes as well as {{government}} spending as <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> We examine an economy either as a small open economy operating under flexible exchange rates or {{as a member of}} a monetary union. In a small open economy when all three <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> are freely available, we show analytically that the welfare impact of technology and mark-up shocks can be completely eliminated (in the sense that policy can replicate the efficient flex price equilibrium), whether policy acts with discretion or commitment. However, once any one of these <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> is excluded as a stabilisation tool, costs can emerge. Using simulations, we find that the useful <b>fiscal</b> <b>instrument</b> in this case (in the sense of reducing the welfare costs of the shock) is either income taxes or sales taxes. In constrast, having government spending as an instrument contributes very little. The results for an individual member of a monetary union facing an idiosyncratic technology shock (where monetary policy in the union does not respond) are very different. First, even with all <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> freely available, the technology shock will incur welfare costs. Government spending is potentially useful as a stabilisation device, because it can act as a partial substitute for monetary policy. Finally, sales taxes are more effective than income taxes at reducing the costs of a technology shock under monetary union. If all three taxes are available, they can reduce the impact of the technology shock on the union member by around a half, compared to the case where fiscal policy is not used. Finally we consider the robustness of these results to two extensions. Firstly, introducing government debt, such that policy makers take account of the debt consequences of using <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> as stabilisation devices, and, secondly, introducing implementation lags in the use of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> We find that the need for debt sustainability has a very limited impact on the use of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> for stabilisation purposes, while implementation lags can reduce, but not eliminate, the gains from fiscal stabilisation. ...|$|R

Abstract: Extending Gali and Monacelli (2004), {{we build}} an N-country open economy model, where each economy {{is subject to}} sticky wages and prices and, potentially, has access to sales and income taxes as well as government spending as <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> to deal with technology shocks once the monetary policy instrument as been given up as part of monetary union. We find that, with empirically plausible degrees of price and wage-stickiness, joining a monetary union imposes significant welfare costs on an economy’s inhabitants when that economy is subject to technology shocks. These costs could be reduced by up to half by utilising <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments,</b> with government spending being particularly effective in responding to idiosyncratic shocks due to its assumed home bias in the purchase of goods. However, even employing all three <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> could not reduce the costs of these shocks to the levels found when the economy stayed out of monetary union and retained use of a monetary policy (and therefore exchange rate) instrument. We also found that implementation lags could significantly affect the ability of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> to deal with shocks, but that the need to ensure fiscal solvency when utilising tax and spending instruments had negligible welfare consequences.

40|$|A countercyclical {{fiscal policy}} {{combined}} with <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> finances {{is considered to}} be one of the most important objectives in modern economic policy. However, procyclical fiscal policy is widely observed in practice, especially in emerging market countries. The main purposes of this thesis are to examine the determinants of fiscal procyclicality and sustainability with special reference to the role of fiscal rules, and to assess the impact of both fiscal procyclicality and sustainability on economic growth. This thesis deals with several new issues on fiscal procyclicality and sustainability which have been ignored in the existing literature. We explore the role of the time coverage of fiscal rules in determining fiscal procyclicality and assess the effect of fiscal procyclicality on economic growth across spending categories and country groups. We also attempt to answer the determinants of fiscal sustainability and the effect of fiscal sustainability on economic growth for the first time. Our empirical analyses yield a number of novel and interesting findings. First, we find that government consumption and investment appear to be procyclical while current transfers appear to be countercyclical in a large number of OECD countries. Second, we find that most OECD countries seem to maintain <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> finances and several factors such as the growth rate, the level of development, and aging populations could play a role in determining fiscal sustainability. Third, we find that procyclical current expenditure, especially government consumption and current transfers, could have a negative effect on economic growth, and this negative effect is prominent in emerging market countries. We also find that fiscal sustainability does not seem to play any role in economic growth in tranquil times. Finally, we find that the introduction of fiscal rules not only help achieve both countercyclical and <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy, but also boost economic growth indirectly by stimulating countercyclical fiscal policy. Multi-year fiscal rules contribute more toward mitigating the level of fiscal procyclicality than annual fiscal rules, and fiscal rules with enforceability, such as the Stability and Growth Pact rules, appear to help maintain <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> finances. ...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{the most}} pernicious {{economic}} institutions and policies create entry barriers or manipulate factor prices to transfer resources from entrepreneurs and workers to groups that hold political power. These inefficiencies partly result {{from the fact that}} direct and efficient <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> {{that can be used for}} taxation and redistribution of resources are absent. One might then conclude that increasing state capacity and expanding the set of available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> should improve the allocation of resources by preventing the use of these inefficient, indirect methods of redistribution. This reasoning ignores the effect of greater state capacity and the change in the set of available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> on the political equilibrium, however. Because the availability of more efficient means of taxation increases the potential benefits of controlling state power, it also intensifies costly political conflict aimed at capturing the control of the state. This indirect effect counteracts the benefits from more efficient taxation and may dominate the direct benefits. The paper establishes the possibility that the allocation of resources may deteriorate substantially in response to an autonomous increase in state capacity and the set of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> It also argues that in the British case, which is a key historical example that points to the central role of increased state capacity in economic development, this change was not autonomous; instead, it was an equilibrium response to changes in political institutions that placed better checks on the exercise of power by the executive. This reasoning suggests that the study of the effect of fiscal capacity and the evaluation of policies aimed at increasing state capacity in less-developed economies should be done in the context of dynamic models of political economy, in which fiscal capacity and political constraints are jointly determined. ...|$|R
