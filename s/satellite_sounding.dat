Topics discussed included: comparisons of assimilations of satellite retrievals versus satellite-observed radiances, planning {{for the use of}} advanced infrared sounders, the use of <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data affected by land surfaces, radiative transfer issues, and error characteristics of models and observations. The workshop concluded with a number of general and specific recommendations to advance {{the state of the art}} of assimilation of <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data...|$|E

40|$|The {{combined}} use of radiosonde and <b>satellite</b> infrared <b>soundings</b> {{can provide}} mesoscale temperature and moisture fields {{at the time}} of satellite coverage. Radiance data from the vertical temperature profile radiometer on NOAA polar-orbiting satellites can be used along with a radiosonde sounding as an initial guess in an iterative retrieval algorithm. The mesoscale temperature and moisture fields at local 9 - 10 a. m., which are produced by retrieving temperature profiles at each scan spot for the BTPR (every 70 km), can be used for analysis or as a forecasting tool for subsequent weather events during the day. The advantage of better horizontal resolution of <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> can be coupled with the radiosonde temperature and moisture profile both as a best initial guess profile and as a means of eliminating problems due to the limited vertical resolution of <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Investigations in FY- 85 were {{centered}} on three case study days in 1982. Two of these, March 6 and April 24, were Atmospheric Variability Experiment/Verical Atmospheric Sounder (AVE/VAS) days for which high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution RAOB and Vertical Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) data sets were available. The third investigation day, April 26, was a day of interesting severe weather. In {{the last part of}} FY- 84 and early FY- 85 we were able to demonstrate most importantly the complimentary nature of <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> and winds in a forecast/analysis system. In our variational analysis scheme, cloud drift and water vapor winds enter into the height field as gradient information. The cloud drift winds especially, have the character of supplying information in cloudy areas where <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> are not possible. In the April 26 experiments, analyses and forecasts using the combination <b>satellite</b> winds and <b>soundings</b> were superior to those using only soundings. Good consistency was shown between independent satellite forecasts from different initialization times run to the same verification time. A significant accomplishment in FY- 85 was expanding experiments on April 26 to include quasi-continuous initialization inserting <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> and winds from several different times into an analysis/forecast. Contrary to the first set of experiments on April 26, here forecast initialization fields were not independent, but contained satellite information from two data times...|$|R

40|$|The {{capabilities}} of the Nimbus 6 <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data for use in synoptic analysis were considered and interpreted. An evaluation of {{the ability of the}} <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data to detect and depict structural features of the atmosphere was {{made on the basis of}} vertical profiles of average difference and standard deviation of differences between satellite and rawinsonde data at nine pressure levels from 850 to 100 mb; and constant pressure charts and cross sections of satellite, rawinsonde and difference values. Results indicate that satellite measurements of temperature as well as the vertical lapse rate and horizontal gradient of temperature are accurate enough to show large scale patterns but not to precisely define fronts or tropopauses; satellite measurements of dew point temperature are smoothed enough to severely reduce contrasts between air masses across fronts; the magnitude of the standard deviation of differences between rawinsonde and satellite data for most variables increases with the synoptic activity in the region; and the most reliable variables to examine from satellite data for depiction of synoptic features are the temperature equivalent potential temperature and mixing ratio...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} is derived for retrieving atmospheric temperature profiles from satellite-measured spectral radiance that appears, in first tests, to effectively circumvent certain difficulties of other well-known and implemented techniques. This method provides an effective manner to avoid numerical instability {{without having to}} force the algorithm toward adherence to a priori statistics not dependent on the radiance measurements. This provides the opportunity to obtain more information from <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> instruments, without encountering instabilities owing to overlapping weighting functions...|$|E
40|$|An early January 1980 {{synoptic}} situation {{was used in}} evaluating the performance of TIROS-N and NOAA- 6 operational temperature soundings. Visual and statistical comparisons of temperature and thickness fields were employed {{to determine the effects}} of manual screening of the <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> and measure the accuracy of both the <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> and analyses derived from them. Comparisons between the performance of TIROS-N and NOAA- 6 were emphasized. Both satellites were able to correctly position the major troughs and ridges. Gradients were underestimated though, with troughs markedly too warm and ridges slightly too cold. The poorest data occurred near the surface and tropopause as reflected by larger standard deviations in those layers. The performance of TIROS-N was slightly superior to that of NOAA- 6...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the FGGE satellite observing system, the following two data sets were compared by examining the available potential energy (APE) and extratropical cyclone activity within the entire global domain during the first Special Observing Period: (1) the complete FGGE IIIb set, which incorporates <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings,</b> and (2) a NOSAT set which incorporates only conventional data. The time series of the daily total APEs indicate that NOSAT values are larger than the FGGE values, although in the Northern Hemisphere the differences are negligible. Analyses of cyclone scale features revealed only minor differences between the Northern Hemisphere FGGE and NOSAT analyses. On the other hand, substantial differences were revealed in the two Southern Hemisphere analyses, where the <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> apparently add detail to the FGGE set...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{formulate}} consistent objective definitions {{of the concept of}} 'effective data density' applicable both in the context of <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> and more generally in objective data analysis. The definitions based upon various forms of Backus-Gilbert 'spread' functions are found to be seriously misleading in <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> where the model resolution function (expressing the sensitivity of retrieval or analysis to changes in the background error) features sidelobes. Instead, estimates derived by smoothing the trace components of the model resolution function are proposed. The new estimates are found to be more reliable and informative in simulated satellite retrieval problems and, for the special case of uniformly spaced perfect observations, agree exactly with their actual density. The new estimates integrate to the 'degrees of freedom for signal', a diagnostic that is invariant to changes of units or coordinates used...|$|R
40|$|Infrared ultra-spectral spectrometers {{have brought}} {{in a new era}} in {{satellite}} remote atmospheric sounding capability. During the 1970 s, after the implementation of the first <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> instruments, it became evident that much higher vertical resolution sounding information was needed to be able to forecast life and property threatening localized severe weather. The demonstration of the ultra-spectral radiance measurement technology required to achieve higher vertical resolution began in 1985, with the aircraft flights of the High resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS) instrument. The development of satellite instruments designed to have a HIS-like measurement capability was initiated in the late 1980 's. Today, {{after more than a decade}} of development time, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) are now operating successfully from the Aqua and MetOp polar orbiting satellites. The successful development and ground demonstration of the Geostationary Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS), during this decade, is now paving the way toward the implementation of the ultra-spectral sounding capability on the international system of geostationary environmental satellites. This note reviews the evolution of the satellite ultra-spectral sounding systems, shows examples of current polar <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> capability, and discusses future advances planned for geostationary orbit...|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} evaluation {{is used to}} compared vertical profiles of temperature and moisture derived from VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) with three different algorithms to that of corresponding rawinsonde measurements for a clear cold environment. To account for time and space discrepancies between the data sets, rawinsonde data were adjusted to {{be representative of the}} <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> times. Both rawinsonde and <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data were objectively analyzed onto a mesoscale grid. These grid point values were compared at 50 mb pressure increments from the surface up to 100 mb. The data were analyzed for horizontal and vertical structure, representatives of derived parameters, and significant departure (improvement) from the apriori (first guess) information. Results indicate some rather strong temperature and moisture biases exist in the satellite soundings. Temperature biases of 1 to 4 C and dewpoint biases of 2 to 6 C generally occur in layers where strong inversions are present and vary with time as these atmospheric features evolve. The biases also changes as a function retrieval scheme suggesting limitations and restrictions on the applications of the various techniques. Standard temperature deviations range from 1 to 2 C for each retrieval scheme with maximum values around 800 and 400 mb. Derived parameters (precipitable water and thickness) suffer from similar biases, though to a somewhat lesser extent. Gradients of basic and derived parameters are generally weaker but have good horizontal structure where magnitudes of the parameters are relatively strong. Integrated thermal (temperature) and moisture (precipitable water) parameters show mixed results...|$|E

The prognostic differences that resulted in diverging cyclone paths between the forecast that included satellite temperature soundings (SAT) and the forecast that excluded <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data (NOSAT) have been traced to initial state differences in the upper level wind and temperature patterns. These modifications enhanced the variation of thermal vorticity and thermal advection across the cyclone center and in the SAT case, gave a greater initial rate of movement of the upper-level vorticity maximum associated with the surface cyclone...|$|E

40|$|In {{the upper}} stratosphere, the {{atmosphere}} exhibits significant diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal variations, with typical amplitude of about 2 K in mid-latitudes. In this paper we examine {{how well the}} tidal variations in temperature are represented by the Goddard Geodesic Earth Orbiting Satellite (GEOS- 2) data assimilation system. We show that the GEOS- 2 atmospheric model is quite successful at simulating the tidal temperature variations. However, the assimilation of <b>satellite</b> temperature <b>soundings</b> significantly damps the simulated tides. The reason is because the tides are not well represented by the satellite retrievals used by the assimilation system (which have a typical tidal amplitude of around 1 K). As {{a result of this}} study, we suggest improvements that should be made to the treatment of <b>satellite</b> <b>soundings</b> by the assimilation system...|$|R

This presentation will review the capabilities of IASI to contribute to several aspects of atmospheric chemistry, such as the identification of local and regional sources to improve emission inventories, the tracking of long-range transport of pollution, and the detection of unexpected events such as large fires or volcanic plumes. Illustrations will be provided for carbon monoxide, methanol, ammonia, and ash/sulfur dioxide from volcanoes.

Background information on the simulation experiment is presented, including discussion of the variational approach utilized, the numerical model, updating procedures, and control run.

40|$|In January of 1978, a {{panel of}} experts {{recommended}} that a 'special effort' be made to enhance and edit satellite soundings and cloud tracked winds in data sparse regions. It was felt that these activities would be necessary to obtain maximum benefits from an evaluation of satellite data during the Global Weather Experiment (FGGE). The 'special effort' is being conducted for the two special observing periods of FGGE. More than sixty cases have been selected for enhancement on the basis of meteorological interest. These cases include situations of blocking, cutoff low development, cyclogenesis, and tropical circulations.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the signatures of atmospheric pressure adjustment mechanism for surface wind convergence/divergence over major sea surface temperature (SST) frontal regions using global observations of <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> and scatterometer. Lower tropospheric air thickness, {{which includes a}} sea-level pressure component modified by air temperature in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, is analyzed, and {{the relation between the}} Laplacian of the thickness and wind convergence are examined. Among four SST frontal regions in mid-latitudes, correlation between the thickness Laplacian and wind convergence is the largest over the Gulf Stream followed by those for the Agulhas Return Current and for the Brazil/Malvinas Current, and relatively small but still significant over the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension. These correlations strongly suggest that the pressure adjustment mechanism ubiquitously {{plays an important role in}} air-sea interaction over the global SST frontal regions. Furthermore, air temperatures in the first two regions exhibit SST-relating signatures even in the mid-troposphere...|$|E

If this can be done in a meaningful way, satellite data could be integrated into existing data and interpretation would be enhanced. In this attempt, both rawinsonde and satellite soundings will be decomposed by the use of the Fourier cosine series. Then, each harmonic will be compared to get a better understanding of the representativeness of the <b>satellite</b> <b>sounding</b> data. Harmonics taken from satellite and rawinsonde soundings will be combined to provide a unified data set that can be used both over data sparse ocean areas as well as over land where rawinsonde data are available...|$|E
