5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper <b>storage</b> <b>disease.</b> Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> type IV.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E

25|$|GM1 <b>Storage</b> <b>Disease,</b> one of {{a family}} of {{conditions}} called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that is inevitably fatal. It is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells. Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 <b>Storage</b> <b>Disease</b> carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed. All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age. The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, paresis, and seizures. The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament. Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur. GM-1 <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> is a recessive deficiency of betagalactosidase. The condition has been genetically identified and is no longer common.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen other syndromes may exhibit signs {{similar to}} Usher syndrome, {{including}} Alport syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Flynn-Aird syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Hurler syndrome (MPS-1), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (CPEO), Norrie syndrome, osteopetrosis (Albers-Schonberg disease), Refsum's disease (phytanic acid <b>storage</b> <b>disease),</b> and Zellweger syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome).|$|E
30|$|Metabolic and <b>storage</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{a diverse}} group of {{conditions}} that are characterised by underlying biochemical or metabolic dysfunctions.

25|$|Benign {{myoclonus}} {{can occur}} in healthy individuals and is most commonly caused by nothing other than arbitrary muscle contractions. Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid <b>storage</b> <b>disease,</b> chemical or drug poisoning, as {{a side effect of}} certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, gabapentin, sertraline, lamotrigine), or other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Another {{lysosomal}} <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> often {{confused with}} the mucopolysaccharidoses is mucolipidosis.

25|$|Sulfatide {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group. However, in order for this reaction to be carried out, a sphingolipid activator protein such as saposin B must be present. Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A can then hydrolyze the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.|$|E
25|$|In rare cases, a {{mutation}} {{in the genes}} controlling the production of lactate dehydrogenase {{will lead to a}} medical condition known as lactate dehydrogenase deficiency. Depending on which gene carries the mutation, one of two types will occur: either lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency (also known as glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>disease</b> XI) or lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency. Both of these conditions affect how the body breaks down sugars, primarily in certain muscle cells. Lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency is caused by a mutation to the LDHA gene, while lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency is caused by a mutation to the LDHB gene.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{a genetic}} linkage test became {{available}} which appears promising. This {{is not a}} test which confirms if a dog has, or {{does not have the}} disease; nor will it definitively predict the disease, as even if a dog is a JDC carrier this does not guarantee its offspring will suffer the disease. It only links certain strains of DNA as carriers of JDC. This is significant in that these strains can now largely be deselected for in the breeding process, as has been successful with GM1 <b>Storage</b> <b>Disease</b> (see above). The test is not yet complete for every bloodline, and why the identified strains are implicated is still unknown, and so in essence the cause of the condition remains a mystery to be solved.|$|E

500|$|They {{continued}} their collaboration at Washington University. While working with minced frog muscle, they discovered an intermediate compound that enabled {{the breakdown of}} glycogen, called glucose 1-phosphate, {{now known as the}} Cori ester. They established the compound's structure, identified the enzyme phosphorylase that catalyzed its chemical formation, and showed that the Cori ester is the beginning step in the conversion of the carbohydrate glycogen into glucose (large amounts of which are found in the liver). It can also be the last step in the conversion of blood glucose to glycogen, as it is a reversible step. Gerty Cori also studied glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>disease,</b> identifying at least four forms, each related to a particular enzymatic defect.

40|$|Glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>diseases</b> are a {{group of}} inborn error of {{metabolism}} and characterized by accumulation of glycogen in various tissues. The overall incidence of glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>diseases</b> is estimated 1 per 20, 000 - 43, 000 live births. There are twelve distinct diseases that are commonly considered to be glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>diseases</b> and classified based on enzyme deficiency and affected tissue. We searched all review articles and books in the national and international databases which considered as inherited metabolic disorders and the genetic associations of these disorders. A large number of enzymes intervene in the synthesis and degradation of glycogen which is regulated by hormones. Several hormones, including insulin, glucagon and cortisol regulate the relationship between glycolysis, glycogenosis, and glycogen synthesis. These diseases are divided into three major groups: disorders that affected liver, disorders that affected muscle and those which are generalized. Glycogen <b>storage</b> <b>diseases</b> are called by a Roman numerical that reflects the historical sequence of their discovery by an enzyme defect or by the author's name of the first description...|$|R
