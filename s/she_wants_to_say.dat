5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion.

When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Planet of the Apes premiered in February 1968. The {{film was}} a hit upon its release, {{as well as a}} {{critical}} and commercial success. In the opening credits, Harrison was billed under the tag [...] "introducing Linda Harrison"; although she had appeared in three previous films. Zanuck wanted to draw attention to Harrison because he felt the role would catapult her to stardom. Harrison impressed audiences with her hourglass figure, long dark hair, and large brown eyes, which, in the absence of spoken dialogue, did most of her acting, though some critics were unimpressed. Renata Adler of the New York Times dismissed Harrison as “Heston's Neanderthal flower girl. She wiggles her hips when <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something." [...] The success of Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, an animated cartoon series, a live-action TV series, a [...] "reboot" [...] by Tim Burton, and three prequels to the original film. Heston and Harrison appeared in the first sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Three decades later, Harrison had a brief cameo in the 2001 reboot, which also featured Heston.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not you," [...] Kendricks declared. [...] "I {{assure you}} that I am a critic in such matters. She looks when {{the young man who}} is with her is engaged upon his dinner, or {{speaking}} to the waiter. I am not positive, even, that she wants to flirt, Julien. I think <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Feel that tinglin'?" [...] asked. Whitwell, and Jackson made yes with silent lips.

60|$|Dorothy was thoughtful. The Rigmaroles {{had made}} a strong {{impression}} upon her. She decided that whenever she spoke, after this, she would use only enough words <b>to</b> express what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There was silence. Dorothea's {{heart was}} full of {{something}} that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and yet the words were too difficult. She was wholly possessed by them: at that moment debate was mute within her. And {{it was very hard}} that she could not <b>say</b> what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Will was looking out of the window angrily. If he would have looked at her and not gone away from her side, she thought everything would have been easier. At last he turned, still resting against the chair, and stretching his hand automatically towards his hat, said with a sort of exasperation, [...] "Good-by." ...|$|R

50|$|The song is a ballad, with Guinot musing on life's character. She sings {{that it is}} {{sometimes}} only the silence which enables her to establish what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and likewise it {{is sometimes}} only in a crowd that she finds where she wants to go.|$|E
5000|$|Ai Kunogi (...) : In-between {{animator}} at Musashino Animation. She {{is later}} promoted to key animator for The Third Aerial Girls Squad. She is extremely nervous and shy, almost never completing a full word.

6000|$|... "You are {{attached}} to that house?" [...] quoth she, in accents of mistrust. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more. I saw it in her eyes that she was wondering was there treachery underlying an action so singularly disinterested as to justify suspicion.|$|R
60|$|But she {{perceived}} {{as she lay}} awake next morning that she wasn't free for experiments any longer. What she might say or do now would be taken up very conclusively. And {{she had no idea}} what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or do.|$|R
60|$|Still {{she did not}} speak. There were {{a hundred}} things <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> but <b>she</b> could not say them. Did he mean that he loved her still? If she were sure of that, she could forgive him anything, but her doubt {{rendered}} her mute.|$|R

Frustrated and embarrassed, she leaves him there and goes back home. She decides to send a postcard—or five—to her favorite radio programs...|$|E

Although she likes her owner she cannot express her feelings well, which ends up telling opposite of what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She likes watching baseball matches, even on midnight telecasts, though she has stated she has no clue on how the game is played. She basically hates Aluminum Akikans and is always having small quarrels with Yell. She mostly uses carbon dioxide based cool drink sorcery in battle.|$|E
5000|$|APRA Magazine said; “This is {{a journey}} through {{creativity}} where Kate lets go of everything and says exactly what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Witness the intimacy and beauty that is Kate Ceberano together with the ever-musical Dallas Cosmas.The beautiful coincidence that has brought the lush vocals of Kate Ceberano and emotive production of Dallas Cosmas together {{has resulted in the}} cinematic-pop that is ‘Dallas et Kate’.

6000|$|Sylvie gently {{explained}} matters. [...] "I'm {{afraid we}} ca'n't manage it," [...] {{she said in}} a low voice.

60|$|Charlotte {{looked at}} Paula uneasily when the latter joined {{her in the}} drawing-room. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'What is the matter?' but {{guessing}} that her brother {{had something to do}} with it, forbore to speak at first. She could not contain her anxiety long. 'Were you talking with my brother?' she said.|$|R

The scent of her fragment comes from a large fan on her left arm. She writes what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on a notepad. After Kurumi was killed, Kuchinashi used her most powerful fragrance 'Lilith Temptation', which makes people see their greatest desire. But it failed on Blade because he already had his desire, to be {{in a room full of}} cute girls.|$|E

Irritated and promising nothing, Ray agrees.|$|E
5000|$|Café of the Inner Mind: Simmons later {{took a more}} {{critical}} look at the dummies, photographing them in environments and using collage to interject their thoughts or visualizations. Much like the ventriloquists she had seen as a child, Simmons gave the dummies a dialogue based on her own projections. According to Simmons, [...] "the dummy is such a metaphor for lying and telling the truth. The way the ventriloquist is able to say whatever he or <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> through this other character. You don’t {{have to take responsibility}} for anything that you’re saying because the dummy said it or the dummy did it. It made me think about a lot of things, from news-casting to public speakers to politicians to friends." ...|$|E
