Java's popularity can be attributed to both its superficial similarity to C++, and, perhaps more importantly, the massive proliferation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to which Java is most often compiled. The Java language is not, however, a significant improvement over other conventional languages like C and C++; Standard ML (SML) incorporates many advanced features not offered by Java (such as parametric polymorphism, an advanced module system, type inference, and algebraic datatypes), and therefore offers a potentially more attractive model for Internet programming. This document describes a compiler which dispenses with the Java language, and instead compiles SML to the Java Virtual Machine. Both the wide availability of the JVM, and the many powerful features of SML, are thereby exploited. Compilation from <b>SML</b> <b>t</b> [...] ...|$|E
