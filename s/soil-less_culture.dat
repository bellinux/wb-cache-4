5000|$|Damage {{caused by}} Pythium aphanidermatum is {{difficult}} to measure because it has such a wide host range and infection results {{in a variety of}} symptoms, all of which are detrimental in different ways. Damage is important and most prevalent in warm and humid regions were soils are particularly wet. Valley areas and river bottom fields are particularly susceptible to infection. [...] In general, the pathogen is especially important in crops such as corn, cotton, cereal crops, and high value horticultural crops. The pathogen is also economically important in crops that are produced both in greenhouses and by <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture.</b> Root infection and seedling damping off are responsible for a decrease in plant health and reduction in yield for economic crops.

In tomatoes, P. aphanidermatum causes significant losses in nurseries where young suspectible transplants are produced.|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of civilization, open field/soil-based {{agriculture}} is facing some major challenges; most importantly decrease in per capita land availability. In 1960 with 3 billion population over the World, per capita land was 0. 5 ha but presently, with 6 billion people it is only 0. 25 ha and by 2050, it will reach at 0. 16 ha. Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization as well as melting of icebergs (as an obvious impact of global warming), arable land under cultivation is further going to decrease. Again, soil fertility status has attained a saturation level, and productivity is not increasing further with increased level of fertilizer application. Besides, poor soil fertility {{in some of the}} cultivable areas, less chance of natural soil fertility build-up by microbes due to continuous cultivation, frequent drought conditions and unpredictability of climate and weather patterns, rise in temperature, river pollution, poor water management and wastage of huge amount of water, decline in ground water level, etc. are threatening food production under conventional soil-based agriculture. Under such circumstances, in near future it will become impossible to feed the entire population using open field system of agricultural production only. Naturally, <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> is becoming more relevant in the present scenario, to cope-up with these challenges. In <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture,</b> plants are raised without soil. Improved space and water conserving methods of food production under <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> have shown some promising results all over the World...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the environmental impacts of eight different tomato production systems in Austria, Spain and Italy based on a life cycle analysis (LCA) approach. The purpose was to identify the environmental impacts of tomatoes produced in different locations - Vienna and Burgenland in Austria, Almería in Spain and Puglia in Italy, which are sold in supermarkets in Vienna. Own research and data available in the computer model GEMIS were used to evaluate the CO 2 -emissions during cultivation and distribution of tomatoes. The ecological footprint for the functional unit (1 kg tomatoes at the point of sale) was also calculated. I analyzed tomato production under the following production systems: (1) <b>soil-less</b> <b>cultures</b> with active heating systems in modern greenhouses (Venlo-houses) in Vienna, (2) <b>soil-less</b> <b>cultures</b> with active heating systems in commonly used glasshouses in Vienna, (3) unheated conventional production systems in plastic greenhouses in Burgenland, (4) unheated organic tomatoes in plastic greenhouses in Burgenland; (5) conventional tomatoes from greenhouses in Almería and (6) canned tomatoes grown in open fields in Puglia. Two hypothetical systems to suggest possible future trends were outlined: (7) a heated plastic greenhouse in Burgenland and (8) a heated greenhouse in Almería. Heated greenhouse systems in Austria have a higher environmental impact than packaged open field tomatoes from Puglia as well as greenhouse-grown tomatoes from Almería even though the latter were transported by road over a distance of 2700 km. Organic and conventional tomatoes from plastic greenhouses in Burgenland without active heating systems have the lowest emissions. The results show that transport has less environmental impact than heating. Heating may account for up to 80...|$|R
50|$|Pythium aphanidermatum infects plants via motile zoospores, {{and because}} zoospores need {{to swim in}} order to infect the host, moist {{conditions}} facilitate the most rapid spread of the disease. Temperature also {{has an effect on}} the rate of pathogen propagation. The pathogen can cause disease in cool temperatures (55-64 °F) but ideal conditions are between 86 °F and 95 °F, a characteristic which distinguishes it from other Pythium species. Potential host plants that are stressed are more susceptible to infection. Factors that may cause stress in plants and therefore increase the likelihood of infection include high saline conditions, drought, nutrient deficiencies, and excessive moisture around the plant. High saline content in the soil can promote infection at lower temperature and humidity that is ideal for the pathogen. Excessive nitrogen fertilization will also increase the chance of infection because the nitrogen decreases the function of the plant’s innate defense response, and it also damages the ends of the roots, which are the primary mode of infection. Furthermore, the medium in which plants are grown dictates affects the severity of Pythium infection. Sterile <b>soil-less</b> <b>cultures</b> are the most susceptible, while increasing soil content inhibits disease progression due to bacteria present in the soil. Finally, seedlings and plants that are germinating have greater susceptibility to the pathogen, and often experience damping off.|$|R

Polyamines are involved in a wide range of metabolic processes in plants. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of polyamines on vegetative and reproductive growth and vase life of rose plants (Rosa hybrida cv. Dolcvita) in <b>soil-less</b> <b>cultures.</b> The experiments were carried out in a randomized completely design with ten treatments and four replications. Treatments included: Putrescine at the rates of 0, 1, 2 and 3 mM, Spermidine at the rates of 0, 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 mM, Spermine at the rates of 0, 1, 2 and 4 mM applied as foliar sprays on two months old of Rose plants cv Dolcvita. Data were analyzed using the MSTAT-C program by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by LSD Test at P = 0. 05. Results showed that the effects of foliar application of polyamines on the length of flower stalks, flower stalks fresh weight; vase life, flower buds diameter and flower buds length were significant. The highest and lowest flower stalks length were obtained in nutrient solutions containing 1. 5 mM spermidine and in control with 100. 66 and 71 cm respectively and the highest vase life was obtained in solutions containing 0. 5 mM spermidine and also in solutions containing 1 mM spermine. The data obtained in this study suggested that polyamines have significant effects on rose properties and quality. Abbreviations: PAs-Polyamines...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{expansion}} of <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> in the Netherlands in the mid-eighties of the previous century, emission of nutrients and plant protection products (PPP’s) used in the root environment was considered as a huge problem. Eventually, the government and growers organisations reached an agreement which aimed at reducing the N, P and PPP emissions. For <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture,</b> reuse of drain water or closed growing systems became obligatory. Recently, the regulation changed by shifting the focus on reaching emission targets for N rather reaching 100 % closure of the systems. Yet, recirculation is still the key issue for reaching the goal of zero emission by 2027. These closed systems will potentially lead to substantial reduction of mineral leaching to the environment, however, they require adequate water quality and nutrient management. Moreover, satisfactory disinfection to control root diseases and removal of organic components is needed. In practice, substantial loss of water and minerals still occurs occasionally, when growers decide to flush the system and drainage water is partially discharged to the surface water or sewage system, causing emission of nutrients and PPP’s. There are several reasons for growers to discharge e. g. accumulation of Na, mismanagement in EC or pH or nutrient supply, and serious problems with soil borne diseases or growth inhibition. This paper will give {{an overview of the}} state of the art of systems for nutrient solution recycling, and the requirements for water treatment, water quality and nutrient supply and strategies to obtain the highest efficiencies for nutrient and water use...|$|E

Researchers at the Scottish Agricultural College have {{developed}} a hydrogel, a water-retentive swelling gel, which makes it possible to grow crops and trees in arid areas where saline water is a problem. The hydrogel, based on polyethylene oxide, has been developed with the University of Strathclyde. It has three distinct uses: firstly, {{it can be used to}} coat seeds before planting in soils where saline water may be a problem. This coating allows moisture through but 'filters out' the salt which would destroy the seedling. The hydrogel can also catch and retain water from mist and fog that sweeps over deserts in the cool nights. A second use for the hydrogel is to mix it with soil when planting trees. If the hydrogel is saturated at planting, then moisture will be gradually released over a period of time. Eventually the hydrogel will degrade by which time the roots will be established. The hydrogel can be used also for growing vegetables in <b>soil-less</b> <b>cultures.</b> lt allows tomatoes and cucumbers to be grown with water as saline as 16.

40|$|The water {{status in}} plants is {{dependent}} on the xylem hydraulic conductance. In cut flowers, for example, the preservation of continuous hydraulic conductance is important for maintaining longer vase life, an important index for cut flower quality. Many factors, such as stomata performance, root water uptake efficiency, temperature, light quality and humidity, influence the efficiency of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.   It has also been shown that the dimensions of the xylem conduits in the plant, such as the conduit length, diameter and density, are important for plant water transport. Therefore, the regulation of the xylem conduit size during xylogenesis is necessary for providing a particular hydraulic efficiency in a given environment. To understand the regulation of xylogenesis and the influence of the processes to produce xylem conduits of particular dimensions with specific hydraulic capacity, this thesis focuses on the Zinnia elegans tracheary element (TE) differentiation at the cellular level. It further considers the regulation of xylem conduit dimensions in whole plants by using drought stress and temperature as variable environmental factors. In Chapter 1, the mechanisms of plant water transport, as regulated by xylem conduit dimensions with consequent effect on plant quality, are reviewed. Also, the chapter provides general literature on xylem formation, Zinnia elegans as model for xylogenic research, and finally gives the outline of the thesis. In Chapter 2, two cultivars of the Zinnia elegans cut flowers, 'Envy' and 'Purple Prince', were grown in soils with different water contents with increasing water stress levels: 70, 50 and 20 %(v/v) soil water content (SWC). Plant length increased with SWC. The hydraulic efficiency in the stems of cut flowers decreased with increasing water stress. The xylem conduit length was not different between Purple Prince cut flowers from the three different water stress levels. In the Envy cultivar, a significant difference in conduit length was found between plants from 20 and 50 % (v/v) SWCs. The proportion of large-diameter conduits increased with decreasing drought stress, i. e., in cut flowers from both cultivars the proportion of large-diameter vessels was highest in the 70 % (v/v) SWC and least in the 20 % (v/v) SWC. This means that the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with water stress was largely due to the decrease in the diameter of the conduits making the conduit length less important. The vase life of the cut flowers correlated negatively with the diameter of the xylem conduits, confirming that small-diameter conduits are more efficient in overcoming embolism and therefore maintaining efficient water transport in the stems. In Chapter 3, the role of average day temperature (ADT) and difference in day and night temperature (DIF) on the length of xylem elements and conduits, and fusion of the individual elements into conduits in planta were investigated. Plant length increased significantly with ADT between 17 and 25 o C. Opposite DIF treatments resulted in different plant length at 4 and 8 o C absolute DIF. The responses to temperature differences were similar in both Zinnia cultivars, although Purple Prince cultivar plants were always bigger. The maximal vessel length (L max) and half vessel lengths (τ) both increased with increasing ADT, about 110 - 130 % increase from 17 to 25 o C ADT. However, DIF had no effect on these conduit parameters. Measurements of average lengths of individual vessel elements from plants grown at average temperatures 17 and 25 o C showed about 10 % and 20 % increase in Envy and Purple Prince respectively. This change in vessel element length constitutes {{a small part of the}} overall change in whole conduit length, and therefore, it can be deduced that the amount of vessel element fusion is more important during formation of longer xylem conduits in the plant. In Chapter 4, a method for establishing an in vitroZinnia elegans cell culture for differentiation into tracheary elements (TEs) is described. The xylogenic Zinnia system is rather unique for studying xylogenesis at the cellular level. It offers possibilities to study in detail the effects of certain factors important for regulating the xylogenesis process. The in vitro culture has been well standardized to eliminate the inconsistencies in TE differentiation that have been observed in the past. Additional methods for monitoring and measuring the important hallmarks of TE differentiation, including DNA laddering, vacuolar rupture, cellulose bands and lignin synthesis, have been treated in this section. In Chapter 5, the effect of leaf osmolarity (LO) induced by different light intensities and electrical conductivity (EC) of <b>soil-less</b> plant <b>culture,</b> on the differentiation of TEs in cell cultures from the two cultivars, Envy and Purple Prince, was investigated. Both light intensity and EC correlated with LO with a similar response, although it was always higher in the Envy cultivar. By increasing the LO, the percentage of TEs (%TE) formed also increased, with a similar trend in cultures from both cultivars. About 60 % increase in %TE was realized in the Purple Prince cultivar as compared to earlier reports by different authors. The LO of the starting material also correlated positively with the final size of the TE. This implies that the efficiency of the xylogenic Zinnia system can be improved by adaptations in the growth conditions for the starting material. In Chapter 6, we investigated the effect of osmotic stress and timed application of NAA and BA (xylem differentiating phytohormones) on the TE differentiation in cultures from the two Zinnia cultivars. The %TE increased with increasing extracellular osmotic stress until 300 mOsm, after which any additional increase resulted in a diminishing %TE. The size of the TEs increased with decreasing extracellular osmolarity within the working range of 100 to 700 mOsm. These results were similar in the cultures from both cultivars. Application of NAA/BA induced a significant increase in the rate of cell division corresponding to a similar increase in TE differentiation. It is proposed that the increase in cell division may be beneficial in providing certain bioactive materials for the development of the TEs. Delayed application of NAA/BA reduced the %TE, but with a significant increase in TE size. In Chapter 7, the role of programmed cell death (PCD) in determining the final size of the TEs and the %TE was investigated. Application of two protease inhibitors, a general caspase inhibitor (Zasp) and a cysteine protease inhibitor (E 64), to xylogenic cultures from the two cultivars, caused a significant increase in the size of TEs but 65 - 300 % decrease in %TE. There proved to be a significant delay or complete inhibition of the hallmarks of PCD, such as DNA laddering and vacuole collapse, in the cultures treated with the inhibitors. It was also found that the second stream of TE differentiation, common in non-inhibited xylogenic Zinnia cultures, was absent in cultures treated with 10 nM or higher of each of the two inhibitors. The research experiments and their outcomes in this thesis range from fundamental xylogenesis at the cellular level to whole plant water transport performance. The overall discussion of the experimental approaches, results, and their practical implications is presented in Chapter 8. This chapter also offers suggestions for future research...|$|R

The values of transmembrane electric potential difference recorded (∼– 40 mV) are less negative than those previously reported from hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi closely associated with roots and from filamentous fungi. The external hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi grown in soil had similar values of electric potential difference to those grown in <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture,</b> and to germ tubes. Thermodynamic calculations showed that despite these low values of electric potential difference, efficient high-affinity uptake of phosphate is possible.

Not dissimilarly, a top priority for the UK tomato industry is the improvement of quality and flavour to enhance tomato as a functional food crop. A PRD trial was established in a commercial glasshouse adopting the standard industry practice of <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> with drip fertigation.

Typically the PRD treatment significantly decreased leaf conductance (up to 30 %), total sap flow (22 % at mid-day) and decreased leaf area (24 %), fresh weight (18 %) and dry weight (22 %). Individual fruit fresh weight and mean weekly yield through the season were not significantly affected by PRD, but PRD significantly increased both dry matter allocation (20 %) to the fruit and the degree Brix (16 %) compared to SSC treatment, with DSC treatment intermediate in response.

At present, FAO estimates that urban agriculture produces {{food for a}} quarter of world's population, reducing food transport, package and waste impact among others and improving food safety. Meanwhile, city governments and citizens are reinventing their roofs usage in order to take more advantage of them. Rooftop Greenhouses (RTGs) are an interesting option because they increase the scarce green area of the cities, create new agricultural spaces and promote food self-sufficiency in urban areas among other growing interests. RTGs are greenhouses located {{on the roof of the}} buildings that usually produce food using <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> systems. These structures as well as the green façades called Vertical Farming (VF) are part of the “building-based Urban Agriculture (UA) ”. In this sense, this article presents the first results of the research project Fertilecity, which aims to analyze, from a technological and sustainability approach, a new agricultural production system for Mediterranean urban areas through the integration of greenhouses on the roof of buildings.

In the first experiment the Fe-chelates DTPA, EDDHA and HEEDTA (25 μmol L- 1) and Zn target values of 5, 25 and 50 μmol L- 1 in the root environment were compared. In the second experiment DTPA and EDDHA and Zn target values of 5 and 50 μmol L- 1 at two pH ranges: 5 - 5. 5 and 6. 0 - 6. 5 were compared. No yield nor fruit quality were significant affected in both trials. Chlorosis occurred severely at the high pH levels but was not significantly different among the chelate- or Zn treatments Necrosis of leaf margin occurred with the DTPA treatments, specifically at high pH. The required Fe-chelate dosage to keep the target levels of Fe was much higher for HEEDTA than for DTPA and EDDHA, at high pH a higher dose of DTPA was needed than for EDDHA in particular with increasing Zn levels. The Fe uptake was not significantly affected by the treatments. The Zn uptake increased with the supply. Interaction of chelate type and pH was found. With EDDHA the Zn uptake was three to five times higher than with DTPA and HEEDTA at high pH. This was in line with the much higher Zn supply needed with EDDHA at high pH The results of these experiments draw the attention to the effects of different Fe chelates on the availability of several micro nutrients to plants, which apparently can be explained by a different behavior to complexation...|$|E
40|$|In the EU regulation, {{confirmed}} by IFOAM, soil {{is considered to}} be connected to the subsoil, therefore <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> is not included in the scope of this paper. Soil fertility is a complex matter, since this term is related to soil physics, minerals and biological characteristics and each of these parameters is important. One of the key issues in organic production is the approach to soil and soil fertility. This is evident in the EU regulation on fertilisers and organic soil amendments used in organic food production, which details restrictions on crop production. The goal in organic production is equilibrium between the production capacity of the soil and other production factors, rather than maximising yields, and the input of manure, compost and mineral fertilisers is constrained by regulations. Conversely, greenhouse crops are characterised by high production levels which are considered necessary to recoup investment costs, and consequently require high nutrient inputs, which conflicts with the basic organic intentions. Leaching in open field production is of concern, but in greenhouse horticulture, it can be fully controlled, since precipitation is excluded. The growing period for fruit vegetable crops is too long for all nutrients to be supplied by base dressings alone, as adding the amount of fertiliser required to supply season-long nutrients would result in excessive levels of soil nutrients and electrical conductivity (EC) values would be too high. Soil N-dynamics must also be considered, as N-immobilisation will result in poor N supply to the crop, and rapid N-mineralisation creates a risk of N losses through leaching and too much vegetative development. Therefore, top dressings in the form of rapid mineralising fertilisers are indispensable. Over-fertilisation and leaching of N and P should be negative, but also can be avoided by fine-tuning nutrient supply and demand, in combination with advanced irrigation scheduling. Therefore, the fertilisation plan should have a balanced approach, taking into account the ratios of all individual macro-nutrients, as well as considering the inputs of undesirable residual salts like Na, Cl and SO 4 and using predictive models for crop demand and N delivery. Additional regulations on mandatory restrictions for top dressings will soon come into effect, making balanced fertilisation complicated and possibly leading to undesirable lower nutrient use efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|In Trinidad {{vegetables}} and short-term root crops are largely {{the province of}} small farmers operating on farms of 0. 2 ha to 2 ha, with the great majority on less than 1 ha. Given the small land area, high value, quick growing crops offer the best potential to such farmers. Produce is marketed mainly through small wholesalers and retailers who buy direct from growers. Certain supermarkets are now becoming established as suppliers of fresh local {{vegetables and}} {{an increasing number of}} farmers are selling directly to them. The combination of increasing prices and a policy framework which has sought to encourage local production of vegetables has offered opportunities for enterprising individuals to make relatively high incomes from this sector of agriculture. However the June December wet season places limitations on the traditional outdoor systems owing to: impact of raindrops which can damage or dislodge young plants; high soil moisture that can effect cultural operations and water. logging; high incidence of diseases and pests; and flooding of low lying areas. These problems stimulated some growers to consider alternative systems including <b>soil-less</b> <b>culture</b> (hydroponics) as a means of fulfilling demand. In addition to overcoming many of the problems inherent in wet season cultivation of vegetables the use of such systems also obviates the need to have irrigation facilities for dry season cultivation. The high cost of establishing such systems can be offset by the high prices which are possible, especially for out of season produce. This is demonstrated by a case study of a 'backyard' producer of lettuce in Trinidad using the hydroponic nutrient film technique on an area of 15, 000 square feet (1, 700 m 2). The farm family of four (husband, wife and two sons) depends entirely on income from the farm. The farmer and his sons work full-time on the farm and in addition they employ three other workers full-time. Undoubtedly the farmer is innovative and is not afraid to experiment. However, he does not take undue risks. He started small, gained experience before expanding and now appears to be successful, owning a comfortable house with modem amenities. His niche is the existing and expanding market for fresh, clean, well-presented lettuce. Fast food outlets and the trend towards health foods, with its emphasis on fresh fruit and vegetables, could increase demand. However, the farmer is aware that movements towards organic farming and ecological agriculture could influence people away from soil-less agriculture. Therefore he is investigating the production of flowering plants, particularly poinsettias.

Two cultivars, 'Daniela' (experiment 1) and 'Boludo' (experiments 2 and 3), were used. Seven levels of electrical conductivity (EC) in the nutrient solution were compared in experiment 1 (2. 5 - 8. 0 dS m- 1) and five levels in experiments 2 and 3 (2. 5 - 8. 5 dS m- 1). Total and marketable yield decreased linearly with increasing salinity above a threshold EC value (ECt). There were only small effects of climate and cultivar on the ECt value for yield. Average threshold EC values for total and marketable fruit yield were, respectively, 3. 2 and 3. 3 dS m- 1. The linear reductions of total and marketable yield with EC above ECt showed significant differences between experiments, the slope varying from 7. 2 % (autumn to spring period, 'Boludo') to 9. 9 % (spring period, 'Boludo') decreases per dS m- 1 increase in EC for total yield, and from 8. 1 % (spring period, 'Daniela') to 11. 8 % (spring period, 'Boludo') for marketable yield. The decrease of fresh fruit yield with salinity was mostly due to a linear decrease of the fruit weight of 6. 1 % per dS m- 1 from an ECt of 3. 0 dS m- 1 for marketable fruits. Reduction in fruit number with salinity made a smaller relative contribution to reduced yield. Blossom-end rot (BER) increased with increasing salinity. There was {{a higher incidence of}} BER with spring grown crops, and 'Boludo' was more sensitive than 'Daniela'. Increasing salinity improved various aspects of fruit quality, such as: (i) proportion of 'Extra' fruits (high visual quality), (ii) soluble solids content, and (iii) titratable acidity content. However, salinity decreased fruit size, which is a major determinant of price. An economic analysis indicated that the EC threshold value above which the value of fruit production decreased linearly with increasing salinity was 3. 3 dS m- 1, which was the same as that for marketable yield. In the economic analysis, the value of increased visual fruit quality was offset by reduced yield and smaller fruit size. ...|$|E
