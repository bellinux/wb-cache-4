2500|$|Most of the {{proteins}} and glycoproteins {{that constitute the}} complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen—antibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (<b>specific</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response),</b> whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. [...] C3b binds {{to the surface of}} pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.|$|E

However, splenectomized horses are unable to control B. equi infection and usually succumb to the infection. To investigate {{the role of the}} spleen in the control of B. equi infection in the absence of <b>specific</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> two 1 -month-old foals with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and two age-matched normal foals were inoculated with B. equi. The SCID foals became febrile seven days postinoculation and developed terminal parasitemias of 41 and 29 %. The SCID foals had greater than 50 % decreases in indices of total erythrocytes, packed-cell volumes, and hemoglobin concentrations. Both SCID foals were euthanized in extremis at 10 days postinoculation. As expected, the serum of the SCID foals lacked detectable antibodies to B. equi antigens. In contrast, the normal foals inoculated with B. equi produced detectable anti-erythrocyte-stage parasite antibodies by 7 days and controlled clinical disease by 12 days postinoculation. Although SCID foals lack functional T and B lymphocytes, they do possess complement, macrophages, granulocytes, and natural killer cells, as well as a spleen. Therefore, the data indicate that <b>specific</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> are required to control B. equi parasitemia but are not required for erythrocyte lysis in infected horses.
