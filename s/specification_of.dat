40|$|We discuss {{logic and}} <b>specification</b> {{language}} <b>of</b> a program synthesizer for Java intended for dynamic synthesis of services. We introduce metainterfaces as logical <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> classes. They {{can be used}} in two ways: as <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> computational usage of classes or as <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> new classes composed from metaclasses – the classes already supplied with metainterfaces. The specification language used has a straightforward translation into a restricted first-order constructive logic. New programs are composed by a deductive synthesis method close to the structural synthesis of programs. An example of composition of a transaction service is presented...|$|R
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{to infer}} process-based {{convergence}} fit models of selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data {{to determine whether}} the same selective forces have acted upon lineages. This uses the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to test different scenarios of selection. Other methods rely on an a priori <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> where shifts in selection have occurred.|$|E
5|$|The abbey's next organ {{was built}} in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> thirty stops over three manuals and pedals. This {{instrument}} was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868, to a <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter & St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ.|$|E

The changes to the specification and a collapse {{in the price of}} collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E

5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull introduced a revised version of its RB6 chassis for Vettel as his previous monocoque had a small defect which created handling difficulties in Monaco. The team tested a version of McLaren's F-duct system (which increases the top speed of a car) during the Friday practice sessions but removed it for qualifying and the race because both of McLaren's drivers found the device difficult to operate. Ferrari modified their F-duct system so that it would allow their drivers to operate the system by using their left leg. Mercedes arrived at the circuit by reverting to a previous <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> suspension and introduced a longer wheelbase on both their cars as well as a new version of their F-duct system. Williams decided to revert to an old <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> their front wing following accidents involving their drivers in Monaco, though the team brought new brake ducts. Lotus débuted a new rear wing specification which improved forward balance of their chassis. Virgin managed to procure a longer-wheelbase version of the VR-01 for Lucas di Grassi after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull prevented them from having two cars prepared in time for the previous race.|$|E
5|$|Some {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 engine for Saturday's qualifying session and the race. Sauber brought lighter components to reduce the weight of their cars and the Williams team arrived with a revised rear wing. Williams engine suppliers BMW confirmed that they would be running the same <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> engine introduced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> genes is one step closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
