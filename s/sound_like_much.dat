He called the music artificial, {{repetitive}} and uninspired. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "At first, it [...] doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> at all. Then you notice its one distinguishing feature, a girlish hiccup that the singer uses over and over until it's irritating as hell.

500|$|Bhatti {{revealed}} that since appearing in EastEnders, {{people have come}} up {{to him in the}} street and called him a [...] "bad man", and that fans call him [...] "Dr Evil". In May 2011, Bhatti was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the TV Quick Awards and the storyline where he tries to destroy the Masoods' marriage was nomated for Best Storyline. Bhatti was surprised to hear that Yusef is liked mainly by women, but {{in an interview with the}} Daily Mirror, he admits that he is nothing like Yusef in real life. BBC News branded Yusef as [...] "Zainab's sinister first husband", elsewhere, Metro.co.uk described Yusef as a [...] "deceptive doctor". Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Zainab sending Yusef into the blazing building was a [...] "stroke of genius". Simon also said that it's unknown what Yusef is hoping to achieve with his [...] "one-man reign of terror. Being married to a woman he can’t stand, with a son he doesn’t want." [...] She added: [...] "It doesn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> of a game-plan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{feel that}} the album's lyrics glamorize gang violence. The Washington Post writer David Mills wrote: [...] "The hard-core street rappers defend their violent lyrics as a {{reflection}} of 'reality.' But for all the gunshots they mix into their music, rappers rarely try to dramatize that reality — a young man flat on the ground, a knot of lead in his chest, pleading as death slowly takes him in. It's easier for them to imagine themselves pulling the trigger". However, Wichita Eagle-Beacon editor Bud Norman noted that [...] "They N.W.A don't make it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> fun...

2500|$|The opening track, [...] "A Sort of Homecoming" [...] {{immediately}} {{shows the}} change in U2's <b>sound.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>much</b> of the album, the hard-hitting martial drum sound of War is replaced with a subtler polyrhythmic shuffle, and the guitar is no longer as prominent in the mix. Typical of the album, the track [...] "The Unforgettable Fire", with a string arrangement by Noel Kelehan, has a rich, symphonic sound built from ambient guitar and driving rhythm, along with a lyrical [...] "sketch" [...] that is an [...] "emotional travelogue" [...] with a [...] "heartfelt sense of yearning". The band cite a travelling Japanese art exhibit {{of the same name}} as inspiration for both the song and album title. The exhibition, which the band attended in Chicago, commemorated the victims of the bombing of Hiroshima. However, the open-ended lyric, which Bono says [...] "doesn't tell you anything", does not directly reference nuclear warfare. Rather, the lyrics are about travelling to Tokyo.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the opening}} track on The Unforgettable Fire, [...] "A Sort of Homecoming" [...] epitomises the new {{direction}} U2 had taken.

5000|$|Ed Wingate, {{owner of}} the newly formed Detroit-based Golden World Records, had signed the Reflections {{on the basis of}} the group's {{regional}} success with the single [...] "You Said Goodbye" [...] on the local Kay-Ko label. Songwriter Freddie Gorman, who had been recruited by Golden World from Motown, would recall that he considered his recent composition [...] "(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet" [...] as [...] "tailor made" [...] for the doo-wop-styled Reflections [...] "because it had a pop feel, as opposed to the R&B thing they were doing."

This doesn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much,</b> but water contains numerous diseases and {{some parts of}} the world do not have the luxury of clean water, or any at all. It wasn’t new to use silver for removing microbes, but this experiment used the carbonate in water to make microbes even more vulnerable to silver. First the scientists of the experiment use the nanopaticles to remove certain pesticides from the water, ones that prove fatal to people if ingested. Several other tests have shown that the silver nanoparticles were capable of removing certain ions in water as well, like iron, lead, and arsenic. But that is not the only reason why the silver nanoparticles are so appealing, they do not require any external force (no electricity of hydrolics) for the reaction to occur.|$|E
5000|$|The LOADER loads the camera, oddly enough, with film made {{by either}} Kodak or Fuji. Loading may not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> of a job, but in {{actuality}} {{it is very}} important. If the wrong film is in the camera, or if it gets loaded twice, or lost, or put in the wrong can, then the scene which corresponded to: Scene 56 - The Army advanced over the hill, the jets dropped their bombs, and the volcano erupted... could be lost. When this happens the Loader can become deeply unpopular very quickly. Kubrick fired one loader I know {{on his first day}} of work for walking across the set holding a magazine upside down. Not Kubrick’s first day of work - the Loader's. This was a trifle harsh, but there is a right way to do the job, and the rules are there for a very good reason. If you screw up the minimum cost is about $20,000 and the max any figure you might care to imagine.|$|E

5000|$|The Agent Intellect was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from contemporary reviewers. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 85, which indicates [...] "Universal acclaim", based on 20 reviews. The Guardian critic Kate Hutchinson thought: [...] "This isn’t spiky postpunk like their last album - it’s more unhinged: they’ve swapped hooks for a dirgy epicness, distortion bulldozes through, sometimes flaring angrily, punctured by driving, truly affecting drums. As poignant as those images of a decrepit Motor City, once brilliant, now decayed." [...] Sam Lefebvre of Paste magazine described the album as [...] "an album of spindly bass, needling guitar and economical drums." [...] Lefebvre further added [...] "And yet, with Protomartyr’s inventive ensemble flare, it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> more." ...|$|R

He batted [...]331 with 8 hrs (13 on the season) in 52 games with the New Orleans Zephyrs of the PCL to give the Mets a reason to keep him for another year. He returned to the Major Leagues for 4 games with the Mets in 2009, going 1 for 4. That may not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much,</b> but it pushed his lifetime Major League batting average above the Mendoza line.

5000|$|And {{there is}} another {{organization}} called the ABIM Foundation that does...well, it’s not quite clear what it does. Its website reads {{like a lot of}} mumbo-jumbo. The Foundation conducts surveys on how “organizational leaders have advanced professionalism among practicing physicians.” And it is very proud of its “Choosing Wisely” program, an initiative “to help providers and patients engage in conversations to reduce overuse of tests and procedures,” with pamphlets, videos and other means.Doesn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much,</b> until you crack open the 990s. This organization is loaded. In the tax year ended 2013, it brought in $20 million—not from contributions, not from selling a product, not for providing a service. No, the foundation earned $20 million on the $74 million in assets it holds.The foundation racked up $5.2 million in expenses, which—other than $245,000 it gave to the ABIM—was divided into two categories: compensation and “other.” Who is getting all this compensation? The very same people who are top earners at the ABIM. Deep in the filings, it says the foundation spends $1.9 million in “program and project expenses,” with no explanation what the programs and projects are.There are some expenditures, though, that are easy to understand: The foundation spends $153,439 a year on at least one condominium.

5000|$|HipHopDX {{reviewer}} Michael Cusenza {{gave the}} album a {{four out of}} five, saying [...] "In Search of Stoney Jackson is another Stones Throw gem mined by their incomparable in-house Konducta. It's a funky ride to Rap's far side in a car fabricated by Madlib, commandeered by Strong Arm Steady {{and a slew of}} able narrators." [...] Pitchfork's Patrick Sisson gave the album a 7.1 out of ten, saying [...] "For all Madlib's eclecticism and supposedly short attention span, his work here sounds focused and sharp. The beats aren't wasted here by any means, but a different crew could have brought out even more potential." [...] Mosi Reeves of Spin gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "With Strong Arm Steady's MC trio of Krondon, Phil Da Agony, and Mitchy Slick (plus extended fam like Planet Asia, Phonte, and Fashawn) dropping lyrical barbs ("Telegram") and creatively reheated thug-isms ("Needle in the Haystack"), Madlib chops up loops bubbling with quirky humor and analog soul." [...] Matt Jost of RapReviews gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "It doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> upon first listen. But after a few spins In Search of Stoney Jackson becomes a charming little record that has quite a lot to offer despite its fragmented, uncoordinated appearance." [...] Joe Schmoh of Sputnikmusic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "That disappointment resonating from the main attraction quickly boils over, as the guests and Madlib's tasteful samples give In Search of Stoney Jackson a sic off-the-cuff, mixtape-ish feeling that makes it truly a fun listen. Madlib still proves he's the master of his terrain, and certain guests slay their hosts, but for the most part, it's a mix of 90s nostalgia and the new kids, and fits together perfectly." ...|$|E
