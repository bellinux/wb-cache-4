A definitive version was subsequently published in Journal of Biomechanics, Vol. 41 Issue 13 (2008), DOI: 10. 1016 /j. jbiomech. 2008. 06. 035 Determining the effect of load carriage on the human spine in vivo is important for determining spinal forces and establishing potential mechanisms of back injury. Previous studies have suggested that the natural curvature of the spine <b>straightens</b> under <b>load,</b> but are based on modelling and external measurements {{from the surface of the}} back. In the current study, an upright positional MRI scanner was used to acquire sagittal images of the lumbar and lower thoracic spine of 24 subjects. The subjects were imaged in standing whilst supporting 0, 8 and 16 kg of load which was applied axially across the shoulders using an apron. An active shape model of the vertebral bodies from T 10 to S 1 was created and used to characterise the effect of load. The results from the shape model showed that the behaviour of the average-shaped spine was to straighten slightly. However, the shape model also showed that the effect of load exhibited systematic variation between individuals. Those who had a smaller than average curvature before <b>loading</b> <b>straightened</b> under <b>load,</b> whereas those who had a greater than average curvature before loading showed an increase in curvature under load. The variation in behaviour of differently shaped spines may have further implications for the effects of load in lifting manoeuvres and in understanding the aetiology of back pain...|$|R
60|$|A big fire threw {{a cheerful}} glow about the shack and Jimmy {{occupied}} {{a pile of}} branches by the snapping logs. He had pulled a blanket over his shoulders, but when he heard Deering's step he jumped up. Deering dropped his <b>load,</b> <b>straightened</b> his back and looked about.|$|R
30|$|All hooks {{fractured}} in {{the region}} just beneath or at the commencement of curvature. This {{is in line with}} shear theory since the material at this point has the smallest cross-sectional area. The innermost fibres experience the highest strain as the hook tries to <b>straighten</b> under <b>loading.</b> The outermost fibres will be in extension as the hook distorts and “straightens” under loading. Once the inner fibres have failed, the full load is then transferred to the outer fibres which immediately fail in tension under the significantly higher stress.|$|R
50|$|The women perform heroically, persevering through hardships {{including}} a stampede and a wicked descent down a steep, rocky trail that kills {{one of them}} when an iron hook attached to the restraining lines <b>straightens</b> under <b>load</b> and sends the wagon plunging out of control. An Indian attack kills Roy, Sid, and six of the women. When a rainstorm causes flooding and undercuts the riverbank her wagon is parked on, Laurie is trapped inside and drowns. However, Fifi's bravery and determination begin to thaw Buck's attitude towards women in general and her in particular, and they fall in love.|$|R
5000|$|Long pasterns {{have been}} favored {{because they can}} diffuse impact, giving a more {{comfortable}} ride. However, excess length puts extreme tension on the tendons and ligaments {{of the back of}} the leg, predisposing the horse to a bowed tendon or suspensory ligament injury. The suspensory is strained because fetlock is unable to <b>straighten</b> as horse <b>loads</b> the limb with weight.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{assessment}} and comparison of trunk kinematics during restricted (knee not beyond toes) and unrestricted squats. Eight repetitions of restricted and unrestricted squats with 0, 25 % and 50 % bodyweight loading using a barbell were assessed with a 12 camera motion analysis system. A trunk marker set was developed and applied that allowed the measurement of the 3 D kinematics of the trunk, divided into three segments (lumbar, thoracic and upper trunk) and the analysis of the sagittal curvature (lumbar and thoracic spine). The preliminary results of four subjects showed a larger range of sagittal motion between lumbar and pelvic segments for the restricted compared to the unrestricted squat. The lumbar curvature <b>straightened</b> with increasing <b>load.</b> The unrestricted execution seems to lead to higher stresses in the lower back...|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{sensing the}} {{magnitude}} of a load on a cable as the cable is employed to support the load includes a beam structure clamped to the cable so that a length of the cable lies along the beam structure. A spacer associated with the beam structure forces a slight curvature in {{a portion of the}} length of cable under a cable no-load condition so that the portion of the length of cable is spaced from the beam structure to define a cable curved portion. A strain gauge circuit including strain gauges is secured to the beam structure by welding. As the cable is employed to support a load the load causes the cable curved portion to exert a force normal to the cable through the spacer and on the beam structure to deform the beam structure as the cable curved portion attempts to <b>straighten</b> under the <b>load.</b> As this deformation takes place, the resistance of the strain gauges is set to a value proportional to {{the magnitude of}} the normal strain on the beam structure during such deformation. The magnitude of the normal strain is manipulated in a control device to generate a value equal to the magnitude or weight of the load supported by the cable...|$|R
40|$|High {{recording}} density with the home-use digital VCRs requires {{the use of}} narrow tracks, short recording wavelength, and thin magnetic tapes. Knowledge of Young’s modulus of the tape is essential for the precise positioning of the tape on the rotating drums and then a stable tape-to-head interface. The magnetic tapes usually show different Young’s moduli for the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD) [1]. The anisotropy develops mainly in the base film of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through the partial crystallization and the crystallite orientation alignment during the stretching process on the tapes [2], while the original PET sheet, from which the tapes are cut, shows much less anisotropy. This situation requires the determination of Young’s moduli for both MD and TD of the tape. The tapes on play are <b>straightened</b> by tensile <b>loads,</b> which should be controlled with Young’s modulus for the MD. Too much load may distort the recorded tracks or damage the tape. Besides, the vertical load is applied onto both edges of the running tape by the guiding rollers. Again, too much load may induce the tape buckling. Critical load is proportional to the Young’s modulus in the TD. Large moduli are desirable for both directions...|$|R

A three-point bending test was performed for 0. 014 NiTi wire engaged in self-ligating (Damon, SmartClip, In-Ovation) and conventional brackets (Victory) ligated with regular and reduced friction modules (Slide). The wire was deflected in the buccal direction and allowed to <b>straighten.</b> The maximum <b>load,</b> unloading plateau and unloading capacity were registered. Results. The lowest activation load was required in the active self-ligating group (In-Ovation 2. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N) and reduced friction module group (Victory/Slide 2. 9 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N), followed by the passive self-ligating systems (Damon 3. 6 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 7 &#x 2009;N, SmartClip 3. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N). Higher activation load was obtained in the conventionally ligated group (Victory/module 4. 5 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N). Unloading plateau phase with the load magnitude ranging from 1. 27 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N (In-Ovation) to 1. 627 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N (Slide) was distinct in all groups but one (Victory). Conclusions. Higher friction at flanking points reduces the net force delivered by the wire. Unloading plateau phase of NiTi load-deflection curve disappears in the conventionally ligated group thus indicating to an incomplete expression of NiTi superelastic properties. A rigid passive bracket clip amplifies resistance to sliding in an active configuration and produces a permanent deflection of the wire...|$|R
