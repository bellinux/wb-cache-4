40|$|The authors {{study the}} effects of {{liquidity}} constraints and <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> on the relationship between wealth and the fraction of entrepreneurs in an economy. They develop a dynamic occupational choice model with endogenous wealth and entry into entrepreneurship. The model predicts that, with liquidity constraints, the probability of entering entrepreneurship is an increasing function of individual wealth while the introduction of <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> tends to flatten this relationship. The theoretical predictions can be tested on cross-sectional data with exogenous variation in liquidity constraints (e. g. access to credit) and business <b>start-up</b> <b>costs.</b> They use three highly comparable micro datasets (SHARE, ELSA and HRS) providing harmonized data on wealth and work status in 9 countries that characterized by very different levels of <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> and liquidity constraints. Their results support their theoretical predictions. While higher liquidity constraints yield a positive relationship with wealth profile for the fraction of workers in entrepreneurship, <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> weaken this relationship by depressing the marginal value of being an entrepreneur as a function of wealth.

2500|$|There is {{some recent}} {{research}} which tries {{to assess the}} impact of the Internet on profitability. It remains unclear what the total effect of computerization is on the relationship between investments and profits. Some argue that, in reality, computerization by itself does not alter the cost structure of products very much. Others argue, that computerization both enables a much faster turnover of capital, with great productivity gains and fewer employees, and permits entrepreneurs to set up business with computers at a much lower <b>start-up</b> <b>cost</b> than before. Perhaps the main effect of the internet relevant to business is that it has gigantically enlarged the possibilities for market access on a global scale: businesses set up for internet sales can reach vastly more customers in much less time. [...] The proof of that is, that purchases via the internet have constantly increased, often at the expense of ordinary street shops. One of the analytical problems is that the relative importance of computers, and their potential financial impact, differs considerably between different kinds of business.|$|E

40|$|In {{an economy}} with {{liquidity}} constraints, individuals face greater difficulty starting their business {{because of a}} lack of sufficient financing. We study the impact of such constraints, and also the effect of business <b>start-up</b> <b>costs,</b> on the relationship between individual wealth and the proportion of self-employed individuals in the economy. The dynamic model of business start-up choice, developed in this paper, predicts an upward sloping relationship between wealth and the proportion of self-employed workers in the economy. It also predicts that this relationship will weaken when business <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> are taken into account. The estimates tend to confirm that liquidity constraints do influence the decision to go self-employed. Our results underline the importance of the combined impact of liquidity restrictions and business <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> on the decision to become self-employed. A policy of financial assistance for entrepreneurs would be of little use if business <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> remain high.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{literature on}} power markets with high shares of fluctuating renewables suggests that more frequent start-up procedures of thermal power plants may become an increasing concern, both for costs and possibly also for market design. Based on official scenario assumptions, we investigate how <b>start-ups</b> and related <b>costs</b> develop in Germany, where {{the share of}} fluctuating renewables quadruples between 2010 and 2030. We find that {{the overall number of}} start-ups decreases by a third, while related costs increase by half. The relative share of <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> in overall variable costs of thermal plants grows only slightly and remains below 1 %. Several overlapping effects drive these results. The expansion of fluctuating renewables alone would strongly increase <b>start-up</b> <b>costs.</b> In contrast, increased flexibility of biomass power plants, additional power storage and larger block sizes have opposite effects. While the relevance of <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> grows only moderately under baseline assumptions, it may increase further under alternative developments of system flexibility. Future power market design reforms should thus aim to ensure proper remuneration of quasi-fixed <b>start-up</b> <b>costs.</b> Our findings are also relevant for many other countries with thermal power systems that plan to undergo comparable transitions toward fluctuating renewables...|$|R

Using panel data on 60 countries spanning the period 2003 - 07 this paper establishes that (i) opportunitymotivated entrepreneurship (as opposed to necessity-motivated entrepreneurship) drives economic growth; (ii) {{governance and}} the <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> are not significant determinants of opportunity entrepreneurship; and (iii) better governance leads to higher economic growth.

Indeed, despite poorer governance and higher <b>start-up</b> <b>costs,</b> rates of opportunity-motivated entrepreneurship are higher in developing countries. Second, better governance can lead to better growth through reducing the impact of destructive entrepreneurship (including rent-seeking), even though this may not result in a reallocation of effort from destructive towards opportunity-motivated entrepreneurship.
