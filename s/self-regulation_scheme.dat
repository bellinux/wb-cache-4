40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the impact on}} U. S. Financial Reporting System Reform under Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Traditionally, in the U. S. Financial Reporting System, the regulation scheme had been avoided by intervene of public regulation, rather adopted self-regulation by the accounting profession. As seen {{a number of major}} corporate and accounting scandals, it is criticized intensely that there are the strategic collusion with corporate manager and public auditors. The act takes the reinforcement and the expansion of direct control by the public sector. One of the major problems is the rearrangement of the standards-setting body. The act establishes the legal status on private sector accounting and auditing standards setter. Thus, the organization of accounting profession has weaken their power. This article concludes that U. S. Financial Reporting System Reform has intent to be sharp departure from self-regulation by accounting profession, and moves to <b>self-regulation</b> <b>scheme</b> under the statue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper uses a {{structured}} survey to {{provide insight into}} how the Road Transport Management System (RTMS), SABS standard SANS 1395 : 2014, has developed and is viewed within {{the road transport industry}} in South Africa. The RTMS is an industry-led, government-supported, voluntary, <b>self-regulation</b> <b>scheme</b> that encourages consignees, consignors and road transport operators to implement a management system that demonstrates compliance with road traffic regulations and contributes to preserving road infrastructure, improving road safety and increasing productivity. The surveyed views of the road traffic authorities, banks, insurance companies, the RTMS steering committee, and road transport operators provide insights into the perceptions and experiences with respect to the RTMS from diverse stakeholders. Respondents indicate that improved safety, operational efficiency and reduced road crashes are seen as attractive benefits to implementing the RTMS. The main obstacles to certification are a lack of awareness of the RTMS and a poor understanding of the requirements for becoming RTMS certified. The clients of road transporters {{play a significant role in}} the transporterâ€™s decision to become RTMS certified...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend towards}} Internet {{self-regulation}} is driven both by gov- ernments that feel reluctant {{to invest in}} direct regulation (because {{of freedom of speech}} concerns or high cots of monitoring and enforce- ment) and by the industry that is under the threat of rising public concerns over content (protection of minors, hate speech, e-business confidence). Our first model explores how firms voluntarily commit themselves to industry-wide or global codes of conduct and reporting initiatives. Then we analyze certification mechanisms through which firms can credibly signal their commitment to <b>self-regulation</b> <b>schemes</b> in the absence of government enforced regulatory standards and use the theoretical results to analyze the logic of current decision making in this area at the European level. Throughout, we illustrate these concepts with a large number of global examples and more detailed European level studies...|$|R
3000|$|Dr. Lubinus {{cited the}} {{president}} of the Colombian Association of Scientific Societies, who said that the evidence-based medicine (EBM) is used to make [...] "explicit recommendations for specific situations, based on statistically validated research", and that it became the basis for developing practice guidelines, which was misused by auditors and administrative staff and even by uninformed doctors, who converted the EBM in an instrument to constrain the medical act. The Colombian Statutory Law of Health from 2015 establishes medical autonomy and self-regulation as the main principles of the law. The autonomy of health professionals is guaranteed to make decisions about the diagnosis and treatment of patients they are responsible for. This autonomy shall be exercised within the framework of <b>self-regulation</b> <b>schemes,</b> ethics, rationality and scientific evidence. All constraints, pressure or restriction of practice that threatens the autonomy of the health professionals, as well as any abusive practice that threatens patient safety is prohibited.|$|R
40|$|Advertising is {{the most}} visible element of modern marketing, and an {{important}} component of trading. It is also an activity often accused by its critics of being intrusive and pervasive. Such accusations are not easily refuted by a worldwide industry which spends billions of dollars each year reaching and persuading its target markets through daily bombardment of thousands of ads in most developed countries. When advertising does offend, mislead, or is untruthful, a structure needs to be in place in order to provide protection to all parties and, in most cases, a country's legal system is complemented by a self-regulatory <b>scheme.</b> <b>Self-regulation</b> is a common approach to controlling conduct or behaviour in society and, indeed, Australian advertisers have opted for this system of control for more than 60 years...|$|R
40|$|Collaboration of {{different}} information systems with partially redundant database contents {{may help to}} decrease response times and to increase availability of the system for query activities. For this purpose these query activities {{have to be performed}} redundantly in parallel on databases in different information systems. However, as collaborations are scaling up in the number of participating customers, uncontrolled parallel querying will finally lead to the opposite effect, namely longer and longer waiting time, until the whole collaborating system undergoes thrashing. In this paper we present a novel, natural, analytic pricing scheme for query services which may be used to control the degree of effective redundancy in query activities by way of <b>self-regulation.</b> The pricing <b>scheme</b> is based on the calculation of tailback effects and it binds the prices to actual performance, thus ruling out any deviations of prices from real behavior due to speculative system usage by cus [...] ...|$|R
