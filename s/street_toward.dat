25|$|Less {{is known}} of the Red Bull's {{provenance}} than of other contemporary venues such as the Globe Theatre and Fortune Theatre. It was constructed in 1604 on St John Street in Clerkenwell; court documents reveal that it was built by renovating an inn with a central square. This origin accounts for its square floor plan, a design shared only by the original Fortune among period playhouses. It may have been named for cattle that were driven down St John <b>Street</b> <b>toward</b> the markets at Smithfield.|$|E

25|$|At Pratt Street, {{the first}} cross street that NY276 meets in Rouses Point, the route turns eastward, {{following}} Pratt <b>Street</b> <b>toward</b> {{the center of}} the village. After one block, the route crosses the Delaware and Hudson Railroad and serves Rouses Point's Amtrak station at the junction of Pratt and Delaware Streets. NY276 remains on Pratt Street for another two blocks to the commercial center of the village, where it terminates at a junction with US11 (Lake Street) on the shores of Lake Champlain.

25|$|It soon {{reaches the}} {{outskirts}} of the village of Saugerties, where it connects to NY32 at a junction adjacent to the New York State Thruway (I-87). NY32 turns east here, overlapping with NY212 as both routes pass over the Thruway and serve the southern half of an interchange (exit20) with the toll road.
