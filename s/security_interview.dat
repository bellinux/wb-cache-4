40|$|The {{best way}} to shift gender norms and {{dynamics}} is to link gender to other interventions. Addressing gender norms by themselves is difficult and is not easily accepted. The researchers introduced {{a new type of}} fishing net designed to catch small, nutritious fish known as mola. They tested whether the combination of gender-transformative approaches and technology would improve benefits and empowerment and have an effect on food security. In some communities they tried making gender norms a topic of discussion, bringing men, women, mothers-in-law, and community leaders together. In other communities, they introduced only the nets, without trying the gender-transformative approaches. They hope both to measure empowerment and to improve food <b>security.</b> <b>Interview</b> with Froukje Kruijssen (WorldFish) for the book "A different kettle of fish?

40|$|Finland is {{a modern}} welfare state in Northern Europe {{especially}} proud of its development of programs for children's health. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the development of core-periphery differences in children's health and use of health services. The study material was obtained from the national health and social <b>security</b> <b>interview</b> survey carried out in 1964, 1968, 1976 and 1987. Age standardized prevalance of chronic diseases, number of restricted-activity days and physician contacts were presented for two age groups: 0 - 6 -year-olds and 7 - 14 -year-olds. The prevalence of chronic diseases was quite similar in the core and periphery in 1976 and 1987, but the number of restricted-activity days throughout the study period (1964 - 1987) was significantly higher in the core than in the periphery. The consistently higher frequency of physician contacts in the core in comparison with the periphery was spectacular; the welfare policy of the last decades seems to have had very little or no effect on this difference. The core-periphery division thus continues to have relevance with respect to the health of Finnish children. core periphery children health policy...|$|E
40|$|Circle of Security is an {{attachment}} theory based intervention {{that aims to}} promote secure parent–child attachment relationships. Despite extensive uptake of the approach, there is limited empirical evidence regarding efficacy. The current study examined whether participation in the 20 -week Circle of Security intervention resulted in positive caregiver–child relationship change in four domains: caregiver reflective functioning; caregiver representations {{of the child and}} the relationship with the child; child attachment security, and attachment disorganization. Archived pre- and postintervention data were analyzed from 83 clinically referred caregiver–child dyads (child age: 13 – 88 months) who completed the Circle of Security intervention in sequential cohorts and gave permission for their data {{to be included in the}} study. Caregivers completed the Circle of <b>Security</b> <b>Interview,</b> and dyads were filmed in the Strange Situation Procedure before and after the intervention. Results supported all four hypotheses: Caregiver reflective functioning, caregiving representations, and level of child attachment security increased after the intervention, and level of attachment disorganization decreased for those with high baseline levels. Those whose scores were least optimal prior to intervention showed the greatest change in all domains. This study adds to the evidence suggesting that the 20 -week Circle of Security intervention results in significant relationship improvements for caregivers and their children. 19 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates vocal behavior, {{measured using}} standard acoustic and commercial vocal analysis software, as it occurs naturally while lying, experiencing cognitive dissonance, or receiving a <b>security</b> <b>interview</b> conducted by an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA). In study one, vocal analysis software used for credibility assessment was investigated experimentally. Using a repeated measures design, 96 participants lied {{and told the}} truth during a multiple question interview. The vocal analysis software's built-in deception classifier performed at the chance level. When the vocal measurements were analyzed independent of the software's interface, the variables FMain (Stress), AVJ (Cognitive Effort), and SOS (Fear) significantly differentiated between truth and deception. Using these measurements, a logistic regression and machine learning algorithms predicted deception with accuracy up to 62. 8 %. Using standard acoustic measures, vocal pitch and voice quality was predicted by deception and stress. In study two, deceptive vocal and linguistic behaviors were investigated using a direct manipulation of arousal, affect, and cognitive difficulty by inducing cognitive dissonance. Participants (N= 52) made verbal counter-attitudinal arguments out loud that were subjected to vocal and linguistic analysis. Participants experiencing cognitive dissonance spoke with higher vocal pitch, response latency, linguistic Quantity, and Certainty and lower Specificity. Linguistic Specificity mediated the dissonance and attitude change. Commercial vocal analysis software revealed that cognitive dissonance induced participants exhibited higher initial levels of Say or Stop (SOS), a measurement of fear. Study three investigated {{the use of the}} voice to predict trust. Participants (N= 88) received a screening interview from an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) and reported their perceptions of the ECA. A growth model was developed that predicted trust during the interaction using the voice, time, and demographics. In study four, border guards participants were randomly assigned into either the Bomb Maker (N = 16) or Control (N = 13) condition. Participants either did or did not assemble a realistic, but non-operational, improvised explosive device (IED) to smuggle past an ECA security interviewer. Participants in the Bomb Maker condition had 25. 34 % more variation in their vocal pitch than the control condition participants. This research provides support that the voice is potentially a reliable and valid measurement of emotion and deception suitable for integration into future technologies such as automated security screenings and advanced human-computer interactions...|$|E
