Using a pulsed external field and a tuneable-pulsed, nano-second laser, we observe that the transient photo current cannot {{be explained by}} the current response <b>of</b> a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drifting</b> charges. The non drift contributions appear to originate from the time dependent relaxation of the Schottky barrier {{as a result of the}} photo excitation. This effect is more obvious in the small forward bias (≤+ 1. 0 volts) mode, when a reversal of the photo response is obtained. Also, we have devised a novel technique to determine the junction potential profile. This is done by measuring the external field required to null the initial photo current as a function of the excitation wave length (hence, the penetration depth) ...|$|R

50|$|For the {{purposes}} of physiographic mapping, landforms are classified according to both their geologic structures and histories. Distinctions based on geologic age also correspond to physiographic distinctions where the forms are so recent as {{to be in their}} first erosion cycle, as is generally the case with <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> glacial <b>drift.</b> Generally, forms which result from similar histories are characterized by certain similar features, and differences in history result in corresponding differences of form, usually resulting in distinctive features which are obvious to the casual observer, but this is not always the case. A maturely dissected plateau may grade without a break from rugged mountains on the one hand to mildly rolling farm lands on the other. So also, forms which are not classified together may be superficially similar; for example, a young coastal plain and a peneplain. In a large number of cases, the boundary lines are also geologic lines, due to differences in the nature or structure of the underlying rocks.|$|R
60|$|Now, if {{the mouth}} of that Chine at Bournemouth was lifted twenty feet out of the sea, one thing would happen,--that the high tide would not come up any longer, and wash away the cake of dirt at the entrance, as we saw it do so often. But if the mud stopped there, the mud behind it would come down more slowly, and lodge inside more and more, till the Chine was half filled-up, and only {{the upper part of}} the cliffs {{continue}} to be eaten away, above the level where the springs ran out. So gradually the Chine, instead of being deep and narrow, would become broad and shallow; and instead of hollowing itself rapidly after every shower of rain, as you saw the Chine at Bournemouth doing, would hollow itself out slowly, as this glen is doing now. And one thing more would happen,--when the sea ceased to gnaw at the foot of the cliffs outside, and to carry away every stone and grain of sand which fell from them, the cliffs would very soon cease to be cliffs; the rain and the frost would still crumble them down, but the dirt that fell would lie at their feet, and gradually make a slope of dry land, far out where the shallow sea had been; and their tops, instead of being steep as now, would become smooth and rounded; and so at last, instead of two sharp walls of cliff at the Chine's mouth, you might have--just what you have here at {{the mouth of}} this glen,--our Mount and the Warren Hill,--long slopes with <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>drifted</b> gravel and sand at their feet, stretching down into what was once an icy sea, and is now the Vale of Blackwater.

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{area of the}} prairies, from Indiana to North Dakota, {{consists of}} till plains, that is, <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> unstratified <b>drift.</b> These plains are 30, 50 or even 100 ft (up to 30 m) thick covering the underlying rock surface for thousands of square miles except where postglacial stream erosion has locally laid it bare. The plains have an extraordinarily even surface. The till is presumably made in part of preglacial soils, {{but it is more}} largely composed of rock waste mechanically transported by the creeping ice sheets. Although the crystalline rocks from Canada and some of the more resistant stratified rocks south of the Great Lakes occur as boulders and stones, a great part of the till has been crushed and ground to a clayey texture. The till plains, although sweeping in broad swells of slowly changing altitude, often appear level to the eye with a view stretching to the horizon. Here and there, faint depressions occur, occupied by marshy sloughs, or floored with a rich black soil of postglacial origin. It is thus by sub-glacial aggradation that the prairies have been levelled up to a smooth surface, in contrast to the higher and non-glaciated hilly country just to the south.|$|R

50|$|Ice rafting is the {{transport}} of various materials by ice. Various objects deposited on ice may eventually become embedded in the ice. When the ice melts after a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>drifting,</b> these objects are deposited onto {{the bottom of the}} water body, e.g., onto a river bed or an ocean floor. These deposits are called ice rafted debris (IRD) or ice rafted deposits. Ice rafting was a primary mechanism of sediment transport during glacial episodes of the Pleistocene when sea levels were very low and much of the land was covered by large masses (<b>sheets)</b> <b>of</b> ice. The rafting of various size sediments into deeper ocean waters by icebergs became a rather important process. Ice rafting is still a process occurring today although its impact is significantly less and much harder to gauge.|$|R

40|$|Among philosophers, {{controversy}} over the notion <b>of</b> <b>drift</b> in population genetics is ongoing.

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation model {{had been developed}} for computing the behavior <b>of</b> <b>drift</b> wood and its dam up process due to jamming between and/or {{in front of the}} houses when drift wood debouches into horizontally two-dimensional flow field. The calculation is accomplished by an interacting combination of Eulerian fluid and Lagragian drift wood equations, in which a turbulent diffusivity and rotational angular velocity <b>of</b> the <b>drift</b> wood are stochastically given based on the statistical analysis of these values in the experiments.

40|$|It {{is noted}} that, {{in the distant}} plasma sheet, {{it is likely that}} {{curvature}} drift is the most important source <b>of</b> <b>drift</b> parallel to the electric field, leading to what is commonly called Fermi acceleration of the particles. The energization mechanism here is proportional to the neutral sheet current density. It is a form of field-aligned acceleration, with rapid lowering of mirror points, caused by the transverse electric field in the plasma sheet. It is noted that the process will work for both negative and positive particles. A filamentation of the neutral current sheet is postulated. Here, the maximum energization by curvature drift and the accompanying intense precipitation will form an auroral band or arc along the <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> magnetic field lines that maps out to the local enhancement of the crosstail current, explaining inverted V events...|$|R

Likewise, the correlations between drifting workers and drones with the phenotypic variance for colony honey yields and levels of infestation with V. jacobsoni were weak and in no case significant.

To achieve these goals, representatives from research, academia, industry, and resource management were invited to participate in this workshop.
