5000|$|Impeller log: A small {{propeller}} {{mounted in}} the water that passes by the ship hull. The rotation rate of the propeller {{is proportional to the}} speed of the ship. This device is similar in principle to an anemometer, which is used to measure wind speed. A variation of this approach is known as a patent log, which is towed from the stern of a ship. The patent log includes a mechanical register that counts the log's rotations as it is being towed. The patent log was invented in 1688 by the English instrument maker Humphry Cole. The patent log is also known as a <b>screw</b> <b>log</b> or taffrail log.|$|E
40|$|A {{case of the}} {{accidental}} death of a 42 -year-old male injured by a <b>screw</b> <b>log</b> splitter in the yard of a private house necessitated a post-mortem examination and the technical evaluation of the machinery. The autopsy revealed fatal traumatic lesions to the head, caused by impact with a downward-moving log. Analysis of {{the scene of the}} accident showed that the machinery was not equipped with safety systems and was used incorrectly by the operators. The decision of the Criminal Court determined the absence of liability of the parties to be persecuted...|$|E

30|$|Model {{validation}} {{was performed}} separately for each end point by inspecting (standardized) residuals, fitted values and random effect estimates (BLUPâ€™s). Specifically, we checked distributional assumptions and {{for signs of}} heteroscedasticity. When evaluating the model we {{paid attention to the}} fact that the model was to be used for estimating mean differences and not for e.g. obtaining predictions. When initial inspections along with the model validation gave impression of a <b>screwed</b> distribution, the <b>log</b> transform was applied to the outcome and the model validation repeated. In the case of the pivot measurements, this caused us to prefer the analysis of log transformed observations.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the proper design of}} {{agricultural}} machines for both professional and non-professional use has assumed a relevant role in workers protection and accident avoidance. The {{activities related to}} cutting and sawing of firewood is the main cause of injuries or death of the operator. This is often due to the use of inadequately built or modified machines, improper use of equipment and use of tools intended for other purposes. This study aimed to design a conical <b>screw</b> <b>log</b> splitter that meets the criteria of the European Directive 2006 / 42 /EC and the technical standards of EN 609 - 2 : 1999 +A 1 : 2009 (E) guideline. For a proper design we determined the forces that influence the machine during its use, and sized the machine accordingly. The log splitter was scanned and digitalized in three dimensions. From the digital model we obtained a real model in 5 : 1 scale. Comparing the created log splitter with other solutions available on the market we confirmed its similar costs with the costs of tools currently marketed. The productivity of the machine was only slightly lower than that of machines not equipped with protections, but its safety was significantly improve...|$|E
