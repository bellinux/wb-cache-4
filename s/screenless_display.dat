50|$|Visual Image <b>screenless</b> <b>display</b> {{includes}} any {{image that}} {{the eye can}} perceive. The most common example of Visual Image <b>screenless</b> <b>display</b> is a hologram. Arguably, virtual reality goggles (which consist of two small screens but are nonetheless sufficiently different from traditional computer screens to be considered screenless) and heads-up display in airplanes (which display images on the clear cockpit window) also are included in Visual Image category. In all of these cases, light is reflected off some intermediate object (hologram, LCD panel, or cockpit window) before it reaches the retina. In the case of LCD panels the light is refracted {{from the back of}} the panel, but is nonetheless a reflected source. Google has proposed a similar system to replace the screens of tablet computers and smartphones.|$|E
50|$|Only {{recently}} {{a number of}} developments have made a true VRD system practical. In particular the development of high-brightness LEDs have made the displays bright enough to be used during the day, and adaptive optics have allowed systems to dynamically correct for irregularities in the eye (although {{this is not always}} needed). The result is a high-resolution <b>screenless</b> <b>display</b> with excellent color gamut and brightness, far better than the best television technologies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{advent of}} the <b>Screenless</b> <b>display</b> which is an emerging new technology, has become a good prospect {{in the near future}} {{for a wide range of}} applications. As the name implies it deals with the display of several things without the use of screens using projector. It involves the following 3 different working principles. The Visual image, Virtual retinal display, Synaptic interface. This paper mainly illustrates and demonstrates how the screen less displays works and its applications in various fields of science. This technology would bring about the revolution in the field of displays and monitors that are costly, huge and are proven difficult to manage the power requirements and constraints. It is also the futuristic technological innovation. Keywords- Foot, Hologram, Hand, LCD, Screenless, voice. I...|$|E
50|$|Virtual retinal display {{systems are}} {{a class of}} <b>screenless</b> <b>displays</b> in which images are {{projected}} directly onto the retina. They are distinguished from visual image systems because light is not reflected from some intermediate object onto the retina, it is instead projected directly onto the retina. Retinal Direct systems, once marketed, hold out the promise of extreme privacy when computing work is done in public places because most snooping relies on viewing the same light {{as the person who}} is legitimately viewing the screen, and retinal direct systems send light only into the pupils of their intended viewer.|$|R
