5000|$|The 1980s {{began with}} the first Surgeon General’s Report on the Health Consequences of Smoking for Women. [...] This report—published nearly 15 years after the {{original}} 1964 Surgeon General’s Report—came nearly sixty years after tobacco companies began marketing their products to women. The smoking rate of women in 1980 was at 29.3%. In 1987, Brown & Williamson introduced the Capri cigarette, which following suit with other feminine cigarettes was a long, slim, elegant cigarette geared toward feminine hands. 1990 saw the women’s smoking rate at 22.8%, continuing its slow decline. The Virginia Slims tennis tour {{came to an end}} in 1994, after 23 successful years. This was just one of many broad spectrum advertising methods that ended in the 1980s and 1990s as public sentiments regarding smoking began their shift. The 1990s were marked by continued restrictions on smoking in public and workplaces. The late 1980s and 1990s were also marked by increased marketing to teenagers and young adults. Many of the same marketing strategies used with women were used with this target group. By 1998, the women’s smoking rate had dropped to 22%. 1998 also marked the year of the Master Settlement Agreement. The beginning of the 21st century saw women smoking at a rate of 22.8%, which was a slight increase compared to the previous decade. [...] Advertising and marketing remained static after the 1998 Settlement Agreement. Advertising campaigns looked to present more modern and cutting-edge packaging and language, appealing to a younger and hipper demographic. In 2001, the most recent Surgeon General’s Report in regards to women and smoking was released. [...] RJ Reynolds entered the women’s market in 2007, with its Camel No. 9 cigarette. The packaging is very contemporary in feel, and very feminine at the same time. It features pink edging as a distinct contrast on the black packaging and the interior of the package is lined in pink foil. The cigarettes are sold in light and menthol light varieties, with the latter featuring a teal highlight and foil, instead of the pink of the regular lights. [...] The first decade of this century has also been marked by mass <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations.</b> A multitude of cities, municipalities, and states have passed legislation prohibiting smoking in public places, such as bars, restaurants, and an assortment of other public venues. [...] This is a growing phenomenon, which will help to reduce smoking rates in the United States. The overall smoking rate in the United States has dropped from approximately 46% in 1950 to approximately 21% in 2004.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{formation}} of social norms for considerate smoking behavior. Being considerate gives smokers a higher social approval from non-smokers, but imposes an inconvenience cost. A non-smoker's disapproval of inconsiderate smoking {{is assumed to be}} stronger the less used he is to being exposed to passive smoking. The analysis shows that introduction of a <b>smoking</b> <b>regulation</b> may move the society from an initial no-consideration Nash equilibrium to a Nash equilibrium in which every smoker is considerate, even in the unregulated zone. This crowding in of considerate behavior will prevail even after policy reversal. Empirical evidence confirms that a shift in social norms on considerate smoking has taken place in Norway after the smoking law amendments in 1988, and supports the plausibility of model assumptions.

5000|$|With the {{scientific}} {{data about the}} health risks of smoking and information {{about the effect of}} smoking on troop readiness, in 1975, the United States Department of Defense discontinued the inclusion of cigarettes in K-rations and C-rations. By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations,</b> including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas. In 1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel (47%) were significantly higher than that of US civilians (30%) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness. The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from stores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking. In 1986, the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who announced, [...] "an intense anti-smoking campaign…at all levels of all Services." [...] It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52% to 25% by 1990. In 1992, the DeCA Directive 40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993, the [...] became the first smoke-free Navy ship. [...] By 1994, the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or leased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year phase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7, 2002. Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had only decreased to 42% and far exceeded the rate of civilians. And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9% from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing.|$|E

We interviewed 3863 Massachusetts youths aged 12 – 17 years and as-certained how often they saw smokers in restaurants in their town. We assessed the effect of local restaurant smoking regulation strength on nonexposure to environmen-tal tobacco smoke (seeing smokers never or only rarely). Results. Compared with youths from towns with weak regulations, youths from towns with medium-strength regulations had 1. 4 times the odds (odds ratio= 1. 36; 95 % confi-dence interval= 1. 12, 1. 65) and youths from towns with strong regulations had twice the odds (odds ratio= 2. 03; 95 % confidence interval= 1. 64, 2. 52) of reporting nonexposure.

Telephone survey data from 40, 267 Canadian workers aged 20 or above interviewed in 2003 - 06 as part of the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey is used to conduct the analysis. <b>Smoking</b> <b>regulations</b> are classified as fully restricted, restricted to designated areas, allowed in certain areas, and no restrictions, and are used as exogenous determinants of whether individuals smokes, of exposure to second-hand smoke at work and more generally outside the home, and of how much smokers smoke. Smoking, quantity smoked, and the joint probabilities of smoking and quantity smoked, of smoking and exposure at work or outside the home, and of quantity smoked and exposure at work or outside the home, are estimated using a variety of econometric specifications, including probit, logit, multiple regression, poisson and negative binomial regression, bivariate and instrumental variables probits, simultaneous equation, and hurdle models. All models indicate that workplace <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations</b> have substantial impacts on the probability of smoking, quantity smoked, and exposure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite {{efforts that}} have {{increased}} <b>smoking</b> <b>regulation,</b> cigarette taxation, and social stigma, cigarette smoking remains {{the leading cause}} of preventable death worldwide, and a significant personal and public economic burden. In the U. S., intermittent smokers comprise approximately 22 % of all smokers and represent a stable, non-dependent group that may possess protective factors that prevent the transition to dependence. One possibility is that intermittent smokers have intact CNS frontal regulatory and control mechanisms that enable resistance to nicotine-induced changes. METHODS: The present study measured inhibitory control using a flanker task and a go-nogo continuous performance tasks in daily dependent smokers, intermittent non-dependent smokers, and nonsmokers. Event-related potential (ERP) measures of were concurrently recorded to measure performance monitoring via Event-Related Negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) components during error trials for each task. RESULTS: In both tasks, behavioral and ERN measures did not differ between groups; however, amplitude of the Pe component was largest among intermittent smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, intermittent smokers differed from both daily smokers and nonsmokers on error processing, potentially revealing neuroprotective cognitive processes in nicotine dependence.

40|$|Objective. —To {{determine}} the number and protectiveness of local <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations</b> adopted before {{the implementation of a}} preemptive statewide smoking control bill. Method. —Review of local smoking control regulations from all 100 counties and 85 municipalities with populations greater than 5000 in North Carolina. Main Outcome Measures. —Adoption of local smoking control regulations before and during the 3 -month delay in enactment of the preemptive bill. Protectiveness of regulations was based on restrictions on smoking and requirements for separate ventilation systems at private work sites: none (smoking unrestricted); minimal (smoking restricted to designated areas); partial (smoking restricted to designated areas served by separate ventilation systems); and complete (smoking prohibited). Because some regulations would be phased in gradually over the next 5 years, we evaluated the requirements that will be in effect by January 1, 2000. Results. —Between July 15 and October 15, 1993, the number of local <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations</b> in North Carolina increased from 16 to 105. By the year 2000, 59 % of private employees still will not be guaranteed any protection from work site environmental tobacco smoke; 19 % will have minimal protection, 22 % will have partial protection, and none will have complete protection. Conclusions. —The 3 -month delay in preemption created an unnatural time frame for communities to organize, debate, and adopt smoking restrictions.

Methods: In a parallel assessment, customers of both cafes answered a questionnaire. Sales were compared and air pollutants were measured to confirm air quality differences. Results: The two customer groups (n = 177) differed only with regard to smoking status (p < 0. 01). The <b>smoking</b> <b>regulation</b> was the most often cited selection criterion (83 %). In the non-smoking café, 89 % indicated that they were usually annoyed by smoke in coffee houses, and 62 % would avoid or leave cafes for this reason.

40|$|Background: In 2014 {{the health}} {{promotion}} {{program aimed at}} managing personnel smoking was implemented in the Polish prison service (PS) {{in cooperation with the}} Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine (NIOM). It combined education of managers, encouraging them to implement good practices, with employees’ education. This paper describes the process of implementation and its effects in 159 units of PS, against the data on the management of smoking in medium and large companies in Poland gathered in 2010. Material and Methods: Situations concerning smoking management in PS units before and after a half-year program implementation were compared. Data were gathered using self-diagnosis questionnaires (initial and final assessments) collectively filled in by representatives of management and employees. Results: Due to the program implementation there was an increase in the percentage of PS units with known number of smoking employees (19 % vs. 61 %), consultions on formal <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations</b> with personnel (14 % vs. 57 %), minimal antismoking medical interventions (46 % vs. 59 %), and assessments of effects of antismoking activities (14 % vs. 55 %). There was also {{increase in the number of}} PS units with personnel totally obeying <b>smoking</b> <b>regulations</b> (28 % vs. 41 %) and decrease in those where such rules are not completely met (9 % vs. 7 %). In 3 / 4 PS units there was an increase in employees’ interest in quitting smoking and in 40 % of them employees smoke less at work. Almost every second unit has set up a health promotion team.

The above findings warrant the necessity for nurturing efforts to reduce smoking and increase the health professionals' awareness of their position as a role model to both patients and the society. </p...|$|E

Our results indicate that restricted availability, increased cigarette prices, cessation subsidies and regulations at restaurants, bars and cafés increase the expected probability of <b>smoking</b> cessation. <b>Regulations</b> at work places {{do not seem to}} have any effect. The results also show the significant role of limited self-control; smokers who have the intent to quit smoking are more likely to quit smoking if a stricter regulation is implemented. Further, smokers who have received advice from their children to quit smoking or who perceive the health risks as considerable, are more likely to expect to quit smoking.

40|$|Advertising by {{multinational}} corporations in Southeast Asia is generating a growing resistance to its perceived {{role in creating}} a "consumer culture " damaging to indigenous values systems. Critics of advertising in Southeast Asia argue that when multinational advertisers or their multinational advertising agencies move into this foreign setting, they bring a set of assumptions based on Western consumer culture, which may be inappropriate for developing Eastern nations. In addition to the concerns about the transfer of a consumer culture, consumer groups are concerned that advertisers are promoting products which are actually harmful to health, such as cigarette <b>smoking.</b> Government <b>regulation</b> is one solution to curb the possible deleterious effects of the consumer culture.
