50|$|The <b>stack</b> <b>damper</b> {{contained}} within {{works like a}} butterfly valve and regulates draft (pressure difference between air intake and air exit) in the furnace, which is what pulls the flue gas through the convection section. The <b>stack</b> <b>damper</b> also regulates the heat lost through the stack. As the damper closes, the amount of heat escaping the furnace through the stack decreases, but the pressure or draft in the furnace increases which poses risks to those working around it if there are air leakages in the furnace, the flames can then escape out of the firebox or even explode if the pressure is too great.|$|E

This result supports the suggestion that the faint emitters are to be identified with the host galaxies of DLAS at these redshifts. Comment: 3 pages, 1 eps figur...|$|R

40|$|Several {{network servers}} and routing and {{signalling}} protocols need {{a large number}} of events to be scheduled off timers. Some of these applications can withstand a bounded level of inaccuracy in when the timer is scheduled. In this paper we describe a novel mechanism called "scalable hierarchical coarse grained timers" which can handle the scheduling of {{a large number of}} events while incurring a minimum of cpu and memory overhead. The techniques presented here were implemented on a commercial IP routing system and are used by the routing <b>stack</b> to <b>damp</b> flapping BGP routes. The paper reflects our experiences in carrying out this implementation and the subsequent performance analysis...|$|R
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{influence of}} pancake vortices on {{motion of the}} Josephson vortex lattice in layered high-temperature superconductors. Mobility of the Josephson vortices in layered superconductors is strongly suppressed by small amount of pancake-vortex stacks. Moving Josephson vortex lattice forces oscillating zigzag deformation of the pancake-vortex <b>stacks</b> contributing to <b>damping.</b> The salient feature of this contribution is its nonmonotonic dependence on the lattice velocity and the corresponding voltage. Maximum pancake effect is realized when the Josephson frequency matches the relaxation frequency of the <b>stacks.</b> The pancake-vortex <b>damping</b> is strongly suppressed by thermal fluctuations of the pancake vortices. This theoretical picture was qualitatively confirmed by experiments on two mesas prepared out of Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_{ 8 +d} whiskers. We found that the Josephson-vortex flux-flow voltage is very sensitive to small c-axis magnetic field. The pancake-vortex contribution to the current indeed nonmonotonically depends on voltage and decreases with increasing temperature and in-plane magnetic field. We also found that irradiation with heavy ions has no noticeable direct influence on motion of the Josephson vortices but dramatically reduces the pancake-vortex contribution to the damping of the Josephson vortex lattice at low temperatures.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} the complete optimization of a hybrid elastomer/composite sandwich plate structure: design variables consist {{in the total}} number of layers of the structure, their respective thicknesses, their fiber orientations, the position(s) of the viscoelastic core(s) and the <b>stacking</b> sentence. The <b>damping</b> of the hybrid structure is calculated by the Method of Strain Energy. The constrained optimization maximizes the damping loss factor using the linear search algorithm. As an example, the method is applied to a simple structure and the results demonstrate the capabilities of our tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” The {{speed and}} {{accuracy}} of nanopositioning systems is heavily influenced {{by the presence of}} lightly damped mechanical resonances. In this work, an electrical impedance is connected in series with the driving piezoelectric <b>stack</b> actuator to <b>damp</b> the first mechanical resonance. The electrical shunt is shown to act equivalently to an output feedback controller except that no sensor is required. A simple inductor-resistor shunt circuit is demonstrated to damp the first mechanical resonance of a high-speed nanopositioner by 19. 6 dB. The technique of shunt damping is low-cost, simple, guaranteed to be stable, and significantly improves the system response. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the mathematical modeling and finite element (FE) solution of general anisotropic shells with hybrid active-passive damping treatments. A fully-coupled piezo-visco-elastic mathematical {{model of the}} shell (host structure) and segmented arbitrarily <b>stacked</b> layers of <b>damping</b> treatments is considered. A discrete layer approach is employed in this work, and the weak form of the governing equations is derived for a single generic layer of the multilayer shell using Hamilton's principle and a mixed (displacement/stresses) definition of the displacement field. First, a fully refined deformation theory of the generic layer, based on postulated out-of-plane shear stress definitions and in the in-plane stresses obtained with a Reissner-Mindlin type shell theory, is outlined. A semi-inverse procedure is used to derive the layer mixed non-linear displacement field, {{in terms of a}} blend of the generalized displacements of the Love-Kirchhoff and Reissner-Mindlin theories and of the stress components at the generic layer interfaces. No assumptions regarding the thinness of the shell are considered. Regarding the definition of the electric potential, the direct piezoelectric effects are condensed into the model through effective stiffness and strains definitions, and the converse counterpart is considered by the action of prescribed electric potential differences in each piezoelectric layer. Then, the weak forms of a partially refined theory, where only the zero-order term of the non-linear fully refined transverse displacement is retained, are derived for an orthotropic doubly-curved piezo-elastic generic shell layer. Based on the weak forms a FE solution is initially developed for the single layer. The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the resultant four-noded generic piezo-elastic single layer FE are then "regenerated" into an equivalent eight-node 3 -D formulation in order to allow through-the-thickness assemblage of displacements and stresses, yielding a partially refined multilayer FE assuring displacement and shear stress interlayer continuity and homogeneous shear stress conditions at the outer surfaces. The shear stresses DoFs are dynamically condensed and the FE is reduced to a displacement-based form. The viscoelastic damping behavior is considered at the global FE model level by means of a Laplace transformed ADF model. The active control of vibration is shortly discussed and a set of indices to quantify the damping performance and the individual contributions of the different mechanisms are proposed...|$|R
