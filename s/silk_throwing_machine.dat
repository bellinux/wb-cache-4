5000|$|Lombe's Mill, in Derby was {{the first}} {{successful}} powered <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> mill in England. John Lombe visited a successful <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> mill in Piedmont in 1717, and returned to England with details of the Italian <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> machines- the filatoio, and the torcitoio, and with some Italian craftsmen built replicas. [...] This was an early example of industrial espionage. The architect George Sorocold built it next to Thomas Cotchett's failed 1704 mill (which used copies of Dutch <b>throwing</b> <b>machines)</b> {{on the west bank}} of the River Derwent. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe, born 1685, instructed George Sorocold to build a mill for the Italian-style machines. To the north of the powered Italian Works an un-powered Doubling Shop was built at some time before 1739, and when this mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson an inventory taken which still exists today. Thomas Lombe was given a 14-year patent to protect the design of the <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> he used. The King of Sardinia responded to this challenge badly, and stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombe's mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe, took over the business.|$|R

Nevertheless, in 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> enterprise at Logwood mill in Stockport, and in 1744, The Button Mill was erected in Macclesfield and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton.

50|$|Silk is a {{naturally}} produced fibre obtained from {{many species of}} the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth (Bombyx mori), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5-10 μm wide. The silk is a protein, fibroin, that was cemented {{in place by the}} use of gum, another protein, sericin. The cocoons were harvested and placed in troughs of hot water to dissolve the gum and allowed the single thread to be wound into a skein. The skeins were placed into bales and taken to the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn could be produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist making it easier to handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. Reeling is the industrial process where silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. <b>Silk</b> <b>throwing</b> is the process where the thread from the bobbins is twisted again to form tram and or organzine. The yarn is twisted together into threads, in a process known as doubling. Colloquially <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling.|$|R

Congleton had an early <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> mill, the Old Mill built by John Clayton and Nathaniel Pattison in 1753. More mills followed, and cotton was also spun. The town's prosperity depended on tariffs imposed on imported silk. When tariffs were removed in the 1860s, the empty mills were converted to fustian cutting. A limited silk ribbon weaving industry survived into the 20th century, and woven labels were still produced in the 1990s. Many mills survive as industrial or residential units.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a method to measure the {{performance}} of ancient <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> powered by torsional motors.

Since the ratio between the dimensions of the main parts of the ancient <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> was constant (they were designed on a modulus), once the size of one part of the machine (e. g. a remain) was known, the performance of the whole machine could be predicted. Finally, calculation examples are presented for a ballista designed according to Vitruvius' reports and for a repeating catapult; the results obtained showthat those “ancient artillery devices” thrust the projectile with considerable energy...|$|R

Three sorts of yarn were {{commonly}} produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist {{making it easier to}} handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. [...] Reeling is the process where the silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. <b>Silk</b> <b>throwing</b> is the process where the filament from the bobbins is given its full twist. The process where filaments or threads from three or more bobbins are wound together is called doubling.The last two processes can occur more than once and in any order. Tram was wound, thrown and doubled, organzine was wound, doubled then thrown and doubled again. Sewing silk could receive further doubling and throwing. No-twist was often three single filaments doubled together. Many other combinations were possible. Colloquially <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling, and silk throwsters would speak of throwing as twisting or spinning. <b>Silk</b> <b>throwing</b> was originally a hand process relying on a turning a wheel (the gate) that twisted four threads while a helper who would be a child, ran the length of a shade, hooked the threads on stationary pins (the cross) and ran back to start the process again. The shade would be a between 23 and 32m long. The process was described in detail to Lord Shaftesbury's Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Employment of Children in 1841:For twisting it is necessary to have what are designated shades which are buildings of at least 30 or 35 yards in length, of two or more rooms, rented separately by one,two or four men having one gate and a boy called a helper... the upper storey is generally occupied by children, young persons or grown women as 'piecers', 'winders' and 'doublers' attending to their reels and bobbins, driven by the exertions of one man... He (the boy) takes first a rod containing four bobbins of silk from the twister who stands at his gate or wheel, and having fastened the ends, runs to the 'cross' at the extreme end of the room, round which he passes the threads of each bobbin and returns to the 'gate'. He is despatched on a second expedition of the same kind, and returns as before, he then runs up to the cross and detaches the threads and comes to the roller. Supposing the master to make twelve rolls a day, the boy necessarily runs fourteen miles, and this is barefooted.|$|R
