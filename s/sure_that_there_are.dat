25|$|Oh I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> Hamas {{members on}} the UNRWA payroll and I don't {{see that as a}} crime. Hamas as a {{political}} organization does not mean that every member is a militant and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, three safety {{regulation}} groups, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety and the National Tripartite Action Plan, agreed {{to look into}} adopting a new unified set of workplace safety standards for clothing manufacturing factories. The new standards would call for increased training of factory inspectors. The inspections would {{be carried out by}} two different inspectors with their experience in the field each being a minimum of five years and combining for a minimum total of 20 years. They would also regulate the spacing of exits making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> ways to escape the building from multiple sides and the amount of machinery on each floor will have a cap allowing easy access to each exit.|$|E

I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> cases of multiple card distribution that we don't know about. But those incidents that we do know about caused us enough concern to contact the Independent Election Commission and say, 'please prevent this!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{frequency}} test, {{was very}} basic: checking to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{roughly the same}} number of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-evening," [...] said Mr. Tillotson, pausing at {{the doorway}} and peering through the gloom to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nobody else present. [...] "All alone?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In June 2011 Maj. General Orna Barbivai {{became the}} first female major general in the IDF, {{replacing}} head of the directorate Maj. General Avi Zamir. Barbivai stated, [...] "I am proud {{to be the first}} woman to become a major general and to be part of an organization in which equality is a central principle. Ninety percent of jobs in the IDF are open to women and I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other women who will continue to break down barriers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because in some {{of these}} caverns {{alligators}} are found, and it is never safe to drink from the running water without first making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no saurian guards about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monotonous indeed, I should imagine," [...] she agreed. [...] "You {{spend your}} time reading other people's letters, do you not, {{just to be}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no {{communications}} from the enemy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be afraid, doctor; I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no one here to whom you would venture {{to give us a}} bad character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] asked Phil Jones, as {{he stood}} by, {{watching}} me turn my pockets inside out to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no mistake.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{let us do}} that, {{on the top of}} the wall. We can see the Makalanga from there, and it will be {{a comfort}} to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other human beings left in the world besides {{ourselves}} and Jacob Meyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we can't do that," [...] said he; [...] "but {{we ought}} to do something. I've been around looking at them all carefully, and I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> at least forty men among those Indians who haven't done a thing to warrant {{shutting}} them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, madame, {{will you}} please take your place in the boat with me? I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> boats coming along. Of course the oars are muffled, and there is enough sea on to prevent us hearing the splash. I think the noise I heard was caused {{by one of the}} {{stretchers}} giving way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the story}} which Sir Walter Scott relates," [...] said the guide; [...] "but I <b>am</b> not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any {{historical}} authority for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will have}} a chat with him, one of these days. And you <b>are</b> all quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{possible}} path up, from below?" ...|$|R
60|$|At last, <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no one in}} there, he crept in. Then he made a discovery. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> beech nuts in <b>there</b> and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> seeds.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is to say, Dias, no spirits {{were ever}} seen there afterwards, {{and we may}} be very certain that no spirits were ever seen there before, though cowardly people might have fancied they saw them. However, to-morrow we shall get inside, and Bertie and I will stop there all night, and if we neither see nor hear {{anything}} of them you may be quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> none there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jenny, [...] "I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{hundreds}} {{who have been}} buying foreign goods who would not do it if they could see any connection between their not doing it and the salvation of the country; but when I go to buy a pair of gloves, I naturally want the best pair I can find, the pair that will last the longest and look the best, and these always happen to be French gloves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your pretty daughter,' she said, 'starts {{to think}} of such things. Yet,' looking full upon her, 'you may be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> men and women already on their road, who have their {{business}} to do with YOU, and who will do it. Of a certainty they will do it. They may be coming hundreds, thousands, of miles over the sea there; they may be close at hand now; they may be coming, for anything you know or {{anything you can do}} to prevent it, from the vilest sweepings of this very town.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, sir,' said Tom. 'I am {{not at all}} {{disposed}} to deny it. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something radically wrong; radically monstrous, in that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Eleanor; [...] "I {{have not}} read {{any of the}} books, but I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one man in the moon at least, if not more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --If {{you mean}} speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no such thing}} as free {{thinking}} inasmuch as all thinking must be bound by its own laws.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep on {{your hands}} and knees," [...] Hector whispered, [...] "and feel the ground as you go to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no broken {{branches}} that would crack if you placed your knee upon them. We may come upon the Spaniards at any moment. Keep close to me. Touch me if you hear the slightest sound, and I will do the same to you. The touch will mean stop. Move your sword along the belt till the handle is round at your back; in that way there will be no risk of it striking a tree or catching in a projecting root." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the best}} I can wish {{you is that}} the day may come when you would gladly give ten times the sum to have them back again. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> great {{possibilities}} in you, and I see that in grouping and in boldness of design you have already achieved much. But your drawing, if you will excuse my saying so, {{is just a little}} crude, and your colouring perhaps a trifle thin. Now, I will make a bargain with you, Mr. McIntyre, if you will consent to it. I know that money has no charms for you, but still, as you said when I first met you, a man must live. I shall buy these two canvases from you at the price which you name, subject to the condition that you may always have them back again by repaying the same sum." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have heard}} {{that there is a}} place under the knee which, when struck, should produce a sort of jump; and that if you do not jump, you are mad. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some such places in the soul. When the human spirit does not jump with joy at either of those two old jokes, the human spirit must be struck with incurable paralysis. There is hope for people who have gone down into the hells of greed and {{economic}} oppression (at least, I hope there is, for we are such a people ourselves), but there is no hope for a people that does not exult in the abstract idea of the peasant scoring off the prince. There is hope for the idle and the adulterous, for the men that desert their wives and the men that beat their wives. But there is no hope for men who do not boast that their wives bully them.|$|E
60|$|The detective {{did look}} round, and pretty thoroughly. As {{soon as he}} <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no one {{concealed}} upon the premises, he drank his whisky and soda and went.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] she answered, [...] "but I mean to earn {{some of it}} all the same, and I want to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{enough for}} all of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is most extraordinary," [...] {{she said}} at last. [...] "What can it mean? You <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no mistake, captain? It was to Dr. Maddison's house she went." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, señor. I fancy {{there are}} only eight of them now. You and your brother could hardly miss marks like their heads at thirty paces." [...] "If I were quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no more of them I should say that, {{as soon as it}} becomes dark, we had better creep forward and fight them. It would be better to do that than wait for them to attack us. But there may be, and very likely are, more of these bands among the hills. Besides, Dias, we don't want to lose one of our number, and we could hardly hope to get through unscathed, for if we were to try to push on they would have us at a {{tremendous}} advantage. They would hide among the rocks and shoot us down before we had time to level a gun at them. Now that we have killed one, if not two of their number, they will certainly try to get their revenge, and will harass us {{all the way up the}} pass." ...|$|E
60|$|This much {{may be said}} conjecturally {{over the}} present signature; but more must not be said. Bernard Shaw understands music {{so much better than}} I do that it is just {{possible}} that he is, in that tongue and atmosphere, all that he is not elsewhere. While he is writing with a pen I know his limitations as much as I admire his genius; and I know it is true to say that he does not appreciate romance. But while he is playing on the piano he may be cocking a feather, drawing a sword or draining a flagon for all I know. While he is speaking I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some things he does not understand. But while he is listening (at the Queen's Hall) he may understand everything, including God and me. Upon this part of him I am a reverent agnostic; it is well to have some such dark continent in the character of a man of whom one writes. It preserves two very important things--modesty in the biographer and mystery in the biography.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{suffer and}} cannot {{understand}} why, my dear boy. Nor do I, but [...] it is truth that {{all who are}} worth anything {{are called upon to}} [...] suffer, to what end we do not know. Nothing of value is gained [...] except by suffering.

This wretched [...] woman is right in a way when she refers all solutions to another [...] world, only her other world is one that is bad, and her [...] solutions are very base.

[...] Meanwhile, do not be frightened by her threats, for even if they [...] should all be true, to those evils which she prophesies there is, [...] be sure, another interpretation.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, with {{a glance}} at the door to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no {{witnesses}} to an act of which the aristocrat in him disapproved, [...] "go on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Purely {{negative}} as yet," [...] {{my friend}} answered. [...] "I have inquired at every {{point where it}} might be, and I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no danger to be apprehended." ...|$|R
