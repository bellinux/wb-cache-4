60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> with apprehension. His manner was so mysterious.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered,</b> looked {{overside}} at the water, {{and made}} a move.|$|E
60|$|She saw his face, beautiful, {{non-human}} in the moonlight, and <b>she</b> <b>shuddered</b> slightly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shudders.</b> <b>She</b> remembers Richard Wardour {{again at}} those words.|$|R
6000|$|RICHARD (whimsically). At noon, punctually. At least, {{that was}} when they {{disposed}} of Uncle Peter. (<b>She</b> <b>shudders.)</b> Is your husband safe? Is he on the wing? ...|$|R
6000|$|Though {{heaviness}} {{endure the}} night, [...] Yet joy shall come with break of day: [...] <b>She</b> <b>shudders</b> {{with a strange}} delight-- [...] The fearful dream is pass'd away.|$|R
60|$|He paused there, and {{his face}} grew dark with remembered despair, and <b>she</b> <b>shuddered.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> all over, {{and almost}} bounded; then {{put her hand}} tenderly on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She saw in {{her mind}} the {{white-hot}} iron approaching those glorious eyes, and <b>she</b> <b>shuddered</b> at the thought.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. A misunderstanding; just a mistake. (<b>She</b> <b>shudders,</b> {{lifts the}} wedding-gown {{and puts it}} back in the ottoman. MISS SUSAN sinks sobbing into a chair.) Don't, dear, don't--we can live it down.|$|R
60|$|Mrs George throws {{down the}} poker; collapses {{into the nearest}} chair; and bursts into tears. The Bishop goes to her and pats her consolingly on the shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>shudders</b> all through at his touch.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>shudders</b> {{and stops}} as the charm she speaks;-- [...] Is it the moody owl that shrieks? [...] Or {{is it that}} sound, betwixt {{laughter}} and scream, [...] The voice of the Demon who haunts the stream? ...|$|R
60|$|Emily {{found the}} wine {{and gave it to}} her. <b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> as she accidentally touched Mrs. Rook's hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> at the {{gathering}} strength in his tone, and the fierce light which had swept into his face.|$|E
60|$|Whatever happens: <b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> at the words, {{reminding}} {{her as they}} did of all her vague misgivings and fears.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (startled, {{turns and}} stares at them with frightened eyes. After a pause she ventures uncertainly, {{as if she were}} not sure hut what these figures might be creatures of her dream). Father. (Her eyes shift to Mrs. Brennan's face and <b>she</b> <b>shudders.)</b> Mrs. Brennan.|$|R
60|$|Again, {{from the}} {{interior}} of the cave came the hideous laughter that was not laughter. This time Momaya recognized it for what it was, the strange cry of a hyena. No more did <b>she</b> <b>shudder,</b> but <b>she</b> held her spear ready and called aloud to Bukawai to come out.|$|R
50|$|As James {{embraces the}} sylph passionately, her wings fall off, <b>she</b> <b>shudders,</b> and dies in James' arms. Sorrowfully, her sisters enter and lift her lifeless form. Suddenly, a joyful wedding {{procession}} led by Effie and Gurn crosses the glade. James is stunned. James directs his gaze heavenward; {{he sees the}} sylph borne aloft by her sisters. James collapses. Madge exults over his lifeless body. Justice has triumphed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered.</b> Then {{she rose}} to her feet, {{straight}} and splendid, with all the grace of her beautiful young womanhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{did they}} mean, mother?" [...] Tommy asked, but <b>she</b> <b>shuddered</b> and replied, evasively, [...] "Did Martha Scrymgeour say anything?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered,</b> and a sob escaped her. From my {{identity}} her mind fled {{back to the}} more important matter of my fate.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (coming {{behind the}} couch). Tell me this. Suppose {{you could have}} got that letter by coming to me over the bridge at Lodi the day before yesterday! Suppose {{there had been no}} other way, and that this was a sure way--if only you escaped the cannon! (<b>She</b> <b>shudders</b> and covers her eyes for a moment with her hands.) Would you have been afraid? ...|$|R
60|$|Possessed {{by a kind}} of desperation, {{she adds}} in the next breath, that she will come to Mr. Jasper in the garden. <b>She</b> <b>shudders</b> at the thought of being shut up with him in the house; but many of its windows command the garden, and she can be seen as well as heard there, and can shriek in the free air and run away. Such is the wild idea that flutters through her mind.|$|R
6000|$|I did not speak--I saw her face, [...] In truth it {{was enough}} for me; [...] I turned about and heard her cry, [...] "O misery! O misery!" [...] And there she sits, until the moon [...] Through half the clear blue sky will go, [...] And when the little breezes make [...] The waters of the pond to shake, [...] As all the country know [...] <b>She</b> <b>shudders,</b> and you hear her cry, [...] "Oh misery! oh misery!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> as I {{pronounced}} the name, then, looking me straight between the eyes--"How come {{you to know}} these things?" [...] she inquired.|$|E
60|$|Dabster got {{her to the}} elevator, {{and inside}} of it. She was wild-eyed, and <b>she</b> <b>shuddered</b> when the express made its {{debilitating}} drop.|$|E
60|$|Grisell {{could well}} believe it, but used to gentle nuns, <b>she</b> <b>shuddered</b> {{a little as}} she asked what they were to do next.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I tell you?" [...] he said. [...] "Isn't she fun?--Persons of the Drama." [...] he resumed: [...] "three in number. Women only. Angelica, a noble lady; noble {{alike in}} spirit and in birth. Cunegonda, a {{beautiful}} devil in woman's form. Damoride, her unfortunate maid. First scene: a dark vaulted chamber in a castle. Time, evening. The owls are hooting in the wood; the frogs are croaking in the marsh.--Look at Ariel! Her flesh creeps; <b>she</b> <b>shudders</b> audibly. Admirable Ariel!" ...|$|R
60|$|Her enemy he was, {{and she has}} often, often, often wished him dead. Her enemy he is, even in his grave. This dreadful {{accusation}} comes {{upon her}} like a new torment at his lifeless hand. And when she recalls how she was secretly at his door that night, and how she may be represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before merely to release herself from observation, <b>she</b> <b>shudders</b> as if the hangman's hands were at her neck.|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. It {{but made}} me the more complacent that never {{in her life}} had Miss Phoebe been guilty of the {{slightest}} deviation from the strictest propriety. (<b>She</b> <b>shudders.)</b> I was always conceiving her in your place. Oh, it was monstrous unfair to you. I stood looking at you, Miss Livvy, and seeing in my mind her and the pretty things she did, and you did not do; why, ma'am, that is how I {{fell in love with}} Miss Phoebe at the balls.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm not,' she protested. 'I'm {{not afraid}} of other things. But black-beetles--ugh!' <b>she</b> <b>shuddered</b> convulsively, as if the very thought were too much to bear.|$|E
60|$|The tone of half-raillery did not, however, cheer Mrs. Tucker. <b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> {{slightly}} and cast her eyes over the monotonous sea of tule and meadow.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shuddered</b> ever so slightly. Then she {{stretched}} {{out a long}} white arm, and drawing his head suddenly down to her, {{kissed him on the}} lips.|$|E
6000|$|XVIII [...] "I did not speak--I saw her face; [...] Her face!--it was [23] {{enough for}} me: [...] 190 [...] I turned about and heard her cry, [...] 'Oh misery! oh misery!' [...] And there she sits, until the moon [...] Through half the clear blue sky will go; [...] And, {{when the little}} breezes make [...] 195 [...] The waters of the pond to shake, [...] As all the country know, [...] <b>She</b> <b>shudders,</b> and you hear her cry, [...] 'Oh misery! oh misery!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, never," [...] <b>she</b> cried, <b>shuddering</b> at his quiet way {{of saying}} it. [...] "You are flesh and blood, christened, and with the hope set before you." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last {{he began}} to exult, to boast, to call {{attention}} to the beauty of the lines spoken by Enid. [...] "See how her simplicity and virginal charm are enhanced by the rugged, remorseless strength, and by the conscienceless greed of the men surrounding her, and yet she sees in them something admirable. They are like soldiers to her. They are the heroes who tunnel mountains and bridge cataracts. When she looks from her slender, white hands to their gross and powerful bodies <b>she</b> <b>shudders</b> with a sort of fearsome admiration." ...|$|R
