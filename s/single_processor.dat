5|$|Thirty-two such modules {{were then}} stacked and wired {{together}} with a mass of twisted-pair wires into a <b>single</b> <b>processor.</b> The basic cycle time was 2.11ns, or 474MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP. Key to the high performance was the high-speed access to main memory, which allowed each process to burst up to 8 GB/s.|$|E
25|$|Distribution sort {{refers to}} any sorting {{algorithm}} where data are distributed from their input to multiple intermediate structures {{which are then}} gathered and placed on the output. For example, both bucket sort and flashsort are distribution based sorting algorithms. Distribution sorting algorithms {{can be used on}} a <b>single</b> <b>processor,</b> or they can be a distributed algorithm, where individual subsets are separately sorted on different processors, then combined. This allows external sorting of data too large to fit into a single computer's memory.|$|E
25|$|Code {{optimization}} can be also broadly {{categorized as}} platform-dependent and platform-independent techniques. While the latter ones are effective on {{most or all}} platforms, platform-dependent techniques use specific properties of one platform, or rely on parameters depending on the single platform or even on the <b>single</b> <b>processor.</b> Writing or producing {{different versions of the}} same code for different processors might therefore be needed. For instance, in the case of compile-level optimization, platform-independent techniques are generic techniques (such as loop unrolling, reduction in function calls, memory efficient routines, reduction in conditions, etc.), that impact most CPU architectures in a similar way. Generally, these serve to reduce the total instruction path length required to complete the program and/or reduce total memory usage during the process. On the other hand, platform-dependent techniques involve instruction scheduling, instruction-level parallelism, data-level parallelism, cache optimization techniques (i.e., parameters that differ among various platforms) and the optimal instruction scheduling might be different even on different processors of the same architecture.|$|E
