60|$|We {{know that}} self-fertilised {{seedlings}} are inferior {{in many respects}} to those from a cross; and as with plants {{in a state of}} nature pollen from the same flower can hardly fail to be often left by insects or by the wind on the stigma, it seems at first sight highly probable that <b>self-sterility</b> has been gradually acquired through natural selection in order to prevent self-fertilisation. It is no valid objection to this belief that the structure of some flowers, and the dichogamous condition of many others, suffice to prevent the pollen reaching the stigma of the same flower; for we should remember that with most species many flowers expand at the same time, and that pollen from the same plant is equally injurious or nearly so as that from the same flower. Nevertheless, the belief that <b>self-sterility</b> is a quality which has been gradually acquired for the special purpose of preventing self-fertilisation must, I believe, be rejected. In the first place, there is no close correspondence in degree between the sterility of the parent-plants when self-fertilised, {{and the extent to which}} their offspring suffer in vigour by this process; and some such correspondence might have been expected if <b>self-sterility</b> had been acquired on account of the injury caused by self-fertilisation. The fact of individuals of the same parentage differing greatly in their degree of <b>self-sterility</b> is likewise opposed to such a belief; unless, indeed, we suppose that certain individuals have been rendered self-sterile to favour intercrossing, whilst other individuals have been rendered self-fertile to ensure the propagation of the species. The fact of self-sterile individuals appearing only occasionally, as in the case of Lobelia, does not countenance this latter view. But the strongest argument against the belief that <b>self-sterility</b> has been acquired to prevent self-fertilisation, is the immediate and powerful effect of changed conditions in either causing or in removing <b>self-sterility.</b> We are not therefore justified in admitting that this peculiar state of the reproductive system has been gradually acquired through natural selection; but we must look at it as an incidental result, dependent on the conditions to which the plants have been subjected, like the ordinary sterility caused in the case of animals by confinement, and in the case of plants by too much manure, heat, etc. I do not, however, wish to maintain that <b>self-sterility</b> may not sometimes be of service to a plant in preventing self-fertilisation; but there are so many other means by which this result might be prevented or rendered difficult, including as we shall see in the next chapter the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over a plant's own pollen, that <b>self-sterility</b> seems an almost superfluous acquirement for this purpose.|$|E

6000|$|In {{considering}} the several cases above given of complete or almost complete <b>self-sterility,</b> we are first struck with their wide distribution throughout the vegetable kingdom.

As in the course of my experiments I have found three new cases, and as Fritz Muller has observed indications of several others, it is probable that they will hereafter be proved to be far from rare. (9/13. Mr. Wilder, the editor of a horticultural journal in the United States quoted in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1868 page 1286, states that Lilium auratum, Impatiens pallida and fulva, and Forsythia viridissima, cannot be fertilised with their own pollen.) ...|$|E
60|$|Fertility {{of plants}} of crossed and self-fertilised parentage, both lots being fertilised {{in the same}} manner.

6000|$|The facts now to {{be given}} differ from the foregoing, as <b>self-sterility</b> is not here the result of long-continued close interbreeding. These facts are, however, {{connected}} with our present subject, because a cross with a distinct individual is shown to be either necessary or advantageous. Dimorphic and trimorphic plants, though they are hermaphrodites, must be reciprocally crossed, one set of forms by the other, {{in order to be}} fully fertile, and in some cases to be fertile in any degree. But I should not have noticed these plants, {{had it not been for}} the following cases given by Dr. Hildebrand (17/66. 'Botanische Zeitung' January 1864 s. 3.):-- ...|$|E
60|$|As {{with plants}} {{of the same}} species and parentage, some {{individuals}} are self-sterile and others self-fertile, of which fact Reseda odorata offers the most striking instances, {{it is not at all}} surprising that species of the same genus differ in this same manner. Thus Verbascum phoeniceum and nigrum are self-sterile, whilst V. thapsus and lychnitis are quite self-fertile, as I know by trial. There is the same difference between some of the species of Papaver, Corydalis, and of other genera. Nevertheless, the tendency to <b>self-sterility</b> certainly runs to a certain extent in groups, as we see in the genus Passiflora, and with the Vandeae amongst Orchids.|$|E
60|$|That plants {{should be}} self-sterile, {{although}} both sexual elements {{are in a}} fit state for reproduction, appears at first sight opposed to all analogy. With respect to the species, all the individuals {{of which are in}} this state, although living under their natural conditions, we may conclude that their <b>self-sterility</b> has been acquired for the sake of effectually preventing self- fertilisation. The case is closely analogous with that of dimorphic and trimorphic or heterostyled plants, which can be fully fertilised only by plants belonging to a different form, and not, as in the foregoing cases, indifferently by any other individual of the species. Some of these hetero- styled plants are completely sterile with pollen taken from the same plant or from the same form. With respect to species living under their natural conditions, of which only certain individuals are self-sterile (as with Reseda lutea), it is probable that these have been rendered self-sterile to ensure occasional cross-fertilisation, whilst other individuals have remained self- fertile to ensure the propagation of the species. The case seems to be parallel with that of plants which produce, as Hermann Muller has discovered, two forms--one bearing more conspicuous flowers with their structure adapted for cross-fertilisation by insects, and the other form with less conspicuous flowers adapted for self-fertilisation. The <b>self-sterility,</b> however, of some of the foregoing plants is incidental on the conditions to which they have been subjected, as with the Eschscholtzia, the Verbascum phoeniceum (the sterility of which varied according to the season), and with the Passiflora alata, which recovered its self-fertility when grafted on a different stock.|$|E
60|$|It is {{interesting}} to observe in the above several cases the graduated series from plants which, when fertilised by their own pollen, yield the full number of seeds, but with the seedlings a little dwarfed in stature--to plants which when self-fertilised yield few seeds--to those which yield none, but have their ovaria somewhat developed--and, lastly, to those in which the plant's own pollen and stigma mutually act on one another like poison. It is also interesting to observe on how slight {{a difference in the}} nature of the pollen or of the ovules complete <b>self-sterility</b> or complete self-fertility must depend in some of the above cases. Every individual of the self-sterile species appears to be capable of producing the full complement of seed when fertilised by the pollen of any other individual (though judging from the facts given with respect to Abutilon the nearest kin must be excepted); but not one individual can be fertilised by its own pollen. As every organism differs in some slight degree from every other individual of the same species, so no doubt it is with their pollen and ovules; and in the above cases we must believe that complete <b>self-sterility</b> and complete self-fertility depend on such slight differences in the ovules and pollen, and not their having been differentiated in some special manner in relation to one another; for it is impossible that the sexual elements of many thousand individuals should have been specialised in relation to every other individual. In some, however, of the above cases, as with certain Passifloras, an amount of differentiation between the pollen and ovules sufficient for fertilisation is gained only by employing pollen from a distinct species; but this is probably the result of such plants having been rendered somewhat sterile from the unnatural conditions to which they have been exposed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Self-sterility</b> differs much {{in degree}} in {{different}} plants. In those extraordinary {{cases in which}} pollen from the same flower acts on the stigma like a poison, it is almost certain that the plants would never yield a single self-fertilised seed. Other plants, like Corydalis cava, occasionally, though very rarely, produce a few self-fertilised seeds. A large number of species, as {{may be seen in}} Table 9/F, are less fertile with their own pollen than with that from another plant; and lastly, some species are perfectly self-fertile. Even with the individuals of the same species, as just remarked, some are utterly self-sterile, others moderately so, and some perfectly self-fertile. The cause, whatever it may be, which renders many plants more or less sterile with their own pollen, that is, when they are self-fertilised, must be different, at least to a certain extent, from that which determines the difference in height, vigour, and fertility of the seedlings raised from self-fertilised and crossed seeds; for we have already seen that the two classes of cases do not by any means run parallel. This want of parallelism would be intelligible, if it could be shown that <b>self-sterility</b> depended solely on the incapacity of the pollen-tubes to penetrate the stigma of the same flower deeply enough to reach the ovules; whilst the greater or less vigorous growth of the seedlings no doubt depends {{on the nature of the}} contents of the pollen-grains and ovules. Now it is certain that with some plants the stigmatic secretion does not properly excite the pollen-grains, so that the tubes are not properly developed, if the pollen is taken from the same flower. This is the case according to Fritz Muller with Eschscholtzia, for he found that the pollen-tubes did not penetrate the stigma deeply; and with the Orchidaceous genus Notylia they failed altogether to penetrate it. (9/14. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1868 pages 114, 115.) ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{these four}} methods are all {{apparently}} very simple, and easily produced by variation and selection. They are applicable to flowers of any shape, requiring only such size and colour as to attract insects, and some secretion of nectar {{to ensure their}} repeated visits, characters common to {{the great majority of}} flowers. All these methods are common, except perhaps the second; but there are many flowers in which the pollen from another plant is prepotent over the pollen from fertilisation, the same flower, and this has nearly the same effect as <b>self-sterility</b> if the flowers are frequently crossed by insects. We cannot help asking, therefore, why have other and much more elaborate methods been needed? And how have the more complex arrangements of so many flowers been brought about? Before attempting to answer these questions, and in order that the reader may appreciate the difficulty of the problem {{and the nature of the}} facts to be explained, it will be necessary to give a summary of the more elaborate modes of securing cross-fertilisation.|$|E
60|$|If we {{now turn}} to the more {{immediate}} cause of <b>self-sterility,</b> we clearly see that in most cases it {{is determined by the}} conditions to which the plants have been subjected. Thus Eschscholtzia is completely self-sterile in the hot climate of Brazil, but is perfectly fertile there with the pollen of any other individual. The offspring of Brazilian plants became in England in a single generation partially self-fertile, and still more so in the second generation. Conversely, the offspring of English plants, after growing for two seasons in Brazil, became in the first generation quite self-sterile. Again, Abutilon darwinii, which is self-sterile in its native home of Brazil, became moderately self-fertile in a single generation in an English hothouse. Some other plants are self-sterile during {{the early part of the}} year, and later in the season become self-fertile. Passiflora alata lost its <b>self-sterility</b> when grafted on another species. With Reseda, however, in which some individuals of the same parentage are self-sterile and others are self-fertile, we are forced in our ignorance to speak of the cause as due to spontaneous variability; but we should remember that the progenitors of these plants, either on the male or female side, may have been exposed to somewhat different conditions. The power of the environment thus to affect so readily and in so peculiar a manner the reproductive organs, is a fact which has many important bearings; and I have therefore thought the foregoing details worth giving. For instance, the sterility of many animals and plants under changed conditions of life, such as confinement, evidently comes within the same general principle of the sexual system being easily affected by the environment. It has already been proved, that a cross between plants which have been self-fertilised or intercrossed during several generations, having been kept all the time under closely similar conditions, does not benefit the offspring; and on the other hand, that a cross between plants that have been subjected to different conditions benefits the offspring to an extraordinary degree. We may therefore conclude that some degree of differentiation in the sexual system is necessary for the full fertility of the parent-plants and for the full vigour of their offspring. It seems also probable that with those plants which are capable of complete self-fertilisation, the male and female elements and organs already differ to an extent sufficient to excite their mutual interaction; but that when such plants are taken to another country, and become in consequence self-sterile, their sexual elements and organs are so acted on as to be rendered too uniform for such interaction, like those of a self-fertilised plant long cultivated under the same conditions. Conversely, we may further infer that plants which are self-sterile in their native country, but become self-fertile under changed conditions, have their sexual elements so acted on, that they become sufficiently differentiated for mutual interaction.|$|E
60|$|Firstly, in {{the third}} and fourth generations of Mimulus luteus, a tall variety, often alluded to, having large white flowers blotched with crimson, {{appeared}} amongst both the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants. It prevailed in all the later self-fertilised generations to the exclusion of every other variety, and transmitted its characters faithfully, but disappeared from the intercrossed plants, owing no doubt to their characters being repeatedly blended by crossing. The self-fertilised plants belonging to this variety were not only taller, but more fertile than the intercrossed plants; though these latter in the earlier generations were much taller and more fertile than the self-fertilised plants. Thus in the fifth generation the self-fertilised plants were to the intercrossed in height as 126 to 100. In the sixth generation they were likewise much taller and finer plants, but were not actually measured; they produced capsules compared with those on the intercrossed plants, in number, as 147 to 100; and the self-fertilised capsules contained a greater number of seeds. In the seventh generation the self-fertilised plants were to the crossed in height as 137 to 100; and twenty flowers on these self-fertilised plants fertilised with their own pollen yielded nineteen very fine capsules,--a degree of <b>self-sterility</b> which I have not seen equalled in any other case. This variety seems to have become specially adapted to profit in every way by self-fertilisation, although this process was so injurious to the parent-plants during the first four generations. It should however be remembered that seedlings raised from this variety, when crossed by a fresh stock, were wonderfully superior in height and fertility to the self-fertilised plants of the corresponding generation.|$|E
60|$|As I {{only twice}} experimented {{on more than}} a single species in a genus, I cannot say whether the crossed {{offspring}} of the several species within the same genus differ in their degree of superiority over their self-fertilised brethren; but I should expect that this would often prove to be the case from what was observed with the two species of Lobelia and with the individuals of the same species of Nicotiana. The species belonging to distinct genera in the same family certainly differ in this respect. The effects of cross- and self-fertilisation may be confined either to the growth or to the fertility of the offspring, but generally extends to both qualities. There does not seem to exist any close correspondence between the degree to which their offspring profit by this process; but we may easily err on this head, as there are two means for ensuring cross-fertilisation which are not externally perceptible, namely, <b>self-sterility</b> and the prepotent fertilising influence of pollen from another individual. Lastly, it has been shown in a former chapter that the effect produced by cross and self-fertilisation on the fertility of the parent-plants does not always correspond with that produced on the height, vigour, and fertility of their offspring. The same remark applies to crossed and self-fertilised seedlings when these are used as the parent-plants. This want of correspondence probably depends, at least in part, on the number of seeds produced being chiefly determined by the number of the pollen-tubes which reach the ovules, and this will be governed by the reaction between the pollen and the stigmatic secretion or tissues; whereas the growth and constitutional vigour of the offspring will be chiefly determined, not only by the number of pollen-tubes reaching the ovules, but {{by the nature of the}} reaction between the contents of the pollen-grains and ovules.|$|E
60|$|Eighteen short-styled flowers legitimately fertilised yielded, {{as may be}} seen in Table 3.20, 15 fruits, each {{having on}} an average 2.6 seeds. Four of these fruits {{contained}} the highest possible number of seeds, namely 4, and four other fruits contained each 3 seeds. The 12 illegitimately fertilised short-styled flowers yielded 7 fruits, including on an average 1.86 seed; and one of these fruits contained the maximum number of 4 seeds. This result is very surprising in contrast with the absolute barrenness of the long-styled flowers when illegitimately fertilised; and I was thus led to attend carefully to the degree of self-fertility of the short-styled plants. A plant belonging to this form and covered by a net bore 28 flowers besides those which had been artificially fertilised, and of all these only two produced a fruit each including a single seed. This high degree of <b>self-sterility</b> no doubt depended merely on the stigmas not receiving any pollen, or not a sufficient quantity. For after carefully covering all the long-styled plants in my garden, several short-styled plants were left exposed to the visits of humble-bees, and their stigmas will thus have received plenty of short-styled pollen; and now about half the flowers, thus illegitimately fertilised, set fruit. I judge of this proportion partly from estimation and partly from having examined three large branches, which had borne 31 flowers, and these produced 16 fruits. Of the fruits produced 233 were collected (many being left ungathered), and these included on an average 1.82 seed. No less than 16 out of the 233 fruits included the highest possible number of seeds, namely 4, and 31 included 3 seeds. So we see how highly fertile these short-styled plants were when illegitimately fertilised with their own-form pollen by the aid of bees.|$|E
60|$|We thus see that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of P. auricula, the long-styled flowers of all nine species are more fertile than the short-styled flowers, when both forms are illegitimately fertilised. Whether P. auricula really differs from the other species in this respect I can form no opinion, as the result may have been accidental. The degree of self-fertility of a plant depends on two elements, namely, on the stigma receiving its own pollen and on its more or less efficient action when placed there. Now as the anthers of the short-styled flowers of several species of Primula stand directly above the stigma, their pollen is more likely to fall on it, or to be carried down to it by insects, than {{in the case of the}} long-styled form. It appears probable, therefore, at first sight, that the lessened capacity of the short-styled flowers to be fertilised with their own pollen, is a special adaptation for counteracting their greater liability to receive their own pollen, and thus for checking self-fertilisation. But from facts with respect to other species hereafter to be given, this view can hardly be admitted. In accordance with the above liability, when some of the species of Primula were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net, all insects being excluded, except such minute ones as Thrips, the short-styled flowers, notwithstanding their greater innate <b>self-sterility,</b> yielded more seed than did the long-styled. None of the species, however, when insects were excluded, made a near approach to full fertility. But the long-styled form of P. Sinensis gave, under these circumstances, a considerable number of seeds, as the corolla in falling off drags the anthers, which are seated low down in the tube, over the stigma, and thus leaves plenty of pollen on it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{means for}} favouring {{cross-fertilisation}} and preventing self-fertilisation, or conversely for favouring self-fertilisation and preventing {{to a certain}} extent cross-fertilisation, are wonderfully diversified; and it is remarkable that these differ widely in closely allied plants,--in the species of the same genus, and sometimes in the individuals of the same species. (12/5. Hildebrand has insisted strongly to this effect in his valuable observations on the fertilisation of the Gramineae: 'Monatsbericht K. Akad. Berlin' October 1872 page 763.) It is not rare to find hermaphrodite plants and others with separated sexes within the same genus; and it is common to find some of the species dichogamous and others maturing their sexual elements simultaneously. The dichogamous genus Saxifraga contains proterandrous and proterogynous species. (12/6. Dr. Engler 'Botanische Zeitung' 1868 page 833.) Several genera include both heterostyled (dimorphic or trimorphic forms) and homostyled species. Ophrys offers a remarkable instance of one species having its structure manifestly adapted for self-fertilisation, and other species as manifestly adapted for cross-fertilisation. Some con-generic species are quite sterile and others quite fertile with their own pollen. From these several causes we often find within the same genus species which do not produce seeds, while others produce an abundance, when insects are excluded. Some species bear cleistogene flowers which cannot be crossed, as well as perfect flowers, whilst others in the same genus never produce cleistogene flowers. Some species exist under two forms, the one bearing conspicuous flowers adapted for cross-fertilisation, the other bearing inconspicuous flowers adapted for self-fertilisation, whilst other species in the same genus present only a single form. Even with the individuals of the same species, the degree of <b>self-sterility</b> varies greatly, as in Reseda. With polygamous plants, the distribution of the sexes differs in the individuals of the same species. The relative period at which the sexual elements in the same flower are mature, differs in the varieties of Pelargonium; and Carriere gives several cases, showing that the period varies according to the temperature to which the plants are exposed. (12/7. 'Des Varieties' 1865 page 30.) ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{foregoing}} chapters all the heterostyled plants known to me {{have been more}} or less fully described. Several other cases have been indicated, especially by Professor Asa Gray and Kuhn, in which the individuals {{of the same species}} differ in the length of their stamens and pistils (6/1. Asa Gray 'American Journal of Science' 1865 page 101 and elsewhere as already referred to. Kuhn 'Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page 67.); but as I have been often deceived by this character taken alone, {{it seems to me the}} more prudent course not to rank any species as heterostyled, unless we have evidence of more important differences between the forms, as in the diameter of the pollen-grains, or in the structure of the stigma. The individuals of many ordinary hermaphrodite plants habitually fertilise one another, owing to their male and female organs being mature at different periods, or to the structure of the parts, or to <b>self-sterility,</b> etc.; and so it is with many hermaphrodite animals, for instance, land-snails or earth-worms; but in all these cases any one individual can fully fertilise or be fertilised by any other individual of the same species. This is not so with heterostyled plants: a long-styled, mid-styled or short-styled plant cannot fully fertilise or be fertilised by any other individual, but only by one belonging to another form. Thus the essential character of plants belonging to the heterostyled class is that the individuals are divided into two or three bodies, like the males and females of dioecious plants or of the higher animals, which exist in approximately equal numbers and are adapted for reciprocal fertilisation. The existence, therefore, of two or three bodies of individuals, differing from one another in the above more important characteristics, offers by itself good evidence that the species is heterostyled. But absolutely conclusive evidence can be derived only from experiments, and by finding that pollen must be applied from the one form to the other in order to ensure complete fertility.|$|E
60|$|As these orchids {{had been}} grown under unnatural {{conditions}} in hot-houses, I concluded that their <b>self-sterility</b> {{was due to}} this cause. But Fritz Muller informs me that at Desterro, in Brazil, he fertilised above one hundred flowers of the above-mentioned Oncidium flexuosum, which is there endemic, with its own pollen, and with that taken from distinct plants: all the former were sterile, whilst those fertilised by pollen from any OTHER PLANT {{of the same species}} were fertile. During the first three days {{there was no difference in}} the action of the two kinds of pollen: that placed on stigma of the same plant separated in the usual manner into grains, and emitted tubes which penetrated the column, and the stigmatic chamber shut itself; but only those flowers which had been fertilised by pollen taken from a distinct plant produced seed-capsules. On a subsequent occasion these experiments were repeated on a large scale with the same result. Fritz Muller found that four other endemic species of Oncidium were in like manner utterly sterile with their own pollen, but fertile with that from any other plant: some of them likewise produced seed-capsules when impregnated with pollen of widely distinct genera, such as Cyrtopodium, and Rodriguezia. Oncidium crispum, however, differs from the foregoing species in varying much in its self- sterility; some plants producing fine pods with their own pollen, others failing to do so in two or three instances, Fritz Muller observed that the pods produced by pollen taken from a distinct flower on the same plant, were larger than those produced by the flower's own pollen. In Epidendrum cinnabarinum, an orchid belonging to another division of the family, fine pods were produced by the plant's own pollen, but they contained by weight only about half as much seed as the capsules which had been fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant, and in one instance from a distinct species; moreover, a very large proportion, and in some cases nearly all the seeds produced by the plant's own pollen, were destitute of an embryo. Some self-fertilised capsules of a Maxillaria were in a similar state.|$|E

Specific inhibition of proteasome activity with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (CLβL) prevented the onset of <b>self-sterility,</b> but had no effect once this process had started.

The different steps {{in which the}} sterility mechanism acts are classified as follows. 1) The pre-pollination stage : The phenomenon seen in this step is the abortive or abnormal development of {{the male and female}} gametophytes. The triploidy causes irregular distribution of chromosomes in the spore cells, and the structural hybridity causes the deletion of chromosome fragments, which the results play important role in this step. 2) The post-pollination stage : The phenomenon in this step is the retardation of the pollen tube growth in the styles of the selfing. Some suppressing mechanism, distributed in the style increasingly downward, affects the pollen germination and the pollen tube growth. The female gametophytes are more viable than the male. The tetrasporic condition in the formation of female gametophytes and their nutritive dependence on sporophytes may be the factors of better development. Hypothetically the triploid L. tigrinum may have come through the stages of diploid self-fertility, diploid <b>self-sterility,</b> triploidization, and eventua lly triploid <b>self-sterility...</b>|$|E
40|$|Alfalfa {{is known}} to be a {{naturally}} cross-pollinated crop that exhibits loss of vigor following selfing and often shows heterosis following hybridization. <b>Self-sterility</b> is recognized in alfalfa, but few or none of the workers have included the frequency of occurrence, the mode of expression, and the inheritance of this phenomenon within the scope of their investigations. Fundamental knowledge of the nature of <b>self-sterility</b> would be of consequence in all phases of alfalfa breeding and would provide a scientific foundation for the commercial production of hybrid alfalfa seed. This paper reports surveys of the self-fertility of large populations of open-pollinated and inbred alfalfa plants and the female sterility and cross-incompatibility of twenty-one self-incompatible individuals.

40|$|In this report, <b>self-sterility</b> in Camellia oleifera was {{explored}} by comparing structural and statistical characteristics following self-pollination (SP) and cross-pollination (CP). Although slightly delayed pollen germination and pollen tube growth in selfed ovaries compared to crossed ovaries was observed, {{there was no}} significant difference in the percentages of pollen that germinated and pollen tubes that grew to the base of the style. There was also no difference in morphological structure after the two pollination treatments. However, the proportions of ovule penetration and double fertilization in selfed ovules were significantly lower than in crossed ovules, indicating that a prezygotic late-acting self-incompatible mechanism may exist in C. oleifera. Callose deposition was observed in selfed abortive ovules, but not in normal. Ovules did not show differences in anatomic structure during embryonic development, whereas significant differences were observed in the final fruit and seed set. In addition, aborted ovules in selfed ovaries occurred within 35 days after SP and prior to zygote division. However, this process did not occur continuously throughout the life cycle, and no zygotes were observed in the selfed abortive ovules. These results indicated that the <b>self-sterility</b> in C. oleifera may be caused by prezygotic late-acting self-incompatibility (LSI) ...|$|E
40|$|Polyploidization {{is common}} among {{angiosperms}} and might induce typically allogamous plants to become autogamous (self-compatible, relying on sexual self-fertilization) or apomictic (achieving asexual reproduction through seeds). This work aimed {{to determine whether}} neopolyploidy leads to {{the breakdown of the}} self-incompatibility system in the hexaploid non-apomictic species Handroanthus serratifolius (Vahl) S. Grose, through analyses of its floral biology, pollination biology and breeding system. Although anthesis lasted for three days, increasing the overall floral display, receptivity decreased as of the second day. Centridini and Euglossini bees were the main pollinators, and low nectar availability (1. 95 ± 1. 91 µl/flower) might have obliged them to visit multiple flowers. We observed low reproductive efficacy. That might be explained by <b>self-sterility</b> and by the great number of flowers per individual, which could increase the frequency of geitonogamy. Ovule penetration by the pollen tubes in self-pollinated pistils with posterior abscission indicated late-acting self-incompatibility in H. serratifolius, as observed in other diploid Bignoniaceae species, although inbreeding depression cannot be excluded. The <b>self-sterility</b> found in the monoembryonic, hexaploid individuals studied here contrasts with the results for other neopolyploid Handroanthus and Anemopaegma species, which are often autogamous and apomictic. Our results suggest that neopolyploidy is not the main factor leading to self-fertility in Handroanthus...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAscidians release {{sperm and}} eggs simultaneously, but self-fertilization is {{effectively}} blocked by unknown mechanisms. We previously {{reported that a}} 70 -kDa sperm receptor HrVC 70 on the egg vitelline coat (VC) consisting of 12 EGF-like repeats is a candidate self/nonself recognition molecule during fertilization of the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi. Here, we report that Halocynthia aurantium also utilizes a homolog (HaVC 80) of HrVC 70 as an allorecognizable sperm receptor. HaVC 80 {{is attached to the}} VC during the acquisition of <b>self-sterility</b> and is detached from the VC by acid treatment, allowing self-fertilization. A cDNA clone of the HaVC 80 precursor, HaVC 130, consists of 3726 nucleotides and encodes an open reading frame of 1208 amino acids. The structure of HaVC 130 is very similar to the HrVC 70 precursor HrVC 120, but the number of EGF-like repeats of HaVC 130 /VC 80 is one repeat larger than that of HrVC 120 /VC 70. There are several amino acid substitutions between different individuals, and two alleles of the HaVC 80 sequence were detected in each individual. Genomic DNA sequence analysis reveals that each EGF-like domain corresponds to a specific exon, and HaVC 130 may have been evolutionarily generated from HrVC 120 by duplication of the 8 th EGF-like repeat. The data support the hypothesis that HaVC 80 is a highly polymorphic protein responsible for <b>self-sterility</b> in H. aurantium...|$|E

We showed a drastic decrease in fertility after self-pollination {{as compared to}} cross-pollination. Number of plump seeds per berry was compared with previous field data. In both species, growth room conditions improved plump seed number after cross-pollination but not after self-pollination. In addition, {{in order to enhance}} resources supply to young developing fruits, cytokinin application was tested in V. myrtillus but no effect was detected. We hypothesize that the partial <b>self-sterility</b> is due to inbreeding depression based on the expression of recessive lethals...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-incompatibility}} (SI) of 3 Middle East Veronica species (V. filiformis, V. gentianoides, V. teucrium) is studied, for {{the first}} time, by pollination and pollen tube growth experiments. Cytological observations of the self-pollen tubes within the pistils permit a conclusion {{about the presence of}} a gametophytic SI system in the first 2 species. The investigated population of the third is self-compatible and confirms the facultative trait of its <b>self-sterility.</b> The presence of a gametophytic SI system in 2 of them suggests the putative conservation of this SI system within the genus Veronica (Plantaginaceae) and could be related to the well-known gametophytic SI system present in the other Plantaginaceae genus, Antirrhinum...|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{observations on}} the <b>self-sterility</b> in Lilium Hansonii has been made with special reference to the pollen tube behaviors. 1) The number of somatic chromosomes is 2 n= 24, and the idiogram is shown in Fig. 1. 2) The morphological normality of embryo-sac seems to be 100 %. 3) The modes of pollen tube behaviors of some Lilium members in the pistils of L.
