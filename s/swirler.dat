Electrically heated aluminum strips placed symmetrically about the leading edge stagnation region were used to measure spanwise-averaged heat transfer coefficients. The maximum Reynolds number obtained, based on leading edge diameter, was about 100, 000. The model was immersed in the flow field downstream of an approximately half-scale model of a can-type combustor from a low NO(x), ground-based power-generating turbine. The tests were conducted with room temperature air; no fuel was added. Room air flowed into the combustor through six vane-type fuel/air <b>swirlers.</b> The combustor can contained no dilution holes. The fuel/air <b>swirlers</b> all swirled the incoming airflow in a counterclockwise direction (facing downstream). A five-hole probe flow field survey in the plane of the model stagnation point showed the flow was one big vortex with flow angles up to 36 deg at the outer edges of the rectangular test section. Hot-wire measurements showed test section flow had very high levels of turbulence, around 28. 5 %, and had a relatively large axial-length scale-to-leading edge diameter ratio of 0. 5.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} inserting <b>swirler</b> outlet orifice plate of different sizes at the exit plane of the flat blade radial air <b>swirler</b> in liquid fuel burner system. Tests were carried out with three different orifice plates with area ratios (orifice area to <b>swirler</b> exit area ratio) between 1. 0 to 0. 7 using 280 mm inside diameter combustor of 1000 mm length. Tests were conducted using commercial diesel as fuel. Fuel was injected at the back plate of the 60 o vane angle <b>swirler</b> outlet using central fuel injector with single fuel nozzle pointing axially outwards. The aim of the insertion of orifice plates was to create the <b>swirler</b> pressure loss at the <b>swirler</b> outlet phase so that the <b>swirler</b> outlet shear layer turbulence was maximised to assist with fuel/air mixing. In the present work, orifice plate with smaller area ratios exhibited very low NOX emissions for the whole operating equivalence ratios. NOX reduction of more than 15 percent was achieved for orifice with 0. 7 area ratio compared to area ratio of 1. 0. Other emissions such as carbon monoxide increased with decreasing in orifice area ratios. This implies that good combustion was achieved using smallest area ratios of orifice plate. ...|$|E

25|$|Ramjet engines {{differ in}} many ways from {{traditional}} gas turbine engines, {{but most of the}} same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle.

Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than <b>swirlers</b> in many gas turbine combustors).
