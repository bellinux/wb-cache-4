Depending on {{different}} structure characteristic of nozzle (<b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> chamber and special boundary condition), the self-excited pulsed water jet can be produced,which {{can increase the}} jet pressure and having the cavitation phenomenon. So,it has been applied in oil driven well,mining and building etc. To study the relation among {{the frequency of the}} jetting peak pressure,the peak pressure of the plused-jetting and the self-excited pulsed water jet device,based on the theory of fluid network,the mathematical model of the <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> pulsed water jet device was established and the dynamic characteristics parameters of the <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> pulsed water jet were tested, which shows that the frequency of the <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> nozzle depend on the structure parameter and the dynamic state characteristic of the fluid decisive. the frequency of the jetting peak pressure depends on natural frequency and damping ratio of the device. The experiment proves that the frequency of the jetting peak pressure decreases with the length of the <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> chamber,increases with the rising of the pump pressure and there is an optimal length of the oscillation chamber corresponding to the jetting surge pressure. lastly, it clearly shows that the device has functions of oscillator and low pass filter and the jetting peak pressure is the highest when the jet dominant frequency close to the natural frequency of the device.

The {{focus of}} the present work is suppressing simulated flutter oscillation using piezoelectric patches bonded to the wing structure.

40|$|Abstract: As a {{renewable}} energy resource, the {{pumped storage power station}} has great prospects for better balancing supply and demand, particularly with {{further development of}} intermittent power sources and the growing need for an intelligent electric grid. However, pump-turbines often involve problematic S-shaped regions in their machine characteristics and thus, while pumped storage may solve some problems in the grid, pump-turbine operation and control can lead to other problems including severe <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> in the hydro-mechanical system. These operational challenges have been so severe that they have even led to some reported accidents. Based on two typical and complex water conveyance systems, includ-ing two pump-turbine system sharing a common tail tunnel and two pump-turbine systems sharing an upstream penstock, the mathematical equations for <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> are deduced from the basic equations of pressurized pipe flow coupled to the pump-turbine’s characteristics; moreover, the behaviour of a single pump-turbine system is obtained through simplification of the first analysis. An analytical study is performed and the amplitude–frequency characteristic is investigated by means of both non-linear vibration theory and its corresponding analytical solution algorithm through a multi-scale method. With a given case study in detail, the results show that, for the turbines staying in the S-shaped regions for a relatively long time, <b>self-excited</b> <b>oscillation</b> inevitably occurs with severe oscillation superposed by several oscillation modes by the use of power spectral analysis module in MATLAB, and numerical results are shown to agree well with the theoretical analysis...|$|E
