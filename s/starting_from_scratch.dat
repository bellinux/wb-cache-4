500|$|Before {{the series}} aired its second episode, the writers spent time researching in offices. This process {{was used for}} Daniels' other series King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation. The pilot is a direct {{adaptation}} of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided to go this route because [...] "completely <b>starting</b> <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> {{would be a very}} risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. He had briefly considered using the idea for [...] "The Dundies" [...] as the pilot episode. After the writers knew who the cast was, they were allowed to write for the actors, which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode, [...] "Diversity Day". Following the mixed reaction towards the first season, the writers attempted to make the series more [...] "optimistic" [...] and to make Michael Scott more likable. They also established the supporting characters of the series more, giving them actual personalities. They also made the lights in the office brighter, which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British version.|$|E

500|$|Black {{later said}} that Roddenberry removed {{a large part}} of Johnson's work, and that Johnson's {{original}} work was better than Roddenberry's edited version. Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand Star Trek after watching [...] "The Man Trap" [...] owing to differences in characterization between this episode {{and the rest of the}} series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson's work, and offered him further writing work on [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", which had been written by Robert Bloch. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to [...] "polish" [...] the script; Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without <b>starting</b> <b>from</b> <b>scratch,</b> turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled [...] "Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!" [...] in which the Enterprise would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father. This was not commissioned, so [...] "The Man Trap" [...] was Johnson's only work on the franchise.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{to honor the}} Kaiju and mecha genres while {{creating}} an original stand-alone film, something [...] "conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything". The director {{made a point of}} <b>starting</b> <b>from</b> <b>scratch,</b> without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. He cautioned his designers not to turn to films like Gamera, Godzilla, or The War of the Gargantuas for inspiration, stating: [...] "I didn't want to be postmodern, or referential, or just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur." [...] Rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as The Colossus and George Bellows's boxing paintings. The film's designers include Wayne Barlowe, Oscar Chichoni, monster sculptors David Meng and Simon Lee, and [...] and The Hobbit designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco. Del Toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled At the Mountains of Madness adaptation may have been used in Pacific Rim.|$|E
500|$|The episode debuted {{the series}} as a midseason {{replacement}} for the 2004–05 season. The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided {{to go through this}} route because [...] "completely <b>starting</b> <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> would be a very risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. Although the episode was primarily adapted from the first episode of the British series, it was partially re-scripted in an attempt to [...] "Americanize" [...] it. [...] Jokes such as Dwight's stapler being put in Jell-O by Jim were transferred verbatim from the original series, while others were only slightly changed. [...] Although later reshot, a scene in which Jim tapes pencils to his desk was originally filmed as a parallel to a scene in the British version, in which Tim Canterbury stacks up cardboard boxes in front of Gareth Keenan to restrict Keenan's view of Canterbury. [...] "Pilot" [...] was filmed almost six months prior to beginning of filming on the second episode of the season, [...] "Diversity Day". The Office used no laugh tracks in the [...] "Pilot", wanting its [...] "deadpan" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] humor to fully come across.|$|E

500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach have {{received}} generally favorable reviews from several video game publications. On Metacritic, a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews, My Spanish Coach received a 73/100, based on seven reviews. In {{a review of}} the DS versions of both games, IGN called them a [...] "great learning experience" [...] and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as [...] "ours of boring exercises and outdated videos".

500|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato. The main objective of the development team was to convert the entire Mana world into a 3D environment, rather than just <b>starting</b> <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> graphically and adding new elements to the gameplay. Ishii had previously {{wanted to make the}} 1999 PlayStation game Legend of Mana a 3D game, but the console had been unable to handle his vision of the player interacting with natural shaped objects in a full 3D world. He wanted to create a Mana title that could explore [...] "the feeling of touch" [...] in a game. After seeing the Havok physics engine in a demo of Half-Life 2 at E3 in 2004, Ishii decided to use the system in Dawn to give players a visual link between environments, objects, and characters. He hoped the physics engine and 3D graphics would allow him [...] "to create a world where players utilize a variety of actions to alter the world and the objects contained within". Although Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, he has also asserted in an interview that Dawn is set ten years before Children of Mana, which depicts the aftermath of the [...] "cataclysm" [...] of Dawn.|$|E

[...] (His older brother, Ralph Craig, was a track star at the University of Michigan who won gold medals in the 100 and 200-meter events at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden.) [...] In August 1913, Craig announced that he would no longer play football. Craig said he needed to drop athletics or fall behind in his university courses. [...] Another reason given for the decision was a bad knee. [...] Others speculated that Craig decided not to play, because he was not selected as captain of the 1913 team.|$|E

2500|$|As he puts it, Yim Maukun arrived penniless in Hong Kong in 1980. [...] He {{effectively}} was <b>starting</b> <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> at age 38, {{leaving behind}} whatever reputation he had established in China {{as an artist}} for the previous fifteen years. [...] He first earned income working on “export paintings” for art dealers. [...] These consisted mainly of full-sized personal and family portraits made from small photos, replicas of classical European paintings, and reproductions of pieces from various international art magazines. [...] While this can be considered more of a money-making trade than true art, it was nevertheless a crucial stage in Yim’s career for refining his techniques. [...] It led to an arrangement through the art dealer Xu Yaolin in 1981 for Yim to produce original works—two original oil paintings per month—for the Simic Gallery in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, as an associate painter. [...] Several noteworthy pieces {{were the result of}} this (including Eternal Devotion, My San Francisco and the original version of Sunset), but the arrangement ended prematurely when Yim’s application for a travel visa to the U.S. was denied in 1982.|$|E

Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that [...] "Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted.

[...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such, security has become a big issue. Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work". Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, [...] "instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models.
