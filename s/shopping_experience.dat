5|$|In 2014, {{the chain}} {{continued}} to manage its store footprint opening new stores, with locations in Ringwood, Blackburn and Southwold, its first branch {{to be without}} Waterstones branding, as well as closing stores in Eastleigh and St Neots. Continued business strategy change saw further departures from Head Office in brand communication and PR and a renewed agency contract for Waterstones’ digital marketing with Epiphany. The retailer overhauled its business technology with new algorithms on its website to help personalise the online <b>shopping</b> <b>experience,</b> updated point-of-sale IT and by introducing contactless payment in its stores. The retailer partnered with Airbnb to hold a one-off ‘sleepover’ for customers in its Piccadilly branch in October 2014 after a customer was accidentally trapped in the Trafalgar Square branch after closing. Accounts for 2014 saw operating income losses narrow to £3.8 million, but sales slip by 5.9%.|$|E

25|$|Babin et al. {{carried out}} some of the {{earliest}} investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the <b>shopping</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} <b>shopping</b> <b>experience.</b> However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{business}} introduced a 'Mystery Shopper' programme to score its branches {{on the service}} they provide. The mystery shopper grades the branch on its presentation and on the service the branch provides at its service counters, checkouts, wine department and shop floor. In more recent times however, the unpopular mystery shopper programme is being phased out in favour of a customer feedback system called 'Measuring the Magic'. Customers are given a card which directs them to the Waitrose Experience website. In return for grading various areas of their <b>shopping</b> <b>experience,</b> customers are entered into a monthly £500 prize draw. The new system hopes to give feedback tailored to each instance of customer-partner contact, instead of being based on strict criteria.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTDespite the {{significant}} number {{of the population of}} Individuals with Disabilities, one can see that, in the field of consumer research in retail organizations, the lack of research on the issues concerning them is notorious. This observation is even more remarkable when one takes into account the work involving the visually impaired. It is precisely because of this gap in literature that there was the interest in conducting a research based on the following problem: How do blind people live in retail their <b>shopping</b> <b>experiences</b> of products, services, artifacts, and symbolic images related to clothing? As a theoretical contribution, we considered the literature concerning the experiential approach and consumption symbolism. The method chosen to obtain data was the in-depth personal interviews with 11 visually impaired. As a result, it may be noted that visually impaired consumers surveyed defined their <b>shopping</b> <b>experiences</b> as something more than seemingly ordinary situations, while they expressed various values through consumption, celebrating their connection to society as a whole. From these observations, it was possible to better understand the <b>shopping</b> <b>experiences</b> of these consumers...|$|R

500|$|Other critics complimented the {{different}} {{nature of the}} song and its production. Reviewing the album for The Michigan Daily, Lark praised the track saying that [...] " [...] a brilliant, ecstatic pop catharsis that all but eclipses every mistake she's ever made, including the virginal writhing, gold-tooth sporting and naked hitchhiking of her sordid past", the last part referring to Madonna's antics during her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992) era. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{found it to be}} the [...] "perfect opener" [...] for Ray of Light and its various contradiction filled tracks. Noting {{the different}} musical elements, including drum loops, strings, computer bleeping as well as jungle snares, Sheffield compared them to a person's <b>shopping</b> <b>experience</b> and unpacking of the bags after the activity ends. The reviewer ended by saying that the track came off as [...] "loud, tacky and ridiculous", but still exuded emotion in the music. In a review for Madonna's greatest hits album, GHV2 (2001), Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters commended Orbit's production work on the track along with others from Ray of Light. She added that the songs are [...] "a testament to his ability to use gadgets and electronic wizardry not to alienate listeners, but to draw them in".|$|E
500|$|Trade {{and crafts}} are {{extremely}} important to the local tourism-fueled economy. There are 18 souks in Marrakesh, employing over 40,000 people in pottery, copperware, leather and other crafts. The souks contain a massive range of items from plastic sandals to Palestinian-style scarves imported from India or China. Local boutiques are adept at making western-style clothes using Moroccan materials. The Birmingham Post comments: [...] "The souk offers an incredible <b>shopping</b> <b>experience</b> with a myriad of narrow winding streets that lead {{through a series of}} smaller markets clustered by trade. Through the squawking chaos of the poultry market, the gory fascination of the open-air butchers' shops and the uncountable number of small and specialist traders, just wandering around the streets can pass an entire day." [...] Marrakesh has several supermarkets including Marjane Acima, Asswak Salam and Carrefour, and three major shopping centres, [...] Al Mazar Mall, Plaza Marrakech and Marjane Square; a branch of Carrefour opened in Al Mazar Mall in 2010. Industrial production in the city is centred in the neighbourhood of Sidi Ghanem Al Massar, containing large factories, workshops, storage depots and showrooms.

40|$|In {{the highly}} {{competitive}} and dynamic world of fashion retailing, developing and retaining loyal customers {{is a requirement}} for survival, let alone success. Marketing practitioners have found that to keep customers loyal, a firm must go beyond merely satisfying to truly delighting them (Schlossberg, 1990; Arnold, Reynolds, Ponder and Lueg, 2005). However, only Arnold et al. (2005) explored the concept of customer delight in a generic (multi-format) retail environment. To the author’s knowledge, {{there has not been}} any similar research conducted in the South African retail environment and none specific to fashion apparel retailers. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine customer delight in the context of fashion retailing. Specifically, qualitative research was conducted to determine the antecedents and outcomes of delightful <b>shopping</b> <b>experiences</b> for these customers. Critical incident analysis of 33 depth interviews with shoppers revealed several factors associated with delightful <b>shopping</b> <b>experiences</b> and the resultant business outcomes. Together with presenting a model that fashion retailers can use to stage delightful <b>shopping</b> <b>experiences,</b> a number of strategic implications are discussed, and limitations and directions for future research are also addressed.

2500|$|CarMax is a {{used car}} auto superstore concept {{developed}} in 1991 at Circuit City by Austin Ligon, then Circuit City's Senior VP of Planning, and Rick Sharp, then Circuit City CEO. The goal of CarMax was to revolutionize used car retailing {{through a combination of}} large selection (400+ used cars at each store); low, no-haggle pricing; guaranteed quality; and a consumer-friendly <b>shopping</b> <b>experience.</b> The first location opened in Richmond, Virginia in September 1993. CarMax grew slowly for its first four years as the team refined the basic concept, then went public through an IPO as a [...] "tracking stock" [...] (KMX) of Circuit City in February 1997. The offering was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and raised more than $400mm for a 20% interest in the company, with Circuit City retaining the remaining 80% ownership. CarMax used the proceeds to repay Circuit City's initial $170mm investment in the company, then used the remainder to grow rapidly, adding 27 more stores from 1997 to 2000, and turning its first profit in FY2001. Circuit City sold a further 10% of its interest in CarMax in July 2001 for $140mm, with proceeds going to Circuit City. CarMax was spun off from Circuit City in a tax free distribution to shareholders in October 2002 to allow both companies to grow and be valued independently. The stock distribution provided Circuit City shareholders with KMX stock valued at over $1.2bn {{at the time of the}} spin off in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the {{kick-off}} to the Christmas {{and holiday}} season for online shopping, the first Monday after US Thanksgiving, was named Cyber Monday. Although {{it was a}} peak, {{that was not the}} busiest on-line shopping day of that year. The busiest on-line shopping days were December 12 and 13, almost two weeks later; the second Monday in December has since become known as Green Monday. Another notable day is Free Shipping Day, a promotional day that serves as the last day in which a person can order a good online and have it arrive via standard shipping (the price of which the sender pays) prior to Christmas Eve; this day is usually on or near December 16. Four of the largest 11 on-line shopping days in 2005 were December 11 to 16, with an increase of 12% over 2004 figures. In 2011, Cyber Monday was slightly busier than Green Monday and Free Shipping Day, although all three days registered sales of over US$1 billion, and all three days registered gains ranging from 14% to 22% over the previous year. Analysts had predicted the peak on December 12, noting that Mondays are the most popular days for on-line shopping during the holiday shopping season, in contrast {{to the middle of the}} week during the rest of the year. They attribute this to people [...] "shopping in stores and malls on the weekends, and [...] extending that <b>shopping</b> <b>experience</b> when they get into work on Monday" [...] by [...] "looking for deals, [...] comparison shopping and [...] finding items that were out of stock in the stores".|$|E
