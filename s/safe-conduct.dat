5|$|Thomas' name {{suggests}} a strong likelihood {{that he came}} from Buittle in Kirkcudbrightshire, Galloway, lands in {{the control of the}} Douglas family. In 1388, it was claimed that he had been a scholar of Decrees (i.e. Canon law) at the University of Oxford for five years, a claim to some extent confirmed by the grant of <b>safe-conduct</b> from the English crown on 18 February 1380, to travel and study at Oxford for a year.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{frequently}} {{used as an}} ambassador by the king, James I of Scotland. According to the 16th century Bishop of Ross and historian John Lesley, Henry {{was one of the}} men sent to England to arrange the ransom of King James - held in England for most of his youth, not being released until 1424. On 9 June 1425, he and other prelates received a <b>safe-conduct</b> from King Henry VI of England enabling them to travel through England on their way to visit Pope Martin V at Rome. In 1428, Henry was the leader of an embassy sent to King Charles VII of France for a marriage proposal and to renew the Franco-Scottish alliance, and in January 1430, was sent into England for discussion of various grievances. On 31 March 1434, Lichton is found in attendance at the Council of Basel, though no more details of his activities there have survived.|$|E
5|$|To reach Bihać, Đurišić made a <b>safe-conduct</b> {{agreement}} with {{elements of the}} Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and with the Montenegrin separatist Drljević. The details of the agreement are not known, but it is thought he and his troops intended to cross the Sava river into Slavonia where they would join Drljević as the Montenegrin National Army, of which Đurišić was the operational commander. Đurišić apparently tried to outsmart them and sent only his sick and wounded troops across the river, keeping his fit troops south of the river. He began moving his command westwards; harassed by the NDH troops and Partisans, Đurišić's forces reached the Vrbas river north of Banja Luka in late May. Between 30 May and 8 April, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by a strong NDH force armed with German-supplied tanks, in the Battle of Lijevče Field. This was probably the largest combat action between NDH forces and the Chetniks in the previous two years.|$|E

50|$|On September 15, 1973, when Charles Horman asked Captain Ray Davis if {{he would}} take him and his friend Terry Simon to Santiago, Davis asked Monsalve for the <b>safe-conducts,</b> {{briefing}} him on Horman's political background.|$|R
50|$|He {{had many}} <b>safe-conducts</b> from the English kings Edward III and Richard II, and on December 1381, he {{obtained}} a passport to travel through England on {{a pilgrimage to}} the Holy Land. He died on Crete some time before March 1382.|$|R
5|$|Wilfrid {{spent his}} exile in Mercia, where {{he enjoyed the}} staunch support of King Æthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a council at Austerfield, on the {{southern}} border of Northumbria, which was attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid's return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by the bishops. According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but the bishops reminded {{him that he had}} promised Wilfrid <b>safe-conduct.</b> After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was excommunicated by his enemies among the bishops. He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to Pope John VI. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Đurišić {{decided to}} move to the Ljubljana Gap {{independent}} of Mihailović, and arranged for Ljotić's forces already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. In order to get to Bihać, Đurišić had to make a <b>safe-conduct</b> agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia and with Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević. He was captured by the Ustaše and Drljević's followers in April 1945 and killed along with other Chetnik leaders, some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. Between March and April, Ljotić and Mihailović exchanged messages concerning a last-ditch alliance against the Partisans. Although the agreement was reached too late to be of any practical use, the forces of Ljotić and Mihailović came together under the command of Chetnik General Miodrag Damjanović on 27 March. Together, they tried to contact the western Allies in Italy in an attempt to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-Communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia. In mid-April, at Ljotić's request, Dožić and Velimirović blessed approximately 25,000 members of the SDS, SUK, Serbian Border Guard, and the Special Police, as well as Đujić's and Dobroslav Jevđević's Chetniks and Slovene collaborators, who had gathered on the Slovenian coast.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ivan Vladislav {{consolidated}} {{his positions}} {{in the mountains of}} Albania and Macedonia. As early as October 1015 he began the reconstruction of many strongholds destroyed during the war, including the fortress at Bitola (as testified in the Bitola inscription). In 1016 he invited his vassal Prince Jovan Vladimir of Doclea, who was married to Gabriel Radomir's sister Theodora Kosara, to come to his court. The emperor probably desired to seize the prince and so secure his western flank. The Prince was determined to attend the invitation of Tsar, but his wife Theodora Kosara did not trust the murderer of her brother, and fearing for her husband's life persuaded him not to go. Ivan Vladislav however vowed not to threaten his vassal's life, and sent him a golden cross as a proof of good will. Jovan Vladimir still hesitated, saying that God was nailed to a wooden not golden cross, but Ivan Vladislav repeated his vow and gave him a guarantee of <b>safe-conduct,</b> also guaranteed by the Bulgarian patriarch David. Eventually Jovan Vladimir travelled to the court of the Tsar in Prespa, but upon his arrival on 22 May, he was immediately beheaded, and the emperor refused to allow the burial of his body. It was not until a number of miraculous events related to the corpse of the prince were observed that Vladislav returned the body to Kosara.|$|E
50|$|When the Jewish {{community}} was established (in 1593), the directors were empowered to grant <b>safe-conducts</b> and immunity as regards previous crimes and debts to all Jews who settled at Livorno. The communal directors decided on accepting new settlers {{by a majority}} vote of two-thirds. The right of immunity {{in the case of}} previous crimes was soon abrogated by the grand duke.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1750, the {{internal}} affairs of the small community were administered by the rabbi of Worms for an annual compensation of 10 Reichsthaler. Visits by the rabbis required official permission, as documents from 1682, 1685, 1698, 1713, and 1746 show. In the last-named document a reference is made to [...] "our rabbi David Strauss of Worms". Episcopal edicts in 1717, 1719, 1722, 1726, 1727, 1728, 1736, 1741, and 1748 prohibited Romanies and Jews having no <b>safe-conducts</b> from visiting the diocese estates; and those that were provided with <b>safe-conducts</b> were required, for sanitary reasons, to submit their bundles or packages to a rigid examination.As of 1752 the Jews were forbidden, on pain of severe punishment, to employ the services of any rabbi other than their own. The first rabbi of Speyer was Isaac Weil (1750-63), succeeded by Löwin Löb Calvaria, whose salary was provided by a bequest in the testament of a Jew named Süssle.|$|R
5000|$|Alexander had {{at least}} four <b>Safe-conducts</b> issued to him to travel abroad. Joseph Bain {{mentions}} him in several issued by Henry VI and found also in Rotuli Scotiae on 13 May and 19 and 30 November 1423, which include [...] "Alexander de Lawedre, archidiaconus Dunkelden in Scotia". With [...] "Magr. Edwardus de Laweder, archidiaconus de Lothian" [...] he is again mentioned on 4 March 1424-5.|$|R

25|$|The {{resistance}} of Ktish endured {{more than a}} year. Esayi wrote to the caliph protesting against this attack and after receiving from him a <b>safe-conduct,</b> he went to Bugha for peace talks. Bugha however treacherously captured him. In 855 Esayi Abu-Muse, along with him all the princes of Armenia, who were captured by Bugha, were exiled to Samarra in Mesopotamia.|$|E
50|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First Civil War obliged Hughes to move to Exeter, where his wife died. Here Prince Rupert and his staff heard him preach. On his deciding {{to leave the city}} the prince provided him with <b>safe-conducts,</b> which enabled him to travel in peace to Coventry. On 21 October 1643 the corporation of Plymouth elected him vicar of St. Andrew's Church. He dedicated to the corporation a work; Richard Baxter considered it the best of its kind.|$|R
5000|$|In 1355 with William, Lord of Douglas and Sir William Ramsay of Dalhousie, the Earl of Dunbar again invaded Northumberland, and {{subsequently}} recovered Berwick-upon-Tweed, although not the castle. In 1357 {{he was one}} of the Scottish ambassadors who met at Berwick to discuss the liberation of King David, who had been taken prisoner at Neville's Cross. He was subsequently one of the hostages for David until the ransom was paid, although it would appear from <b>Safe-Conducts</b> that he was out and about thereafter. Following this his town of Dunbar was erected into a Royal Burgh.|$|R
60|$|He {{had reached}} the {{conclusion}} that by consenting {{to go to her}} rescue at such a time he stood committed to a piece of purely sentimental quixotry. The quittances which the Mayor of Meudon had exacted from him before he would issue the necessary <b>safe-conducts</b> placed the whole of his future, perhaps his very life, in jeopardy. And he had consented to do this not {{for the sake of a}} reality, but out of regard for an idea--he who all his life had avoided the false lure of worthless and hollow sentimentality.|$|R
25|$|A Venetian {{ambassador}} of {{that time}} praised Marguerite as knowing all the secrets of diplomatic art, hence {{to be treated with}} deference and circumspection. Marguerite's most remarkable adventure involved freeing her brother, King Francis I, who had been held prisoner in Spain by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor after being captured in the Battle of Pavia, Italy, 1525. During a critical period of the negotiations, Queen Marguerite rode horseback through wintry woods, twelve hours a day for many days, to meet a <b>safe-conduct</b> deadline, while writing her diplomatic letters at night.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the fort was {{virtually}} won, and Menéndez {{turned his attention to}} the vessels anchored in the neighborhood. A number of women and children had been spared and his thoughts turned to how he could rid himself of them. His decision was promptly reached. A trumpeter with a flag of truce was sent to summon someone to come ashore from the ships to treat of conditions of surrender. Receiving no response, he sent Jean Francois to the Pearl with the proposal that the French should have a <b>safe-conduct</b> to return to France with the women and children in any one vessel they should select, provided they would surrender their remaining ships and all of their armament.|$|E
25|$|The authorities, {{fearful of}} {{starvation}} on an overpopulated island kept under blockade, resolved to deport the entire Nauruan population. Shortly after {{the arrival of}} the last military convoy, the Japanese called together a Nauruan council and made the announcement of the deportation of some of the islanders under the leadership of Timothy Detudamo. They refused to tell the Nauruans their destination, which increased anxiety among the population; they were only told that the island to which they would be sent had an abundance of food. Just before departure, Nakayama, second in the military hierarchy of the island, gave Detudamo a letter bearing the seal of the emperor Hirohito, indicating that the Nauruans were under his protection. This document was later used for <b>safe-conduct</b> by the exiles.|$|E
50|$|Alexander de Forbes fought at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, {{and appears}} among the Scottish forces {{sent to the}} {{assistance}} of Charles, Dauphin of France, afterwards King Charles VII, and had {{a share in the}} victory obtained over the English at Beaugé, in Anjou, on 22 March 1424. But soon after, at the desire of King James I of Scotland, then a prisoner in England, Forbes quit the French service and subsequently obtained three <b>Safe-conducts</b> at different times to visit England, with one hundred persons in his retinue each time, to wait upon his sovereign.|$|R
50|$|Adam de Lanark, O.P. (died 1378) was a 14th-century Scottish Dominican friar and prelate. Possibly from a Lanark burghess family, {{he was a}} Dominican and {{a priest}} by 1356, and by 1364 was styled Magister, {{indicating}} {{the completion of a}} long university education. He first appears in the sources, c. 1355/6 as a confessor of King David II of Scotland; he retained this royal position through the 1350s and into the 1360s; Adam received a number of English <b>safe-conducts</b> (between May 1356 and August 1357) to visit King David, who for a time was a prisoner in England.|$|R

25|$|In October 1560 Nicholas Throckmorton heard Cleutin {{was out of}} favour in France due to his {{opposition}} to the plan to execute the Protestant lords, but was given leave to go home to Villeparis. In September 1561 Cleutin visited Throckmorton in Paris, saying he had been a friend to Mary, Queen of Scots and the House of Guise. Cleutin then travelled to London to obtain a passport and <b>safe-conduct</b> for Mary, Queen of Scots' voyage to Scotland. Elizabeth did not oblige, wishing Mary to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh which d'Oisel had helped draft, and kept d'Oisel waiting. William Maitland approved of this, but learnt that Mary would sail anyway. On 6 October 1561 Throckmorton went to the Hôtel de Guise and d'Oysel brought him to speak to the Duke himself.|$|E
25|$|After {{becoming}} bishop, Walter {{remained a}} prominent royal servant, continuing his duties as Clerk of the Rolls and Clerk of the Register, and enjoyed {{a strong relationship}} with the ruler of Scotland, now Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany. He officiated at every exchequer audit between May 1409 and July 1422. He also continued his ambassadorial role, serving as leader of a mission to England in 1408 to negotiate the release of James I, the nominal king. He went appears to have gone on further missions in May 1412, April 1413 and September 1413, though the evidence we have is for the grants of <b>safe-conduct</b> rather than the expeditions themselves. He was in Rome 14231424, and made a separate trip to Flanders later in 1424. After James I's return in 1424, he served once more as exchequer auditor, 7 May 1425.|$|E
25|$|Orwell married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the {{political}} crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At {{the end of}} the year, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising, (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), Orwell decided to go to Spain {{to take part in the}} Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised him to get a <b>safe-conduct</b> from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.|$|E
50|$|The {{terms of}} the treaty {{included}} abstinence from war, <b>safe-conducts</b> for legitimate travellers, redress for cross-border robbery and rendition of criminals. Trade by sea was assured according to the previous treaty made by Edward IV and James III in 1464. Among the provisions was the traditional clause, that neither side should dismantle or rebuilt the fishgarth, where the River Esk meets the Solway. A new clause {{addressed the issue of}} border people robbing trees and timber from across the marches. It was hoped that during the three years Scottish commissioners would come to London to negotiate a new treaty of Perpetual Peace. Henry VIII signed on 17 August.|$|R
60|$|The chaise rattled triumphantly {{through the}} Batignolles. It was then broad daylight. A {{brilliant}} early autumn {{day after the}} rains. The sun, the keen air, all mocked Chauvelin's helplessness, his humiliation. Long before noon they passed St. Denis. Here the barouche turned off the main road, halted at a small wayside house--nothing more than a cottage. After which everything seemed more dreamlike than ever. All that Chauvelin remembered of it afterwards {{was that he was}} once more alone in a room with his enemy, who had demanded his signature to a number of <b>safe-conducts,</b> ere he finally handed over the packet of papers to him.|$|R
50|$|In {{mainland}} Greece, as elsewhere, {{uncertainty and}} ambivalent {{behavior of the}} Italian superior officers favored a rapid German success; Italian forces in this region, consisting of the 11th Army with headquarters in Athens, were subordinate to Army Group E of General Löhr, whom had numerically inferior but more efficient units (three chasseurs divisions, part of the 1st Panzer Division and a Luftwaffe field division). General Carlo Vecchierelli, commander of the 11th Army, issued at first an order dictating that no initiatives where to be taken against the Germans, and on 9 September, believing the German assurances of <b>safe-conducts</b> to return to Italy, he ordered his troops to avoid any resistance and hand over the weapons to the Germans, without fighting.|$|R
25|$|Empress Matilda and {{her party}} took refuge at Arundel Castle {{where they were}} welcomed by King Henry's widow Adeliza and her new husband William d'Aubigny. Robert of Gloucester rode to Bristol to rally support for the empress. Stephen quickly {{assembled}} an army and surrounded Arundel Castle, demanding that the empress be handed over to him. Though her garrison was weak, Adeliza sent word that she would fight it out. At this point Stephen committed an astonishing blunder by giving Empress Matilda a <b>safe-conduct</b> pass to Bristol and withdrawing his army. When his enemy reached safety, the civil war broke out in full fury. While London and the east remained loyal to Stephen, the west declared for the empress. Stephen hired a body of Flemish mercenaries under William of Ypres, antagonizing his English subjects. The system of justice established under Henry I went to pieces and the common people suffered under the harsh demands of local noblemen and officials.|$|E
25|$|In 1638, after King Charles I had {{attempted}} to impose an Episcopalian version of the Book of Common Prayer upon the reluctant Scots, resistance spread throughout the country, eventually culminating in the Bishops' Wars. Montrose joined the party of resistance, and was for some time {{one of its most}} energetic champions. He had nothing puritanical in his nature, but he shared in the ill-feeling aroused by the political authority King Charles had given to the bishops. He signed the National Covenant, and was sent to suppress the opposition which arose around Aberdeen and in the country of the Gordons. Three times Montrose entered Aberdeen, where he succeeded in his object, on the second occasion carrying off the head of the Gordons, the Marquess of Huntly, as a prisoner to Edinburgh (though in so doing, for the first and last time in his life, he violated a <b>safe-conduct).</b> He was a leader of the delegation who subsequently met at Muchalls Castle to parley regarding the 1638 confrontation with the Bishop of Aberdeen. With the Earl Marischal he led a force of 9000 men across the Causey Mounth through the Portlethen Moss to attack Royalists at the Bridge of Dee. These events played a part in Charles I's decision to grant major concessions to the Covenanters.|$|E
500|$|Following Spoletta's departure, Tosca imposes {{the further}} {{condition}} that Scarpia provide a <b>safe-conduct</b> out of Rome {{for herself and}} her lover. While he is signing the document, Tosca quietly takes a knife from the supper table. As Scarpia triumphantly embraces her, she stabs him, crying [...] "this is Tosca's kiss!". As Scarpia falls dead, she declares that she now forgives him. She removes the <b>safe-conduct</b> from his pocket, lights candles in a gesture of piety and places a crucifix on the body before leaving.|$|E
500|$|Though {{historians have}} {{generally}} shown understanding for Harclay's actions, it is nevertheless common {{to refer to}} the event as [...] "Harclay's treason". In the words of Maurice Keen: [...] "To make a truce, or to indeed to give <b>safe-conducts</b> or make any agreement with the king's enemies without proper grant of powers, again constituted lèse majesté and can be found defined as such in other military cases". Harclay had received such powers in February 1322, but he was considered to have overstepped his prerogative by the 1323 treaty. It is also possible that Edward held a grudge against Harclay for the latter's failure to come to the rescue at Byland, and that this was behind the king's later, severe reaction. There is, however, no evidence that Harclay received the royal letter in time to arrive at the battlefield any earlier than he did.|$|R
5000|$|After the coup, Charles Horman and Terry Simon innocently asked U.S. (Navy) Captain Ray Davis if {{he would}} take them in his car from Valparaíso to Santiago, and Davis asked for <b>safe-conducts</b> to his contact in the Chilean Navy, Raúl Monsalve, in fact {{alerting}} him about Horman's whereabouts. Unfortunately, judge Jorge Zepeda never took Ray Davis's statement. As late as 2011, eight years having prosecuted Rafael González, Zepeda asked the U.S. authorities for the extradition of Davis, a request that as usual took a longtime to be processed by Chilean courts. The answer from American authorities {{was that it was}} impossible to extradite Davis, since Davis was living in Santiago, Chile, and besides he had died on April 30, 2013, aged 88. Joyce Horman declared that judge Zepeda's gross blunder was [...] "extraordinarily frustrating" [...] and Peter Kornbluh pointed out how unbelievable it was that judge Jorge Zepeda was “working to get Davis extradited and he was literally less than a couple of miles down the road" ...|$|R
