25|$|The {{combination}} of wastewater and biological mass is {{commonly known as}} mixed liquor. In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> and the treated supernatant is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the sludge, is returned {{to the head of the}} aeration system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called return activated sludge (R.A.S.).|$|E
30|$|Amongst the {{treatment}} processes, the raw water collection sump and primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> consume {{maximum amount of}} energy (20  %). The energy used here is for pumping the raw water from the sump to the primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> The disinfectant tank, sand filter and carbon filter account for the least energy consumption.

40|$|One of the {{important}} environmental problems in human settlements is the contamination of water bodies and terrain by pollutants arriving with sewage. The main reasons for this are the physical deterioration of treatment facilities and insufficient funding. Thus, it becomes impossible to maintain wastewater treatment facilities in operative condition and provide treatment of discharged wastewater to the standard quality. Therefore the task of intensifying the operation of facilities and plants for the water settling as well as reducing the areas occupied by this water acquires the particular importance. The present work deals {{with the construction of}} a new vertical <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> with spiral-wound nozzle. The design of this <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> has a patent. Compared to a conventional vertical <b>settling</b> <b>tank,</b> in the proposed <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> with spiral-wound nozzle there are more favorable hydrodynamic conditions. At the same settling time these conditions allow improving of the lightening effect by increased staying of treated water in the spiral-wound nozzle. The application of this vertical <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in the water and sewage treatment helps to reduce the facilities volume and improve the cleaning effect. Based on the theory of suspended particles sedimentation for this <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> a mathematical model and calculation method were developed...|$|R

25|$|Upgrading of {{the first}} Activated Sludge plant to use the 'Simplex' system took place between 1970 and 1973. Because of the {{proximity}} of the M60 motorway and the risk that deep excavations might damage it, seven of the final <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> were built above ground. Effluent from the Activated Sludge plant was raised up {{to the level of the}} tanks by screw pumps, and the increased hydraulic head improved their performance. The upgrade also included five primary settlement tanks and eight sludge consolidation tanks. Two new sludge boats were purchased in 1971 and 1972, and a new dock was constructed on land which had formerly been used for secondary beds.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its early}} days, Sellafield has {{discharged}} low-level radioactive waste into the sea, using a flocculation process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents produced a metal hydroxide flocculant precipitate following {{the addition of}} ammonium hydroxide. The suspension was then transferred to <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or supernate, would be discharged to the Irish Sea. In 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) was opened. In EARP {{the effectiveness of the}} process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of technetium-99 released to the environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Design {{of primary}} <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> has {{historically}} been done more empirically than rationally. The main {{reason for this is}} a lack of understanding of what pollutants primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> are capable of removing. Inlets should be designed to dissipate the kinetic energy or velocity head of the mixed liquor. They should be able to distribute the flow equally in vertical and horizontal directions. Inlets should also be designed to prevent short-circuiting. Flow in primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> is simulated by means of computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The fluid is assumed incompressible and non-buoyant. Two-dimensional simulation for one-phase flow has been done. The RNG turbulent model was solved with the Navier-Stockes equations. The flow pattern properties in the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> include the velocity profiles, the flow separation area and kinetic energy. In this study, the effect of inlet configurations on these characteristics is considered. Due to this object, rectangular, slope and curved shape of inlet slot are suggested...|$|R
500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{effluent}} discharged into the Don was soon giving rise to concern, as the treatment process was unsatisfactory. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1900, which allowed Sheffield Corporation to buy an additional , on which contact beds would be built, so that the effluent could be better treated before discharge. The initial plan was costed at £367,355, which was reduced to £270,369 when secondary contact beds {{were removed from the}} scheme. The Local Government Board approved the plans on 13 May 1905, paving the way {{for the construction of a}} biological treatment system, instead of the system using lime. Logan and Hemmingway, who were contractors based at Nottingham, won the initial contract for excavations, and also the subsequent one for the construction of six <b>settling</b> <b>tanks,</b> 24 contact tanks, and Jordan bridge, which would carry the internal railway line over the River Don Navigation. The contract was worth £41,046, and further contracts followed, which included £36,500 for 36 more contact beds and three <b>settling</b> <b>tanks,</b> £5,000 for excavating [...] of earth, and £36,484 for storm beds and other work, which was subsequently raised to £39,184, so that they could pay their workers at the same rate as Sheffield Corporation paid their own workmen.|$|E
500|$|Called [...] "Jordan Bridge 21" [...] by British Waterways, {{this bridge}} carried a railway that linked Blackburn Meadows Sewage Works to {{additional}} filters and contact beds {{to the east}} of the navigation. It was constructed by Logan and Hemmingway, who won a contract valued at £41,046 in April 1907, which included six <b>settling</b> <b>tanks,</b> 24 contact beds, and the bridge. The eastern approach consists of three brick arches, which allowed a siding to pass through it. Continued expansion of the works required a second bridge to be constructed in 1922, to carry the railway over the river channel. The steelwork for Holmes bridge was supplied by Charles Ross Ltd, who were based in Sheffield, while piling work was carried out by Yorkshire Hennebique Concreting Co Ltd.|$|E
500|$|By mid-1886, {{the works}} was complete, and the Mayor, J. W. Pye-Smith Esq, officially opened it on 2 June. The event was {{witnessed}} {{by members of}} the Council, and by invited guests, which included a representative from the London Metropolitan Board of Works. Reports at the time indicated that the sewage passed through catch pits by gravity, allowing solids to settle, which were removed weekly. Milk of lime was then added as it flowed through mixing channels, after which it entered rectangular <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> Next it passed on to a number of precipitating tanks, each holding , where after 30 minutes of settling, it passed over aerating weirs. Finally it ran through coke filters and was discharged into the river. Around [...] of sludge was removed from the precipitating tanks each day, to be pumped into ponds. Once the water had drained off, it was moved to drying beds, and was then used as manure by farmers, or was taken by rail to a tip at Kilnhurst, near Rotherham. Initially, there were 30 precipitating tanks and 60 aerating or filtering tanks.|$|E

30|$|Activated sludge {{system for}} {{biological}} wastewater treatment consists essentially of an activated sludge reactor and a <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Reports on {{the analysis of}} the performance of the activated sludge plants based on reactor- settler interaction are rather scarce. Sherrard and Kincannon (1974) proposed a correlation among the mean solid retention time, sludge recycle ratio and sludge concentration factor in secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Riddell et al. (1983) combined the functions of the reactor and the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in order to choose permissible flow rate of an activated sludge plant. Sheintuch (1987) introduced the concept of system response for analyzing the interactions of the functions of the reactor and <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> But it was Cho et al. (1996) who described the reactor-settling tank interaction in very comprehensive way. They used the sludge recycle ratio and sludge waste ratio as the operating parameters and obtained the responses of the output variables such as biomass concentration in aerator, dissolved pollutant and solid concentration in the effluent. Diehl and Jeppsson (1998) presented a dynamic simulation model of an activated sludge plant. For describing the continuous sedimentation in the secondary clarifier, a one-dimensional model based on non-linear partial differential equation was proposed. The analysis of the settling process lied on vigorous mathematical treatment of the equation. The Diehl-Jeppsson model, however, does not correlate the dynamics of the reactor to that of the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in a comprehensive way.|$|R
