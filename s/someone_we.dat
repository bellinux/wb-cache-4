The South African national cricket captain, Graeme Smith, said that he wanted Kieswetter to return to play cricket in South Africa; rather than directly inviting him to play for the South Africa national cricket team, he stated that [...] "the challenge is to get him back into our franchise system first, but he is certainly <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> have seen and would like {{to get back into the}} system". Kieswetter repeated his desire to play international cricket for England.|$|E

He compared her to Snooki {{of the reality}} television series Jersey Shore {{and said that the}} show has fallen under Jersey Shores [...] "drunken spell". He wrote: [...] "Regardless of who portrayed the character—because I have absolutely nothing against DeGarmo—why does Y need yet another big name stunt cast?" [...] Additionally, he said: [...] "every time I read something about the new character I find myself asking myself why, just why?" [...] DeGarmo said: [...] "Angelina nor I need to watch ‘Jersey Shore’ for pointers. But we are fans. Definitely Snooki is <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> look up to." ...|$|E

In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice.

500|$|Though McCotter {{had decided}} to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the {{majority}} of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. McCotter argued that [...] "somebody either panicked or it was sabotage... My gut tells me that we got lied to by <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> trusted." [...] Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it [...] "caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection," [...] but McCotter rejected this as an [...] "idiotic line of thinking." [...] He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation. The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Tripathi {{confirmed}} {{that from the}} next month he would start penning the third installment of the trilogy, The Oath of the Vayuputras. In January 2013, {{it was revealed that}} The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released on 27 February of the same year, by Westland Publishing. Tripathi explained that {{the final version of the}} book was longer than he had expected it to be, and consisted of 53chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. So yes, people will die in Vayuputras," [...] he concluded.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} acclaim from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an A-, {{praising the}} unlikely pairing of Bender and Hermes, writing: [...] "If I had {{to name a}} character on the show least likely to pluck at my heartstrings, Bender and Hermes would be {{near the top of}} the list...and yet they pulled it off. I'm not sure if Baby Bender violates continuity or not, but I don't care. It worked." [...] Handlen called the episode [...] "more thoughtful" [...] and also felt that the episode provided depth and growth to both Bender and Hermes without compromising characterization. [...] In the case of Hermes, Handlen stated, [...] "Hermes can be an obsessive, number-loving accountant, and still have that memory of his younger self saving Baby Bender from the trash heap. It works because the twist is the discovery of compassion in <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> liked and wanted to love." [...] Danny Gallagher of TVSquad felt that the episode marked the return of the Futuramas [...] "true sense of emotion," [...] comparing it to previous episodes like season four's [...] "Jurassic Bark". In particular, Gallagher noted the highly effective use of the Central Bureaucracy, stating that it allowed the show to use a Douglas Adams-feel. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects stated that the episode worked [...] "99.9%" [...] and that it recovered what he felt had been lacking from the previous episodes of season six. [...] While he disliked the opening Star Wars gag, he felt that the rest of the episode made up for it, stating that [...] "Lethal Inspection" [...] was [...] "by far, the funniest episode since the shows return. If the writers can keep this up, then my faith will have been fully restored." ...|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{portion of}} the {{audience}} criticized the writers for not directly confronting what Ziva had endured in captivity, believing that in doing so they had not properly addressed her trauma. When the Season 8 episode focusing on domestic abuse aired, Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic commented, [...] "What was most intriguing about the case was not the evidence or the unfolding mystery {{but the fact that}} this powerful woman, a Marine martial arts trainer, was an abuse victim. Sounds like <b>someone</b> <b>we</b> know. Ziva opened up to Georgia about similar abuse she suffered and made some inroads, although this could have been extrapolated upon further. It seemed like a prime opportunity for Ziva's character to shine - relating to a suspect similarly strong, powerful, yet vulnerable - but the plot quickly moved in other directions." [...] There were also complaints about the choice to partially rewrite the details of the earlier storyline surrounding Ziva's killing of her brother, which had served as her introduction to the series.|$|E

Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
