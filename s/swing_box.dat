40|$|The {{experimental}} task {{required the}} MTRNN system {{to learn the}} eight sensorimotor patterns: slide box left/right, <b>swing</b> <b>box,</b> lift box up/left/right, push/pull box. The Sequence Recorder module of Aquila was used to record these sensorimotor patterns while the experimenter was guiding the robot by holding its arms and performing the actions. •At {{the end of the}} training, the learned neural network was tested on the iCub in the same setup as that during the tutoring part. The results showed that the MTRNN system was able to replicate all the eight sequences while successfully manipulating the object. Testing the trained MTRNN system on the iCub humanoid robot in an object manipulation task scenario. •Our preliminary benchmark tests showed 12 x speedup of the training algorithm and 75 x speed-up of the neural network forward pass when using GPUs and MTRNN with 336 neurons...|$|E

50|$|The {{aluminum}} disk was twenty-two {{inches in}} diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just {{over a quarter of}} an inch in thickness. The traversing wheel was eighteen {{inches in diameter}} with a 1.5 in working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was clamped between cast iron members supporting the strawboard rings inside and clamping them sideways. This fibrous friction wheel is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in <b>swinging</b> <b>boxes</b> so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum-faced driving disk, which is motor driven.|$|R
50|$|This {{directional}} effect {{is intended to}} interact with the room acoustics to add interest to the sound, {{in much the same way}} as an acoustic guitarist may <b>swing</b> the <b>box</b> around on a final sustain, or the rotating baffle of a Leslie speaker will spin the sound around the room.|$|R
60|$|More {{than one}} of those present knew just what Ben could do if he should <b>swing</b> that <b>box</b> around in defence of any one who was being imposed upon, and they {{concluded}} {{that it was not}} best to discuss the matter any further. The crowd fell back, and Paul was safe, for a short time, at least.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can <b>swing</b> clubs, and <b>box,</b> and fence," [...] she cried, {{successively}} {{striking the}} typical postures; [...] "and swim, and make high dives, chin a bar twenty times, and--and walk on my hands. There!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The correct English name {{should be}} [...] "wooden galloper with a {{free-standing}} cargo box" [...] since said device walks in a gallop form. It {{was equipped with}} two handles to make it walk by manpower. The <b>swing</b> cargo <b>box</b> is used to store useless work caused by the up-and-down motion of the walking machine. When the cargo box swung forward, the walking machine steps forward {{at the same time}} to raise efficiency. This invention was specifically mentioned in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Records of Three Kingdoms, Book of Qi, and some other works from the Song Dynasty.|$|R
50|$|Lovebirds {{require an}} {{appropriately}} sized cage or aviary. Minimum recommended space per bird is 1m×1m×1m. Lovebird's beaks {{are made of}} keratin, which grows continuously. Chewing and destroying wood toys and perches helps to keep beaks trim. Cuttlebones help provide beak-trimming {{and a source of}} calcium and other necessary minerals. Natural perches and special rough surfaced perches of varying diameters placed at different levels in the cage will allow greater climbing mobility and gives them a choice to select the most comfortable spot to roost. They also require plenty of toys, such as willow branches, <b>swings,</b> tunnels, <b>boxes</b> and safe things to chew on and play with.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 August 2012, {{an article}} {{appeared}} in Australian newspapers titled [...] "Punch Drunk: Ireland intoxicated as Taylor <b>swings</b> towards <b>boxing</b> gold". The article claimed that Katie Taylor was not [...] "what you'd {{expect in a}} fighting Irishwoman, nor is she surrounded by people who'd prefer a punch to a potato". The journalist who wrote it apologised for [...] "indulging racial stereotypes". The following day, Australian commentator Russell Barwick asserted that athletes from Ireland should compete for the British Olympic team, likening it to [...] "an Hawaiian surfer not surfing for the USA". When fellow presenter Mark Chapman explained that the Republic of Ireland was an independent state, Barwick remarked: [...] "It's nothing but an Irish joke".|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Green {{has also}} {{always been a}} welcome place for children. A {{playground}} was built in 1929 in a grove of trees, which included slides, <b>swings,</b> and sand <b>boxes.</b> It is reported that the 1929 Chairman of the House Committee said, ”As everyone knows, the formative years are the best ones for learning the ancient and honorable game…By all means, let {{the boys and girls}} grow up in a wholesome atmosphere of golf.” ...|$|R
50|$|Magnuson Park {{is home to}} Seattle's biggest playground, the Junior League of Seattle Children's Playground {{which was}} designed, {{developed}} and funded {{through the efforts of}} the Junior League of Seattle, a women's leadership and volunteer organization. Opened in 1999 and spearheaded by prominent Seattle resident, Mary Herche, the Playground celebrated its 10th anniversary on Saturday, May 16, 2009, where children played in the 20000 sq ft of colorful climbing walls, sand <b>box,</b> <b>swings,</b> slides and much more.|$|R
50|$|New Coach Stiehm {{came out}} of the <b>box</b> <b>swinging,</b> scoring nearly as many points as were posted in Nebraska's {{previous}} game to end the prior season. Unlike the closing against Haskell in 1910, however, coach Stiehm played backups and substitutes to help establish the starters for the season and yet still piled up an astonishing 117 points, just 2 points shy of the 119-0 record set the year before and resulting the Cornhuskers outscoring their opponents 236-0 in the previous two games. This was the only time Kearney State would face off with the Cornhuskers.|$|R
60|$|In an evil hour {{we went to}} {{the yard}} window and looked out. We saw a quiet scene. The McGinnis dog was still sitting on his {{haunches}} by the steps, just as he had been sitting all the morning. Down in the McGinnis yard everything wore an unusually peaceful aspect. Only one McGinnis was in sight--Tony, aged eight, who was perched up {{on the edge of the}} well <b>box,</b> <b>swinging</b> his legs and singing at the top of his melodious Irish voice. All at once, just as we were looking at him, Tony went over backward and apparently tumbled head foremost down his father's well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} in an [...] "H" [...] shape, with the auditorium in the back. The original plan situated that 5 acre would be dedicated to a play area with three playgrounds, with one for younger children of both sexes, one for older boys, and one for older girls, {{as well as a}} basketball court, a baseball diamond for students of both sexes, gymnastic equipment, jumping pits, a track, sand <b>boxes,</b> <b>swings</b> for smaller children, and a volleyball court. The playground for smaller children was to be located {{in the center of the}} play area tract, the playground for older boys was to be located on the south side of the play tract, and the playground for older girls was to be located on the north side of the play tract. The plan called for trees to be planted parallel to sidewalks along Avalon Road, Kirby Drive, and San Felipe Road. The auditorium was built square-shaped.|$|R
50|$|When an IH {{vehicle was}} ordered, a factory build or {{construction}} sheet was created (when {{the order was}} sent to the factory) with the new vehicle's VIN or ID number, and all the codes for standard equipment and options that the salesman used to create this vehicle for his customer or inventory. This sheet was used to assemble the vehicle from beginning to finish. After the factory assembled the vehicle and the vehicle was shipped and sold, the Line Setting Ticket identified such things as the engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment specific to that vehicle. This was and still is a very valuable tool when ordering parts later at the dealership by the customer. There were different parts used on the same model in the same year. A very small copy of the Line Ticket was attached to each vehicle during the building process at the factory. The location of the ticket varied: 1971-1976 Scout II's had their Line Ticket copies mounted under their hoods, attached to the cowl cover panels. 1977-1980 Scout II's had their copies {{on the inside of the}} glove box doors. 1969-1975 pickups and Travelalls had them attached to the back of the glove boxes; depressing the keeper tabs on each side of the box lets the <b>box</b> <b>swing</b> down to reveal the Line Setting Ticket. If lost, Lineset tickets can be ordered through several Scout parts specialists, thanks to their diligence in maintaining these valuable resources.|$|R
