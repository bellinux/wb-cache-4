These marks are associated to high profile crimes such as drug dealing, murder and harassment. Following the application of forensic enhancement techniques by the CSI or the crime lab, one of the marks could be directly analysed on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> and the others were analysed as primary lifts.

These four casework examples are to be considered a first insight into the limitations, benefits and feasibility of MALDI MS based methods in the field; due to the extreme variability {{in the state of the}} mark, comprehensive evaluation of these aspects can only be undertaken upon the analysis of a large number of crime scene marks.

40|$|Purpose - The paper aims {{to predict}} the <b>surface</b> {{roughness}} <b>of</b> fused <b>deposition</b> modelling prototypes. Since average roughness is not comprehensive, this study aims to extend the characterization to all the roughness parameters obtainable by a profilometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model of the 3 D profile is supplied {{as a function of}} process parameters and part shape. A suitable geometry was designed and prototyped for validation. Data were measured by a profilometer and complemented by microscopic analysis. A methodology based on the proposed model was applied to optimise prototype fabrication in two practical cases. Findings - The proposed profile is effective in describing the micro-geometrical <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> fused <b>deposition</b> modelling prototypes. The third dimension enables the calculation of amplitude, spatial and hybrid roughness parameters. Research limitations/implications - Because of mathematical assumptions and technological aspects, the validity of the model presents limitations related to the deposition angle. Practical implications - The method is an effective tool in the process planning stage: it enables knowing in advance how to assure part specifications delivering a set of technical choices. Two practical applications point out the usability in the product development and process parameters optimisation.

40|$|The {{management}} of mineral scale {{is a challenge}} in many industrial fields and environmental issues relating to eutrophication are leading industry to develop environmentally-friendly solutions to scale control. The determination of the strategy of inhibition is a real challenge as many factors influence the formation of calcium carbonate formation and affect the performance of scale inhibitors. The processes of CaC 03 formation on a surface have been studied. The mechanisms of inhibition of three green (Carboxymethyl Inulin, CMI, Polymaleic acid, PMA and Polyaspartic acid, PA) and one conventional (Polyphosphinocarboxylic acid, PPCA) scale inhibitors of calcium carbonate nucleation and growth have been investigated. The interactions between the chemicals and the surface have been studied by chronoamperometry. The use of surface analysis enabled these interactions to be characterised. The in-situ electrochemical flow cell permitted the characterisation of the crystals formed (size, number and surface coverage of the electrode) and the affinity of the chemicals to inhibit the nucleation and/or the growth to be determined. Important information on the different effects of scale inhibitors on CaC 03 polymorphs has been found by use of Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD) as an in-situ method for crystal characterisation. The inhibitors partly inhibit the deposition of CaC 03 by forming a film on the deposition surface. The interactions between the inhibitors and the metal surface occur via the cations Ca 2 + and/or Mg 2 +. The adsorption of the chemicals on the crystals ofCaC 03 has been investigated {{and it appears that}} the PPCA, PMA and PA act by blocking the growth sites of the crystals. Each inhibitor exhibits an affinity to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> and with the CaC 03 crystals but to a different extent resulting in different inhibition efficiencies. The PPCA affected greatly the deposition of CaC 03 and PA and PMA exhibited similar effects. Nevertheless the PA is more efficient when it is present during the nucleation step or early crystallisation whereas PMA acts more during the growth process. The SXRD permitted three steps of growth to be detected in the non-inhibited case and PMA, PA, CMI act by reducing the growth of the different planes whereas the PPCA totally inhibited two main crystal planes (the aragonite (032) and the vaterite (300 » and an acceleration of the growth of the calcite C(006) and of the aragonite A(Ill) was observed...|$|E

It was shown that at <b>surface</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> aluminium alloys interstices, arising at hydrogen bubbles formation in the weld pool lat the moment of its crystallization are the most probable defects. An additional source of hydrogen supply into the weld pool springs up at <b>surface</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> aluminium alloys-this is the powder electrode charge. So, a model of formation of gas bubbles with due regard to this factor was developed. Presence <b>of</b> various <b>surface</b> defects, like cavities, shears, and micro-cracks is a factor, promoting formation of gaseous hydrogen phase inside a drop of electrode metal. Further development of gas bubbles, entrapped into the weld pool goes on by their consolidation and hydrogen diffusion from the molten metal into gaseous section. Intensification of bubble degassing, both at the stage of molten metal drop and at the welding pool stage is the most efficient way. The process of degassing depends on the amount of hydrogen, introduced into the weld pool. Proposed was an analytical dependence of evaluation of the original hydrogen concentration in the weld pool upon the coefficient of powder wire filling and dimensions of the charge particles. Experimental research of the influence of the parameters of powder wire upon the porosity of deposited metal made it possible to determine an optimal range of charge granulation and the coefficient of powder wire filling, ensuring intensive degassing during the period of its existence in liquid state and reaching deposited metal with sufficient densit...|$|R
