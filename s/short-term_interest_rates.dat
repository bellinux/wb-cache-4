40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 33 - 36). This paper {{presents the}} results of Gaussian estimation of the South African <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> It uses the same Gaussian estimation techniques employed by Nowman (1997) to estimate the South African <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> using South afrcan Treasury bill data. A range of single-factor continuous-time models of the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> are estimated using a discrete-time model and compared to a discrete approximation used by Chan, Karolyi, Lonstaff and Sanders (1992 a). We find that the process followed by the South African <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is best explained by the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model and that the conditional volatility depends to some extent on the level of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> In addition we find evidence of a structural break in the mid- 1980 s, confirming our suspicions that the financial liberalisation of that period affected the short rate process...|$|R
25|$|Inflation {{levels and}} trends: Typically a {{currency}} will lose value {{if there is}} a high level of inflation in the country or if inflation levels are perceived to be rising. This is because inflation erodes purchasing power, thus demand, for that particular currency. However, a currency may sometimes strengthen when inflation rises because of expectations that the central bank will raise <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to combat rising inflation.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} position (<b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{higher than}} long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for UK Government bonds was partially inverted. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative liquidity premiums can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing {{view is that}} a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only the anticipation of falling interest rates will cause an inverted yield curve. Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic depressions.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{received}} an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, {{although it was}} not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall {{in the value of the}} U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, foreign direct investment (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8billion for 2007. Inflation monitoring and control currently plays a major part in the Central bank's role of setting out <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> as a monetary policy measure.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E
25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer {{the biggest}} primary {{impact of the}} New Deal {{on the economy and}} the key to {{recovery}} and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> remained close to zero. Before March 1933 people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the possible existing causal relationship among the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rate and budget deficit in their level logarithmic form. First, it summarizes {{a body of}} theoretical and empirical views about these relationships. Second, it investigates the causal relationships among the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rate and budget deficit by using the VAR models with the MWALD test for causality associated with two lag variables in each proposition. The data {{in this study is}} yearly observations for a 33 -year period (1981 to 2014) from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Canada. The main findings of the paper is that: (1) it was observed that the variables were found to be nonstationary; (2) it was revealed that there are no directional causality relationships in its level form among the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rate and budget deficit in the Canadian economy over that period. These imply that a budget deficit is a symptom of other economic variables; rather, than a cause of the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and inflation rate. Thus, if the goal of policymakers is to reduce the inflation rate and increase output, we should look to more direct problems than focusing on controlling the budget deficit...|$|R

2500|$|An {{inverted}} {{yield curve}} {{is often a}} harbinger of recession. [...] A positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of inflationary growth.

2500|$|Another {{factor was}} {{the efforts of}} the Federal Reserve to wring {{inflation}} out of the economy, marked by Paul Volcker's speech of October 6, 1979, with a series of rises in <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> This led to a scenario in which increases in the short-term cost of funding were higher than the return on portfolios of mortgage loans, a large proportion of which may have been fixed-rate mortgages (a problem that is known as an asset-liability mismatch). Interest rates continued to rise, placing even more pressure on S as the 1980s dawned and led to increased focus on high interest-rate transactions.

2500|$|Academics {{had to play}} {{catch up}} with {{practitioners}} in this matter. One important theoretic development came from a Czech mathematician, Oldrich Vasicek, who argued in a 1977 paper that bond prices all along the curve are driven by the short end (under risk neutral equivalent martingale measure) and accordingly by <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> [...] The mathematical model for Vasicek's work was given by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, but has since been discredited because the model predicts a positive probability that the short rate becomes negative and is inflexible in creating yield curves of different shapes. [...] Vasicek's model has been superseded by many different models including the Hull–White model (which allows for time varying parameters in the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process), the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model, which is a modified Bessel process, and the Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework.

40|$|The causal {{relations}} and dynamic interactions among macroeconomic variables and {{stock market index}} are important {{in the formulation of}} a country’s macroeconomic policy. In this study, to investigate the lead-lag relationship between stock market index and macroeconomic variables, we employ several conventional time-series techniques and a recently introduced method – wavelet analysis - to economics and finance. The data used in this paper is the monthly data of the selected macroeconomic variables such as (1) Kuala Lumpur Composite Index, (2) exchange rate, (3) inflation, (4) government bond yield, (5) <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and (6) export over the period of January 1996 to September 2013. Our findings tend to suggest that a cointegrating relationship does exist between KLCI and selected macroeconomic variables. The results of the error correction model, the generalized variance decompositions as well as the wavelet cross-correlation analysis suggest that the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> KLCI and government bond yields are exogenous variables; especially, the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is the most leading variable. Policy makers may concentrate on the adjustment and control of the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in order to achieve the desired results for the target economic variables. ...|$|R

2500|$|From the post-Great Depression era to the present, {{the yield}} curve has usually been [...] "normal" [...] meaning that yields rise as {{maturity}} lengthens (i.e., {{the slope of}} the yield curve is positive). [...] This positive slope reflects investor expectations for the economy to grow in the future and, importantly, for this growth to be associated with a greater expectation that inflation will rise in the future rather than fall. [...] This expectation of higher inflation leads to expectations that the central bank will tighten monetary policy by raising <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the future to slow economic growth and dampen inflationary pressure. [...] It also creates a need for a risk premium associated with the uncertainty about the future rate of inflation and the risk this poses to the future value of cash flows. Investors price these risks into the yield curve by demanding higher yields for maturities further into the future. In a positively sloped yield curve, lenders profit from the passage of time since yields decrease as bonds get closer to maturity (as yield decreases, price increases); this is known as rolldown and is a significant component of profit in fixed-income investing (i.e., buying and selling, not necessarily holding to maturity), particularly if the investing is leveraged.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{entering}} office, Obama {{focused on}} handling {{the global financial}} crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The tax provisions of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second stimulus bill passed. Obama also launched a second bailout of US automakers, possibly saving General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy {{at the cost of}} $9.3 billion. For homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgage due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013. <b>Short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> remained near zero for much of Obama's presidency, and the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates during Obama's presidency until December 2015.|$|E
2500|$|According to the explanation, {{excessive}} monetary liquidity (easy credit, large disposable incomes) potentially occurs while fractional reserve {{banks are}} implementing {{expansionary monetary policy}} (i.e. lowering of interest rates and flushing the financial system with money supply); this explanation may differ in certain details according to economic philosophy. [...] Those who believe the money supply is controlled exogenously by a central bank may attribute an 'expansionary monetary policy' to said bank and (should one exist) a governing body or institution; others {{who believe that the}} money supply is created endogenously by the banking sector may attribute such a 'policy' with the behavior of the financial sector itself, and view the state as a passive or reactive factor. [...] This may determine how central or relatively minor/inconsequential policies like fractional reserve banking and the central bank's efforts to raise or lower <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are to one's view on the creation, inflation and ultimate implosion of an economic bubble. [...] Explanations focusing on interest rates tend to take on a common form, however: When interest rates are set excessively low, (regardless of the mechanism by which it is accomplished) investors tend to avoid putting their capital into savings accounts. Instead, investors tend to leverage their capital by borrowing from banks and invest the leveraged capital in financial assets such as stocks and real estate. [...] Risky leveraged behavior like speculation and Ponzi schemes can lead to an increasingly fragile economy, and may also be part of what pushes asset prices artificially upward until the bubble pops.|$|E
