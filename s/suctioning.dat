At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are {{an important source of}} food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs.

25|$|Supraglottic airway — a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any {{airway device}} that is seated above {{and outside the}} trachea, as an {{alternative}} to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for <b>suctioning</b> or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia. There are many types of SGAs available including the Esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC), Laryngeal tube (LT), and the obsolete Esophageal obturator airway (EOA).|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{shrinkage}} cracking {{of concrete}} {{occurs when the}} stresses arising in the concrete, due {{to a combination of}} <b>suction</b> and restraints of deformation such as reinforcement or formwork, equal its strength. However, three different types of <b>suctions</b> should be distinguished, namely total, matric and osmotic <b>suctions.</b> Although the total <b>suction</b> comprises matric and osmotic <b>suctions,</b> it is often used interchangeably with matric <b>suction,</b> with the underlying unconfirmed assumption that either the osmotic <b>suction</b> or its effect is negligible. In this paper, after a discussion of the pore moisture <b>suctions</b> and strength of unsaturated early-age concrete, experimental investigations of the <b>suctions</b> arising in, and the tensile strength and shear strength of, fly ash mixed with solutions of different osmotic <b>suctions</b> are described. It was found that osmotic <b>suction</b> has negligible effect on the shear and tensile strength, and hence, by inference, the inter-particle stresses in the fly ash mixture and early-age concrete. This strongly suggests that the role played by osmotic <b>suction</b> in the plastic shrinkage cracking of concrete is minimal and, accordingly, justifies the focus of earlier researchers on matric <b>suction</b> only...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of high wave action. There are myriad {{ways in which the}} organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of <b>suctioning</b> tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|E
500|$|When {{being used}} in a {{drafting}} operation from a pool, portable water tank, or other uncovered water source, the length of hard suction hose farthest from the pump is usually attached to a strainer, to keep foreign objects in the water from being pulled into and damaging the pump.

In the UFD technique, relatively tightly spaced, useful crossflow vortices are excited once, grow to nonlinearly large amplitudes due to primary instability, and deform the baseflow thus suppressing otherwise naturally growing, nocent vortices with larger spanwise spacing, and do not cause secondary instability that otherwise rapidly invokes turbulence.

[...] Chest physical therapy makes use of techniques such as breathing exercises, stimulation of coughing, <b>suctioning,</b> percussion, movement, vibration, and drainage to rid the lungs of secretions, increase oxygenation, and expand collapsed parts of the lungs. People with pulmonary contusion, especially those who do not respond well to other treatments, may be positioned with the uninjured lung lower than the injured one to improve oxygenation. Inadequate pulmonary toilet can result in pneumonia. People who do develop infections are given antibiotics. No studies have yet shown a benefit of using antibiotics as a preventative measure before infection occurs, although some doctors do recommend prophylactic antibiotic use even without scientific evidence of its benefit. However, this can cause the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, so giving antibiotics without a clear need is normally discouraged.

In terms of <b>suction</b> control methods, the high <b>suction</b> level (from 3. 29 to 38 MPa) was realized by the vapor equilibrium technique and the low <b>suction</b> level (from 0 to 800 kPa) was controlled by the axis translation technique. Results of the triaxial tests indicate that the specimen with higher <b>suction</b> shows higher strength and lower contractive and higher dilative volumetric strains, and the average skeleton stress ratio (q/p=) at failure decreases with increasing <b>suction</b> in the high <b>suction</b> range (3. 29 ~ 38 MPa).

Experimental results also show that high pre-applied <b>suction</b> (i. e., the maximum <b>suction</b> in the history) can lead to peak strength, post-peak softening, and shear dilation. Three different methods (pressure plate, filter paper, and vapor equilibrium) were employed to study the soil-water retention behaviour of the unsaturated expansive soil.

These rotary vane pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute.
