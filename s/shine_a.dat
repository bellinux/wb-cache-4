5|$|The Rolling Stones {{performances}} at New York City's Beacon Theatre on 29 October and 1 November 2006 were filmed by Martin Scorsese for a documentary film, <b>Shine</b> <b>a</b> Light, which {{was released in}} 2008. The film also features guest appearances by Buddy Guy, Jack White, and Christina Aguilera. An accompanying soundtrack, also titled <b>Shine</b> <b>a</b> Light (UK 2; US 11), was released in April 2008. The album's debut at No. 2 in the UK charts was the highest position for a Rolling Stones concert album since Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. At the Beacon Theater show, Music Executive, Ahmet Ertegun fell and ultimately succumbed to his injury.|$|E
5|$|Several live {{recordings}} of the song have been released. The 1977 double album Love You Live features a version recorded on 7 June 1976 at Les Abattoirs, Paris, France. The 2008 release <b>Shine</b> <b>a</b> Light captures a New York City performance of the song from the 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour, while a July 2013 performance in London's Hyde Park is included in Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce <b>shine,</b> <b>a</b> wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to <b>shine</b> <b>a</b> beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Smith {{would put}} the seer stone into a hat, and put {{his face in the}} hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the {{darkness}} the spiritual light would <b>shine.</b> <b>A</b> piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing.

Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.|$|E

The new CD To Ella (recorded live and dedicated to her friend Ella Fitzgerald upon hearing of her death before walking on stage), was released in 1998 on Silverwolf Records, followed by three releases on M.C. Records in partnership with pianist/arranger/producer Seth Farber and record producer Mark Carpentieri.

25|$|The {{project has}} used crowd-sourcing to create maps which show where sexual assault has taken place. In 2012, Women Under Siege {{put out a}} call to people from Syria and those working with Syrian {{refugees}} {{to provide information about}} rape and sexual assault. The entries were created by collecting information from journalists, human rights activists and individual citizens. Some the reports came via email or by Twitter with the hashtag #RapeinSyria. Women Under Siege mapped these incidents, providing over 117 pieces of data for each entry. The data was documented in real time, using a software developed by Ushahidi. The data was analyzed and put together in a comprehensive report that details a huge amount of human suffering. Not only did the information <b>shine</b> <b>a</b> light on the problem, it also uncovered unexpected findings. For example, the data revealed that Syrian government forces were also largely responsible for much of the sexual violence.|$|E
