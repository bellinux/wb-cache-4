5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a <b>shaved</b> <b>head,</b> which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E

25|$|Some men shave their heads, {{either as}} a fashion statement, because they find a <b>shaved</b> <b>head</b> {{preferable}} to the appearance of male pattern baldness, or in order to attain enhanced cooling of the skull – particularly for people suffering from hyperhidrosis.

Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks of Classical {{times are}} said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale {{transposition}} cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's <b>shaved</b> <b>head</b> and concealed under the regrown hair. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.|$|E

500|$|With {{the open}} game world, Rocksteady {{included}} more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange {{was selected as}} a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman [...] "vulnerable and exposed {{in a way that}} he has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a <b>shaved</b> <b>head</b> and contemporary costume design that were intended to move away from his traditional [...] "Boy Wonder" [...] image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: [...] "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The <b>shaved</b> <b>head</b> is inspired by cage fighters, because we thought that Robin might be doing that in his spare time to keep him on his toes. Still, we kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." [...] Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.|$|E

500|$|In Soul Edge, Li Long {{appears as}} a tall, Asian male with his brown hair tied in a knot atop his head with long, thick sideburns. His facial contours, {{expressions}} and hairdo were designed to be sharp, intended to suggest the [...] "assassin" [...] side of his character, as well as imply the image of Chinese culture in the character. A large light brown jacket with green trimming covers his arms, while a large belt wraps around his midsection. Dark brown pants ending in white trimming cover his legs, and blue and white stripped shoes cover his feet. His alternate character model varies significantly, featuring a <b>shaved</b> <b>head,</b> blue and gray vest with an open collar, small gold belt, green pants, and blue and red striped shoes. Li Long stands [...] tall.|$|E
500|$|The creature's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} {{an image of a}} woman with a henna-tattooed back that Kripke found on the internet. He thought it would be intriguing to have the villain's entire body tattooed. The actor who portrayed the djinnMackenzie Grayhad a <b>shaved</b> <b>head,</b> so special effects makeup artist Toby Lindala only used a minor prosthetic to cover Gray's eyebrows. Lindala found the tattoos to be a [...] "particular challenge" [...] because they were [...] "intricate designs". [...] The production schedule could not accommodate the six hours needed to apply the makeup each day, so the actor was booked with the condition that the make-up not be removed for four days. Gray's personal life was affected by this, as people on the street were scared by his appearance. Lindala was surprised that Gray was able to keep the tattoos undamaged outside of filming.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, the Pumpkins {{undertook}} {{an extended}} world tour {{in support of}} Mellon Collie. Corgan's look during this period—a <b>shaved</b> <b>head,</b> a longsleeve black shirt with the word [...] "Zero" [...] printed on it, and silver pants—became iconic. That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons, [...] "Homerpalooza". With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and [...] "Zero" [...] shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were {{considered one of the}} most popular bands of the time. But the year was far from entirely positive for the band. In May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band's repeated requests for moshing to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O'Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her. However, while Corgan maintained that moshing's [...] "time [...] come and gone", the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.|$|E

500|$|Like all Silent Hill games, one of Silent Hill 3s {{influences}} is {{the film}} Jacob's Ladder: {{one of the}} subway platforms is named Bergen Street Station, the station Jacob was inquiring about {{at the beginning of}} the film. The developers also cited horror writer Stephen King as another of their influences. Silent Hill 3 incorporates references drawn from real life actors and actresses. Douglas Cartland's name came from American actor Douglas Fairbanks. The developers stated that his name [...] "just seemed to suit him" [...] and that there was no true connection to his namesake. During the sketching process, his character was modeled after actors Giancarlo Giannini and Ian Holm. It was noted that even during the concept designs that Cartland was designed as a middle-aged detective. Claudia Wolf's character was considered the most difficult to design. Early sketches revealed that the creators wanted to dress her like a holy woman, and at one point she had a <b>shaved</b> <b>head,</b> with her body covered with tattoos, however, the creators thought that this way of showing her malevolent side was too obvious. Eventually, the creators decided to model her on Julianne Moore, and then remove her eyebrows, so that the appearance was slightly skewed. She was first named [...] "Christie", but it was deemed too [...] "cute" [...] and the character was eventually named after Italian actress Claudia Cardinale. Vincent's name originated from actor Vincent Gallo in connection with his unshaven look. Early designs were based on actor Ethan Hawke and focused on capturing a look of [...] "derangement and moodiness." ...|$|E
