Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed [...] "the {{superior}} instrumental quality, well-done arrangements, and tasteful {{selection of}} themes boost the [...] qualities while hiding its flaws", elaborating that [...] "even people <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> who are not fans of the original will be impressed by its prowess, and fans will simply be enamored". Neal Chandran of RPGFan was similarly impressed, {{saying that it was}} [...] "a very good soundtrack" [...] and that its tracks sounded [...] "more beautiful than the original version". His primary complaint was that he would have liked for the album to include more pieces.|$|E

[...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fry has {{repeatedly}} expressed opposition to organised religion, and has {{identified himself as}} an atheist and humanist, while declaring some sympathy for the ancient Greek belief in capricious gods. In his first autobiography he described how he once considered ordination to the Anglican priesthood, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he [...] "couldn't believe in God, because [...] was fundamentally Hellenic in [...] outlook." [...] He has stated that religion can have positive effects: [...] "Sometimes belief means credulity, sometimes an expression of faith and hope which even the most sceptical atheist <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> cannot but find inspiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Clinton's {{tenure as}} Secretary of State was popular {{at the time}} among the public and praised by President Obama, {{observers}} have noted {{that there was no}} signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of Dean Acheson, George Marshall, or Henry Kissinger. The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left. Many of Clinton's initiatives in the [...] "smart power" [...] realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect. Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that [...] "She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy." [...] Michael E. O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution analyst, said that, [...] "Even an admirer, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [...] more solid than spectacular." [...] Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled , former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney argue that Clinton's tenure, and the Obama administration's foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since World War II. Others, however, such as Eric Schmidt disagree, and have argued that Clinton was [...] "perhaps the most significant secretary of state since" [...] Acheson. All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, [...] "She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do." ...|$|E

60|$|Now I am {{not going}} to set out all the {{military}} details that preceded the massacre of Isandhlwana, for these are written in history. It is enough to say that on the night of January 21, Major Dartnell, who was in command of the Natal Mounted Police and had been sent out to reconnoitre the country beyond Isandhlwana, reported a strong force of Zulus in front of us. Thereon Lord Chelmsford, the General-in-Chief, moved out from the camp at dawn to his support, taking with him six companies of the 24th regiment, together with four guns and the mounted infantry. There were left in the camp two guns and about eight hundred white and nine hundred native troops, also some transport riders <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> and a number of miscellaneous camp-followers. I saw him go from between the curtains of one of my wagons where I had made my bed {{on the top of a}} pile of baggage. Indeed I had already dressed myself at the time, for that night I slept very ill because I knew our danger, and my heart was heavy with fear.|$|E
6000|$|Of real sensational journalism, as {{it exists}} in France, in Ireland, and in America, we have no trace in this country. When a {{journalist}} in Ireland wishes to create a thrill, he creates a thrill worth talking about. He denounces a leading Irish member for corruption, or he charges the whole police system with a wicked and definite conspiracy. When a French journalist desires a frisson there is a frisson; he discovers, let us say, that the President of the Republic has murdered three wives. Our yellow journalists invent quite as unscrupulously as this; their moral condition is, as regards careful veracity, about the same. But it is their mental calibre {{which happens to be}} such that they can only invent calm and even reassuring things. The fictitious version of the massacre of the envoys of Pekin was mendacious, but it was not interesting, except to those who had private reasons for terror or sorrow. It was not connected with any bold and suggestive view of the Chinese situation. It revealed only a vague idea that nothing could be impressive except a great deal of blood. Real sensationalism, of which I happen to be very fond, may be either moral or immoral. But even when it is most immoral, it requires moral courage. For {{it is one of the}} most dangerous things on earth genuinely to surprise anybody. If you make any sentient creature jump, you render it by no means improbable that it will jump on you. But the leaders of this movement have no moral courage or immoral courage; their whole method consists in saying, with large and elaborate emphasis, the things which everybody else says casually, and without remembering what they have said. When they brace themselves up to attack anything, they never reach the point of attacking anything which is large and real, and would resound with the shock. They do not attack the army as men do in France, or the judges as men do in Ireland, or the democracy itself as men did in England a hundred years ago. They attack something like the War Office--something, that is, which everybody attacks and nobody bothers to defend, something which is an old joke in fourth-rate comic papers. just as a man shows he has a weak voice by straining it to shout, so they show the hopelessly unsensational nature of their minds when they really try to be sensational. With the whole world full of big and dubious institutions, with the whole wickedness of civilization staring them in the face, their idea of being bold and bright is to attack the War Office. They might as well start a campaign against the weather, or form a secret society in order to make jokes about mothers-in-law. Nor is it only from the point of view of particular amateurs of the sensational <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> that it is permissible to say, in the words of Cowper's Alexander Selkirk, that [...] "their tameness is shocking to me." [...] The whole modern world is pining for a genuinely sensational journalism. This has been discovered by that very able and honest journalist, Mr. Blatchford, who started his campaign against Christianity, warned on all sides, I believe, that it would ruin his paper, but who continued from an honourable sense of intellectual responsibility. He discovered, however, that while he had undoubtedly shocked his readers, he had also greatly advanced his newspaper. It was bought--first, by all the people who agreed with him and wanted to read it; and secondly, by all the people who disagreed with him, and wanted to write him letters. Those letters were voluminous (I helped, I am glad to say, to swell their volume), and they were generally inserted with a generous fulness. Thus was accidentally discovered (like the steam-engine) the great journalistic maxim--that if an editor can only make people angry enough, they will write half his newspaper for him for nothing.|$|E
