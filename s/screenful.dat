The structure is shown pictorially as an inverted tree with the data considered as ‘leaves’ of the tree, accessed via ‘branches’ which serve as a means of classifying the information. There exists quite a lot of jargon regarding such structures but in order to appreciate the concept it is necessary to mention just the node, page and frame. Nodes are the junction pages in the tree at which a number of choices can be made leading to other nodes or to the information itself. Pages are the final levels in the tree and contain the actual data-these may be divided into frames which are really <b>screenfuls</b> of information.|$|R

You are viewing a gene sequence in Entrez, {{and you want to}} find whether it contains a particular sequence motif.

Subsequently, your favorite sequence analysis software informs you that there is an interesting feature at position 13982 – 14013. By painstakingly counting the 10 bp blocks, you are able to examine the sequence at this location.

50|$|In {{languages}} written horizontally, such as most Western languages, text documents {{longer than}} will {{fit on the}} screen are often displayed wrapped and sized to fit the screen width, and scrolled vertically to bring desired content into view. It is possible to display lines too long to fit the display without wrapping, scrolling horizontally to view each entire line. However, this requires inconvenient constant line-by-line scrolling, while vertical scrolling is only needed after reading a full <b>screenful.</b>|$|E

50|$|In a WIMP-style {{graphical}} {{user interface}} (GUI), user-controlled scrolling is carried out by manipulating a scrollbar with a mouse, or using keyboard shortcuts, often the arrow keys. Scrolling is often supported by text user interfaces and command line interfaces. Older computer terminals changed the entire contents of the display one <b>screenful</b> ("page") at a time; this paging mode requires fewer resources than scrolling. Scrolling displays often also support page mode. Typically certain keys or key combinations page up or down; on PC-compatible keyboards the page up and page down keys or the space bar are used; earlier computers often used control key combinations. Some computer mice have a scroll wheel, which scrolls the display, often vertically, when rolled; others have scroll balls or tilt wheels which allow both vertical and horizontal scrolling.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in late March 1993, Prevue Networks {{overhauled}} the Prevue Guide software, {{this time}} to modernize its appearance. Still operating on the same Amiga 2000 hardware, the old grid's black background with white text separated by colored lines {{gave way to a}} new, embossed-looking navy blue grid featuring 90 minutes of scheduling information for each channel. Arrow symbols were added to listings for programs whose start or end times stretched beyond that timeframe, and for viewer convenience, local cable operators could now configure the grid's scrolling action to momentarily pause for up to four seconds after each <b>screenful</b> of listings. Additionally, local cable operators could enable light grey sports and movie summaries within the grid. Appearing between each listings cycle, these showed all films and sporting events airing on any channel during the next 90 minutes.|$|E

In modern software, typing text usually causes previous text to scroll {{off the top of}} the screen or window. Some old programs could disable this and restart at the top of the window when scroll lock was pressed. The advantage is that the entire <b>screenful</b> of text does not shift, making it easier to read. Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its line and scroll the work area under it. In spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, it locks the cell pointer on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the view window without moving the cell pointer. On some consoles (such as the Linux console), it prevents scrolling of messages until another key combination is pressed. Many hardware KVM switches use Scroll Lock to switch between the devices they control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper advocates using HTML for {{representing}} Computer Science lectures. This technology {{should be}} at least as good as popular presentation-packages such as Microsoft PowerPoint, being able to handle multimedia. Beyond that, HTML can conveniently handle material in chunks larger than a <b>screenful,</b> it can be used in more computer-systems, and it is more extensible. This paper further presents a package which formats lectures in HTML. Features of this package particularly suited for lectures include: (i) enabling private lecturenotes to be interspersed with the lecture-materials that will be publicly displayed, and (ii) arranging for some texts to be filled in during presentations of lectures, which induces students to be somewhat involved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a computer program}} designed to look for similarities between pairs of nucleic or amino acid sequences. The program looks both for segments of perfect identity or for regions where, using a scoring matrix, a minimum value is exceeded. The results of comparisons are presented as a matrix which is displayed on a simple graphics terminal. Dse of a graphics terminal allows the user to display {{the whole of the}} two sequences in one <b>screenful</b> or to horae-in on regions of interest to examine them in more detail. The program is interactive and so the user can easily see the effect of changes to variables and can use inbuilt editing functions to make insertions to produce alignments of the two sequences. These aligned sequences can then be saved on disk files for further processing...|$|E
40|$|New {{developments}} in information technology, like computer networks and hypermedia systems, enhance {{the role of}} computers in teaching and learning. Indeed, parts of the teaching process can be automated and the learning process can be helped substantially. The necessary software that accomplishes this goal is termed "courseware" and its development {{is not an easy}} task. One of the problems that are related to the development of courseware is that of accurate cost estimation. In this paper, we present a novel model for cost estimation in multimedia-based courseware development, using an algorithmic cost estimation mechanism based on the work breakdown structure of a typical courseware application. We suggest the "page", i. e. a <b>screenful</b> of educational material, as the basic unit in our size metric. Although our model has not been adequately tested yet, the first results are promising. 1 Introduction The introduction of computers, and in general of the Information Technology, in educatio [...] ...|$|E
