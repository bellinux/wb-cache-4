25|$|Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia; {{also known}} as giant redwood, <b>Sierra</b> <b>redwood,</b> Sierran redwood, Wellingtonia or simply Big Treea {{nickname}} used by John Muir) is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae, together with Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood). The common use of the name sequoia generally refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum, which occurs naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.|$|E

50|$|The {{two giant}} sequoias near Kölpin {{in the parish}} of Demen in the {{district}} of Ludwigslust-Parchim in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, are a natural monument. They belong to the species commonly known as giant sequoia, but also Wellingtonia and <b>Sierra</b> <b>redwood</b> (Sequoiadendron giganteum).|$|E

5000|$|The {{woodland}} {{that surrounds}} the Grotto or [...] "Secret Spring" [...] of Polmaise Castle supports a number of woodland species such as wood anemones, wood sorrel and bluebells. In {{the area around the}} Grotto many towering, ‘exotic’ conifers were planted in the 1860s by the Murray family which include four <b>Sierra</b> <b>Redwoods,</b> two Coast Redwoods (which can reach over 350’ high becoming the tallest trees on Earth), Douglas-firs, and a South American Monkey-puzzle tree.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, the New South Wales Forestry Commission planted various exotic {{conifers}} {{amidst the}} cool temperate rainforest at Banda Banda. Arboretum species include the monkey puzzle tree, Cunninghamia, Cryptomeria, Douglas fir, radiata pine, Ponderosa Pine and the <b>Sierra</b> <b>redwood.</b> The {{possibility of the}} spread of exotic seedlings into the natural rainforest is of concern.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{branches}} of fossil Sequoia from Florissant have foliage with spreading leaves, {{which is also}} common in the modern Sequoia. The leaves in the fossil species, however, are usually thinner and more delicate. An example of the leaves of Sequoia affinis has been featured on a postcard in a series on [...] "Tertiary Fossil Plants," [...] issued by the British Museum of Natural History in the early 1920s. It has also been suggested that Sequoia affinis may be ancestral to both Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum (<b>Sierra</b> <b>redwood).</b>|$|E
50|$|The flora of Gillies Hill is {{intricately}} {{entwined with}} its history. The Murray family who built Polmaise Castle in 1865, created landscaped gardens incorporating {{many of the}} exotic coniferous trees that still grace the woodland. Like much of 19th Century British aristocracy, the Murrays were enamored with planting landscape gardens filled with newly discovered plants from around the world. Often these outdoor plant collections included tall conifers imported from North America. A fine {{example of this is}} the grove of <b>Sierra</b> <b>Redwoods</b> (or Wellingtonia), Sequoiadendron giganteum, growing at the apex of Gillies Hill. These five Redwoods were planted in the 1860s by the Murray family along the walk from the castle to the large natural loch that was once on the upper portion of Gillies Hill, but was lost to quarrying. If left undisturbed, these giants could well live over 3000 years and attain a mass of over 1400 cubic meters potentially becoming the most massive trees in Scotland. Along with others of that era, these trees may have been grown from some of the first Sequoiadendron seeds brought to Scotland by John D. Matthew in 1853 and given to his noted horticulturist father Patrick Matthew of Gourdiehill near Errol in Perth Shire who then gave many of the seedlings away to friends and family as living gifts.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{attraction}} of Muir Woods are the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) trees. They {{are known for}} their height, and are related to the giant sequoia of the <b>Sierra</b> Nevada. While <b>redwoods</b> can grow to nearly 380 feet (115 m), the tallest tree in the Muir Woods is 258 ft. The trees come from a seed no bigger than that of a tomato. [...] Most of the redwoods in the monument are between 500 and 800 years old. The oldest is at least 1,200 years old.|$|R
5000|$|Endlicher {{described}} {{many new}} plant genera, including the genus Sequoia, and also its only extant species Sequoia sempervirens (California coast redwood). [...] Although Endlicher never offered {{an explanation for}} the name, later writers speculated that he must have been inspired by the achievements of the American Cherokee Indian linguist Sequoyah. John Davis credited Endlicher with naming the new species of <b>Sierra</b> <b>redwood</b> Sequoyah gigantea in 1847, , the present day Sequoiadendron giganteum (California giant redwood), to honor Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee syllabary. Recent scholarship has convincingly rebutted this hypothesis; Endlicher appears to have been thinking of the Latin for [...] "sequence." ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{many decades}} of Seattle city history, the park ravine had been ignored by loggers and farmers and still possessed full old-growth timber rising nearly 400 feet. The trees {{remained}} through the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1908, {{at which they}} were featured exhibitions. Public controversy about them declined after their gradual disappearance in suspicious circumstances by 1926. [...] Today, none of that size remain anywhere in the world. [...] The legacy helped save Seward and Carkeek parks, and helped galvanize conservation efforts ever since. [...] Today, a single <b>Sierra</b> <b>Redwood</b> stands over the Medicinal Herb Garden at a south edge of the UW campus, at 106 feet somewhat {{over a quarter of}} the height of those of Cowen Park-Ravenna Park.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There are {{recognized}} financial and opportunity {{costs associated with}} the reduction or elimination of timber harvest on productive forests. It has recently become clear that there are additional costs associated with harvest foregone, which range from increased pollution to species extinction at distant sites. Appropriate mitigation of these unwanted costs is to link harvest foregone at some sites to increased productivity of the renewable wood resource at other sites. At trailhead to South Grove, Calaveras, a sign quotes John Muir: "The <b>Sierra</b> <b>redwood</b> is nature's forest masterpiece, and so far as I know, the greatest of living things. It belongs to an ancient stock, and has a strange air of other days about it. " Our ancient giant sequoias are a national treasure. While we may disagree as to the best way to manage these giant trees, there seems to be broad agreement on the followin...|$|E
