50|$|The {{shell is}} <b>globose,</b> <b>conical,</b> first whorls are {{straight}} and later {{are a little}} convex spire outlines. There are {{six and a half}} whorls.|$|R
5000|$|The apple {{shape is}} broad <b>globose</b> <b>conical,</b> {{it has a}} {{distinctive}} orange blush mixed with a greenish yellow [...] "background," [...] and taste is sharp sweet.|$|R
50|$|Fruits are {{medium to}} large, <b>globose</b> <b>conical,</b> medium stem length. Yellow under-color is covered on {{almost the entire}} skin surface with an {{attractive}} bright red over-color. There is some russeting in stem cavity which occasionally may extend out over base. Flesh yellowish, juicy with medium grained texture and distinctive pleasant aroma.|$|R

30|$|Leaf spots none. Ascomata thyriothecial, scutate, roughly circular, superficial, densely gregarious, {{arranged}} in approximately concentric circles, appressed {{closely to the}} cuticle, superficial mycelium absent; on upper surfaces of leaves. Upper wall of thyriothecium composed of dark brown angular cells forming a reticulum, basal wall not seen, (100)- 105 -(120) μm in diameter[*]×[*](30)- 36 -(40) μm high, ostiole distinct,(16)- 17 -(20) μm in diameter, occasionally {{with two or three}} smaller secondary ostioles.

50|$|P. bruneauensis {{is a small}} snail {{that has}} a height of 2.2 - 2.9 mm and a <b>globose</b> to broadly <b>conical,</b> {{medium-sized}} shell. Its differentiated from other Pyrgulopsis in that its penial filament has a very short lobe and elongate filament with the penial ornament consisting of small, weakly developed terminal gland.|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of Ornithidium from the Massif de la Hotte, {{one of the last}} {{remaining}} orchid-rich regions of Haiti, is described and illustrated. Collected in the 1980 s by Donald D. Dod whose original specimen has been lost and whose live plants only just recently flowered, the new species is closely related to O. coccineum based on both morphology and molecular sequences. It is distinguished from the latter by <b>shorter</b> apical leaves, <b>globose</b> pseudobulbs and longer sepals.

40|$|Mycorrbizal {{systems of}} "Quercirhiza tomentellostellata" are monopodial-pinnate to-pyramidal {{in shape and}} dark brown to black in colour. They form outer mantle layers with roundish to angular cells which bear groups of <b>globose</b> cells with <b>conical</b> wall outgrowths, and become {{elongated}} and star-like arranged in middle mantle layers. Inner layers are plectenchymatous with cells varying in shape but mostly elongated, distributed with no discernible pattern altrenating with portions of ring-like arrangement. Rhizomorphs are slightly differentiated and produce thin and densely twisted peripheral byphae. The mycosymbiont of this ectomycorrhiza {{was identified as a}} member of the genus Tomentella by nrDNA its sequence analysis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|O. donaldeedodii {{is closely}} related to Ornithidium coccineum, based on {{morphology}} and molecular sequencing. O. donaldeedodii flowers are campanulate, bright red to red-orange, from 35 to 37 mm long, similar to its close relative in color and form. It is distinguished from O. coccineum by its <b>shorter</b> apical leaves, <b>globose</b> pseudobulbs, and longer sepals. O. donaldeedodii was collected in Pic Macaya National Park in the Massif de la Hotte range in south-western Haiti.|$|R
