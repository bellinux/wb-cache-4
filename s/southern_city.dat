5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues.

Gjergj Arianiti, who was living at the Ottoman court as a hostage, was called by rebels to lead the revolt in his family's domains. In response, he fled from Edirne and returned to Albania. In the winter of 1432, Sultan Murat II gathered around 10.000 troops under Ali Bey, who marched along the Via Egnatia and reached the central valley of Shkumbin, where he was ambushed and defeated by forces under Gjergj Arianiti. His victory prompted the Albanians in the area of Gjirokastër to call upon Depë Zenebishi, who had settled in his estates in Corfu after the Ottoman conquest of the Principality of Gjirokastër, to lead the rebels in the south. After spreading the revolt in nearby areas including Këlcyrë, Zagorie and Pogon his forces besieged the <b>southern</b> <b>city</b> of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak of Albania.

50|$|The {{first modern}} Southern police forces emerged between 1845 and the Civil War {{in large part}} due to the {{class-based}} tensions that developed in <b>Southern</b> <b>cities.</b> Some <b>Southern</b> cities—notably New Orleans and Charleston—experimented with police forces even earlier in the eighteenth century as a means of controlling their large urban slave populations. But most <b>Southern</b> <b>cities</b> relied on volunteer night-watch forces prior to mid-century.
