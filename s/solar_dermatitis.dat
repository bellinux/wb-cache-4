40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Exposure to UV solar radiation has deleterious effects on human skin, inducing a number of skin disorders such as immune suppression, inflammation, photo-aging, sun-burn, <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>solar</b> urticaria and skin cancer [1]. For protection against UV damage, human skin is equipped with a complex defence system, including skin pigmen-tation, skin thickening and a network of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants [2 - 4]. Skin pigmentation is one of the first events in response to UV radiation, which increases proliferation, activity and dendricity of melanocytes, followed by the synthesis and activation of tyrosinase and finally by the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes [2]. Melanocytes are key components of the skin pigmentary system and a significant source of various cytokines, including interleukin 1 α (IL- 1 α) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), which are released by UVB-exposed cells [2, 5]. Skin pigmentation is also regulated by the activation of tyrosinase, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the process of melanin synthesis (2). Interest-ingly, melanocyte growth and melanogenesis are also linked to the activation of tyrosine kinase activity an...|$|R
40|$|International audienceErythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an {{inherited}} disorder of the haem metabolic pathway characterised by accumulation of protoporphyrin in blood, erythrocytes and tissues, and cutaneous manifestations of photosensitivity. EPP {{has been reported}} worldwide, with prevalence between 1 : 75, 000 and 1 : 200, 000. It usually manifests in early infancy upon the first sun exposures. EPP is characterised by cutaneous manifestations of acute painful photosensitivity with erythema and oedema, sometimes with petechiae, together with stinging and burning sensations upon exposure to sunlight, without blisters. These episodes have a variable severity depending on the exposure duration and may result in chronic permanent lesions on exposed skin. As protoporphyrin is a lipophilic molecule that is excreted by the liver, EPP patients {{are at risk of}} cholelithiasis with obstructive episodes, and chronic liver disease that might evolve to rapid acute liver failure. In most patients, EPP results from a partial deficiency of the last enzyme of the haem biosynthetic pathway, ferrochelatase, EC 4. 99. 1. 1 /FECH (encoded by the FECH gene). EPP appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant disease, the clinical expression of which is modulated by the presence of the hypomorphic FECH IVS 3 - 48 C allele trans, but recessive inheritance with two mutated FECH alleles has also been described. In about 2 % of patients, overt disease was recently shown to be caused by gain-of-function mutations in the erythroid-specific aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 (ALAS 2 /ALAS, EC 2. 3. 1. 27) gene and named X-linked dominant protoporphyria. Diagnosis is established by finding increased levels of protoporphyrin in plasma and red blood cells, and detection of a plasma fluorescence peak at 634 nm. Investigations for hepatic involvement, ferrochelatase activity level, genetic analysis (FECH mutations, presence of the hypomorphic FECH IVS 3 - 48 C allele trans and ALAS 2 mutations) and family studies are advisable. Differential diagnosis includes phototoxic drug reactions, hydroa vacciniforme, <b>solar</b> urticaria, contact <b>dermatitis,</b> angio-oedema and, in some cases, other types of porphyria. Management includes avoidance of exposure to light, reduction of protoporphyrin levels and prevention of progression of possible liver disease to liver failure. As the major risk in EPP patients is liver disease, a regular follow-up of hepatic involvement is essential. Sequential hepatic and bone marrow transplantation should be considered as a suitable treatment for most severe cases of EPP with hepatic involvement. EPP is a lifelong disorder whose prognosis depends on the evolution of the hepatic disease. However, photosensitivity may {{have a significant impact on}} quality of life of EPP patients...|$|R

Method: During 1999 to 2001, treated 50 cases of vesicle type <b>solar</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with MEBO, and observed pain, inflammation, healing duration, and the escharation of the lesion. Results: 5 to 10 minutes after applied MEBO on the lesion, pain basically vanished. Healing duration minimum 6 days and maximum 10 days, without any infection and escharation.

40|$|Chronic <b>solar</b> <b>dermatitis</b> was accompanied, in 25 of the 38 {{individuals}} studied, by an appreciable increase, percentage and absolute, in {{the number}} of circulating lymphocytes. In eight there was a definite decrease and in five no appreciable change after prolonged exposure to the rays of the summer sun. Of the thirteen subjects with no increase in blood lymphocytes, six failed to tan, three were so dark originally that to determine an increase was impossible, and five had an extremely high lymphocyte count at the first count. Blood counts on white persons living in the Philippines indicate that the blood lymphocytes are likewise increased after a prolonged period of residence in the tropical zone. Because of the parallelism between the tanning and the blood changes it seems probable that the lymphocytosis observed in the majority of instances, which is similar to the response of the blood of animals to small doses of the x-rays, is due to the effects of the ultra-violet rays contained in the solar spectrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} diploma thesis was to {{abstract}} a literary overview the most often dermatitis incident on acras, especially, {{in the area of}} fetlock and fetlock-deep. I mentioned a clinical picture, treatment and possible methods of prevention by single types of dermatitid. I described likely factors affecting the origin and the progress of pastern dermatitis; furthermore, I noted the prevalence and the frequence of the incidence of pastern dermatitis. In terms of the experimental part I treated 23 horses suffering that dermal disease. There were included 12 mares, 9 geldings and 2 stallions. I recorded a few options of the treatment process during the evaluation of the therapeutical intervention in light of effectivity of the chosen therapy; for example, the improvement and the restoration of pastern dermatitis after selected pharmacotherapy; firstly, betterment of pastern dermatitis and it is necessary to use a different preparation for after-treatment; secondly, pastern dermatitis got worse after the application of pharmacotherapy and it was requiered to change the treatment; finally, the specific case was a <b>solar</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The single cases were analyzed in terms of the lenght of therapy and usage of a horse.
