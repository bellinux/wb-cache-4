2500|$|To {{appeal to}} a wider market, Bösendorfer {{designed}} the Conservatory Series for colleges and universities that could not afford Bösendorfer's standard black-model pianos. The production of the two CS Series pianos spends less time in [...] "non-critical areas", cutting down costs of production and purchase, making them more affordable than standard models. The cases and frames are of <b>satin</b> <b>finish,</b> rather than polished, and initially, the pianos were loop-strung rather than single-strung, but that difference has since been abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{key to the}} Empire State's initial fame was a -long American-type 4-4-0 steam {{locomotive}} built in West Albany, New York especially to haul the train. The handmade unit had 86" [...] diameter driving wheels {{and was the first}} of its kind to have brakes on the front truck. The bands, pipes, and trim were polished; the boiler, smokestack, domes, cab, and tender were given a black <b>satin</b> <b>finish,</b> and [...] "Empire State Express" [...] was applied to the sides of the tender in [...] high gold leaf lettering.|$|E
2500|$|The Studio {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1983, and is still in production. The guitar is intended for the studio musician; therefore, the design features of the [...] "Les Paul Studio" [...] are centered on optimal sound output and not on flashy appearance. This model retains only {{the elements of the}} Gibson Les Paul that contribute to tone and playability, including the carved maple top and standard mechanical and electronic hardware. However, the Studio design omits several stock Gibson ornamentations that do not affect sound quality, including body/neck binding. The first Studios from 1983 to 1986 were made with alder bodies rather than mahogany/maple. The current Studios come with a chambered mahogany body with either a maple or mahogany cap. The entry level Les Paul Studio [...] "faded" [...] has a weight relieved mahogany body and top and a <b>satin</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Designed by Fender, Walker and Sterling Ball (Sterling was a {{beta tester}} for the instrument), the StingRay bass {{appeared}} in 1976 and, though physically {{similar to a}} Fender Precision Bass, was a highly innovative instrument. It employed an [...] "MM" [...] humbucking pickup and an active pre-amp powered by a 9-volt battery. The early versions had 2-band EQ (i.e., bass and treble controls), and the range was later augmented {{by the addition of}} a 3 band EQ (bass, mid and treble) model, and then piezo pickups located in the bridge became an option with the 3-band model. The StingRay's 3-band equalization system made it possible to boost midrange frequencies as well as low and high. [...] Along with its electronic improvements, the StingRay had physical attributes that set it apart from other Fender-inspired designs, such as a heavy <b>satin</b> <b>finish</b> {{on the back of the}} neck to allow players' hands to slide effortlessly up and down during play, a symmetrical egg-shaped pickguard ("the toilet seat lid") and separate chromed [...] "boomerang" [...] control plate, and its distinctive [...] "3+1" [...] headstock (on which three tuning machines are situated on the top and one on the bottom) made it an instantly recognizable and distinguishable instrument.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not confess {{any such}} thing," [...] said I hardily. [...] "I grant you that, in that {{department}} of paper-hangings which exhibits floral decoration, the French designs and execution are, and must be {{for some time to}} come, far ahead of all the world: their drawing of flowers, vines, and foliage has the accuracy of botanical studies and the grace of finished works of art, and we cannot as yet pretend in America to do anything equal to it. But for <b>satin</b> <b>finish,</b> and for a variety of exquisite tints of plain colors, American papers equal any in the world: our gilt papers even surpass in the heaviness and polish of the gilding those of foreign countries; and we have also gorgeous velvets. All I have to say is, let people who are furnishing houses inquire for articles of American manufacture, and they will be surprised at what they will see. We need go no farther than our Cambridge glassworks to see that the most dainty devices of cut-glass, crystal, ground and engraved glass of every color and pattern, may be had of American workmanship, every way equal to the best European make, and for half the price. And American painting on china is so well executed, both in Boston and New York, that deficiencies in the finest French or English sets can be made up in a style not distinguishable from the original, as one may easily see by calling on our worthy next neighbor, Briggs, who holds the opposite corner to our 'Atlantic Monthly.' No porcelain, it is true, is yet made in America, these decorative arts being exercised on articles imported from Europe. Our tables must, therefore, perforce, be largely indebted to foreign lands for years to come. Exclusive of this item, however, I believe it would require very little self-denial to paper, carpet, and furnish a house entirely from the manufactures of America. I cannot help saying one word here in favor of the cabinet-makers of Boston. There is so much severity of taste, such a style and manner about the best-made Boston furniture, as raises it really quite into the region of the fine arts. Our artisans have studied foreign models with judicious eyes, and so transferred to our country the spirit of what is best worth imitating that one has no need to import furniture from Europe." ...|$|E

50|$|The StingRay bass was an {{innovative}} early instrument.
