40|$|Five {{abstract}} Early Bronze Age idols {{from the}} Schliemann Collection of Trojan {{objects in the}} Römisch-Germanische Zentralmuseum are presented. Apart from their formal classification possible alternative functions of certain types are discussed, for example polishing <b>stones</b> or <b>net</b> weights. Finally the partly abstract, partly naturalistic »Kilia-idols« dating to the Chalcolithic period, are taken to appraise {{the problem of the}} genesis of small abstract sculpture in western Turkey...|$|R
50|$|Along {{much of the}} cliffed coast between Brighton and Newhaven (and beyond to Eastbourne), frost {{involution}} structures {{can be seen in}} {{the upper}} meter of the chalk cliff. These involutions appear as repeated 'U' (festoon) shaped structures and date from the Devensisn (last glacial period). Frost heaving broke up the sub-surface sedimentary layers of chalk turning small slabs into a more and more upright orientation towards the surface, to be covered by present day soil. The centre of the 'U' structure is a fill of finer chalk and sands giving a more orange / yellow appearance. These structures have a polygonal surface manifestation which can be revealed by stripping away turf and soil. Slope angle appears to have had an effect on their formation. Where the gradient exceeds 20 degrees solifluction appears to have been a more dominant process preventing their formation. This may link to the patterned ground features of <b>stone</b> <b>nets</b> becoming elongated by gradient resulting in stone stripes as seen in modern periglacial environment and in relic locations such as Dartmoor.|$|R
50|$|Washington National Cathedral closed from August 24 to November 7, 2011, as $2 {{million was}} spent to {{stabilize}} the structure and remove damaged or loose <b>stone.</b> Safety <b>netting</b> was erected throughout the nave to protect visitors from any debris that might fall from above. The cathedral reopened for the consecration and installation of Mariann Budde as the ninth Bishop of Washington on November 12, 2011. At that time, estimates {{of the cost of}} the damage were about $25 million.|$|R
60|$|They sat in {{adjoining}} {{windows of}} the same room in Lucetta's great <b>stone</b> mansion, <b>netting,</b> and looking out upon the market, which formed an animated scene. Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfather's hat among the rest beneath, and was not aware that Lucetta watched the same object with yet intenser interest. He moved about amid the throng, at this point lively as an ant-hill; elsewhere more reposeful, and broken up by stalls of fruit and vegetables.|$|R
50|$|The Chinchorro were expert fishermen. They {{developed}} an extensive and sophisticated fishing tool assemblage.

40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} the urinary calculi with tuberculous patients treated with minimally invasive percutaneous renal puncture lithotomy curative effect, safety and its complications, thus {{it can provide}} the effective solution {{for the treatment of}} patients with urinary calculi with tuberculous. Methods: From June 2013 to August 2014 on our hospital 72 cases of urinary stones with tuberculous patients were randomly divided into observation group and the control group (n = 36). The observation group 36 cases were treated by minimally invasive percutaneous renal puncture for the treatment of the lithotomy, while the control group is treated with the open operation. We observe two groups of the <b>stones</b> taking <b>net</b> rate, operation time, and the intraoperative blood loss, the hospital stay and the complications such as the index. Results: By the treatment and observation by two groups patients, the <b>stones</b> from <b>net</b> rate differences had no statistical significance between the observation group and control group (P> 0. 05); The operation time, blood loss, hospital stay of the observation group were significantly less than the control group (P < 0. 05); The observation group compared with preoperative creatinine postoperative 5 d has no obvious change. Conclusion: The minimally invasive percutaneous renal stone extraction for the treatment on urinary stones is safe, effect, and worth clinical promotion...|$|R

5000|$|These soils have {{permafrost}} (permanently frozen material) {{within one}} metre {{of the surface}} (2 m if the soil is strongly cryoturbated; i.e., disturbed by frost action). As permafrost is a barrier to roots and water, the active layer (seasonally thawed material) above it may become a saturated, semifluid material in spring. Commonly the permafrost layer near the surface contains abundant ice. Melting of ice and frozen materials, resulting from disturbance of the surface vegetation (boreal forest or tundra), may cause slumping of the soil and disruption of roads, pipelines and buildings. Cryosolic soils, occupying about 3 672 000 km2 (about 40%) of Canada's land area, are dominant {{in much of the}} Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and occur in northern areas of all but the Atlantic provinces (excluding Labrador).The order and its 3 great groups were defined in 1973, after soil and terrain surveys in the Mackenzie Valley yielded new knowledge about the properties, genesis and significance of these soils. Turbic Cryosols have a patterned surface (hummocks, <b>stone</b> <b>nets,</b> etc.) and mixed horizons or other evidence of cryoturbation. Static Cryosols lack marked evidence of cryoturbation; they are associated with sandy or gravelly materials. Organic Cryosols are composed dominantly of organic materials (e.g., peat). Because organic material acts as an insulator, Organic Cryosols occur farther south than the boundary of continuous permafrost.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the role of a}} seagrass bed, made from artificial materials, in a shallow subtidal zone. The artificial seagrass (ASG) units were made of simple and cheap materials such as <b>stones,</b> old <b>nets,</b> floats and ropes. Observations were made by snorkeling. Various fishes in their different stages in life (from larvae to adult) and benthic animals were observed to colonized the bed. The association of these marine faunas to the artificial seagrass units were recorded. Furthermore, the condition and the attracting capability of the ASG units through time were discussed. The disadvantages of the design of ASG units used in the study were likewise considered...|$|R
30|$|Fresh Fruits: Products in {{this group}} include {{tropical}} fruits grown locally (bananas, guavas, papayas, pineapples, watermelons, etc.) and imported fruits (apples, citrus fruits, berries, <b>stone</b> fruits, etc.). <b>Net</b> fresh fruit supplies from all sources totaled 98 thousand tonnes in 2010. Local production is 38 % of total market requirement, and the state is dependent on imports for the remaining 62 %, mainly from the continental United States. The market supply in 2010 is about 2.6 times the equivalent measure of 36.9 thousand tonnes recorded in 1980.|$|R
50|$|Another {{technique}} to capture stones {{is the so-called}} net, also known by its Japanese name, geta. This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones, preventing their escape in all directions. An example is given in the adjacent diagram. It is generally better to capture <b>stones</b> in a <b>net</b> than in a ladder, because a net {{does not depend on}} the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way, nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker.|$|R
50|$|Nomadic peoples have {{inhabited}} the Brooks Range {{for as many}} as 12,500 years, living mainly on caribou and other wildlife. The Mesa site at Iteriak Creek has yielded evidence of occupation between 11,500 and 10,300 years before the present. Later sites from around 6,000 years before present have yielded projectile points, <b>stone</b> knives and <b>net</b> sinkers. The Arctic small tool tradition (ASTt) of about 4,500 BP has also been documented. A late phase of the ASTt from between 2500 and 950 BP, the Ipuitak phase, has been documented in the park at the Bateman Site at Itkillik Lake.|$|R

50|$|He goes to {{the same}} school as Yuuki, but {{is not in the}} same class. He's sort of a bully, and is said to have beaten a junior high student. He has an older sister (which was never shown), and he doesn't spend much time studying. He first meets Yuuki and the others in Takamagahara when he attacks Takaomi for the bounty on his head. He then finds a magic <b>stone</b> in the <b>net</b> that the poacher used, and that's when he gets his {{memories}} from Nakatsukuni. He then meets Yuuki in Nakatasukini when he discovers that she checked out a book from the library {{that he was going to}} borrow, telling her afterwards that there is another student in his class with a magic stone. He has a crush on Miss Nakime.|$|R
25|$|They {{depicted}} the Indians as living at a bare subsistence level, typically located in small rancherias of extended family groups of 100 to 150 people. They had no apparent agriculture, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery, and their only tools were {{made out of}} wood, leather, woven baskets and <b>netting,</b> <b>stones</b> and horns. Shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by digging into the ground two to three feet and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, tules and/or mud. Their clothing was minimal in the summer, with animal skins and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Some tribes around Santa Barbara, California and the Channel Islands (California) were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast were using wooden dugout canoes.|$|R
2500|$|The mother rock or matrix {{in which}} {{turquoise}} is found {{can often be}} seen as splotches or a network of brown or black veins running through the <b>stone</b> in a <b>netted</b> pattern; this veining may add value to the stone if the result is complementary, but such a result is uncommon. Such material is sometimes described as [...] "spiderweb matrix"; it is most valued in the Southwest United States and Far East, but is not highly appreciated in the Near East where unblemished and vein-free material is ideal (regardless of how complementary the veining may be). Uniformity of colour is desired, and in finished pieces the quality of workmanship is also a factor; this includes {{the quality of the}} polish and the symmetry of the stone. Calibrated stones—that is, stones adhering to standard jewellery setting measurements—may also be more sought after. Like coral and other opaque gems, turquoise is commonly sold at a price according to its physical size in millimetres rather than weight.|$|R

60|$|There {{was no time}} lost. The Ostjaks {{ordered the}} women to set about it at once, and leaving the matter in their hands went off to their fishing. Godfrey asked them to take him with them, leaving Luka to see to the repairs of the boat. The fishing {{implements}} were of the roughest kind. The hooks were formed of fish bones, bound together by fine gut; the lines were twisted strips of skin, strong gut attaching the hook to these lines; the bait was small pieces of fat, varied by strips of fish with the skin on them. Clumsy as the appliances were, jack, tench, and other fish were caught in considerable numbers, and among them two or three good-sized salmon. The nets were of coarse mesh, made of hemp, which grows wild {{in many parts of}} Siberia. They were some ten feet in depth and some twenty yards long. The upper ends were supported by floats made of bladders, and the whole anchored across the stream by ropes at the extremities, fastened to heavy <b>stones.</b> In these <b>nets</b> a considerable quantity of fish were taken. The fishing was over early, for there had been a good supply taken on the previous day, and as {{at this time of year}} they would not keep, it was useless obtaining more.|$|R
