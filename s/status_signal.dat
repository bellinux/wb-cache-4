5000|$|Offensive {{adaptation}} behavior {{differs from}} defensive behavior {{because it involves}} an attempt to ruin the chances of another male's opportunity in succeeding in copulation by engaging in an act that tries to terminate the fertilization success of the previous male. This offensive behavior is facilitated {{by the presence of}} certain traits, which are called armaments. An example of an armament are antlers. Further, the presence of an offensive trait sometimes serves as a <b>status</b> <b>signal.</b> The mere display of an armament can suffice to drive away the competition without engaging in a fight, hence saving energy. A male on the offensive side of mate-guarding may terminate the guarding male's chances at a successful insemination by brawling with the guarding male {{to gain access to the}} female. In Drosophila, males release seminal fluids that contain additional toxins like pheromones and modified enzymes that are secreted by their accessory glands intended to destroy the sperm that have already made their way into the female's reproductive tract from a recent copulation. Based on the [...] "last male precedence" [...] idea, some males can remove sperm from previous males by ejaculating new sperm into the female; hindering successful insemination opportunities of the previous male.|$|E

40|$|Extended phenotypes as {{signals are}} widely {{distributed}} among animal taxa. For example, many bird species build eye-catching nests or structures, which can potentially mirror the quality or {{ability of the}} builder. Rock sparrow,Petronia petronia, nests are usually overly decorated with feathers belonging to different species. Feather carrying in this and other species seems {{to play a role}} beyond their supposed thermoregulatory function, that is, to provide insulation to eggs and developing chicks. In this study, we documented for thefirst time this intriguing pattern of behaviour in the rock sparrow and experimentally tested its potential role as a sexually selected or <b>status</b> <b>signal</b> by means of a feather supplementation experiment carried out in two distinct populations from Italy and Spain. We found that females were responsible for feather carrying, laid larger clutches and provisioned their young at a lower rate in those nests with experimentally added feathers. Decorated nests sustained fewer intrusions by floater individuals and were defended with greater intensity by both parents than control nests, which supports the role of nest ornamentation as a <b>status</b> <b>signal</b> to conspecifics. Presence of experimental feathers did not significantly increase the frequency with which males provisioned their young but males tended to desert their brood less often and spent more time guarding the brood in experimental nests, indicating that feather presence may also play a role in an intersexual context. Overall, our results allow us to exclude the thermoregulation hypothesis as a likely explanation for the occurrence of these decorations and provide partial evidence for the idea that feather carrying conveys information to the partner and potential competitors. Our study thus supports the notion that nonbodily traits serving a direct (naturally selected) function can also evolve a signalling component...|$|E
40|$|The first essay of this {{dissertation}} uses {{a general}} equilibrium model of the U. S. economy to study the welfare implications of a biofuel blend mandate and consumption subsidy {{in the presence of}} pre-existing labor and fuel taxes. The tax interaction and revenue recycling effects are found to be significant relative to the overall costs of the policies and to previous partial equilibrium studies. I find empirically that the tax credit is welfare superior to the mandate for a given level of ethanol consumption, and this result is robust to {{the presence or absence of}} the labor tax. The second essay studies consumer behavior in durable goods markets. I extend a classic model of consumption with status-seeking preferences to incorporate a visible durable good stock with three attributes: quality, average item age, and stock size. "Newness" is an important feature of durable goods consumption, and I illustrate how the newness of a durable good stock, as captured by average item age, could be used as the <b>status</b> <b>signal</b> in a signaling equilibrium. I analyze Consumer Expenditure Survey data on the consumption of apparel goods which vary quasi-experimentally in visibility, and my empirical results suggest that newness and/or stock size may be used more than quality as a <b>status</b> <b>signal,</b> if consumers use apparel consumption to signal income. The third essay analyzes a model in which environmental regulation can potentially satisfy the "Porter hypothesis. " I show theoretically how limited attention to waste production on the part of behaviorally-biased firm managers can result in internally sub-optimal production choices and the potential for "win-win" environmental regulation which increases net social benefits and also makes the firm itself better off. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|E

Rohwer {{recently}} has proposed that intraspecific plumage variability in winter flocking birds represents a polymorphism that functions to <b>signal</b> social <b>status.</b> We test several predictions of Rohwer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>status</b> <b>signaling</b> hypothesis for Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), explore some theoretical implications of our findings for juncos, {{and discuss the}} generality of social <b>status</b> <b>signaling.</b> Both darkness of hood and whiteness of tail were positively, although imperfectly, associated with social rank in captive winter flocks of first-year juncos. If plumage differences function as cues to dominance status in this species, our results suggest that their signal value derives primarily from learned associations between plumage attributes and other variables (such as sex or body size) that might influence fighting ability. Ultimate factors possibly responsible for winter plumage variability in juncos, both within and between age/sex classes, appear to be complex; selective pressure for a system of social status advertisement could (but need not) be one of these factors. Findings for some other winter flocking species reveal both similarities to, and differences from, our results for juncos.

Although there is considerable evidence that many male plumage traits function as <b>status</b> <b>signals</b> that convey information about fighting ability, less is known about <b>status</b> <b>signaling</b> in females. We tested whether the carotenoid-based orange breast coloration of the female streak-backed oriole (Icterus pustulatus pustulatus) <b>signals</b> <b>status</b> during territorial interactions. To do this, we simulated territorial intrusions using taxidermic models and compared the roles of the sexes within pairs during territorial defense directed toward different types of simulated intruders. Females were more territorial than their mates during the breeding season, whereas males were more territorial than their mates in the nonbreeding season, contrary to patterns seen in studies of temperate zone birds. The coloration of simulated female intruders also influenced territorial responses: When presented with color-augmented female models, females responded with greater intensity than their mates, whereas the intensity of defense was similar for both sexes when presented with average-colored female models. The greater female response to more colorful intruders suggests that females perceive more ornamented females as greater threats to their territorial tenure or to their pair bond.
