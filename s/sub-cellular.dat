5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these <b>sub-cellular</b> compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and <b>sub-cellular</b> membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other <b>sub-cellular</b> structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other <b>sub-cellular</b> structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{animations}} {{are often}} {{employed as a}} method of visualizing the vast number of microscopic processes that occur in the human body.

25|$|Medical ultrasonography, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to morphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low resolution imaging capability (typically {{a fraction of a}} millimeter), the third one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e. <b>sub-cellular),</b> between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can probe as deep as 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural) resolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth in ophthalmology, for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in endoscopy).|$|E
25|$|Electron {{microscopy}} or EM {{can be used}} {{to study}} the detailed microarchitecture of tissues or cells. Immuno-EM allows the detection of specific proteins in ultrathin tissue sections. Antibodies labelled with heavy metal particles (e.g. gold) can be directly visualised using transmission electron microscopy. While powerful in detecting the <b>sub-cellular</b> localisation of a protein, immuno-EM can be technically challenging, expensive, and require rigorous optimisation of tissue fixation and processing methods. Protein biotinylation in vivo was proposed to alleviate the problems caused by frequent incompatibility of antibody staining with fixation protocols that better preserve cell morphology.|$|E

2500|$|Disruption of the HMG CoA-reductase pathway at {{the level}} of FPPS {{prevents}} the formation of two metabolites (farnesol and geranylgeraniol) that are essential for connecting some small proteins to the cell membrane.

2500|$|In 2015 study {{published}} in Cell [...] by Jeff Lichtman lab at Harvard researchers describe automated technologies to probe the structure of neural tissue at nanometer resolution {{and use them to}} generate a saturated reconstruction of a sub-volume of mouse neocortex in which all cellular objects (axons, dendrites, and glia) and many <b>sub-cellular</b> components (synapses, synaptic vesicles, spines, spine apparati, postsynaptic densities, and mitochondria) are rendered and itemized in a database. [...] By tracing the trajectories of all excitatory axons and noting their juxtapositions, both synaptic and non-synaptic, with every dendritic spine the study refutes the idea that physical proximity is sufficient to predict synaptic connectivity (the so-called Peters’ rule).|$|E
2500|$|Kurzweil {{notes that}} {{computational}} capacity {{alone will not}} create artificial intelligence. He asserts {{that the best way}} to build machine intelligence is to first understand human intelligence. The first step is to image the brain, to peer inside it. Kurzweil claims imaging technologies such as PET and fMRI are increasing exponentially in resolution while he predicts even greater detail will be obtained during the 2020s when it becomes possible to scan the brain from the inside using nanobots. Once the physical structure and connectivity information are known, Kurzweil says researchers will have to produce functional models of <b>sub-cellular</b> components and synapses all the way up to whole brain regions. The human brain is [...] "a complex hierarchy of complex systems, but it does not represent a level of complexity beyond what we are already capable of handling".|$|E
2500|$|Luminescent Dinoflagellates: In early 1954 at Northwestern University, Hastings, his {{students}} and colleagues studied cellular and molecular aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [...] They elucidated {{the structures of}} the luciferins and luciferases, the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms, and the actual <b>sub-cellular</b> identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed scintillons. They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in pH when an action potential leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons. Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 μm) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein. More recently, the lab found that the luciferase gene in Lingulodinium polyedrum and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences {{in a kind of}} [...] "three-ring circus with the same act in all three." [...] However, another luminescent, but heterotrophic, dinoflagellate, Noctiluca scintillans, has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.|$|E
