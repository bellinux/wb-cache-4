40|$|Land {{management}} {{aiming to}} sustain ecosystem services {{is an important}} issue, especially in biodiversity hot spots such as found in Mediterranean areas. In Mediterranean areas, viticulture is an important land use. Vineyards are frequently found on inherently poor soils and are submitted to intensive management practices, which threaten <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> and associated ecosystem services. To encourage winegrowers and stakeholders to be reflective and adapt their vineyard practices, we evaluated the effects of three soil management practices (inter row plant cover duration, weeding and fertilization strategies) on <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> in 146 commercial plots distributed in Southern France, by a complementary set of biological and physico-chemical indicators. We used the concept of soil dynamic quality to evaluate some soil management practices on <b>soil</b> <b>functioning.</b> The influence of inherent soil properties derived from pedogenesis on soil dynamic indicator response was accounted for by considering the response of soil indicators for three soil groups differing in their stoniness and Ca carbonate content. The three soil management practices systematically influenced some nematode-based indicators, whereas other indicators were ascribable to a specific soil type or practice. We demonstrated that the potential of soil management practices to enhance <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> is restricted by soil type. In particular for calcareous <b>soils,</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> is very stable limiting effects of soil management practices. The presence of a cover crop, even temporary, in the inter row, is the only practice which benefits <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> whatever the <b>soil</b> type whereas organic fertilization and chemical weeding exhibit contrasting results on <b>soil</b> <b>functioning...</b>|$|R

However, to what extent CWD affects <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> remains unknown, and is seldom considered. From 32 paired test–reference points in eight Fagus sylvatica (L.) stands throughout Southwest Germany, CWD significantly increased soil C/N ratios, base saturation, and possibly pH. CWD-induced changes in soil porosity, available water capacity, and total organic carbon depended on site and CWD characteristics. As such, CWD {{can be viewed as}} a “pedogenic hot-spot” of concentrated biogeochemical and -physical processes with outsized effects on <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> and development. CWD management for <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> should consider site and tree species specific volume thresholds, timed rotations, and spatial densities, but appropriate implementation requires further research to define best management practices.

50|$|Soil {{contamination}} at {{low levels}} is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages {{the soil to}} such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. Remediation of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> and values.

50|$|The soil {{is home to}} a large {{proportion}} of the world's biodiversity. The links between soil organisms and <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> are observed to be incredibly complex. The interconnectedness and complexity of this soil ‘food web’ means any appraisal of soil function must necessarily take into account interactions with the living communities that exist within the soil. We know that soil organisms break down organic matter, making nutrients available for uptake by plants and other organisms. The nutrients stored in the bodies of soil organisms prevent nutrient loss by leaching. Microbial exudates act to maintain soil structure, and earthworms are important in bioturbation. However, we find that we don't understand critical aspects about how these populations function and interact. The discovery of glomalin in 1995 indicates that we lack the knowledge to correctly answer some of the most basic questions about the biogeochemical cycle in soils. There is much work ahead to gain a better understanding of the ecological role of soil biological components in the biosphere.|$|E

40|$|Soils {{are major}} {{contributors}} to global nutrient cycling processes, which are indispensable for the healthy functioning of our ecosystems. In this study, we {{raise the question}} whether <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> can be captured in a concept denominated normal operating range (NOR), or the normal fluctuations in <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> under field conditions. We further examine how this concept could be effectively {{used to evaluate the}} impact of disturbances on agricultural ecosystems. We propose the establishment of a NOR on the basis of multiple parameters in the soil. These should include so-called sensitive processes, that is, those processes that are poorly redundant and easily deviate following a stress situation. The model that we built allowed to visualize the interplay of multiple soil parameters, under which the sensitive ones, which would be most indicative of a disturbance. Here we use the initial step of nitrification, i. e. ammonia oxidation, {{as an example of a}} sensitive process. By capturing the normal fluctuations in ammonia oxidation-related parameters that take into account population dynamics, and implementing these in a mathematical model, a multidimensional representation of the NOR of <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> is created which is useful in tests of resilience in the context of disturbances.

40|$|Soils are {{subjected}} to multiple pressures which cause their degradation and endanger their ecological, economic, social and cultural functioning. This justifies the development of indicators for driving sustainable soil management strategies and policies. In this context, numerous soil quality indicators are currently available that allow measuring the physical, chemical and biological status of soil. Yet, only few approaches are available for assessing the <b>soil</b> <b>functioning.</b> This study develops and evaluates indicators for the water flux regulation <b>function</b> of <b>soil.</b> The methodological approach encompasses three steps: (i) the definition and measurement of the relevant reference physical properties of the soil (basic indicators) allowing to assess the physical qualities relative to the environmental function mentioned above; (ii) the development and definition {{of a set of}} synthetic indicators of <b>soil</b> <b>functioning,</b> based on 2 -dimensional simulation of water fluxes using Hydrus 2 D/ 3 D, which explicitly considers the soil structural heterogeneity generated by tillage; and (iii) the establishment of relations between the developed synthetic indicators of <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> and the more easily measurable basic indicators.

40|$|AbstractGlobally, {{there is}} growing demand for {{increased}} agricultural outputs. At the same time, the agricultural industry is expected to meet increasingly stringent environmental targets. Thus, there is an urgent pressure on the soil resource to deliver multiple functions simultaneously. The Functional Land Management framework (Schulte et al., 2014) is a conceptual tool designed to support policy making to manage <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> to meet these multiple demands. This paper provides a first example of a practical application of the Functional Land Management concept relevant to policy stakeholders. In this study we examine the trade-offs, between the <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> ‘primary productivity’ and ‘carbon cycling and storage’, {{in response to the}} intervention of land drainage systems applied to ‘imperfectly’ and ‘poorly’ draining managed grasslands in Ireland. These trade-offs are explored {{as a function of the}} nominal price of ‘Certified Emission Reductions’ or ‘carbon credits’. Also, these trade-offs are characterised spatially using ArcGIS to account for spatial variability in the supply of <b>soil</b> <b>functions.</b> To manage <b>soil</b> <b>functions,</b> it is essential to understand how individual <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> are prioritised by those that are responsible for the supply of <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> – generally farmers and foresters, and those who frame demand for <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> – policy makers. Here, in relation to these two <b>soil</b> <b>functions,</b> a gap exists in relation to this prioritisation between these two stakeholder groups. Currently, the prioritisation and incentivisation of these competing <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> is primarily a function of CO 2 price. At current CO 2 prices, the agronomic benefits outweigh the monetised environmental costs. The value of CO 2 loss would only exceed productivity gains at either higher CO 2 prices or at a reduced discount period rate. Finally, this study shows large geographic variation in the environmental cost: agronomic benefit ratio. Therein, the Functional Land Management framework can support the development of policies that are more tailored to contrasting biophysical environments and are therefore more effective than ‘blanket approaches’ allowing more specific and effective prioritisation of contrasting <b>soil</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|E
