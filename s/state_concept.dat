2500|$|Many {{systems in}} nature reach steady-states and {{dynamical}} systems theory {{is used to}} describe such systems. Soil shear can also {{be described as a}} dynamical system. The physical basis of the soil shear dynamical system is a Poisson process in which particles move to the steady-state at random shear strains. Joseph generalized this—particles move to their final position (not just steady-state) at random shear-strains.

2500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} it {{was first}} introduced, the {{critical}} <b>state</b> <b>concept</b> has been subject to much criticism--chiefly its inability to match readily available test data from testing a wide variety of soils. [...] This is primarily due to the theories inability to account for particle structure. A major consequence of this is its inability to model strain-softening post peak commonly observed in contractive soils that have anisotropic grain shapes/properties. [...] Further, an assumption commonly made to make the model mathematically tractable is that shear stress cannot cause volumetric strain nor volumetric stress cause shear strain. [...] Since this is not the case in reality, it is an additional cause of the poor matches to readily available empirical test data. [...] Additionally, critical state elasto-plastic models assume that elastic strains drives volumetric changes. [...] Since this too is not the case in real soils, this assumption results in poor fits to volume and pore pressure change data.|$|E

40|$|The study {{entitled}} Konsep Negara dalam Tradisi Islam uses qualitative {{design by}} comparative historical approach. Theories used {{here are the}} Pluralism in Islam from Esposito and Islamic States from Ahmed an-Naim. The purpose of the research is {{to answer the following}} questions : 1) why there are varieties related to <b>state</b> <b>concepts</b> in Islamic tradition, 2) what kind of characteristics of <b>state</b> <b>concepts</b> in Islam, and 3) where the friction of <b>state</b> <b>concepts</b> go in contemporary Islamic politics Based on the data analysis, the research findings can be formulated as follows. First, varieties were caused by two determinant factors: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors cover nas (texts) and syahsiyyah (personality), meanwhile extrinsic factors cover bi’ah (environment), ijtima’iyyah (social-culture), isti’mariyyah (colonialism) which caused the imitation of Law of Descent or otherwise, iqtisadiyyah (economy), and ‘alamiyyah (globalization). Dialectics of <b>state</b> <b>concepts</b> at the phase of elite reason until public reason had more varieties and doubled face. At phase of elite reason, before Abduh, there were Ibn Abdul Wahhab (Wahabiyah) who was radical and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (Ahmadiyah) who had concept of chaliphate without political power. Then, at phase of public reason, the influence of Abduh’s thingking came to conservative sunni through Rasyid Ridha, and the next followers became more and more radical and exclusive, and even they considered other infidel. Abduh’s thinking also had a role in the birth of Qasim Amin and the next followers tended to be more liberal and inclusive. In addition, Abduh’s thingking caused the birth of moderat sunni such as Abdul Qadir Audah etc. Second, neo-genuine states at the contemporary era has some charateristics: constitutional republic, democration, nomocrative, self-determination, inclusion, flexibility, accomodating and participation…… [...] Third, there is a friction of the <b>concepts</b> of <b>state</b> in the contemporary Islmic politics from chaliphate into religious democration such as in Indonesia. The implication is that the best secular state and Daulah Islamiyyah ‘Ammah at contemporary era will come to utopia room beyond utopia of perfect democration and can’t satisfy all people...|$|R
