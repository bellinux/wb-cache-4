40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Concerns have been raised about the privacy and security of personal information in light of advances in information technology and the increasingly sophisticated {{ways in which the}} government obtains and uses information. Federal agencies' use of personal information is governed by the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002, while the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides implementation guidance and oversight. These laws and guidance are based on the Fair Information Practices, a set of widely accepted principles for protecting privacy. GAO was asked to testify on its report, being released today, concerning the <b>sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> privacy <b>protections</b> afforded by existing laws and guidance. To do this, GAO analyzed privacy laws and guidance, compared them with the Fair Information Practices, and obtained perspectives from federal agencies as well as an expert forum. ...|$|R
40|$|Evidence from eyewitnesses {{is often}} the {{starting}} point for police investigations and it is estimated that it {{plays an important role in}} one quarter of all contested Crown Court cases. However, the memory is a fragile and malleable instrument which can produce unreliable yet convincing evidence. Because mistaken witnesses can be both honest and compelling, the risk of wrongful conviction in eyewitness identification cases is high, as is illustrated in a number of famous miscarriages of justice. This thesis assesses the <b>sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>protections</b> offered to defendants in cases involving eyewitness identification by examining psychological research on memory, police procedures for the collection of evidence from eyewitnesses, and judicial discretion to exclude unreliable evidence found in RvTurnbull and section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. In interview, startling levels of guessing were reported by witnesses attending identification procedures; and suspects were largely unaware of their rights. Current identification procedures are time-consuming and inefficient; and psychological research offers some guidance but few answers, precluding the usefulness of expert evidence. The thesis concludes that an increase in specialised identification officers, reform of procedures to allow for greater use of video identification, guidelines on the exercise of discretion under s. 78, and judicial education regarding the importance of using a comprehensive Turnbull direction are required before an adequate level of procedural and evidential protection against erroneous identification can be offered to suspects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper studies K-sublinear inequalities, a {{class of}} inequalities with strong {{relations}} to K-minimal inequalities for disjunctive conic sets. We establish a stronger result on the <b>sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> K-sublinear inequalities. That is, we show that when K is the nonnegative orthant or the second-order cone, K-sublinear inequalities together with the original conic constraint are always sufficient for the closed convex hull description of the associated disjunctive conic set. When K is the non-negative orthant, K-sublinear inequalities are tightly connected to functions that generate cuts—so called cut-generating functions. As a consequence <b>of</b> the <b>sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> Rn+-sublinear inequalities, we also provide an alternate and straightforward proof <b>of</b> the <b>sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> cut-generating functions for mixed integer linear programs, a result recently established by Cornuéjols, Wolsey and Yıldız. ...|$|R
