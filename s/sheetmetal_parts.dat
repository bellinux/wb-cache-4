40|$|The {{reduction}} of development time and cost {{is a very}} important task in every manufacturing industry. In this paper, a CAD/CAE application for global automation of the whole design process in a Greek manufacturing company is presented, using the Top-Down methodology. For this purpose, a 3 -D Parametric Solid Modelling System is used, and the results are compared with company’s existing 2 -D Parametric Design System. The whole assembly depends on 7 input parameters, and the results include the complete 3 -D solid model of the transformer assembly, the necessary mechanical drawings, the customized bill of materials for all subsystems, and the G-Codes for all <b>sheetmetal</b> <b>parts</b> of the assembly. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an account of}} some investigations into a new die-less rapid prototyping process for sheetmetal forming, namely Incremental Sheetmetal Forming (ISF). The process {{involves the use of}} a single smooth tool to carry out local sheet metal deformation progressively on a CNC milling machine. The controlled movement of the tool enables a 3 -Dimensional profile to be made. The process can offer rapid prototyping advantages for <b>sheetmetal</b> <b>parts</b> to be made directly from a 3 D CAD model to the finished product without the traditional intermediate stage of tool design and manufacture. The paper describes an investigation into the capabilities of the ISF process by using experimental data to develop a tool-path generation methodology for generic materials and shapes. This is achieved by looking at a number of process variables, such as tool rotational speed and tool feed rates, on surface finish, as well as dimensional accuracy. The ISF process can offer the advantages of short lead times, high flexibility and low cost for volume applications...|$|E
40|$|The project {{elaborated}} {{in frame}} of engineering studies branch Manufacturing Technology (N 2307 - 00) is submitting design of technology {{production of the}} latch claw. The latch claw is a component of a car side-door latch assembly {{and can be used}} for different car models. The part is made of sheetmetal 4 mm thick. The material for the part is 15 CrMo 5, alloy steel for case-hardening purposes. Pursuant of the literary pursuit was designed several options of the part manufacture. With regard to required dimensional accuracy, cut-edge quality and expected production run (800 000 pcs. per year) was proposed manufacturing the part by fineblanking technology. Fineblanking is a cost-effective manufacturing method for accurate <b>sheetmetal</b> <b>parts.</b> For manufacturing parts was chosen Feintool hydraulic fineblanking press HFA 3200 plus with total force 3200 kN. The press is coupled to a coil reel a strip straighter. Both units of Feintool feeding line FBA 8 / 300 are very compact, reducing space requirement. For the fineblanking tool design is used a moving-punch system because these tool systems are compact and economical to make and use. The tool make use of standardized cast iron fineblanking die set made by Fibro company. At the conclusion was compared the cost-effectiveness between two production methods – fineblanking with that of laser beam cutting...|$|E
50|$|The 900 {{underwent}} minor cosmetic {{design changes}} for 1987, including restyled front-end and bumpers that {{went from a}} vertical to a more sloped design; <b>sheetmetal</b> body <b>parts</b> were unchanged. Being a small car factory, for economic reasons, Saab kept the basic undercarriage more or less unchanged throughout the 900's production run.|$|R

50|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Mirada would reopen the door to Dodge success in NASCAR racing, as the {{nameplate}} had not won a race since November 1977. Lee Iacocca personally called Richard Petty, a longtime Dodge driver, in late October 1980 {{and asked him to}} build and test a race spec Mirada, saying Chrysler would supply Petty Enterprises the necessary body <b>sheetmetal</b> and engine <b>parts</b> Petty would need to build and campaign the car. Petty, who had left Dodge for General Motors in 1978, agreed, and had his team immediately set about and built a Mirada-based race-car. A few other teams including Junior Johnson's team built race-spec Mirada's to test. Johnson's team would have been a major coup for Dodge, as they had been running GM cars since the team's inception and the team had just signed Darrell Waltrip away from DiGard Motorsports to drive for them (Waltrip having won 22 races in GM cars prior to this).|$|R
