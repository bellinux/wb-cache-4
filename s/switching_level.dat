40|$|Abstract — Custom VLSI {{design at}} the <b>switch</b> <b>level</b> is {{commonly}} applied when a chip {{is required to}} meet stringent operating requirements in terms of speed, power, or area.

A switching-level operation analysis for BTB converter {{is very important}} to understand the converter operation in detail and check the voltage and current transients in each components. However, the development of switching-level simulation model for the actual size BTB Converter is very difficult because the MMC normally has more than 150 sub-modules for each arm. So, a <b>switching</b> <b>level</b> simulation model for the 11 -level MMC-based BTB converter was developed with PSCAD/EMTDC software, which has 12 sub-modules for the positive arm and another 12 sub-modules for the negative arm.

40|$|The {{integration}} of ferroelectric materials {{will enhance the}} functionality of conventional microsystems. The converse piezoelectric effect {{can be used for}} the fabrication of integrated actuators, which will help to realize integrated high frequency switches. The aim of this thesis is the {{integration of}} ferroelectric thin films into silicon based microsystems. Therefore, PZT thin films have been deposited on platinum coated silicon substrates by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and are characterized regarding their electrical and electromechanical properties. It has been shown that PZT with a composition of 45 % zirconium and 55 % titanium shows a very high piezoelectric coefficient of 115 pm/V. Moreover it has been proved that no electromechanical fatigue occurs, if the material is driven with unipolar electric fields. Lead hafnate titanate (PHT) is a variation of PZT and doping with 10 % lanthanum leads to an electrostrictive behavior. Thereby, the piezoelectric coefficient is around 60 pm/V and nearly independent on the applied electric field, which leads to a linear strain behavior. The investigation of the permittivity of barium strontium titanate (BST) shows a linear decrease with increasing temperatures. This effect is used for the detection of infrared radiation. For the fabrication of silicon based microsystems a variety of technologies have been developed for the structuring of ferroelectric thin films, platinum electrodes, silicon and silicon dioxide. The release of cantilevers and membranes is performed by back etching with TMAH, isotropic etching with SF 6 plasma and by a sacrificial process. The latter one is based on silicon on insulator substrates, whereby the buried oxide is etched with HF-vapor. Furthermore, a process for the fabrication of freestanding copper bridges was developed. A number of cantilevers relying on the converse piezoelectric effect were fabricated and characterized with a laser vibrometer regarding the displacement and the resonance frequency. The measurement results are in good agreement with finite element simulations. A maximum displacement of 80 µm was measured at an applied voltage of only five volts. This is several times more than can be achieved with electrostatic actuation. Further development leads to the fabrication of a microrelay, which than was integrated in an high frequency switch. Simulations show that this novel piezoelectric concept reaches a <b>switching</b> <b>level</b> of more than 20 dB up to 20 GHz. Further fabricated microsystems are thin film bulk acoustic resonators (TFBAR) relying on the generation of acoustic waves due to electrostriction and showing a resonance at 6. 2 GHz as well as a dielectric bolometer for the detection of infrared radiation. Beyond, experiments with PZT coated metal foils exhibit higher spontaneous polarization than obtained on platinum coated silicon. From the experiments, cantilevers using the metal foil as flexible substrate were fabricated with fine mechanical techniques showing a displacement of 35 µm...|$|E
30|$|Adaptive {{techniques}} have been employed for numerous applications. One {{of the early}} works on adaptive modulation for individual subcarriers of an OFDM system is [17]. It used a BER metric for controlling adaptive selection. However, it considered only BPSK, QPSK, and M-QAM without transmit power control and devoid of exploiting the diversity of OFDM channels. Keller and Hanzo investigated adaptive OFDM with {{the focus on the}} trade-off between performance and throughput [18]. They also provided a number of adaptive OFDM techniques and their performance in [19]. Those works mainly focused on gaining a balance between performance and throughput by employing limited number of modulation, i.e., BPSK, QPSK, and 16 -QAM without taking advantage of channel diversity through MIMO system. In [20], the authors examined a unified adaptive modulation approach where the data rate, transmitted power, and instantaneous BER were varied to maximize spectral efficiency. While it gives fundamental ideas of combining three aforementioned metrics for channel adaptation, Chung and Goldsmith [20] do not provide a platform to maximize channel diversity and utilize a rate variation by employing MIMO system. Fu, et al. proposed a link adaptation scheme for MB-OFDM UWB systems [21] with a modest performance improvement. A cross-layer adaptive modulation to minimize the transmission energy in wireless sensor networks was proposed in [22]. Yang and Sayrafian-Pour proposed an adaptive modulation, rate, and duty cycle for body area networks (BANs) to mitigate coexisting wireless interference, including from nearby BANs [23]. Its basic principle, however, is reducing transmit power by using a link adaptation scheme in order to maintain a minimum link quality, hence sacrifice the performance. An optimization of <b>switching</b> <b>level</b> based on the received signal strength to select an adaptive scheme for a frame transmission was proposed in [24]. Its optimization works on the minimization of the difference between upper bound performance and the desired performance on frame-to-frame basis. This scheme works well in high SNR. However, in low SNR it works only by disabling the transmission hence sacrifice the capacity to the extent below that of BPSK. Authors in [25] proposed a dual physical layer (PHY) WBAN which focuses on the design of MAC protocol to optimize data forwarding between those PHY to the external networks. However, they only considered energy efficiency and delay parameters as the performance metrics and did {{not take into account the}} BER and throughput performance. An adaptive medium access control (MAC) was presented in [26], in which the focus is on an adaptive guard band assignment and sleep/wake up mechanism. This scheme is for the MAC layer and does not consider adaptive scheme for the physical layer. An adaptive power control for a WBAN is proposed in [27] without considering adaptive modulation and STFC coding. Although Sodro et al. [27] provide a significance power saving, they do not exploit the multipath diversity nature of WBAN channel through a MIMO. In other words, adaptive schemes for the WBAN system which are capable to take advantage of a rich diversity of body area channels by utilizing a MIMO technique have been largely unexplored in the literature.|$|E
