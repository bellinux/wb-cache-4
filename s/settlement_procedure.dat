40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and the EU under GATT and the WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> can contribute to states’ compliance with these dispute settlement mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose under GATT) and the Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), the Steel case (GATT) and the Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases under GATT and the WTO respectively, and the Citrus case (GATT) and the Bananas case (WTO). In {{each of the four}} comparisons the US acted more in accordance with the judicial WTO dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> than with the diplomatic GATT procedures. We can therefore say that contrary to realist assumptions, the judicialization of dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> can contribute to their effectiveness. However, contrary to idealist assumptions the effectiveness of international dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> does not automatically follow from their judicialization. Yet, as assumed by institutionalists, judicialized dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> are better than diplomatic dispute settlement mechanisms in sustaining states’ compliance with these procedures precisely because of their normative and strategic effects...|$|R

50|$|Later, in June 2011, Hans-Werner Sinn and Timo Wollmershaeuser {{compiled}} {{the first}} panel database of the Eurozone's Target balances. The authors {{point out that}} the additional creation of money by the central banks of the crisis-stricken countries was provided by a lowering of the standards for the collateral that commercial banks have to provide to their national central banks to obtain refinancing credit. Furthermore, they showed that the commercial banks of the Eurozone's core countries used the incoming liquidity to reduce the refinancing credit they drew from their national central bank, even lending the surplus liquidity to this central bank, which implies that the Target balances indirectly also measure the reallocation of refinancing credit among the countries of the Eurozone. The authors showed that the national central banks of the northern countries became net debtors to their own banking systems. Sinn and Wollmershaeuser argue that the euro crisis is a balance-of-payments crisis, which in its substance is similar to the Bretton Woods crisis. Moreover, they show the extent to which Target credit financed current account deficits or capital flight in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. They also show that the current account deficits of Greece and Portugal were financed for years by refinancing credits of their national central banks and the concomitant Target credit. They document as well the Irish capital flight and the capital flight from Spain and Italy, which began in earnest in summer 2011. Following Sinn, the authors compare the Target balances of the Eurosystem with the corresponding balances in the US settlement system (Interdistrict Settlement Account) and point out that US balances relative to US GDP have decreased thanks to a regularly performed <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> in which ownership shares in a common Fed clearing portfolio are reallocated among the various District Feds comprising the US Federal Reserve System. They advocate the establishment of a similar system in Europe to end the ECB's role as a provider of international public credit that undercuts private market conditions. Hans-Werner Sinn addressed the Target balances issue again in a special edition of 'ifo Schnelldienst' and made it the main topic of his book ‘Die Target-Falle‘ ("The Target Trap"), published in early October 2012.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} limits of {{international}} trade cooperation {{in the presence of}} a dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure.</b> The dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> is modeled as set of conditions imposed on the punishment equilibria of a repeated tariff game, conditions that are consistent with the WTO principles of conciliation and reciprocity. The resulting equilibria are "renegotiation-proof" in the sense of Pearce (1987). We find that tariff agreements cannot achieve free trade in the presence of the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure,</b> although the cost of this limitation becomes small for high discount factors. Quota agreements can achieve free trade under the dispute settlement procedure; however, countries would always prefer to settle disputes with tariff sanctions, if given a choice.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to reexamine the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> under the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{from the viewpoint}} of incentive design. The WTO dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> are aimed not only to resolving disputes but also at securing compliance of obligations under WTO agreements. It is therefore necessary to analyze the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> focusing on their aspect as a mechanism for deterring non-compliance with WTO rules. In this regard, Warren F. Schwarz and Alan O. Sykes (2002) distinguish between two types of non-compliance: "efficient breaches," or non-compliance that increases the total sum of benefits to all WTO members, and "inefficient breaches," or non-compliance that decreases the total sum of benefits to all WTO members, defining the WTO dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures</b> as a mechanism for encouraging the former and deterring the latter. Yet in doing so, they did not conduct detailed substantive analysis of the WTO dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures.</b> In this paper, a simple game theoretic model has been used to analyze the current framework of the WTO dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedures.</b> It has been found that not only effective breaches but also ineffective breaches cannot be deterred under the existing framework. In this sense, the procedures are not functioning in the manner postulated by Schwarz and Sykes. In other words, under the current framework, WTO member countries have an incentive to intentionally engage in conduct that might or would constitute an ineffective breach, and would remove or correct the questioned measure if and only after it {{has been found to be}} inconsistent with the relevant WTO agreement. Such an incentive is not weakened by criticism from other members of the international community or by retaliatory measures. Furthermore, the fact that retroactive compensation - remedies for previously incurred damages - is not allowed under the current system, which increases the incentive for non-compliance, particularly, inefficient breaches. In this sense, the current WTO dispute settlement system is insufficient at deterring violations. There have been discussions about increasing the level of retaliation winning parties are allowed to take in the event of non-implementation. However, addressing the problem described above would require other measures, which may include allowing winning parties to seek, at the stage of implementation, monetary compensation for past damages, the grant of interlocutory injunction, or approval for limited retaliation. Yet each of these measures is not without problems and further study will be required. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact on UK stock and option markets of the change from an account based {{settlement}} system to a rolling <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure.</b> Such a change increases the transaction costs of short-term margin traders, {{and is likely to}} impact on the liquidity of the underlying market, as well as trading in the options market. Evidence is presented that the <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> does impact on the liquidity of the market. Further, we find that rolling settlement increased market liquidity, consistent with the exit of margin traders {{as a result of the}} increase in short selling costs. Associated with this increase in liquidity is a significant reduction in nonoptionable stock trading volume, implying that margin trading may have been more prevalent in stocks without options. Finally, it is shown that while trading in stock options increased, the volatilities implied from call and put option prices indicate that put options have become relatively more expensive. This reflects the change in demand induced by the new <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure,</b> especially in terms of the increase in short selling costs. ...|$|E
40|$|One {{prominent}} {{explanation for}} disagreement in bargaining {{is that the}} parties have divergent and relatively optimistic expectations regarding the ultimate outcome {{if they fail to}} agree. The fact that settlement rates are much higher where final-offer arbitration is the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> than where conventional arbitration is the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> is used as the basis of a test of the role of divergent expectations in causing disagreement in negotiations. Calculations of identical-expectations contract zones using existing estimates of models of arbitrator behavior yield larger identical-expectations contract zones in conventional arbitration than in final-offer arbitration. This evidence clearly suggests that divergent expectations alone are not an adequate explanation of disagreement in labor-management negotiations. A number of alternative explanations for disagreement are suggested and evaluated. ...|$|E

40|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is a key}} {{arena for}} {{establishing}} global legal norms for what counts as relevant knowledge. As a high-profile case, the WTO trade dispute on GMOs mobilized scientific expertise in somewhat novel ways. Early on, the Panel put the dispute under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement through a new legal ontology; it classified transgenes as potential pests and limited all environmental issues to the ‘plant and animal health’ category. The selection of scientific experts sought a multi-party consensus through a fast adversarial process, reflecting a specific legal epistemology. For the SPS framing, focusing on the defendant’s regulatory procedures, the Panel staged scientific expertise in specific ways that set up how experts were questioned, the answers they would give, their specific role in the legal arena, and the way their statements would complement the Panel’s findings. In these ways, the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> co-produced legal and scientific expertise within the Panel’s SPS framework. Moreover, the Panel operated a procedural turn in WTO jurisprudence by representing its findings as a purely legal-administrative judgement on whether the EC’s regulatory procedures violated the SPS Agreement, while keeping implicit its own judgements on substantive risk issues. As this case illustrates, the WTO <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> mobilizes scientific expertise for sophisticated, multiple aims: it recruits a source of credibility from the scientific arena, thus reinforcing the standard narrative of ‘science-based trade discipline’, while also constructing new scientific expertise for the main task – namely, challenging trade restrictions for being unduly cautious...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{apparent}} universal {{existence of the}} friendly <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> {{it has not been}} extensively used in the African regional system. Against this background, this study is a comparative analysis of the provisions and application of the friendly <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> in the African, Inter-American and European regional systems. The study further examines in detail the practice and jurisprudence of the three regional systems on a comparative basis. The comparative analysis is relevant for the following reasons. Both Africa and South America share common historical backgrounds in terms of socio-economic development and the nature of human rights violations. Europe has the oldest human rights system and if experience is anything to go by, then there might be lessons to be learnt by the younger counterparts. The establishment of the African Court of Human and Peoples' Rights (African Court) to complement the protection mandate of the African Commission on Human and Poeoples' Rights (The African Commission) further justifies the comparative analysis as the other regional systems also have regional human rights courts. [...] . Chapter 1 is an introduction of the study on the effectiveness and propriety of friendly settlements. The ensuing chapter traces the foundations and sets up the conceptual and theoretical framework of friendly settlements. Having established the existence of the procedure, chapter 3 examines the institutional and legal provisions of friendly settlements in international and regional human rights instruments on a factual level. The detailed and critical analysis of the frienldy <b>settlement</b> <b>procedure</b> is presented in chapter 4. The author makes use of the jurisprudence of the three regional human rights bodies and examines how the procedure has been applied in practice. The practice of the three regional bodies is analysed on a comparative basis to assess the effectiveness of the procedure.
