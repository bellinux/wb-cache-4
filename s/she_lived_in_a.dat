Darejan, Queen Dowager of Georgia and Lady of the Russian Order of St. Catherine, Grand Cross, was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.|$|E
5|$|When Hickok's {{diabetes}} worsened in 1945, she {{was forced}} to leave her position with the DNC. Two years later, Roosevelt found her a position with the New York State Democratic Committee. When Hickok's health continued to decline, she moved to Hyde Park to be closer to Roosevelt. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cottage on the Roosevelt estate, where she died in 1968. She is buried at Rhinebeck Cemetery in Rhinebeck, New York.|$|E
5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Docherty {{remained}} {{a member of}} the Communist Party for 70 years, at times working with Alex Moffat and Abe Moffat. She campaigned for J. V. Leckie when he was a candidate for the Dunfermline Burghs constituency. She worked for Willie Gallacher, the communist Member of Parliament for Fife, for several years, and in 1952 unsuccessfully ran for a city council seat. At various points, Docherty held the positions of treasurer, Women's Group leader, and secretary for the Fife branch of the Communist Party. She retired from active political life when she was 60 years old, but despite being crippled by arthritis, participated in fundraising efforts for the newspaper Morning Star. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modest house in Cowdenbeath, and spent her time working on her memoirs. She continued to give talks and participate in International Women's Day events nearly every year until her death.|$|E
5|$|Mah Laqa Bai (7 April 1768 – 1824), born Chanda Bibi, and {{sometimes}} referred to as Mah Laqa Chanda, was an Indian 18th century Urdu poet, courtesan and philanthropist based in Hyderabad. In 1824, she became the first female poet to have a diwan (collection of poems) of her work, a compilation of Urdu Ghazals named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, published posthumously. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period when Dakhini (a version of Urdu) was making its transition into the highly Persianized Urdu. Her literary contributions provide insight on such linguistic transformations in southern India. She was an influential female courtesan of the Deccan; the Nizam, ruler of Hyderabad, appointed her to the omarah (the highest nobility), and as a close affiliate at the court. In 2010, her memorial in Hyderabad, that houses her tomb, was restored using funds donated by the Federal government of the United States.|$|E

25|$|As a Queen Dowager, it was {{a relief}} to Sophia Magdalena to {{withdraw}} from public life. Her brother-in-law, Duke Charles, became regent, and she eschewed a political role. As a widow, Sophia Magdalena lived a withdrawn life. She did not wish to take part in any representational duties, and she gave up her quarters at Drottningholm Palace to be relieved of them. She lived in the Royal Palace in Stockholm during the winter, and at Ulriksdal Palace during the summer. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderström. It is noted, that although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them a position in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.|$|E
25|$|Atwood has {{indicated}} in interviews that she considers herself a Red Tory {{in the historical}} sense of the term. Atwood and her partner Graeme Gibson are strong supporters of Green Party of Canada leader, Elizabeth May. Atwood has strong views on environmental issues, and she and Gibson are the joint honorary presidents of the Rare Bird Club within BirdLife International. She has been chair of the Writers' Union of Canada and president of PEN Canada, and is currently a vice-president of PEN International. In the 2008 federal election, she attended a rally for the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec separatist party, because of her support for their position on the arts, and stated that she would vote for the party if <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> riding in Quebec in which the choice was between the Bloc and the Conservatives. In a Globe and Mail editorial, she urged Canadians to vote for any other party to stop a Conservative majority.|$|E
25|$|All {{her life}} Bortkevičienė campaigned for {{democratic}} liberties and was particularly {{upset by the}} December 1926 coup d'état that brought the authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona. Her publications were critical of the regime {{either directly or indirectly}} (for example, via examination of negative effects of other authoritarian regimes). On 11 March 1927, the printing house was bombed by unknown persons, most likely members of the fascist Voldemarininkai movement; <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small house near the printing house. The explosion was powerful enough to collapse two floors of the building and destroy printing presses. However, the newspaper was not discontinued – the same day Lietuvos žinios was printed by a different press. Bortkevičienė rebuilt the press by October 1928. The publication of Lietuvos žinios was temporarily suspended by the government censors four times; the last and the longest time was six months for making fun of a son of Benito Mussolini. Bortkevičienė campaigned for amnesty of Juozas Pajaujis who received a death sentence for organizing an anti-Smetona coup in 1927.|$|E

500|$|Pattycake moved {{permanently}} to the Bronx Zoo on December 20, 1982. For a few years, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cage with Pansy, a chimpanzee. [...] In June 1999, Pattycake {{moved into}} the Wildlife Conservation Society's $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit. [...] The exhibit includes a Great Gorilla Forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window. Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo. The general curator of the Bronx Zoo, James Doherty, described Pattycake as [...] "independent" [...] with [...] "few close friends" [...] in the Congo Gorilla Forest. [...] "It {{may have something to}} do with the fact that she didn't live with her parents that long, and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years," [...] Doherty said.|$|E
500|$|In 1941 Anderson {{completed}} her PhD at the University of Wisconsin, writing her thesis on [...] "Low energy {{levels in the}} atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII". Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons. [...] Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day. [...] Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. While there, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dormitory, and being older {{than most of the}} other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge. She often worked at night, wearing jeans and a plaid shirt– not the usual attire for a woman at the time.|$|E
