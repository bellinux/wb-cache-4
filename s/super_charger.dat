40|$|Abstract — Transesterified {{vegetable}} oil, {{also called}} bio-diesel {{is becoming increasingly}} important as a fuel for diesel engine due to several reasons. Bio-diesel is a renewable, inexhaustible and a clean burning fuel. Many {{studies have shown that}} properties of bio-diesel are very close to petro diesel. Bio-diesel can be used in diesel engine without modification. Bio-diesel has no aromatic, no-sulfur and contains 10 - 12 % oxygen by weight. These characteristics of bio-diesel reduce the harmful emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and CO, research has shown that NOx, emission is higher in case of bio-diesel fueled engine. Exhaust gas recirculation is an effective technique to reduce NOx. The aim of present research work is to use B 10,B 20, B 30, blend of jatropha methyl ester and cooled EGR in order to reduce pollutant from diesel engine emission of NOx, CO, HC,are recorded and compared with petro diesel. Various performance parameters was evaluated such as brake thermal efficiency, BSFC, SEC, TFC were calculated. Result indicates the reduction of NOx and brake thermal efficiency decreased with the application of EGR. The effect of super charging also studied and the performance of the engine are evaluated in terms of BSFC, TFC, SEC, brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency. The investigation result shows that the output and brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency of the engine with <b>super</b> <b>charger</b> was improved in comparison with naturally aspirated engine...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{have begun}} to hit the main stream market, with sales raising form under 20, 000 in 2001 to over 110, 000 per year since 2014 [1]. With new models hitting the market every year, and more people becoming conscious about their fossil fuel usage, this trend will only continue until there are more electric vehicles than combustion vehicles on the road. A major drawback of electric vehicles is their limited range, and relatively long recharge times. Even with advancements in battery charging speed, such as the Tesla <b>super</b> <b>charger,</b> able to provide up to 90 miles of range in just 30 minutes, electric vehicles are still not practical for people who make regular, long distance trips [2]. These quick charging technologies not only take much longer than refueling a combustion vehicle, they providing less range, and they are also bad for the vehicles batteries. Regularly using them will greatly reduce the capacity and lifespan of the vehicles battery pack. The equivalent to refueling a combustion vehicle, is switching out the traction battery pack for a fully charged one. This gives the vehicle {{the full range of}} the battery pack, {{in the time it takes}} for the exchange to take place. This technology would help make electric vehicles more practical for people who do not want to wait around for their vehicle to charge, as well as help spread the cost of replacing depleted battery packs over the life of the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} twisted D=N= 2 superspace formalism. The {{relation}} between the twisted <b>super</b> <b>charges</b> including the BRST charge, vector and pseudo scalar <b>super</b> <b>charges</b> and the N= 2 spinor <b>super</b> <b>charges</b> is established. We claim that this relation is essentially related with the Dirac-Kähler fermion mechanism.

We then construct a Yang-Mills action described by the twisted N= 2 chiral and vector superfields, and show that the action is equivalent to the twisted version of the D=N= 2 super Yang-Mills action, previously obtained from the quantized generalized topological Yang-Mills action with instanton gauge fixing.
