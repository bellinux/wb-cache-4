This regulatory framework defines a range of performance standards which recognise specific high-level uncertainties and long-term issues which storage developers will have to address. However, with one or two notable exceptions, the level of site characterisation required to obtain a <b>storage</b> <b>permit</b> has not been systematically evaluated. To determine the required geological site characterisation necessary to demonstrate adequate understanding of site performance, two storage case studies identify those issues that might remain challenging in the permitting process. These case studies, an onshore aquifer and an offshore multi-store site, produce credible dry-run <b>storage</b> <b>permit</b> applications from site geological characterisation activities, which are evaluated by a separate team, acting as a regulator. The applications, though necessarily reduced in scope from those anticipated for full storage projects, comprise the key elements of a permit. Issues identified during this process include:•Defining the storage complex boundaries, which for certain sites may be challenging, especially where expected pressure responses may extend for some distance or where lateral boundaries may not be clearly defined. We present examples of how these regulatory boundaries have been defined for the two case studies. •Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include a range of metrics against which site performance can be measured, both during the operational and closure phases, providing a basis for the design of the geological monitoring program and the corrective measures plan. Defining qualitative terms such as ‘expected’ or ‘acceptable’ in appropriate quantitative metrics has been attempted for site ‘sufficient’ measured, both during the operational and closure phases, providing a basis for the design of the geological monitoring program and the corrective measures plan-specific KPIs in the case studies described.

On average 1. 1 million tonnes of CO 2 per year will be compressed, transported via a 25 km insulated pipeline to the P 18 -A platform operated by TAQA, and permanently stored offshore in the P 18 - 4 depleted gas reservoir.

40|$|AbstractThe {{adoption}} of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) {{as a method}} of mitigating anthropogenic CO 2 emissions will depend on the ability of initial geological storage projects to demonstrate secure containment of injected CO 2. Potential leakage pathways, such as faults or degraded wells, increase the uncertainty of geological storage security. CCS as an industry {{is still in its infancy}} and until we have experience of industrial scale, long term CO 2 storage projects, quantifying leakage event probabilities will be problematic. Laboratory measurements of residual saturation trapping, the immobilisation of isolated micro-bubbles of CO 2 in reservoir pores, provides an evidence base to determine the fraction of injected CO 2 that will remain trapped in the reservoir, even if a leakage event were to occur. Experimental results for sandstone, the most common target lithology for storage projects, demonstrate that 13 – 92 % of injected CO 2 can be residually trapped. Mineralisation, the only other geological trapping mechanism which guarantees permanent trapping of CO 2, immobilises CO 2 over hundreds to thousands of years. In comparison, residual trapping occurs over years to decades, a timescale which is more relevant to CCS projects during their operational phase and to any financial security mechanisms they require to secure <b>storage</b> <b>permits...</b>|$|E

This <b>storage</b> <b>permits</b> the fast and efficient application of our box-counting approach to compute what we call the “dynamic fractal dimension”. For a nonempty set of points in the d-dimensional space R d (for constant d ≥ 1), the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is shown to be O(n log n) while the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of considered points. In addition, we show that the time complexity of an insertion, or a deletion is O(log n), and that the above time and space complexity is optimal.

40|$|SummaryIn {{polyandrous}} females, sperm <b>storage</b> <b>permits</b> {{competition between}} sperm of different mates, {{and in some}} species females influence the relative fertilization success of competing sperm {{in favor of a}} preferred mate [1, 2]. In female Drosophila melanogaster, sperm competition is strongly influenced by the timing of sperm ejection from the uterus [3, 4]. Understanding how female behavior influences sperm competition requires knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms controlling sperm retention and storage, which is currently lacking. Here, we show that D.  melanogaster females eject male ejaculates from the uterus 1 – 6  hr after mating with a stereotypic behavior regulated by a brain signaling pathway composed of diuretic hormone 44 (Dh 44), a neuropeptide related to vertebrate corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and its receptor, Dh 44 R 1. Suppression of Dh 44 signals in the brain expedites sperm ejection from the uterus, resulting in marked reduction of sperm in the storage organs and decreased fecundity, whereas enhancement of Dh 44 signals delays sperm expulsion. The Dh 44 function was mapped to six neurons located in the pars intercerebralis of the brain together with a small subset of Dh 44 R 1 neurons that express the sex-specific transcription factor doublesex. This study identifies a neuronal pathway by which females can control sperm retention and storage and provides new insight into how the female might exercise post-copulatory sexual selection...|$|E

These exercises provide insight in the way implementation of CCS project plans may be perceived by local stakeholders, and inform approaches to develop effective local communication and participation strategies. 				Key lessons from the research conducted in SiteChar were developed as technical recommendations for storage site characterisation and best practice guidance for storage permitting from the perspective of both applicant and regulator. A best practice guide for policymakers and regulators at Member States and European levels, potential storage site developers and operators has been presented...|$|E
40|$|Accurately {{monitoring}} changing energy {{usage patterns}} in households {{is a first}} requirement for more efficient and eco-friendly energy management. Such data {{is essential to the}} establishment of the Smart Grid, but at this stage, domestic data collection devices are still in development and monitoring-enabled domestic appliances are rare, so that any experimental software framework must be flexible and adaptable both in respect of sensor sources and developer and user requirements. These considerations have been the drivers behind the distributed agent-based platform this paper proposes. It provides: (i) a generic sensor interface that can be specialised for new devices as required, while insulating the rest of the platform from such changes, (ii) persistent unstructured (RDF) data <b>storage,</b> <b>permitting</b> both semantic annotation and semantic-based queries, independent of data sources, and (iii) a flexible, dynamic browser interface, that allows for remote configuration of the sensor platform and accessibility via a wide range of devices. Two small case studies show the utility of the approach...|$|R
50|$|To {{comply with}} IRS requirements, all IRAs, {{including}} precious metals IRAs, {{must be in}} the possession of a trustee or custodian. Therefore, legally speaking, precious metals in an IRA are in the custody of the trustee or custodian, not the IRA owner. IRS Publication 590 specifies that for all IRAs, “The trustee or custodian must be a bank, a federally insured credit union, a savings and loan association, or an entity approved by the IRS to act as trustee or custodian.” Many trustees/custodians use civilian (private) depositories, which may be approved by various commodities exchanges, for storing IRA metals. Security features may include timed locks and automatic re-locking features, 24/7 monitoring, and motion, sound, and vibration detectors. They typically have large insurance policies, with some amounting to as much as $1 billion. There are two types of Gold IRA <b>Storage</b> <b>permitted</b> in depositories: non-segregated, where your assets are mixed with the assets of others; and segregated, where your assets are held separately from other people’s assets.|$|R
40|$|The Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application is {{considered}} to be a single application organized into a General Information Portion (document number DOE/RL- 91 - 28) and a Unit-Specific Portion. The scope of the Unit-Specific Portion is limited to Part B permit application documentation submitted for individual, operating treatment, storage, and/or disposal units, such as the PUREX Storage Tunnels (this document, DOE/RL- 90 - 24). Both the General Information and Unit-Specific portions of the Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application address the content of the Part B permit application guidance prepared by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology 1996) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (40 Code of Federal Regulations 270), with additional information needs defined by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments and revisions of Washington Administrative Code 173 - 303. For ease of reference, the Washington State Department of Ecology alpha-numeric section identifiers from the permit application guidance documentation (Ecology 1996) follow, in brackets, the chapter headings and subheadings. A checklist indicating where information is contained in the PUREX <b>Storage</b> Tunnels <b>permit</b> application documentation, in relation to the Washington State Department of Ecology guidance, is located in the Contents Section. Documentation contained in the General Information Portion is broader in nature and could be used by multiple treatment, storage, and/or disposal units (e. g., the glossary provided in the General Information Portion). Wherever appropriate, the PUREX <b>Storage</b> Tunnels <b>permit</b> application documentation makes cross-reference to the General Information Portion, rather than duplicating text. Information provided in this PUREX <b>Storage</b> Tunnels <b>permit</b> application documentation is current as of April 1997...|$|R

The park surrounding the lake to the north houses one large pavilion on a large open grass area which is frequently used by kite-fliers. The lake also houses two major boat docks and one year-round marina for boat <b>storage.</b> A <b>permit</b> is required to launch a boat.|$|R
