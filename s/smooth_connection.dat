40|$|We {{consider}} {{the more general}} question as to when a connection is a metric connection. There are two aspects to this investigation: first, {{the determination of the}} integrability conditions that ensure the existence of a local parallel metric in the neighbourhood of a given point and second, the characterization of the topological obstruction to a globally defined parallel metric. MSC: 53 C 05 0 By means of a derived flag it may be ascertained when a connection on a vector bundle possesses, locally, a non-trivial parallel section; in particular, for the bundle of symmetric, covariant two-tensors on a manifold this solves the problem as to when a connection is locally metric. For connections satisfying a certain regularity requirement, the existence of a global parallel metric may be formulated in the setting of the cohomology of the constant sheaf of sections in the general linear group. When the general linear group associated to the connection is one-dimensional the obstruction may be defined in terms of de Rham cohomology. Lastly, the difference between analytic and <b>smooth</b> <b>connections</b> is examined: whereas analytic connections are regular, the case of <b>smooth</b> <b>connections</b> is shown to possess a pathology in that a locally metric connection need not be globally metric, even on a contractible manifold. 1...|$|R
