5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitation did not apply, not {{that it would not}} bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

5000|$|Because <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose impose an {{absolute}} bar for actions against manufacturers, typically {{based on the}} date that allegedly defective goods are delivered or installed rather than the date when they cause harm, they are strongly favored over <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> limitation by industry trade groups and opposed by consumer organizations and tort lawyers.

5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E

5|$|In November 1267, {{parliament}} met at Marlborough. Here {{an important}} provision was issued {{that would become}} known to history as the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Marlborough.

5|$|In 1414, {{six years}} before the Treaty of Troyes, a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> Henry V of England gave {{directions}} to the goldsmiths {{in terms of the}} troy pound. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used for weighing metals and spices. After the abolishment of the Tower pound in 1527 by Henry VIII of England, the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Injuries {{resulting}} from environmental conditions created by improvements to real property {{have always been}} commonplace. Across jurisdictions, however, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that defendants may be able to escape liability for certain environmentally-related injuries by invoking <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose. Although <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose may protect defendants from prejudice in court and relieve them of past obligations, they may also prevent injured plaintiffs from obtaining redress in court where their injuries were latent or undiscoverable. This Note explores the nature and purpose <b>of</b> <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose, discusses whether they might be used by defendants during environmental litigation by addressing case law and public policy considerations, and offers suggestions for balancing the interests of plaintiffs and defendants to the extent that <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose are applicable to environmental injuries...|$|R
