40|$|Mediterranean and West European pre-modern {{agriculture}} (agriculture before 1600) was {{by necessity}} ‘organic agriculture’. Crop protection is {{part and parcel}} of this agriculture, with weed control in the forefront. Crop protection is embedded in the medieval agronomy text books but specialised sections do occur. Weeds, insects and diseases are described but identification in modern terms is not easy. The pre-modern ‘Crop Portfolio’ is well filled, certainly in the Mediterranean area. The medieval ‘Pest Portfolio’ differs from the modern one because agriculture then was a Low External Input Agriculture, and because the proportion of cultivated to non-cultivated land was drastically lower than today. The pre-modern ‘Control Portfolio’ is surprisingly rich, both in preventive and interventive measures. Prevention was by risk management, intensive tillage, and careful <b>storage.</b> <b>Intervention</b> was mechanical and chemical. Chemical intervention used natural substances such as sulphur, pitch, and ‘botanicals’. Some fifty plant species are mentioned in a crop protection context. Though application methods look rather modern they are typically low-tech. Among them are seed disinfection, spraying, dusting, fumigation, grease banding, wound care, and hand-picking but also scarification, now outdated. The reality of pest outbreaks and other damages is explored as to frequency, intensity, and extent. Information on the practical use of the recommended treatments is scanty. If applied, their effectiveness remains enigmatic. Three medieval agronomists are at the heart of this book, but historical developments in crop protection from early Punic, Greek, and Roman authors to the first modern author are outlined. The readership of these writers was the privileged class of landowners but hints pointing to the exchange of ideas between them and the common peasant were found. Consideration is given to the pre-modern reasoning in matters of crop protection. Comparison of pre-modern crop protection and its counterpart in modern organic agriculture is difficult because of drastic changes in the relation between crop areas and non-crop areas, and because of the great difference in yield levels then and now, with several associated differences...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{guidelines}} for denture care are available, but evidence for optimal nocturnal storage is scarce. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the role of the overnight storage state on plaque growth and composition on acrylic removable dentures. METHODS: In a parallel-group randomized controlled trial of 51 institutionalized participants, 3 denture overnight preservation methods were considered: (i) in water, (ii) dry or (iii) in water with added alkaline peroxide-based cleansing tablet. Biofilm samples were taken on day 7 (developing biofilm - dBF) and day 14 (maturing biofilm - mBF) from a mechanically uncleaned, standardized region, situated distally to the second lower premolars. Total and individual levels of selected perio-pathogenic and commensal species (n= 20), and of Candida albicans were calculated by PCR. Differences between storage conditions (water/dry/tablet) and between the samples (dBF/mBF) were assessed by means of unpaired and paired t-tests respectively, with α= 5 %. RESULTS: Overnight denture storage with cleansing tablet significantly decreased the total bacterial level of dBF and mBF up to 13. 8 %. Fn, Ec, Cs, Sc, Ao and Vp counts were particularly affected by tablet care. Significant lower amounts of Candida albicans for tablet storage compared to water preservation were recorded in dBF and mBF (- 69. 3 ± 3. 8 % and - 75. 9 ± 3. 2 % respectively). The mass and pathogenicity of dBF and mBF was equal, irrespective of the overnight <b>storage</b> <b>intervention.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of cleansing tablets for acrylic removable denture overnight storage reduces denture biofilm mass and pathogenicity compared to dry and water preservation, and may contribute to the overall systemic health. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence-based clinical {{guidelines for}} overnight storage of removable acrylic dentures are lacking. The findings of this study indicate that alkaline peroxide-based cleansing tablets decrease bacterial and Candida levels in denture biofilms in case of poor oral hygiene.

Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are found in water, {{but there is little}} research on whether NTM survive POU treatment. Mycobacteria may be removed by multi-barrier treatment systems that combine processes such as coagulation, settling and disinfection. This work evaluated removal of a non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (Mycobaterium terrae) and a Gram-negative non-acid-fast environmental bacterium (Aeromonas hydrophila) by combined coagulation-flocculation disinfection POU treatment. Aeromonas hydrophila showed 7. 7 log 10 reduction in demand free buffer, 6. 8 log 10 in natural surface water, and 4 log 10 reduction in fecally contaminated surface water. Turbidity after treatment was < 1 NTU. There was almost no reduction in levels of viable M. terrae by coagulant-flocculant-disinfectant in natural water after 30 minutes. The lack of Mycobacteria reduction was similar for both combined coagulant-flocculant-disinfectant and hypochlorite alone. A POU coagulant-flocculant-disinfectant treatment effectively reduced A. hydrophila from natural surface waters but not Mycobacteria. These results reinforce previous findings that POU coagulation-flocculation-disinfection is effective against gram-negative enteric bacteria.

Please note that although {{commonly referred to as}} the BioSand Filter, the BioSand Filter terminology is trademarked to one particular design, and this fact sheet encompasses all slow sand filters. The version most widely implemented consists of layers of sand and gravel in a concrete or plastic container approximately 0. 9 meters tall and 0. 3 meters square. The water level is maintained to 5 - 6 cm above the sand layer by setting the height of the outlet pipe. This shallow water layer allows a bioactive layer to grow on top of the sand, which contributes to the reduction of disease-causing organisms. A diffuser plate is used to prevent disruption of the biolayer when water is added. To use the filter, users simply pour water into the top, and collect finished water out of the outlet pipe into a bucket. Over time, especially if source water is turbid, the flow rate can decrease. Users can maintain flow rate by cleaning the filter through agitating the top level of sand, or by pre-treating turbid water before filtration.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Boiling is {{the most}} common method of {{household}} water treatment in low- and middle-income countries, however, it is not always effectively practiced. We examined factors associated with Escherichia coli contamination of improved water supplies among 207 households in a rural population in Peru that practiced boiling. We subsequently conducted a randomized controlled trial among these households to assess the effectiveness of water pasteurization and safe <b>storage</b> <b>interventions</b> in reducing Escherichia coli contamination of household drinking water. Households were randomized to three study groups: two intervention groups that received either a safe storage container or a safe storage container plus water pasteurization indicator and a control group that continued usual practices. Although over 90 % of households used an improved water source at baseline, 47 % of source and 43 % of stored water samples were contaminated with E. coli. Pouring or using a spigot to obtain water from the storage container instead of dipping a hand or object was associated with decreased risk of contamination of stored water (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0. 58, 95 % CI= 0. 42, 0. 80). Container cleanliness (aPR= 0. 67, 95 % CI= 0. 45, 1. 00) and correct handwashing technique (aPR= 0. 62, 95 % CI= 0. 42, 0. 90) were also associated with decreased contamination risk. During a 13 -week follow-up period, households that received a safe storage container and water pasteurization indicator had a higher prevalence of stored drinking water contamination relative to the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (Prevalence Ratio (PR) : 1. 20, 95 % CI: 0. 94, 1. 52). Receipt of only a safe storage container had no effect on the contamination of stored drinking water (PR: 1. 02, 95 % CI: 0. 79, 1. 31).

40|$|When {{assessing}} soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon <b>storage</b> and <b>interventions</b> to foster {{it should be}} taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87 -year (2014 – 2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1. 9 – 3. 9 % of the SRES-A 2 projected 87 -year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032 – 33, at that time reaching 4. 3 – 8. 9 % of the projected annual SRES-A 2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC...|$|R
40|$|Why is {{household}} {{water treatment}} and safe <b>storage</b> an important <b>intervention</b> for preventing disease? Unsafe drinking water, along with poor sanitation and hygiene, {{are the main}} contributors to an estimated 4 billion cases of diarrhoeal disease annually, causing more than 1. 5 million deaths, mostly among children under 5 years of age (WHO 2005). Because diarrhoeal diseases inhibit normal ingestion of foods and adsorption of nutrients, continued high morbidity also contributes to malnutrition, a separate cause of significant mortality; it also leads to impaired physical growth and cognitive function, reduced resistance to infection, and potentially long-term gastrointestinal disorders. Contaminated drinking water is also {{a major source of}} hepatitis, typhoid and opportunistic infections that attack the immuno-compromised, especially persons living with HIV/AIDS. Outbreaks of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) add to the disease burden and require costly diversion of scarce health and other resources to minimize fatalities.

Earlier <b>intervention</b> may allow metabolic correction to occur before lipid buildup has irreversible consequences and/or before the immune system mounts limiting responses. We have been developing gene therapy to treat lysosomal storage disorders, especially Fabry disease. We describe studies directed toward metabolic correction in neonatal animals mediated by recombinant lentiviral vectors. To develop this method, we first injected a marking lentiviral vector that engineers expression of luciferase into the temporal vein of recipient neonatal animals. The use of a cooled charged-coupled device camera allowed us to track transgene expression over time in live animals. We observed intense luciferase expression in many tissues, including the brain, that did not diminish over 24 weeks. Next, we injected neonatal Fabry mice a single time with a therapeutic lentiviral vector engineered to express human α-galactosidase A. The injection procedure was well tolerated. We observed increased plasma levels of α-galactosidase A activity starting at our first plasma collection point (4 weeks). Levels of α-galactosidase A activity were found to be significantly elevated in many tissues even after 28 weeks. No immune response was observed against the corrective transgene product. Increased levels of enzyme activity also led to significant reduction of globotriaosylceramide in the liver, spleen, and heart.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the links that exist between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Communities (EC) and the EC budget. In particular, the thesis {{examines}} {{the impact on the}} budget of reforming the CAP. It shows that the nature of support offered under the CAP up to the 1992 MacSharry reforms has a strong historical precedent in French and German history. It then goes on to examine in greater detail the support mechanisms of the cereals and oilseeds sectors. The cereals sector is focused on because of its importance in agricultural output and in total agricultural support expenditure by the EC. Oilseeds is considered for its policy linkages with cereals in both production and consumption. The detailed nature of expenditures on these sectors is examined in detail, with particular emphasis placed on costs and policy problems arising out of <b>intervention</b> <b>storage.</b> In forecasting future expenditures under different policy scenarios, cereals production and consumption are considered separately. Imports, exports and intervention behaviour are also considered, to permit the examination of all aspects of the cereals market that affect expenditure. The impact of the 1992 MacSharry reforms is compared to a strict continuation of the 1988 stabiliser reforms and a price freeze at 1992 levels for the forecast period to 1999. It is shown that the impact of the 1992 reforms is to reduce the extent of the market imbalances by 1999 as compared with the base scenarios, but unless the level of compensatory payment is cut, then by 1999, the EC faces a support bill that is higher under the new policy than would have been the case had the 1988 reforms been retained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Early graft {{dysfunction}} due to preservation/reperfusion injury {{represents a}} dramatic event after liver transplantation. Enhancement of donor organ criteria, {{in order to}} cope with the ever increasing donor shortage, further increases graft susceptibility to ischemic alterations. Major parts of post-preservation injury, however, occur at the time of warm reperfusion but not during ischemic storage; successful reperfusion of ischemic tissue in turn depends on an adequate redox and intracellular signal homeostasis. The latter has been shown experimentally to be favorably influenced by oxygen persufflation within short time spans. Thus viability of marginally preserved liver grafts could still be augmented by transient hypothermic reconditioning even after normal procurement and static cold storage. The present study is aimed to confirm the conceptual expectations, that hypothermic reconditioning by gaseous oxygen persufflation is a useful method to suppress injurious cellular activation cascades and to improve post-ischemic recovery of marginally preserved liver grafts. Methods/Design OPAL is a prospective single center randomized proof of concept study, including two parallel groups in a total of 116 liver transplant patients. The effect of an in hospital treatment of the isolated liver graft by 2 hours of oxygen persufflation immediately prior to transplantation will be assesses as compared to standard procedure (cold <b>storage</b> without further <b>intervention).</b> The primary endpoint is the peak transaminase serum level (AST) during the first three days after transplantation as a surrogate readout for parenchymal liver injury. Other outcomes comprise patient and graft survival, time of intensive care requirement, hepatic tissue perfusion 1 h after revascularisation, early onset of graft dysfunction based on coagulation parameters, as well as the use of a refined scoring-system for initial graft function based on a multi-parameter (AST, ALT, Quick and bilirubin) score. Furthermore, the effect of OPAL on molecular pathways of autophagy and inflammatory cell activation will be evaluated.
