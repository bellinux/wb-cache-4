40|$|Ranching is a {{challenging}} and sometimes risky business, with cattle production (and associated enterprise income) largely being dependent on seasonal weather patterns and corresponding forage production. To help reduce this risk, the USDA–Agricultural Research Service performed a multistate study of seasonal weather effects on cattle production across the Northern Great Plains (Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana). Cool, wet springs and longer, cooler growing seasons increased cattle production across the Northern Great Plains. Knowledge of these seasonal weather influences on cattle production {{is important for}} management decision making, but practical application of this knowledge remains problematic. Increased enterprise flexibility to deal with variable forage production {{can be achieved by}} using seasonal weather forecasts, as well as reducing base cow-calf herd numbers to less than 100 % of typical ranch carrying capacity.

40|$|Freely {{discharging}} lowland catchments {{are characterized}} by a strong <b>seasonal</b> <b>contracting</b> and expanding system of discharging streams and ditches. Due to this rapidly changing active channel network, discharge and solute transport cannot be modeled by a single characteristic travel path, travel time distribution, unit hydrograph, or linear reservoir.

The effects of spatial heterogeneity in soil properties, vegetation and drainage network are lumped and described by a relation between groundwater storage and the spatial probability distribution of groundwater depths with measurable parameters. The model describes how in lowland catchments the catchment-scale flux from groundwater to surface water via various flow routes is affected by a changing active channel network, unsaturated-saturated zone interactions and surface ponding. We used observations of groundwater levels and catchment discharge of a 6. 6 km 2 Dutch watershed in combination with a high-resolution spatially distributed hydrological model to test the model approach.

Typically farmers were unable to distinguish between the impact of the Sectoral Determination and other labour laws. Results indicate that the impact of the legislation is similar in each region. No respondents reported mass retrenchment, but job shedding is disguised by not replacing workers (especially unskilled workers) that leave the farm. A sizeable number of growers (17 per cent on the South Coast and 44 per cent on the North Coast) have reduced the working week to 27 hours (or 36 hours in the Felixton Mill Group Area) enabling them to pay wages on an hourly, rather than a weekly basis.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis discusses various complex issues associated with reactive power management and pricing {{in the context of}} new operating paradigms in deregulated power systems, proposing appropriate policy solutions. An integrated two-level framework for reactive power management is set forth, which is both suitable for a competitive market and ensures a secure and reliable operation of the associated power system. The framework is generic in nature and can be adopted for any electricity market structure. The proposed hierarchical reactive power market structure comprises two stages: procurement of reactive power resources on a seasonal basis, and real-time reactive power dispatch. The main objective of the proposed framework is to provide appropriate reactive power support from service providers at least cost, while ensuring a secure operation of the power system. The proposed procurement procedure is based on a two-step optimization model. First, the marginal benefits of reactive power supply from each provider, with respect to system security, are obtained by solving a loadability-maximization problem subject to transmission security constraints imposed by voltage and thermal limits. Second, the selected set of generators is determined by solving an optimal power flow (OPF) -based auction. This auction maximizes a societal advantage function comprising generators' offers and their corresponding marginal benefits with respect to system security, and considering all transmission system constraints. The proposed procedure yields the selected set of generators and zonal price components, which would form the basis for <b>seasonal</b> <b>contracts</b> between the system operator and the selected reactive power service providers. The main objective of the proposed reactive power dispatch model is to minimize the total payment burden on the Independent System Operator (ISO), which is associated with reactive power dispatch. The real power generation is decoupled and assumed to be fixed during the reactive power dispatch procedures; however, the effect of reactive power on real power is considered in the model by calculating the required reduction in real power output of a generator due to an increase in its reactive power supply. In this case, real power generation is allowed to be rescheduled, within given limits, from the already dispatched levels obtained from the energy market clearing process. The proposed dispatch model achieves the main objective of an ISO in a competitive electricity market, which is to provide the required reactive power support from generators at least cost while ensuring a secure operation of the power system. The proposed reactive power procurement and dispatch models capture both the technical and economic aspects of power system operation in competitive electricity markets; however, from an optimization point of view, these models represent non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problems due to the presence of binary variables associated with the different regions of reactive power operation in a synchronous generator. Such MINLP optimization problems are difficult to solve, especially for an actual power system. A novel Generator Reactive Power Classification (GRPC) algorithm is proposed in this thesis to address this issue, with the advantage of iteratively solving the optimization models as a series of non-linear programming (NLP) sub-problems. The proposed reactive power procurement and dispatch models are implemented and tested on the CIGRE 32 -bus system, with several case studies that represent different practical operating scenarios. The developed models are also compared with other approaches for reactive power provision, and the results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model. The results clearly reveal the main features of the proposed models for optimal provision of reactive power ancillary service, in order to suit the requirements of an ISO under today’s stressed system conditions in a competitive market environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{constitutes}} {{the findings of}} a two-month long research into the working conditions of female workers in the food processing industry with particular reference to canneries in Zimbabwe. The objective {{of the study was to}} analyse both the working conditions and the specific problems experienced by female workers and the character of the canning industry itself. Most of the problems and issues examined in previous ILO-sponsored studies on the food-processing industries had tended to be treated in a general and global manner. This Zimbabwean casestudy had therefore a specific focus which yielded extremely useful insights into the structure of the canning industry and into female working conditions and problems in particular. The significance of the food-processing industry to the national economy is obvious. The linkages between manufacturing industry and agriculture are clearly indispensable. The significance of the industry assumes an international character in its demonstrated capacity to produce for external markets. In spite of the diversity which characterizes the Zimbabwean economy, food-processing accounts roughly for about a quarter of the value of the total output of the manufacturing industry. Canning emerges as a crucial sub-secotr of food processing: fruit, vegetables, fish and meat products are the major commodities that are processed for both domestic and export consumption. Although it was obvious that canning was not the major employer of wage-labour in food-processing, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the observation that it was the major employer of casual, <b>seasonal</b> and <b>contract</b> female labour in the industry. To that extent, the particular concern and focus on the problems and conditions experienced by female workers was both warranted and revealing.,Ministry of Labour, Manpower Planning and Social Welfar...|$|R
40|$|Trade unions {{throughout}} the advanced capitalist societies face significant {{challenges in the}} current period. One central challenge {{is associated with the}} persistence and growth of temporary work, ie the varied forms of non-permanent waged work such as fixed-term <b>contracts,</b> <b>seasonal</b> employment, casual employment, employment with temporary agencies and certain types of government employment and training schemes. In responding to this challenge, trade unions operate on at least two fronts – design and implementation of regulatory initiatives and effective representation of temporary workers. Regulatory initiatives can be pursued at different levels and usually involve change to one or another of three main mechanisms- restrictions on temporary employment, the level of rights and benefits, and the level of compensation for perceived disadvantages. Both regulation and representation pose dilemmas, including dilemmas of co-ordination with trade union efforts to defend the interests of employee in a continuing (‘permanent’) contract of employment. This paper briefly reviews union initiatives in varied countries. However, it focuses in particular on Australian trade unions and casual employment. Australian trade unions face a particularly severe challenge in this area, because casual employment constitutes – at least potentially – a highly degraded form of temporary employment and because it already constitutes such a large and rapidly growing proportion of the workforce. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{agri-food}} sector {{in developing countries}} has been transforming rapidly during the last decades, leading to a more consolidated and vertically integrated agro-industry. Labour market effects are especially pronounced in high-value export sectors. Whether this transformation in the {{agri-food sector}} and the associated employment creation benefits rural households in developing countries remains a highly debated issue. While some argue that {{the economic impact of}} employment is limited due to inferior working conditions, others demonstrate that employment in high-value export sectors can lead to upwards income mobility and poverty reduction but empirical evidence is very scarce. This dissertation aims to fill this research gap by unravelling the links between global food value chains, employment creation and rural development. I focus on the Saint-Louis region in Senegal, a rural area where investments from horticultural export companies have created many off-farm employment opportunities since 2000 s, especially for women. In chapter two I investigate the impact of wage employment on households’ income. I differentiate between employment in the horticultural export industry and employment in other sectors. I use household survey data from two panel rounds in 2006 and 2013 and apply quantile regressions to address unobserved heterogeneity and estimate heterogeneous effects. I demonstrate that employment in the horticultural export sector increases income per capita of the 50 % poorest households with 31 to 57 %, while employment in other sectors increases income per capita of both poor and non-poor households with 82 %. Although employment in other sectors is more remunerative, employment in the horticultural sector is more inclusive, as it employs both poor and non-poor households. In chapter three I analyse the impact of women’s participation in the labour market on fertility rates. Using household- and individual-level survey data I show that employed women have a significantly higher age at marriage and at first childbirth, and significantly fewer children. As causal identification strategy I use instrumental variable and difference-in-differences estimations, combined with propensity score matching. I find that female employment reduces the number of children per woman by 25 %, and that this fertility-reducing effect is as large for poor as for non-poor women and larger for illiterate than for literate women. Results imply that female employment is a strong instrument for empowering rural women, reducing fertility rates and accelerating the demographic transition in poor countries. In chapter four I investigate the impact of female wage employment on women’s subjective wellbeing. I use household- and individual-level survey data and an instrumental variable approach. I find that female employment improves subjective wellbeing for the poorest women but not necessarily for women whose household income has moved well beyond the poverty threshold. Female employment improves women´s happiness through an income effect, as female employment leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects of female employment reduce women’s happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload, low job satisfaction and changing gender roles. In chapter five I analyze contractual preferences of female workers in the horticultural export sector. I use a discrete choice experiment to assess women’s preferences for a labour contract and employ a latent class model to capture preference heterogeneity. I find that women have a high willingness to accept a labour contract in the horticultural export industry and that differences in preferences for contract attributes can be explained by women’s empowerment status. More empowered women prefer flexible, <b>seasonal</b> <b>contracts</b> that include job tasks in the conditioning centres and that provide pick-up service. Less empowered women prefer labour contracts that offer company services, especially health care and training, {{and to a lesser extent}} pick-up service. Overall, this dissertation shows that development of global food value chains can benefit rural households in developing countries through employment creation. Policy implications entail that investments from the horticultural export industry can contribute to a pro-poor economic growth. However, to ensure long-term welfare benefits of employment, working conditions should improve by increasing wages and employment duration. Specific policies on women’s empowerment should take the increase in female wage employment opportunities into account, e. g. through family planning programs that target employed women who have low-fertility preferences. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{many of his}} peers, Dillon {{moved to}} Kingston {{towards the end of}} his teen years in search of work, staying first in a tiny shack in the west Kingston slum of Back-O-Wall. He {{travelled}} to Fellsmere, Florida in 1963 on a <b>seasonal</b> farm work <b>contract,</b> and after returning to Kingston in 1964, he settled in Trench Town, lodging at the home of the aunt of popular sound system deejay King Sporty, who he knew from his days in Port Antonio. In Trench Town, Dillon met Peter Tosh, who introduced him to Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston, his fellow vocalists in the Wailers. An audition was swiftly arranged at Studio One, where the Wailers were recording some of the biggest hits of the day, which led to Dillon voicing his first material. Three songs were backed by the Wailers, including a sound system favourite called [...] "Ice Water", based on lyrics of double entendre, while [...] "Suffering On The Land" [...] and [...] "Beggars Have No Choice" [...] were more concerned with the harshness of life in the ghetto; a fourth song, [...] "Woman, Wine And Money", featured Delroy Wilson on harmony. All of the songs were issued on 7 in 45 RPM singles, credited to Jack Sparrow. Shortly after the release of these singles, through the efforts of the Ethiopian Reorganization Centre in Waterhouse (established by elders Nasser King and Daddy King), Dillon entered the Rastafari faith, which he remained committed to thereafter.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRespiratory viral infections (RVI) are {{important}} in hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) and knowledge regarding incidence, morbidity, mortality, and long-term pulmonary complications is limited. We report a study to evaluate incidence and outcomes, both short and long-term, of RVI in children receiving HSCT. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 844 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the Hospital for Sick Children: 491 were allogeneic and 353 were autologous. When screening for causes {{of death in the}} first year after HSCT in the 844 patients, we found that RVI as a cause of death was only evident in the first 100  days after HSCT. Fifty-four (6. 5 %) patients were found to have an RVI within the first 100  days after HSCT (allogeneic =  32, autologous =  22). Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were documented in 31 (57 %) and 23 (43 %) patients, respectively. Viruses were parainfluenza (35 %), respiratory syncytial virus (28 %), influenza (22 %), adenovirus (7 %), human metapneumovirus (4 %), coronavirus (2 %), and rhinovirus (2 %). Three patients relapsed with their primary disease before day 100 and were excluded. The overall mortality for the remaining 51 patients was 10 % (allogeneic =  4, autologous =  1). All 5 deaths were directly attributable to RVI and all 5 deaths occurred in patients with a lower respiratory tract infection. The remaining patients were followed for a median of 4. 3  years (range, 1. 4 to 11. 8) and no chronic pulmonary complications were observed. A clear <b>seasonal</b> pattern for <b>contracting</b> RVI was evident with 65 % of total RVI occurring between October and March (35 of 427 versus 19 of 417, P =. 03). Given the significant mortality from RVI and the challenges in preventing them, choosing the time to start HSCT, whenever possible, may help prevent RVI and improve outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Persons with {{disability}} (PWDs) {{are among}} the vulnerable groups {{in the country that}} need utmost attention from the government. This is perhaps the reason why the institutional and legal environment has been made favorable to this particular group, especially in the area of employment. However, earlier reports note that the quality of employment of PWDs still needs improvement. This paper examines the employment profile of PWDs in the Philippines using the 2008 and 2010 disability surveys in selected cities of Metro Manila (urban) and Rosario, Batangas (rural), respectively. Key findings of this paper are as follows: (1) Proportion of employed among PWD respondents in the urban area is relatively higher than that in the rural area; (2) Roughly half of working PWDs are underemployed; (3) Employed PWDs in the urban area are dominated by the visually-impaired while the hearing-impaired has the highest proportion of employed in the rural area; (4) The leading occupation among PWDs in the urban area is masseur while farmer/farm worker/livestock and poultry raiser in the rural area, although many respondents in both areas are also engaged in entrepreneurial activities (e. g., managing a sari-sari store, e-load business, among others) and are working as helpers/utility workers or laborers; (5) The majority of employed respondents in both areas are considered as vulnerable workers - self-employed and unpaid family workers; (6) Some PWDs who are wage/salary workers are considered as informally employed as they are working as temporary workers without formal <b>contract,</b> <b>seasonal</b> workers, or hired on a daily basis; (7) Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) suggests that being a member in a Disabled People's Organization and being at least high school graduate strongly correlate with being employed; and (8) MCA also revealed that PWDs who are at least college graduates are more closely related to being officers/managers/supervisors, professionals, and technicians/associate professionals while those who are at most elementary graduates tend to be laborers/unskilled and agricultural workers...|$|R
