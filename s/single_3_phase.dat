5000|$|In 2000, {{officials}} and transport planners in Greater Manchester {{decided that the}} top public transport priority was a third phase of Metrolink expansion, which would create four new lines along key transport corridors in Greater Manchester: the Oldham and Rochdale Line (routed northeast to Oldham and Rochdale), the East Manchester Line (routed east to East Manchester and Ashton-under-Lyne), the South Manchester Line (routed southeast to Chorlton-cum-Hardy and East Didsbury), and the Airport Line (routed south to Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport). GMPTE and the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) lobbied central government to provide partial funding to upgrade the current network with a new depot, passenger information displays, and construct four new lines in a <b>single</b> <b>Phase</b> <b>3</b> contract (dubbed the [...] "Big Bang") worth £489,000,000 (£ as of [...] ).Estimated costs were later revised in 2002 to £820,000,000 (£ as of [...] ), meaning Metrolink required a Government contribution of at least £520,000,000. With costs predicted to rise further, on 20 July 2004, Alistair Darling (the Secretary of State for Transport) announced the Government had withdrawn its share of funding Metrolink due to excessive costs.|$|R

Si substrates {{were used for the}} optimization of the deposition process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that polycrystalline <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> YMnO <b>3</b> films can be obtained for an optimal ratio of Y and Mn on the injected solution and either amorphous, metastable orthorhombic, and/or hexagonal YMnO <b>3</b> <b>phases</b> can be obtained depending on the deposition temperature and precursors ratio. In a second stage, YMnO 3 films were grown on SrTiO 3 substrates. Pure epitaxial orthorhombic YMnO <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> was confirmed by XRD. The films microstructure, characterized by scanning electron microscopy and TEM, shows a columnar growth. Each columnar grain grows epitaxially with three possible orientations...|$|R
