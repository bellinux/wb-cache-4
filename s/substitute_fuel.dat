40|$|In {{the course}} of the project, it was found that it was {{possible}} to separate <b>substitute</b> <b>fuels</b> of high calorific value from waste plastics and to use them for the cement production process. The substances involved are residual fractions which cannot be used as materials. The project was carried out in cooperation with Readymix Zementwerke GmbH and Co. Beckum, the aim being to investigate the use of waste plastics for energy recovery and to save landfill space. Separation is carried out by screening, air separation, magnetic separator and whirlwind separator. Where possible, the fractions were analyzed in accordance with DIN. Separating out <b>substitute</b> <b>fuels</b> for the cement productions process was proved to be possible. The results of the analysis show that it is possible to produce <b>substitute</b> <b>fuels</b> for other energy recovery applications. (orig.)

40|$|Small {{hydropower}} <b>substituting</b> <b>fuel</b> (SHSF) is {{an ecological}} environment protection program to improve regional ecosystems and alleviate poverty. However, {{the sustainability of}} SHSF programs remains controversial due to lingering doubts about its potential for socioeconomic development and its environmental impacts. The sustainability of SHSF was examined based on field investigations and household questionnaire surveys. The results were as follows: (1) Biomass of SHSF protected mass on pine (Pinus massoniana) and weeping cypress (Platycladus orientalis) plantations were 11. 06 t·ha− 1 and 7. 15 t·ha− 1 higher than unprotected plantations, respectively. Furthermore, the differences in ecosystem biomass were mainly derived from arbor biomass. While the energy conversion efficiency based on field investigations was merely 1. 28 kg (kWh) − 1, which was only 64 % of the empirical value and 54 % of the guideline for accounting for the ecological benefit of small hydropower <b>substituting</b> <b>fuel.</b> (2) Households’ total income in SHSF villages was higher than in households with access to a hydropower plant but no <b>substituting</b> <b>fuel</b> or households with no hydropower plant. (3) Most of the households had a positive attitude towards SHSF because of its cheaper electricity and associated ecological environmental improvements. Overall, our results suggest optimistic and sustainable prospects for the SHSF program; however, continued education and policy communications are needed to sustain program success...|$|R

50|$|The series {{takes place}} on the planet Karbon/Krud, though the UK dub does include {{references}} to locations on Earth. Episode 6; Planet Karbon /The Black Planet reveals that Karbon/Krud was originally a dark, colourless rock inhabited by a single race of insects; the Yuks/Kruds. The Yuks/Kruds survived the planet's hostile environment by burrowing deep into it for coal. At one point, a Prism shaped meteor hit the planet and nourished the site on which it landed with colour and energy, resulting in a flower filled paradise. A few of the Yuks/Kruds colonised the area and evolved colours of their own, renaming themselves Joyces/Verigreens. They venerated the Prism and built a high altar upon it. The Yuks/Kruds who chose to stick to their original lives continued mining for coal till they gradually exhausted their supplies. The animosity between the two insect civilizations began when a violent Yuk/Krud known as King Bakrako/Katheter the First {{came up with the}} solution of using the Joyce's/Verigreen's flower stalks as <b>substitute</b> <b>fuel</b> sources.

30|$|Biodiesel {{has become}} very crucial owing to higher demand on {{existing}} petroleum reserves and lower hazardous emissions as compared to petroleum diesel-fuelled engines [4]. Biodiesel prepared from low-cost non-edible oils, restaurant waste and animal fats can provide <b>substitute</b> <b>fuel</b> that is technically and environmentally acceptable and economically competitive [5]. Although biodiesel-fuelled engines are less polluting than petro-diesel, biodiesel readily undergoes oxidation. The oxidation leads to increased acidity and formation of insoluble gums and sediments that can plug fuel filters [6]. Biodiesel prepared from many feedstocks is generally more prone to oxidation than petro-diesel unless modified or treated with antioxidants. Biodiesel dealers are therefore concerned that it may form sediment during storage while equipment operators fear that sediment and gum may form during use and cause engine damage [7].|$|E
