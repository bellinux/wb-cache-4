5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials. In most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of a}} rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on <b>spools</b> or coils.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} is used {{to create}} many things such as wire <b>spools,</b> packaging, bottle caps, automotive parts and components, gameboys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. Injection moulding {{is the most common}} modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.|$|E
5|$|The {{exemplar of}} Puuc-style {{architecture}} is Uxmal. The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and <b>spools,</b> possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|E
40|$|A <b>spool</b> valve as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the <b>spool</b> valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the <b>spool.</b> The motion of the <b>spool</b> is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the <b>spool,</b> and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion of the <b>spool</b> valve. As the first step, dynamic characteristics of a <b>spool</b> valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|R

5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel <b>spools</b> with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

50|$|In HASP II V3, NIH {{created the}} shared <b>spool</b> {{capability}} for HASP {{that was used}} by many mainframe sites. It allowed each HASP system to share a common <b>spool</b> and checkpoint. This enabled workload balancing in a multi-mainframe environment. In HASP II V4, Mellon Bank - Don Greb & Dave Miko moved shared <b>spool</b> to this version and carried it forward into JES2 multi-access <b>spool</b> (IBM's formal support of HASP in MVS). Over 350 copies of the HASP II V4 shared <b>spool</b> mods were distributed around the world.

25|$|Compact Cassettes contain two {{miniature}} <b>spools,</b> between {{which the}} magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These <b>spools</b> and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell. Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks {{are available on}} the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette, or by the machine automatically changing the direction of tape movement ("auto-reverse") when it detects that the tape has come to an end.|$|E

25|$|The {{spinning}} jenny, a multi-spool {{spinning wheel}} invented c. 1764 by James Hargreaves, dramatically reduced {{the amount of}} work needed to produce yarn of high consistency, with a single worker able to work eight or more <b>spools</b> at once. At roughly the same time, Richard Arkwright and a team of craftsmen developed the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny. Too large to be operated by hand, a spinning frame powered by a waterwheel became the water frame.|$|E
