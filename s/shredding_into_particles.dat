5000|$|Distributing {{very long}} {{one-time}} pad keys is inconvenient and usually poses a significant security risk. The pad {{is essentially the}} encryption key, but unlike keys for modern ciphers, it must be extremely long and is much too difficult for humans to remember. Storage media such as thumb drives, DVD-Rs or personal digital audio players {{can be used to}} carry a very large one-time-pad from place to place in a non-suspicious way, but even so the need to transport the pad physically is a burden compared to the key negotiation protocols of a modern public-key cryptosystem, and such media cannot reliably be erased securely by any means short of physical destruction (e.g., incineration). A 4.7 GB DVD-R full of one-time-pad data, if <b>shredded</b> <b>into</b> <b>particles</b> 1 mm² in size, leaves over 4 megabits of (admittedly hard to recover, but not impossibly so) data on each particle. [...] In addition, the risk of compromise during transit (for example, a pickpocket swiping, copying and replacing the pad) is likely to be much greater in practice than the likelihood of compromise for a cipher such as AES. Finally, the effort needed to manage one-time pad key material scales very badly for large networks of communicants—the number of pads required goes up as the square of the number of users freely exchanging messages. For communication between only two persons, or a star network topology, this is less of a problem.|$|R
40|$|Supercapacitors {{are widely}} used in {{electric}} and hybrid vehicles, wind farm and low-power equipment due to their high specific power density and huge number of charge–discharge cycles. Waste supercapacitors should be recycled according to EU directive 2002 / 96 /EC on waste electric and electronic equipment. This paper describes a recycling approach for end-of-life supercapacitors based on shredding and mild thermal treatment. At first, supercapacitors are shredded using a Retsch cutting mill. The shredded mixture is then undergone thermal treatment at 200 °C to recycle the organic solvent contained in the activated carbon electrodes. After the thermal treatment, the mixture is roughly separated using a fluidized bed method to remove the aluminium foil particles and paper particles from the activated carbon particles, which is subsequently put into water for a wet <b>shredding</b> <b>into</b> fine <b>particles</b> that can be re-used. The recycled activated carbon has a BET surface area of up to 1200 m 2 /g and the recycled acetonitrile has a high purity...|$|R

50|$|A {{scrap metal}} {{shredder}} {{is often used}} to recycle items containing a variety of other materials in combination with steel. Examples are automobiles and white goods such as refrigerators, stoves, clothes washers etc. These items are labor intensive to manually sort things like plastic, copper, aluminum and brass. By <b>shredding</b> <b>into</b> relatively small pieces, the steel can easily be separated out magnetically. The non-ferrous waste stream requires other techniques to sort.|$|R
50|$|Dokha, is {{a tobacco}} {{originally}} grown in UAE, Iran, and other gulf states. Traditional dokha is 100% additive free tobacco. Dokha is Arabic for dizzy, {{which refers to}} the extremely high nicotine content of dokha. Dokha is not cured like many other commercial tobacco products and is minimally processed. The green leaves are dried and <b>shredded</b> <b>into</b> small flakes which are smoked through a pipe called a medwakh.|$|R
50|$|This fescue is a {{clumping}} perennial bunchgrass with stems generally {{one half}} to one meter in height. The leaves are narrow and often have rolled edges, {{are surrounded by}} sheaths that <b>shred</b> <b>into</b> fibers, and may be tough and spikelike on {{the lower part of}} the plant. The erect inflorescence has a few branches each holding flat green spikelets. This is an important forage grass for livestock in some areas.|$|R
5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are <b>shredded</b> <b>into</b> small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves <b>into</b> small <b>particles,</b> resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|R
40|$|The {{amounts of}} wheat or hybrid sudan hay wasted with three large round bale feeding methods were {{evaluated}} at two ranch locations. The feeding methods were: 1) bale processor (Hay Forage Industries BP 25 ®) used to <b>shred</b> forage <b>into</b> bunks; 2) the same processor used to shred forage onto the ground; and 3) unrolling large round bales on the ground. Estimated forage wastages or refusals from unrolling, shredding onto ground, and <b>shredding</b> <b>into</b> bunks were 23, 13, and 8 % with wheat hay and 22, 16, and 11 % with sudan hay, respectively. These results demonstrate {{the potential for}} substantial savings of forage. Shredding or tub-grinding large round bales and feeding in bunks appears to have economic potential when hay prices are high and when herd size is large...|$|R

2500|$|Leaded {{glass from}} CRTs is reused in car batteries, ammunition, and lead wheel weights, or sold to {{foundries}} as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore. Copper, gold, palladium, silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling. Hazardous smoke and gases are captured, contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat. These methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials. Hewlett-Packard product recycling solutions manager Renee St. Denis describes its process as: [...] "We move them through giant shredders about 30 {{feet tall and}} it <b>shreds</b> everything <b>into</b> pieces {{about the size of}} a quarter. Once your disk drive is <b>shredded</b> <b>into</b> pieces about this big, it's hard to get the data off". An ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased cost-effective processing of bulk electronic waste. Reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device. Devices still need eventual recycling, but by allowing others to purchase used electronics, recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use.|$|R
