50|$|During {{this era}} {{the end of}} extensional {{tectonics}} had been well constrained in the Southern North Sea basin, the extension occurred from the late Carboniferous to the Triassic. There had been some reactivation of Varsican basement faults due to the subsidence of the Sole Pit Basin and allowing basin tilts creating a peripheral graben system around the basin. Due to the reactivation of the basement faults {{it led to the}} beginning of halokinesis in the basin. The halokinesis allowed major uplift during the Mesozoic {{because of the presence of}} salt and the reactivation of basement faults the thrusting permitted the sediment to thrust over the diapers and float on top of the Zechstein salt. Due to the Kimmerian phase uplift in the northern portion of the north sea, it allowed subsidence and deposition to fill the basin creating sandstone. Due to differential loading along the faults, salt diapers developed and played a huge role in the Southern North Sea basin and all salt tectonic structures. Reverse faulting associated with late Carboniferous basin inversion is recorded by a wide range of Carboniferous stratigraphy <b>subcropping</b> the Permian sediments.The subcrop pattern indicates a strong influence of NW-SE tectonic trends during this inversion. This inversion event was followed by deposition of upper Carboniferous red beds, which pass up into sands of the Permian Rotliegend Group; these are overlain by evaporites of the Zechstein Supergroup. A major phase of basin inversion during, or at the end of, the Late Cretaceous affected many basins in NW Europe, including the Sole Pit Basin and the Cleveland Basin and has been attributed to both strike-slip reactivation of basement faults.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Jurassic and Triassic {{reservoirs}} in the Central North Sea {{are highly}} overpressured (> 40 MPa above hydrostatic pressure). Simulation of {{the interplay between}} rapid Tertiary subsidence, seal permeability and fluid flow allows insight into the geological controls on the distribution and magnitude ofthe overpressure. One-dimensional models demonstrate that, unlike other basins, the overpressure d veloped in the Graben is not determined by the thickness and permeability ofthe shale pressure seal. A two-dimensional model simulating lateral flow beneath the pressure seal provides an accurate simulation of the overpressure distribution. Disequilibrium compaction of shale-dominated off-structure regions forms the principal overpressuring mechanism. Lateral flow in the permeable Fuhnar sandstones leads to high overpressure and focused vertical escape on an axial high, where the seal is thinner above a <b>subcropping</b> Fulmar Fm. A layered hydrogeological regime is suggested, with shallow Tertiary pressure cells separated from deep Cretaceous-Triassic pressure cells by normally pressured, permeable Palaeocene sandstones.

The irregular fault trace {{and the presence of}} a supposed klippe at Court-St. -Etienne are both ascribed to the very gentle fault dip. However, a review of outcrop, borehole and geophysical data shows that there are no convincing arguments for such a gently N-dipping thrust. An alternative model is proposed in which the Orne-Noirmont-Baudecet fault is considered a pre-cleavage and pre-folding low-angle extensional detachment, similar to the Asquempont fault sensu Debacker in the Senne-Sennette area. The irregular <b>subcrop</b> trace of the Orne-Noirmont-Baudecet fault is attributed to the strongly variable fold orientations, associated with a transition zone between steeply plunging and gently plunging folds, similar to what has recently been described in the Senne-Sennette area.

40|$|Abstract: A {{total of}} ten marine, {{petroleum}} source rocks {{ranging in age}} from Middle Devonian to Late Cretaceous exist within the Western Canada Basin. Principal hydro-carbon reserves occur in the Lower Cretaceous Mannville Group and <b>subcropping</b> Paleozoic arbonates, where 270 • 109 m 3 (1. 7 trillion barrels) of heavy oil form one of the largest deposits of oil on Earth.

40|$|The Eldorado palcosurface {{marks the}} last major period of erosion in the Witwatersrand {{succession}} in the Welkom gold field. Fluvial and debris flow sediments on this surface contain placer concentrates that were ultimately derived by the repeated erosion of sub-cropping placers, which occur within a sequence of onlapping formations, separated by unconformities, near the southern margin of the basin. Autoradiographs ofcore recovered by drilling through the Eldorado palcosurface indicate that uranium mineralization is asso-ciated with detrital pyrite and gold accumulations. This mineralization occurs as fluvial bed-load concentrates that were deposited in shallow palcochannels and with conglomer-atic diamictites. Comparison of heavy mineral assemblages in crushed concentrates of the <b>subcropping</b> placers {{with those in the}} placer alluvium on the Eldorado pediment indicates that the suite of heavy minerals is the same; all three varieties of pyrite show detrital rounding, including secondary pyrite which originally formed in situ in the older placers; kerogen particles appear to be rounded allogenic grains of broken columnar kerogen de-rived from erosion of older placers; uraninite is very sparse and inclusions found in the rounded kerogen grains have been largely altered to brannerite; the dominant uranium-bearing minerals are uraniferous leucoxene and brannerite; and various tages of alteration from uraninite to brannerite are evident. The rarity of uraninite indicates that most of the grains of that mineral were altered during reworking and prolonged exposure in a slightly oxidizing atmosphere...|$|E

Explorers are not confident in the current understanding of where, when, and how geochemical anomalies form (or don’t form) in the cover and how to make the critical interpretive link to buried mineral deposits. Understanding how elements move through transported cover and their link to buried mineralization is increasingly important for exploration success in many regions of the world. At the Kintyre U deposits, groundwater, regolith, soil, Triodia basedowii (spinifex), Acacia ancistrocarpa foliage and litter, and termite (Nasutitermes triodiae) mound materials were sampled and analysed to test if near surface methods can detect mineralization through 3 ̆c 1 to 80 m of cover.

In Fig.  21 b, the behaviour is quite different as the variation of porosity is linear and very small for small incremental growth.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The Pleistocene Carpinteria basin is an east-trending northward-verging, faulted {{syncline}} containing up to 1220 m of partially intertonguing Santa Barbara and Casitas Formations {{deposited on}} previously folded pre- Pleistocene strata {{with up to}} 80 ° discordance. Structures <b>subcropping</b> against the unconformity indicate most of the deformation in the Santa Ynez Range prior to deposition of the Santa Barbara Formation approximately one Ma ago was by folding. During that time, the Carpinteria area was the northern margin of the offshore Ventura basin; subsequent uplift north of the Red Mountain fault (RMF) isolated the Carpinteria basin during middle to late Pleistocene time. Quaternary faults {{in the area are}} either south-dipping reverse faults related to bedding-slip in pre- Pleistocene strata or north-dipping reverse faults that truncate bedding and are seismically active. The Rincon Creek fault (RCF) dips 35 °- 60 ° south steepening to near-vertical at depth, where it apparently passes into bedding within the upper Sespe Formation. It offsets late Pleistocene marine terraces and is itself deformed by the RMF.

Vertical separation decreases westward from 4500 m north of the Rincon field to 350 m at Rincon Point. The main branch of the RMF offsets a 45, 000 yr marine terrace, but not a 4, 500 yr terrace. The Summerland Offshore oil field occurs within a disharmonically folded anticline in which incompetent, severely deformed Miocene mudstone overlies competent, broadly folded Oligocene sandstone.

The two drill sites are located were reflections are <b>subcropping</b> below the late Neogene and Quaternary overburden, and in two different sub-basins within the Hornsund fault complex. Borehole 7418 / 01 -U- 01 was drilled at a water depth of 181. 5 m. Total depth from seabed was 126. 15 m and 113. 3 m of cores were cut. Borehole 7515 / 12 -U- 01 was drilled at a water depth of 156 m. Total depth from seabed was 200 m and 87. 8 m of cores were cut. Borehole 7418 / 01 -U- 01 penetrates Late Paleocene to Early Eocene strata, while borehole 7517 / 12 -U- 01 penetrates Late Paleocene strata. The cores show a diverse set of sedimentary features, ranging from primary depositional structures to detrimental bioturbation. The cores are dated to Paleogene age and show a variety of sedimentary features such as ample bioturbation, ripples and various cross stratifications. The lithology varies from mud to several sandy intervals and thinner beds of conglomerate. The findings indicate a deep marine setting for core 7418 / 01 -U- 01 and a shallow marine setting for 7517 / 12 -U- 01.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether or not it is possible to trace the signature of alteration haloes surrounding deep-seated unconformity-type U mineralization through thick Quaternary tills is one of great importance for those conducting exploration in glaciated areas. The geochemical signals associated with alteration are often subtle and subject to numerous sources of noise, and multi-till stratigraphies can completely mask or truncate dispersal patterns. To study glacial dispersal from alteration zones surrounding unconformity-type uranium mineralization, this study focuses on a deep-seated (> 100 m) basement-hosted unconformitytype U mineralized body known as Tatiggaq, which is located in the Thelon Basin of Nunavut. The Tatiggaq area presents an ideal opportunity to investigate this problem, since the area is blanketed by a thick (12 - 34 m) multi-till stratigraphy, mineralization does not intersect the bedrock-till interface, and the mineralization is surrounded by an extensive illitic alteration halo that reaches the bedrock surface. The recovery of till samples from diamond drill core from the multi-till stratigraphy overlying the <b>subcropping</b> alteration halo provides a unique opportunity to model glacial dispersal and identify whether the fingerprint of buried alteration can be traced through three dimensions to the modern day surface. Sampling of till recovered during diamond drilling was combined with the sampling of surficial mudboils in the area surrounding Tatiggaq to trace the dispersal of alteration. The drill core samples were collected from four stratigraphic units that were deposited by early southwesterly and southerly ice flows, followed by a reversal in ice flow towards the northwest and westnorthwest. Knowledge of the till stratigraphy directly above the Tatiggaq alteration zone was used to construct a three dimensional model of the sediments overlying bedrock to allow the tracing of alteration through the subsurface. The geochemical fingerprint of the alteration halo at Tatiggaq was identified by applying univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis, to geochemical data from altered and fresh rocks in the region. This analysis identified the enrichment of Fe 2 O 3, K 2 O, Al 2 O 3, P 2 O 5, TiO 2, B, Ni, U, Cr, and Sc, and depletion of CaO, MnO, Na 2 O, Mo, Zn, Ba, and Sr in the altered rocks using total digestion of rock powders (HF-HClO 4 -HNO 3). Partial digestion of the same rock powders using HNO 3 -HCl identified the enrichment of U and depletion of V, Zn, Y, and Yb in the altered rocks. The observed trends in the bedrock data were then applied to the till geochemistry data to identify alteration signatures that were discernible across the till stratigraphy. These enrichment and depletion trends were used to generate four alteration indices (AI) for use in uranium exploration: - 1 = (2 + 23) / [(2 +) + (2 + 23) ] () - 2 = (+ +) / [(+) +(+ +) ] () - 3 = / (+) () - 4 = / (+) () A 3 D model of the till sequence was constructed with GOCAD® and populated with interpolated values for the four alteration indices in order to trace alteration through the subsurface. Analysis of these trends revealed that alteration near the bedrock surface is pronounced, but rapidly attenuates moving up the stratigraphic sequence. Despite the rapid attenuation of the alteration signal in the subsurface, the signal is detectable at the surface down-ice from the main alteration zone with AI 1 and AI 2, and above the alteration zone with AI 3. Although AI 4 was successful at delineating alteration in the subsurface, no patterns were observed in the surficial mudboil data using AI 4. This study shows that despite a complex Quaternary stratigraphy and ice-flow history in a region, it is possible to trace glacial dispersal of subtle geochemical signatures related to <b>subcropping</b> alteration zones surrounding buried basement-hosted unconformity-type uranium deposits. However, the detection of such alteration signals requires a detailed knowledge of the alteration signal being sought out and an understanding of the depositional history and stratigraphy of Quaternary sediments. Continuing research into alteration systems surrounding basement hosted unconformity-type uranium deposits will help determine the applicability of the ratios developed here to other regions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The gold {{mineralization}} event within Archaean granite-greenstone terranes {{occurred during the}} late Archaean, and followed the intrusion of syn- to late-tectonic granitic plutons into previously deformed greenstone belts. An Archaean granite/gneiss-hosted gold deposit, {{in terms of this}} project, is classified as having a gold-assay cutoff of 1 g/metric ton over widths of at least several metres, or higher grades over narrower widths and/or verbal descriptions that indicate such values. Fluid inclusion studies and isotopic data identify two possible origins for the auriferous fluids; namely magmatic and metamorphic. The exploration target according to the magmatic model, is a late-Archaean, hydrothermally altered, mineralized and fractured granitic intrusion preferably with a granodioritic or quartz-dioritic composition. The exploration target according to the metamorphic replacement model is a granitic stock that has intruded a zone of crustal weakness such as a shear zone, active during the late Archaean. Alternatively, the granitic intrusion should be affected by regionally extensive late-Archaean shearing. It should be hydrothermally altered, deformed and mineralized. Five areas within the Pietersburg granite-greenstone terrane were selected for the 'Regional Area Selection' phase of exploration for Archaean granite/gneiss-hosted gold deposits; namely Roodepoort, Waterval, Ramagoep, Moletsie and Matlala. Roodepoort contains a known granodiorite-hosted gold deposit; the Knight's Pluton, and served as an orientation survey for this project. The use and interpretation of LANDSAT images formed an integral part of exploration techniques; to assess their usefulness in the exploration of Archaean granite/gneiss-hosted gold deposits. Area selection criteria for granite/gneiss-hosted {{gold mineralization}} at Roodepoort are the major ENE-trending shear zone, the NNW-trending lineament and hydrothermal alteration, shearing, quartz-stockworks and sulphide mineralization within the Knight's Pluton. The origin of the gold within the Knight's Pluton is uncertain; both magmatic and metamorphic models are possibilities. Ongoing exploration is in progress at Roodepoort. The only area selection criterion for granite/gneiss-hosted gold mineralization at Waterval is the sericitized, <b>subcropping</b> granites located within trenches. Gold mineralization is insignificant. No area selection criteria for Archaean granite/gneiss-hosted gold mineralization were located at Ramagoep, Matlala and Moletsie. No further exploration is recommended for all these areas. The MES image interpretations were successful in identifying lineaments, granitic outcrops, greenstones, vegetation and soil cover. The Clay-iron images adequately differentiated betweeen iron-rich and clay-bearing areas. However, not all clay-bearing areas were associated with hydrothermal alteratian; field checks were necessary to discriminate between weathered granites and hydrothermally altered granites. The Wallis images served to locally enhance the contrasts of the MES and Clay-iron images...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The Santa Barbara-Montecito and Goleta basins are {{structurally}} continuous fault-controlled Pleistocene basins containing up to 3000 feet (925 m) {{of marine}} Pleistocene Santa Barbara Formation which were deposited on previously deformed Sisquoc and older strata. Structures <b>subcropping</b> against the unconformity {{at the base}} of the Santa Barbara Formation show that pre-basin deformation was mainly by folding. In addition, high-angle reverse faulting occurred along the Cameros, Goleta, and Modoc faults prior to Santa Barbara deposition in the Goleta basin. These are the oldest faults in the study area. Deposition of the Santa Barbara Formation began less than 1. 2 Ma ago. Post-Santa Barbara (post-basin) deformation includes disharmonic folding of incompetent Miocene strata above broad folds in competent Oligocene strata, as displayed in the Elwood oil field and La Goleta gas field, and reverse faulting along several south-dipping faults of large displacement. The More Ranch fault, which juxtaposes Sisquoc and older strata against the Santa Barbara and "Pico"(?) Formations, displaces a 40, 000 year old marine terrace, forms a north-facing eroded fault scarp, and marks the southern edge of the Goleta basin. The fault dips more than 80 ° south and displays up to a maximum of 2000 feet (610 m) vertical separation. The fault in the area with the largest amount of vertical separation, is the Coal Oil Point fault of post-Sisquoc age. This fault fails to reach the surface even though vertical separation of the Oligocene Vaqueros Formation is as great as 5400 feet (1650 m). Comparison with other faults in the area suggests that this fault belongs to the set of south-dipping, east-trending, Quaternary reverse faults that are characteristic of the coastal basins adjacent to the central Santa Ynez Mountains. All post-basin faults disrupt late Pleistocene strata and are potentially active. Other post-basin faults include the Mesa fault, which may link the More Ranch and Rincon Creek faults, the Lavigia fault which cuts older alluvium, and the San Jose fault which forms a north-facing scarp in late-Pleistocene fanglomerate. Distribution of aftershocks and focal mechanism solutions of the 1978 Santa Barbara earthquake suggest a gently north-dipping fault plane which would be unrelated to any of the faults exposed at the surface in the study area. However, the linear pattern of aftershock epicenters is parallel to the Mesa and Mission Ridge- Arroyo Parida faults; if the alternate south-dipping nodal plane is the correct solution then the earthquake could have originated on a member of the south-dipping fault set...|$|E
40|$|It is {{commonly}} thought that unconformities may both cause reservoir deterioration by being highly cemented and therefore form low permeability zones, or they promote reservoir development by {{being associated with}} coarse-grained sediments that offer high permeability pathways for fluid flow. Unconformity surfaces {{play a significant role}} in sequence stratigraphy and correlation of parasequences. However, they are also of fundamental importance for understanding petroleum prospectivity in many sedimentary basins. They commonly promote diagenetic change and either enhance reservoir porosity in <b>subcropping</b> sedimentary layers through leaching or promote cementation to create low permeability, poorer quality reservoirs. This thesis reports the results of a systematic analysis at different scales of the Caledonian and Variscan Unconformities, the two most prominent unconformities affecting British Stratigraphy, to provide new insights for our understanding that the subcrop and supracrop of unconformities are important in controlling reservoir properties. The Base Devonian Unconformity outcropping onshore in the Siccar Point, Scotland, represents the most famous angular unconformity ("Hutton’s Unconformity") and provides an exceptionally well exposed, hitherto unrecognized, wadi channel. Application of a new technique - LiDAR laser scanner, shed new light on this world famous unconformity. By generating a three-dimensional model representing the surface, highly angular character of the unconformity and its controlling factor in the deposition and distribution of the overlying sediments could be reflected. Furthermore, evaluation of the Base Permian Unconformity (BPU) through integration of seismic, electrical well-log, outcrop and core data has afforded the opportunity to determine the effects that it has on highly prospective Carboniferous gas-reservoirs which have been sealed beneath its overlying sealing Lower Permian, Rotliegend Group, Silverpit Claystone Formation cover in the UK Southern North Sea (SNS). Conventional wisdom has polarised views and has been a part of an on-going debate with opinion divided as to whether reservoir properties are enhanced or not by the unconformity. Given the significance for exploration, appraisal and development of the prospective Carboniferous play fairway in the SNS, the research has attempted to resolve this issue through seismic interpretation of the BPU, stratigraphic assessment of supracropping horizons and the systematic sampling and analysis of all relevant field exposures and cored sections. The interpretation of high-fidelity 3 D seismic data has also permitted the identification of areas of structural inversion and the presence of a suite of WNW-ESE striking, sub-vertical Tertiary igneous dykes. The zones of structural inversion and the transecting dykes both affect the Carboniferous sediments and the BPU affecting the reservoir quality by instigating additional, overprinting diagenetic changes and the compartmentalisation of the reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|The Paleogene Shelf {{sediment}} {{are well}} developed in Garo hills, Khasi and Jiantia hills {{along the southern}} margins of Shillong Plateau in Meghalaya, parts of Mikir and North Cachar hills of Assam {{and also in the}} <b>subcrops</b> of Dhansiri and Upper Assam valleys. These sediments represent diverse depositional environments from marine, lagoonal, tidal flat to fluvio–deltaic exhibiting the effects of differential tectonic movements in basin floors,changes in shorelines, sediment source and varying degree of energy conditions of thetransporting media. As a consequence, certain problems may be encountered in erecting a unified scheme of generalized stratigraphic columns for the entire region under review. The stratigraphic study of these lithounits would obviously help to understand the diverse and subtle variations in lithofacies of the Paleogene sequence in different areas of basin position...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Three {{detailed}} biostratigraphic zonations, {{based on}} ostracods, foraminiferids and dinocysts, are {{proposed for the}} latest Triassic through to the earliest Cretaceous of the Portland-Wight Basin and its adjacent areas. A total of 112 zones-zonules (34 ostracod zones/subzones, 25 foraminiferid zones, 53 dinoflagellate zones, subzones and zonules) are recognized. All three zonation schemes are based on samples obtained from both outcrop (the Dorset coast) and boreholes, the latter from ditch cuttings, with some conventional and sidewall core samples, in association with published ata, and have where possible b en calibrated to the standard ammonite zones recognized throughout northwest Europe. The three biostratigraphic zonation schemes (ostracods, foraminiferids, dinocysts/miospores) illustrated in Fig. 1 and discussed below are based on samples obtained both at outcrop (the Dorset coast) and the <b>subcrop,</b> in associa-tion with numerous microfossil publications. All three zonations have where possible bee...|$|R
30|$|The NC Coastal Plain is {{predominantly}} a relict Plio-Pleistocene landscape, {{characterized by a}} series of progressively younger scarps, or paleoshorelines, and intervening terraces that step down in elevation and age towards the coast and towards the river incisions (see Fig. 1 in Farrell et al. 2013 and Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Abbott et al. 2011), forming a stair-step topography. Over the past 5  Ma, glacio-eustatic changes in sea level drove the transgressive–regressive cycles that sculpted this landscape. The surficial deposits that underlie the relict landscape include a complex assemblage of marine, barrier island, estuarine, fluvial, and other coastal plain deposits, which are predominantly Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene in age. Abbott et al. (2011) summarized the surficial geology and distribution of the shallow <b>subcrops</b> of the NC Coastal Plain. The features known as Carolina bays postdate the formation of the terraced topography.|$|R
40|$|International audienceKoudiat Aïcha is a Visean stratiform, volcanogenic massive {{sulphide}} (VMS) zinc-copper-lead deposit, situated {{northwest of}} Marrakech, within the Central Domain of the Jebilet massif of the Western Moroccan Meseta. The Central Domain is formed mainly of sedimentary (argillite, siltstone, sandstone, carbonate) and magmatic (gabbro and rhyodacite) rocks that host numerous massive sulphide deposits (e. g., Koudiat Aïcha, Kettara and Draa Sfar) {{in a thick}} grayish argillite sequence (rhythmic metapelite). The deposit is stratabound and consists of highly deformed, sheet-like lenses of massive sulphide located structurally on the eastern flank of a large anticline. Prior to metamorphism, the country rocks were subjected to hydrothermal alteration which is particularly pronounced {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the sulphide deposits where chloritization and sericitization are prevalent. Hydrothermal alteration extends into both the stratigraphic footwall and the stratigraphic hanging wall. The footwall lacks an obvious pipe zone (sulphide stringers or vent complex) beneath the sulphide mineralization, but is characterized by an increase in the modal proportion of Mg-chlorite and by the breakdown of feldspar and sericite. Chloritization, the most extensive and readily recognizable alteration useful in mineral exploration, is evident for more than 60 m above the <b>subcropping</b> sulphide deposits. The hanging wall rocks show a pervasive sericitization (over 30 m wide) and a weak chlorite alteration accompanied by disseminated nodules of pyrrhotite stretched parallel to the S 1 foliation. Because chlorite and sericite are metamorphic minerals that also occur in unaltered rocks surrounding the sulphide deposits, abundant Mg-rich chlorite and the absence of feldspar in the footwall are used to distinguish hydrothermal alteration facies from metamorphic facies. The chlorite geothermometer reveals temperatures between 250 and 330 °C. Higher temperatures (up to 300 °C) are associated with chlorite located in and adjacent to sulphide mineralization, whereas lower temperatures correlate with distal chlorite in both the footwall and hanging wall rocks. Chemical trends in altered footwall rocks are shown by absolute mass gains for Fe 2 O 3 total, MnO and MgO, by absolute mass losses for CaO, K 2 O and Na 2 O, and by a moderate loss in SiO 2. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of Koudiat Aïcha lithofacies (6. 2 - 12. 4 ‰ for oxygen and − 51 ‰ to − 36 ‰ for hydrogen) have also been used to determine the temperature and origin of metalliferous fluids. The couple plagioclase-amphibole of gabbros provides equilibrium temperatures between 310 and 380 °C and suggests that the heat source for the ore-forming fluid system may have been igneous. On the other hand, oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios cluster between normal values for sedimentary and magmatic rocks, suggesting a magmatic-metamorphic origin for the ore fluid...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGeological {{characterization}} in {{the current}} phase of the IEA Weyburn-Midale CO 2 Monitoring and Storage Project is focused on adding new data to the already rich dataset from phase I, and also adding new geological data to refine the final model. Adding new data to existing datasets and bringing in multiple sources of other data has proven challenging from a data management point of view. During this phase a revised static geocelluar model {{will serve as the}} heart of the data storage component of the project. It can be used by researchers in many diverse fields including: Geomechanics, hydrogeology, wellbore integrity, geophysics, reservoir simulation, geochemical modelling, and risk assessment. This model utilizes geological information from over 900 wells, covers an area of 1865  km 2 around the Weyburn field, and includes all the hydrogeological flow units from surface down to the Bakken Formation [...] The Weyburn reservoir is hosted within the Mississippian Midale Beds, one of many south-southwest-dipping strata that are progressively truncated to the northeast by the sub-Mesozoic unconformity. Well density has been increased from Phase I to better refine the zero edges of these <b>subcropping</b> Mississippian units. The model has been improved to integrate geological units not included in the Phase I model, including: 1) an “altered zone” of anhydrite and dolostone at the updip edge of the Weyburn-Midale reservoir. This forms the caprock to the reservoir subjacent to the regional seal formed by the Watrous Formation; 2) the Frobisher Evaporite, a variably thick anhydrite unit present {{at the base of the}} reservoir beneath the northern portion of the field; and 3) the Oungre Evaporite, an anhydrite/dolomite unit within the Ratcliffe beds present above the majority of the reservoir. The altered zone, Frobisher Evaporite, and Oungre Evaporite have been added to the model to improve characterization of long-term fluid behaviour in the Mississippian aquifers. Adding these units into the model, with their irregular termination edges, has been a challenge. Stacking structure maps of the Mississippian beds and then truncating them with the sub-Mesozoic unconformity created residual artifacts. These artifacts could not be correctly resolved in the resulting 3 D grid. It was necessary to closely delineate the zero edges them using false wells with zero isopach values, then stack these isopach thicknesses to proportionately fill the 3 D grid while maintaining their complex morphology. The result has been a more acceptable representation of the architecture of the Weyburn reservoir and hydrogeological flow units above and below the Midale aquifer. Porosity and permeability derived from core analyses have been added to the model for the Midale and Frobisher aquifer units only. Very little core exists beyond these beds, therefore only the Midale and Frobisher were included. Modelling has been done primarily in Petrel, however it has become necessary to use multiple mapping tools and data conversion utilities to best handle the vast quantities of information present in the Weyburn project. Issues in the projection of data in latitude/longitude, North American Datum (NAD) 27 and NAD 83 were rectified by using a standardized well data source, and a consistent methodology for converting between these coordinate systems. This presentation will give an overview of the new geocellular model for Weyburn Phase II and the methodologies for representing the flow unit architecture while highlighting the key obstacles and challenges in compiling large quantities of different types of data from multiple sources...|$|E
40|$|A new {{geological}} map, mostly <b>subcrop,</b> of the Brabant Massif is presented, {{based on}} a revised lithostratigraphy of the outcrop area and on recently acquired palaeontological and lithological data from boreholes in the concealed area. New interpretations of magnetic and gravity data are used to extend the lithostratigraphical units into areas with few or no boreholes. A structural model of the western, northern and southern parts of the Brabant Massif is presented. The main anticlinal axis plunges towards the west-northwest, its core comprising Upper Precambrian (?) to Lower Cambrian terrigenous rocks which outcrop in the southeast. To {{the north of the}} main axis, younger rocks appear in regular succession, but to the southwest this picture is complicated by the occurrence of a second anticlinal structure and by a subparallel magmatic arc. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of subsurface temperature beneath London (with {{emphasis on the}} depth interval between 60 and 100 m below ground level) has been estimated from fluid temperature logs run in boreholes and water wells during the 1980 s to the 2000 s. Although the temperature distribution in the Lea Valley–New River area may have been disturbed {{as a result of}} artificial recharge–abstraction trials and operation, one can elsewhere identify a clear trend of increasing temperature from east (&# 62; 11  °C) to SW (&# 62; 15  °C). The observed pattern is speculatively explained by: (1) the thick Tertiary sequence and low transmissivity of the Chalk in the SW resulting in a temperature at depth compatible with that expected from conduction of the prevailing geothermal flux; (2) recharge of cooler water through Chalk–Basal Sands <b>subcrop</b> and down-dip towards abstraction centres in central London potentially modifying the geothermal gradient via advective processes...|$|R
40|$|It is not {{sufficient}} to identify fine-grained soils, only, as locations for potential subgrade problems as could be done using a traditional 2 D geological map. More information is required about the geological structure, lithological variability, mineralogy, moisture content and geotechnical properties of the soil, much of which can be supplied by modern 3 D geospatial databases. These databases can be interrogated at key depths to show the wide variability of geological materials and conditions beneath the ground surface. Geological outcrop and thickness of bedrock an superficial deposits (soils), plus the permeability and water table level are predicted from the Manchester geospatial model that is based on 6500 borehole records. Geological sections along railway routes are modelled and the locations of problem soils such as alluvium, till and glaciolacustrine deposits at outcrop and shallow <b>subcrop</b> are identified. Spatial attribution of geotechnical data and simple methods to recast sections in engineering geological terms are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Carbonates of the Pekisko Formation are {{important}} reservoir rocks in west-central Alberta, especially in fields along the Pekisko <b>subcrop</b> edge. They represent a transgressive-regressive carbonate ramp sequence comprised of upward shallowing facies, which subsequently underwent extreme erosion {{leading to the}} development of karst topography. Lithofacies include grainstones, wackestones/packstones, mudstones, intraclast breccia mudstones and dolostones. Several generations of calcite cementation and dolomitization are the result of very complex diagenetic changes. Calcite cements include: isopachous, drusy mosaic, pendant/meniscus, blocky, syntaxial, fibrous and equant/prismatic. Five dolomite types have been identified: pervasive, dissolution seam-associated, planar void-filling, selective and saddle. Consequently, diagenetic alteration mainly by dolomitization has affected most of the carbonate facies. Dept. of Earth Sciences.
