5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out press packs {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E
25|$|The small <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> on the DeLorean have vinyl on one side, and {{headliner}} fabric on {{the other}} side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side {{would be on the}} bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the 98. For {{the first time}} air conditioning was an option.|$|E
40|$|A <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> {{has been}} used only {{for the purpose of}} {{interrupting}} direct sunshine. Investigation, therefore, has not been made to be on the feeling of touch of the <b>sun</b> <b>visor.</b> In this study, the feeling of touch of <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> installed in the present automobile was investigated. To clarify the relation between the sense of touch and the mechanical and physical quantity of the <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> prototype products of the <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> of the same shape were made. Surface characteristics and cold feel characteristic of materials were measured by the KES system. In addition, we investigated the relation between the surface property and the sense of touch of various materials. The correlation between favorability and WC, RC, SMD was high on the <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> prototype. As a result, it was clarified that materials whose surfaces were very smooth and soft were favorable. Those materials consist of leather and moquette. Conversely, the material sensed hard was not favorable. The relation between the mechanical and the physica...|$|R

25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|Witness James Tague {{was also}} injured by the shots when he {{received}} a superficial face wound. The Main Street south curb he had been standing 23.5 feet away from {{was struck by a}} bullet or bullet fragment that had no copper sheath, and a fragment of the concrete curb or a bullet fragment struck Tague on his right cheek. At Zapruder frame 313 Tague's head top was located 271 feet away from and 16.4 feet below President Kennedy's head top and the limousine's front windshield and its pushed nearly vertically straight-upwards <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> were in between the president and the impacted curb point. The bullet or bullet fragment that struck the concrete curb was never found.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} Australian-assembled models, New Zealand Rebels also reused the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and {{instrument}} pack for all model years. The cars were {{built at the}} AMC plant in Kenosha with right-hand drive with engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors already installed. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in New Zealand. The New Zealand models were more [...] "American" [...] than the Australian models as Australian laws required more local content for tariff concessions. For example, New Zealand models came with the U.S seats, door cards, headlining and <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> whereas the seats, door cards, headlining, and <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> on Australian models were all locally supplied. Australian Law prohibited the use of rear red turn signals, whereas these were allowed in New Zealand.|$|E

These may be permanently mounted and wired into the vehicle’s electrical system, or they may be temporarily mounted and plug into the vehicle’s cigarette lighter. [...] They are often fitted with shields which direct the light through the window, but prevent reflections in to the cab.|$|E

2500|$|Again in 1946 the Custom Cruiser 98 {{was the top}} of the Oldsmobile line. Three {{body styles}} were offered (a 4-door sedan, a 2-door Club coupe and a 2-door convertible) and all were eight {{cylinder}} powered. Technical features included electro hardened pistons, full pressure lubrication and automatic choke with fast idle mode. Standard equipment included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, dual <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> cigarette lighter and plastic radiator ornament, wraparound bumpers, Deluxe instrument cluster clock, rear armrest, and foam rubber sheet cushions.

50|$|The body {{structure}} {{was designed by}} T.K. Garrett, who had been an aeronautical engineer before joining Austin. It was of fully stressed monocoque chassis-less construction, which made it lighter and stiffer than most contemporary vehicles, the first Austin {{to be made in}} this way. Inside there were individual seats at the front and a bench at the rear covered in PVC with an option of leather facings on the seats. Evidence of economy was seen in only having a single windscreen wiper, central combined stop/tail/numberplate lamp and a <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> in front of the driver only. A passenger-side wiper and <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> and a heater were available as optional extras.|$|R
2500|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase, [...] longer than the 88. Power came from the 240 horsepower Rocket V8 shared with the Super 88. Standard equipment included armrests, bumper guards, lined trunk, rotary door latches, dual horns, cigarette lighter, turn signals, rubber floor mats, aluminum door sill plates, <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> front and rear carpeting, foam rubber seat cushions, courtesy lights, front fender medallions, deck lid '98' script, back-up light moldings, electric clock, Jetaway Hydramatic Drive, padded dash, power steering, windshield washers and Deluxe steering wheel.

2500|$|In November 2011 {{the company}} {{indicated}} that the price was being increased to US$149,000. Part of the price increase {{was due to the}} incorporation of optional features as standard, including the multi-function display, intercom and <b>sun</b> <b>visors.</b> About US$20,000 of the increase was to improve company profits on the aircraft. Russ Niles writing for AVweb noted [...] "The new price puts the Skycatcher at {{the upper end of the}} market for LSAs". The 30% price increase attracted aviation media attention. Paul Bertorelli writing for AVweb concluded [...] "Only one thing mystifies me about this decision. Cessna is the only LSA manufacturer well established with manufacturing in China. If a company with Cessna's economy of scale and marketing acumen can't make an LSA more affordable by building it in China, the notion of low-cost aircraft may very well be the myth that many people think it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 American ECD {{included}} the same upgrades {{as the rest}} of the American line. These were longer <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> a 160km/h speedometer, new dome light lens, and a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio on the 258 six. Rear defroster was added to the options list while the tinted windshield became factory issue. The luxury seat patterns and wheel covers were redesigned. An electric analog clock appeared to the right of the speedometer, although several models kept the vacuum gauge. A new model for the year was the a two-door American ECD. This model was a limited edition luxury American two-door sedan, comparable to the Rambler American Hardtop of the 1960s. The equipment was the same as the four-door American ECD with some differences. The engine on this model was the 200 gross hp [...] six cylinder with a Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, 7.7:1 compression ratio, 266 degree camshaft, and electronic ignition. The automatic transmission was a floor-mounted shift design, a first in a VAM Hornet-based American. The front seats were upgraded to high-back individual non-reclining units instead of the four-door bench.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Warren Commission, {{a second}} shot that struck the President was {{recorded}} at Zapruder film frame 313. The Commission made no conclusion {{as to whether}} {{this was the second}} or third bullet fired. The presidential limousine then passed in front of the John Neely Bryan north pergola concrete structure. The two investigative committees concluded that the second shot to hit the president entered the rear of his head (the House Select Committee placed the entry wound four inches higher than the Warren Commission placed it) and passed in fragments through his skull; this created a large, [...] "roughly ovular" [...] hole on the rear, right side. The president's blood and fragments of his scalp, brain, and skull landed on the interior of the car, the inner and outer surfaces of the front glass windshield and raised <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> {{as well as on the}} front engine hood and the rear trunk lid. His blood and fragments also landed on the follow-up Secret Service car and its driver's left arm, as well on the motorcycle officers who were riding on both sides of the President just behind his vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The Gremlin X {{version was}} added in 1976 as a {{separate}} model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger [...] I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, wheel arches, rocker panels), wheel trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the [...] "Navajo" [...] pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual seat configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.|$|E
