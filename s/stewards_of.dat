5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the <b>stewards</b> <b>of</b> their {{inability}} to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

25|$|When King Eärnil II of Gondor died, his son Eärnur, the Witch-king's old enemy, {{inherited}} the throne. The Witch-king challenged him to single combat, but Eärnur refused.

25|$|The warning beacons of Gondor were {{an alarm}} {{system for the}} realm of Gondor.

Built by the <b>Stewards</b> <b>of</b> Gondor, the beacons linked their capital Minas Tirith with the westernmost provinces of Gondor (and Rohan), thus enabling either to quickly alert the other. The beacon posts were manned by messengers, who would ride to either Belfalas or Rohan with word of their lighting.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{there was}} a further {{controversy}} when the Australian national eight, preparing for the Berlin Olympics, was excluded from the Grand Challenge Cup because the crew was composed of policemen, deemed to be 'manual workers'.

On 9 June 1937, the offending references to manual labourers, mechanics, artisans and menial duties were deleted from the ARA rules; Henley's rules were changed the following day, coming into effect from the 1938 regatta.|$|E

On 30 March 2015, Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen told the Associated Press that the weight-saving design is the root of the issues. This is based on a letter from Inspector General Volker Wieker advising the <b>Stewards</b> <b>of</b> Defence and Budget Committee of the Bundestag and the troops in advance of publication of the report.|$|E
