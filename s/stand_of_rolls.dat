50|$|A {{variety of}} {{cross-section}} profiles can be produced, but each profile requires a carefully crafted set of roll tools. Design of the rolls {{starts with a}} flower pattern, which is the sequence of profile cross-sections, one profile for each <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The roll contours are then derived from the flower pattern profiles. Because of {{the high cost of}} the roll sets, computer simulation is often used to develop or validate the roll designs and optimize the forming process to minimize the number of stands and material stresses in the final product.|$|E
40|$|Cold {{roll forming}} {{is a process}} for plastic deformation, which allows realizing profiles, with a defined section and {{established}} length, from the plastic deformation of a metal sheet. The sheet is induced to cross several <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls,</b> arranged along the same axis <b>of</b> advancing. The <b>rolls</b> induce plastic deformation in the sheet and then lead it to the desired geometric configuration. In order to control the geometric parameters of the plate during the profiling, it was created a FEM model to simulate {{the final stage of}} the technological process, developed by an industrial production line of a company located in Naples (Italy), that sells tubes with several cross sections. In this phase, the semi-finished product, having a circular cross section, is forced to cross through four <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> In this way, it changes the geometric condition of the cross section from circular to square. The model was carried out using a non-linear calculation code, which allows analyzing the parameters of interest in the different process steps. The results, obtained numerically, were compared with the experimental ones through the measurement of five specimens, obtained directly from technological process. The values of percentage deviation, regarding the external dimension and the thickness, for each step of advancement, do not exceed the 3 % of error. Then, the analysis results denote the capability to simulate the cold roll forming process using finite element method...|$|R

50|$|No6 Mill was a three-high {{rolling mill}} with several <b>stands</b> (Sets <b>of</b> <b>Rolls)</b> {{producing}} bar down to thick wire sizes from red hot billets {{taken from the}} reheat furnaces. The small diameter rod and bar produced in this mill snaked all over the cast iron floor plates.

In one hot summer the floor plates expanded, the expansion could not go anywhere and two plates buckled upwards like flagstones directing the hot metal into the air - within milliseconds there was no one on the mill floor as the metal reared up towards the roof and collapsed in a writhing heap as the mill rollers continued to spew out the rest of the bar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Square pipes (pipes {{with square}} cross sections) {{are being used}} for various {{industrial}} objectives, such as machine structure components and housing/building elements. The utilization of them is extending rapidly and widely. Hence, the out-put of those pipes is increasing and new application fields are continually developing. Due to various demands in recent time, the products have to satisfy difficult specifications with high accuracy in dimensions. The reshaping process design of pipes with square cross sections; however, is performed {{by trial and error}} and based on expert’s experience. In this paper, a computer-aided simulation is developed based on the 2 -D elastic-plastic method with consideration of the shear deformation to analyze the reshaping process. Effect of various parameters such as diameter of the circular pipe and mechanical properties of metal on product dimension and quality can be evaluated by using this simulation. Moreover, design of reshaping process include determination of shrinkage of cross section, necessary number <b>of</b> <b>stands,</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> and height <b>of</b> pipe at each stand, are investigated.

50|$|In metalworking, rolling is a {{metal forming}} {{process in which}} metal stock is passed through one or more pairs <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> to reduce the {{thickness}} {{and to make the}} thickness uniform. The concept is similar to the rolling <b>of</b> dough. <b>Rolling</b> is classified according to the temperature <b>of</b> the metal <b>rolled.</b> If the temperature of the metal is above its recrystallization temperature, then the process is known as hot rolling. If the temperature of the metal is below its recrystallization temperature, the process is known as cold rolling. In terms of usage, hot rolling processes more tonnage than any other manufacturing process, and cold rolling processes the most tonnage out of all cold working processes. <b>Roll</b> <b>stands</b> holding pairs <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> are grouped together into rolling mills that can quickly process metal, typically steel, into products such as structural steel (I-beams, angle stock, channel stock, and so on), bar stock, and rails. Most steel mills have rolling mill divisions that convert the semi-finished casting products into finished products.|$|R

40|$|Horizontal roll vortices, or rolls, are {{frequently}} {{observed in the}} hurricane boundary layer (HBL). Previous studies suggest that these rolls can be generated by the inflection point instability of the HBL flow. In this study we investigate the formation <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> due to this mechanism in the axisymmetric HBL using a numerical approach that explicitly resolves <b>rolls.</b> The effects <b>of</b> mean HBL wind and stratification distributions on rolls are evaluated. We identify two important factors of the mean HBL wind that affect the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The dynamical HBL height affects the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>rolls,</b> and {{the magnitude of the}} mean wind shear affects the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> As a result, under neutrally stratified HBL, the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> increases with the radius (out of the radius of maximum wind), while the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> decreases. The stratification also {{plays an important role in}} the generation <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The stable stratification suppresses the growth <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> because <b>of</b> the negative work done by the buoyancy force. Nonuniform stratification with a mixed layer has less suppressing effect on rolls. Rolls can trigger internal waves in the stably stratified layer, which have both vertically propagating and decaying properties.

40|$|AbstractIn {{hot rolling}} mills, {{premature}} failure <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> {{is a major}} concern as it adversely affects the mill operation as well as production. Analysis <b>of</b> failed <b>roll</b> materials and actual rolling conditions in service are therefore necessary to understand the roll failure mechanism and thereby improve the wear resistance and extend the service life <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The hot strip mill referred here consists <b>of</b> six <b>stands</b> wherein high chromium (Hi-Cr) iron rolls and Indefinite Chilled Double Poured (ICDP) cast iron rolls are being used for finishing rolling of the strips in the last two stands. The thin strip mill produces strips in the thickness range of 1. 0 – 12. 7 mm. This work describes two different types <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> failure cases and their analysis which was carried out using destructive as well as non-destructive testing techniques (NDT). The cases are as follows:(a) Case I: enhanced ICDP bottom <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> fifth <b>stand</b> (F# 5) which failed from the neck portion.
