50|$|The Me 163B {{had very}} docile landing characteristics, mostly {{due to its}} {{integrated}} leading edge slots, located directly forward of the elevon control surfaces, and just behind {{and at the same}} angle as the wing's leading edge. It would neither stall nor spin. One could fly the Komet with the <b>stick</b> <b>full</b> <b>back,</b> and have it in a turn and then use the rudder to {{take it out of the}} turn, and not fear it snapping into a spin. It would also slip well. Because the Me 163B's airframe design was derived from glider design concepts, it had excellent gliding qualities, and the tendency to continue flying above the ground due to ground effect. On the other hand, making a too close turn from base onto final, the sink rate would increase, and one could quickly lose altitude and come in short. Another main difference from a propeller-driven aircraft is that there was no slipstream over the rudder. On takeoff, one had to attain the speed at which the aerodynamic controls become effective—about 129 km/h—and that was always a critical factor. Pilots accustomed to flying propeller-driven aircraft had to be careful the control stick was not somewhere in the corner when the control surfaces began working. These, like many other specific Me 163 problems, would be resolved by specific training.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a l/ 19 -scale model of the North American T- 28 C airplane to determine the spin and recovery characteristics. The T- 28 C airplane {{is similar to the}} T- 28 B airplane except for slight modifications for the arresting hook. The lower rear section of the fuselage was cut out and, consequently, {{the lower part of the}} rudder was removed to make a smooth fairing with the fuselage. The T- 28 B airplane had good recovery characteristics; but these modifications, along with the addition of gun packages on the wings, led to poor and unsatisfactory spin-recovery characteristics during demonstration spins of the T- 28 C airplane. Model test results indicated that without the gun packages installed, satisfactory recoveries could be obtained if the elevators were held <b>full</b> <b>back</b> while the rudder was fully reversed and the ailerons were held neutral. However, with the addition of gun packages to the wings and the corresponding change in loading, recoveries were considered unsatisfactory. Recoveries attempted by using a larger chord or larger span rudder were improved very slightly, but were still considered marginal or unsatisfactory. Strakes placed on the nose of the model were effective in slowing the spin rotation slightly and, in most instances, decreased the turns for recovery slightly. Recovery characteristics were slightly marginal for the full fuel loading when strakes and the extended-chord rudder were installed; but with the wing fuel partly used, recovery characteristics were again considered unsatisfactory or, at least, definitely on the marginal side. The optimum control technique for recovery is movement of the rudder to full against the spin with the <b>stick</b> held <b>full</b> <b>back</b> (elevators <b>full</b> up) and the ailerons held neutral, followed by forward movement of the stick only after the spin rotation ceases. Inverted-spin test results indicate that the airplane will spin steep and fast and that recovery by full rudder reversal will be satisfactory if the ailerons are held neutral...|$|R

25|$|The role of <b>full</b> <b>back</b> {{who wears}} the number 3 jersey {{is one of}} the most {{important}} in Gaelic football or hurling. As well as defending against attackers, the <b>full</b> <b>back</b> is responsible for organising the defence and is the key defender in front of goals, and is usually one of the tallest and strongest players on the team. The <b>full</b> <b>back</b> plays most often around the 20-metre line. The position of the <b>full</b> <b>back</b> requires that the player have decent speed over short bursts, strength, and good hand eye co-ordination. In playing either cornerback or <b>full</b> <b>back</b> positions a well-developed aerobic system is required although, unlike the corner <b>backs,</b> the <b>full</b> <b>back</b> is needed to make short burst sprints both away from and into the goal area.|$|R
