40|$|Until today, neuro {{surgery is}} still very {{dependant}} on the individual skill of the surgeon. During surgery, he or she {{takes a look at}} the CT or MR slices, determines the location of, e. g., the tumor,then <b>sees</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> find it in real life, and starts cutting. Of course, this method is neither precise nor secure. Yet it is today’s standard procedure. But, as information technology gets better and better all the time, this does not have to be so in the future. In future, it will be standard to overlay the CT and MR slices to the patient in the operating room. How it works? Well, that’s what this paper is all about. Theoretical Part 1. Method Several stages are required to overlay an accurately aligned representation of preoperative image data on the surgical field. In short, these stages are:- Calibrating the optics of the microscope- Identify and segment the relevant structures from a patient’s scan- Align scan data to the patient in the operating room- Intraoperatively track patient as well as microscope to compensate for any relative movement- Combine all these transformations so that the surgeon perceives objects in the correct 3 -D position 2. Calibration Calibrating the microscope is necessary to know the correspondence between 3 -D world and the 2 -D overlay. This calibration is done by taking a number of images through the microscope optics of a calibration object. This During this process, you track both the position of the microscope and the position of the object. The 3 -D world coordinates of the circular markers in the calibration image are known in the localizer coordinate system. So, yo...|$|R
