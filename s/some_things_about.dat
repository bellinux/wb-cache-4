25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> {{the future}} of the Central Waterfront are clear. The 2001 Nisqually {{earthquake}} revealed that the Alaskan Way Viaduct is unsound and the seawall is in very poor condition. Another earthquake could cause liquefaction of the soils, undermining the viaduct and placing massive pressure on the seawall. While there may be much question as to what will happen, {{there is no doubt that}} things cannot remain as they are. Elsewhere on the waterfront, the deteriorating Piers 62 and 63 also cannot remain as they are.|$|E

According to series creator Paul Scheuring, the writers try to let all {{the characters in the}} show [...] "inhabit a gray area." [...] Scheuring says that although Mahone's pursuit in the second season is very noble, [...] "there are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> him that we will learn that are slightly less than noble." [...] Fichtner tries to play the character with a soft side, and believes that those characterizing him as [...] "a hard guy" [...] are [...] "missing what I'm trying to do." [...] Regarding the frequent intake of pills by Mahone, the series' executive producer and writer Matt Olmstead says: ...|$|E

6000|$|Bartley quaffed {{half of it}} in {{tolerant}} content. [...] "I always do. Find {{it takes}} my nerves {{down at the end}} of a hard week's work. Well, now, tell me <b>some</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> yourself. What are you going to do in Illinois?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, written you or something, I suppose!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Trust an Englishman for bungling a love affair. All I {{can tell}} you is that she left Dorset House in a hansom without the others, and said <b>some</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> having supper with some friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind me," [...] said Mr. Stokes, glancing balefully {{over at his}} {{agitated}} friend. [...] "P'raps I'll {{tell you}} <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> him some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you keep}} away from her apartment, Basil; that's all I've got to say to you. And yet I do like <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, lad. It's a mystery--an' I {{suppose it}} will remain a mystery. We know <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Nater, but there's others she keeps putty well hid." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 101. Finding Out: The Hoobs set out {{to learn}} <b>some</b> new <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Peeps and Tiddlypeeps.|$|R

6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] I said. [...] "Aren't {{you afraid}} of {{catching}} pneumonia or bronchitis or <b>some</b> <b>thing,</b> walking <b>about</b> in a singlet in such a wet fog?" ...|$|R
60|$|But it is {{no wonder}} that <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this house and its grounds strike us as peculiar, for it was built more than three {{thousand}} years ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not frightened," [...] Cecil answered. [...] "I don't {{think that}} I {{was ever a}} coward. All the same, there are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this fellow which I don't quite understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She said <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the {{difference}} between your hideous character and your splendid stature. Called you a magnificent fellow--that was it. Well, then she choked up and confessed something to Sally in shame and disgrace." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Lennon {{stated that}} [...] "there's <b>some</b> {{underlying}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Yoko in there", saying that McCartney looked at Yoko Ono {{in the studio}} every time he sang [...] "Get back to where you once belonged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't part at all," [...] he said, {{standing}} {{his ground}} {{with his back}} to the fire. [...] "I don't understand it, by heaven I don't. Because I said <b>some</b> stupid <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Boulogne, all in joke--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] nodded the doctor. He {{looked at}} Anne {{as if he}} were {{thinking}} <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> her that couldn't be expressed in words. Later on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.|$|E
60|$|Will was put {{entirely out of}} countenance by her {{expression}} and the ring of her voice. He held his peace, concluding that there were <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this girl beyond his comprehension--in which he was exactly right.|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} read my thoughts, and said: [...] "If you will {{go on with your}} smoking, I will wait and ask you <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Walford.

60|$|Hamel praised his wine, {{as indeed}} {{he had every}} reason to, but {{for a few moments}} the smooth {{conversation}} of his host fell upon deaf ears. He looked from the boy's face, pale and wrinkled as though with some sort of suppressed pain, to the girl's still, stony expression. This was indeed a house of mysteries! There was something here incomprehensible, <b>some</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the relations of these three and their knowledge of one another, utterly baffling. It was the queerest household, surely, into which any stranger had ever been precipitated.|$|R
60|$|He {{resumed his}} speech. The {{audience}} listened intently. Mr Bickersdyke, having said <b>some</b> nasty <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Free Trade and the Alien Immigrant, {{turned to the}} Needs of the Navy {{and the necessity of}} increasing the fleet at all costs.|$|R

6000|$|... "It may be," [...] said Aunt Martha, [...] "that the man's {{story is}} true. There are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> it which {{make me think}} so; but if he is really a {{criminal}} {{he must have had}} trials and temptations which led him into his present mode of life. We should consider that." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{great day}} for Grayton, that. It was a {{wonderful}} day--quite an indescribable day; but there were also <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> it that made Captain Ellice feel somehow that it was a mysterious day, for, while there were hearty congratulations, and much sobbing for joy on the part of Mrs Bright, there were also whisperings which puzzled him a good deal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Russ, don't think me proud," [...] she faltered. [...] "I wouldn't {{care who}} you were if I could only--only respect you. <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> you are splendid, you're such a man, that's why I cared. But you gamble.

5000|$|Aristotle {{asserts that}} we can usefully accept <b>some</b> <b>things</b> said <b>about</b> the soul (clearly a cross {{reference}} to Plato again), including {{the division of the}} soul into rational and irrational parts, and the further division of the irrational parts into two parts also: ...|$|R
60|$|It is curious, but I pitched early upon Mr. Norton as {{the very}} man who would think <b>some</b> generous <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> that matter, whether he said it or not. It is splendid {{to be a man}} like that--but it is given to few to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are pelicans, my dear sir. Are you {{interested}} in birds? If you would join me in a bun {{and a glass of}} milk at the stall yonder, I could tell you <b>some</b> interesting <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Indian birds. Right oh! Now the hill-mynah, for instance--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. I wouldn't {{think of}} {{teaching}} you, my boy. You know I'm not a schoolmaster. I'm not clever enough for that, and when I was your age, I hated to be taught. But I could show you <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> flowers and plants that would astonish you. Only {{it would not}} be safe to do it just now, for the deer might come up and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} the seaman, with much earnestness, [...] "having said that I am grateful, I {{will not say}} more about the Innuit just now. I will only tell you, in few words, <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> my own country which will interest you. I have been asked if we have big villages. Yes, my friends, we have very big villages--so big that I fear you will {{find it difficult to}} understand what I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Silas, I am {{sure there}} are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> our trip that we never told you. How we saw Napoleon and his {{beautiful}} Empress driving in the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and bowed at the people. I never saw such enthusiasm in my life. And oh, I learned such a lot of French history. All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus along the Loire. Very few tourists go there. You really ought to have gone with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can quite {{understand}} that," [...] he said; [...] "but {{there must have}} been some of the conversation that you understood. For instance, the Anti-Trust Bill that is coming before the House in a few weeks. They ought to have said <b>some</b> interesting <b>things</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|R
60|$|Trumps {{accompanied}} Tommy {{part of the}} way, {{and told}} him that he knew <b>some</b> ugly <b>things</b> <b>about</b> lawyer Lockhart that might get that gentleman into difficulties if he could only prove them, but he couldn't quite see his way to that, not being learned enough in the law.|$|R
50|$|Sir Eustace's corpse {{is still}} lying {{at the murder}} scene.
