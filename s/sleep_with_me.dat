500|$|After Edward's {{death on}} 6 July 1553 Northumberland {{undertook}} {{the enforcement of}} the King's will. Lady Jane Grey accepted the Crown only after remonstrances by her parents and parents-in-law. On 10 July the Duchess of Northumberland accompanied her son and daughter-in-law on their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London, where they were to reside {{for the rest of the}} short reign. According to Jane's own exculpatory letter to Queen Mary a few months later, Guildford now wanted to be made king. The young people agreed on having him declared king by Act of Parliament; but then Jane changed her mind and declared she would only make him a duke. [...] "I will not be a duke, I will be King", Guildford replied and went to fetch his mother. Furious, the Duchess took the side of her son, before she told him to leave the Tower and go home. Jane, however, insisted that he remain at court. According to her the Duchess also [...] "induced her son not to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> any more", and it is clear from her writings that Jane disliked her mother-in-law.|$|E

6000|$|Perdita {{shook her}} head; [...] "If {{it could be}} so," [...] she replied, [...] "I were much in the wrong to disdain your offers. But {{it is not a}} matter of choice; I can live here only. I am a part of this scene; each and all its {{properties}} are a part of me. This is no sudden fancy; I live by it. The knowledge that I am here, rises <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in the morning, and enables me to endure the light; it is mingled with my food, which else were poison; it walks, it <b>sleeps</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> for ever it accompanies me. Here I may even cease to repine, and may add my tardy consent to the decree which has taken him from me. He would rather have died such a death, which will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to old age unknown, unhonoured. Nor can I desire better, than, having been the chosen and beloved of his heart, here, in youth's prime, before added years can tarnish the best feelings of my nature, to watch his tomb, and speedily rejoin him in his blessed repose.|$|R
6000|$|Again the woman's eyes wandered absently away; {{then she}} began {{studying}} the parcel, and appeared about to unfold it once more, then thought better of it, and at last said, still speaking in the same absent mournful tone: [...] "I've got a room to myself up there," [...] indicating {{the upper end of}} the street. [...] "You can come and <b>sleep</b> along <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> if you like. One bloater ain't much for two, but there's tea and bread, and that'll do you good." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a September 2009 {{interview}} in Gay & Night Mika commented on his sexuality: [...] "I've never ever labelled myself. But having said that; I've never limited my life, I've never limited who I <b>sleep</b> <b>with...</b> Call <b>me</b> whatever you want. Call me bisexual, {{if you need}} a term for me..." [...] Later he stated in an interview with This Is London: [...] "I consider myself label-less because I could fall in love with anybody - literally - any type, any body. I'm not picky." [...] In an August 2012 interview with the magazine Instinct, the singer described himself as gay.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's prob'ly {{a mighty}} nice {{kind of a}} goose," [...] said the boy; [...] "but {{it seems to me}} if I had a pet I'd want one that could <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> an' you know you couldn't take this goose to bed." ...|$|E

6000|$|January 31. It was {{novel and}} pleasant, and I stayed awake {{as long as}} I could, to enjoy it, and to read about those strange people the Thugs. In my <b>sleep</b> they {{remained}} <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and tried to strangle me. The leader of the gang was that giant Hindoo who was such a picture in the strong light when we were leaving those Hindoo betrothal festivities at {{two o'clock in the}} morning--Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale, Vakeel to the Gaikwar of Baroda. It was he that brought me the invitation from his master to go to Baroda and lecture to that prince--and now he was misbehaving in my dreams. But all things can happen in dreams. It is indeed as the Sweet Singer of Michigan says--irrelevantly, of course, for the one and unfailing great quality which distinguishes her poetry from Shakespeare's and makes it precious to us is its stern and simple irrelevancy: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would not}} {{trespass}} too much upon you," [...] she said. [...] "My daughter can <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{am sure that}} my esquire here, Master Guy Aylmer, will gladly share a room with my boy. I can obtain lodgings for my four followers without." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} you CAN <b>sleep,</b> <b>with</b> the wind a bellowsing and roaring about you, making the tiles fly like a pack of cards,' said John; 'but no matter for that.

6000|$|... "Of course; but I am {{sure that}} if there were {{anything}} of that sort about you would soon be in touch <b>with</b> it. <b>With</b> <b>me</b> it is different; I could <b>sleep</b> sweetly <b>with</b> ghosts sitting on my bed in rows." ...|$|R
6000|$|An urgent, daring look {{came into}} his eyes, under the light-cluster. He stopped, took her arm. There was an edge of spring madness in his voice as he demanded, [...] "Wouldn't you like to run away <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to-night? Feel this breeze on your lips--it's simply plumb-full of mystery. Wouldn't you like to run away? and we'd tramp the Palisades till dawn and go to <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> the May sun glaring down the Hudson. Wouldn't you like to, wouldn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jane;" [...] I cried, {{looking up}} to her, and yet despising myself for saying it, [...] "you must stop here to-night and <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> If I'm left by myself in the room alone, I know I shall go mad--I can feel it--I'm sure of it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|I feared {{she might}} catch cold sitting there, {{and asked her}} to come in and <b>sleep</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> so she came into bed, and lay down beside me.

As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out, [...] "What is that?" ...|$|E
