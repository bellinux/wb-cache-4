5|$|Attorney General George H. Williams {{administered}} the United States Department of Justice with <b>slackness.</b> There were rumors that Williams was taking bribes {{in exchange for}} declining to prosecute pending trial cases. In 1875, Williams was supposed to prosecute the merchant house Pratt & Boyd for fraudulent customhouse entries. The Senate Judiciary Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation. Williams had also indiscreetly used Justice Department funds to pay for carriage and household expenses.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's {{results have}} been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary <b>slackness,</b> and saddlepoint duality. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.|$|E
5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined <b>slackness,</b> while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E

It was ridiculous that the Carmel boy should have such emotions--he was six years younger than Trafford and only a year older than Marjorie, and yet she was pleased by his manifest wound....|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} regarding to small displacement measurement using vibration transducers. Mechanical faults, usages, <b>slackness’s,</b> cause different noises and vibrations with different amplitude and frequency against the normal sound and {{movement of the}} equipment. The vibration transducers, accelerometers and microphone are used for noise and/or sound and vibration detection with fault detection purpose. The output signal of the vibration transducers or accelerometers is an acceleration signal and {{can be converted to}} either velocity or displacement, depending on the preferred measurement parameter. Displacement characteristics are used to indicate when the machine condition has changed. There are many problems using accelerometers to measure position or displacement. It is important to determine displacement over time. To determinate the movement from acceleration a double integration is needed. A transfer function and Simulink model was determinate for accelerometers with capacitive sensing element. Using these models the displacement was reproduced by low frequency input...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--Since I last {{laid down}} my pen, I have written and rewritten The Beach of Falesá; {{something}} like sixty thousand words of sterling domestic fiction (the story, you will understand, {{is only half}} that length); and now I don't want to write any more again for ever, or feel so; and I've got to overhaul it once again to my sorrow. I was all yesterday revising, and {{found a lot of}} <b>slacknesses</b> and (what is worse in this kind of thing) some literaryisms. One of the puzzles is this: It is a first person story--a trader telling his own adventure in an island. When I began I allowed myself a few liberties, because I was afraid of the end; now the end proved quite easy, and could be done in the pace; so the beginning remains about a quarter tone out (in places); but I have rather decided to let it stay so. The problem is always delicate; it {{is the only thing that}} worries me in first person tales, which otherwise (quo' Alan) [...] "set better wi' my genius." [...] There is a vast deal of fact in the story, and some pretty good comedy. It is the first realistic South Sea story; I mean with real South Sea character and details of life. Everybody else who has tried, that I have seen, got carried away by the romance, and ended in a kind of sugar candy sham epic, and the whole effect was lost--there was no etching, no human grin, consequently no conviction. Now I have got the smell and look of the thing a good deal. You will know more about the South Seas after you have read my little tale than if you had read a library. As to whether any one else will read it, I have no guess. I am in an off time, but there is just the possibility it might make a hit; for the yarn is good and melodramatic, and there is quite a love affair--for me; and Mr. Wiltshire (the narrator) is a huge lark, though I say it. But there is always the exotic question, and everything, the life, the place, the dialects--trader's talk, which is a strange conglomerate of literary expressions and English and American slang, and Beach de Mar, or native English,--the very trades and hopes and fears of the characters, are all novel, and may be found unwelcome to that great, hulking, bullering whale, the public.|$|R
5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the <b>slackness</b> with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E
25|$|Though the law {{was highly}} {{offensive}} to many Northerners, Southerners complained bitterly about perceived <b>slackness</b> in enforcement. Fillmore believed himself bound by his oath as president and by the bargain made in the Compromise to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. He did so even though some prosecutions or attempts to return slaves ended badly for the government, with acquittals or the slave taken from federal custody and to freedom by a Boston mob. Such cases were widely publicized North and South, and inflamed passions in both places, undermining the good feeling that had followed the Compromise.|$|E
25|$|Most of the contemporaries' {{critics to}} the Ordinary reprimanded him {{not for his}} office or for being {{insensitive}} or too rigorous and persistent in obtaining confessions, but for <b>slackness</b> and negligence and for being too lax. 19th and 20th century commentators characterised him as morally lax, drunken and dissolute, an incompetent minister, weak and ineffectual, unable to exert any control over the condemned. Victorian and Edwardian writers conflate the Ordinary and his Accounts with the corruption and depravity of 18th century Church. We have proof of the corruption of some Ordinaries as well: Samuel Smith and John Allen were discharged by the Court of Aldermen for undue practices, such as fabricating false confessions and dying speeches, pocketing charitable donations and money sent to the condemned, soliciting bribes under the pretext of obtaining reprieves for the criminals.|$|E

500|$|After his {{recall in}} January 1963, Ivanov {{disappeared}} for several decades. In 1992 his memoirs, The Naked Spy, were serialised in The Sunday Times. When this account was challenged by Profumo's lawyers, the publishers removed offending material. In August 2015, The Independent newspaper published a preview [...] of a forthcoming history of Soviet intelligence activities, by Jonathan Haslam. This book {{suggests that the}} relationship between Ivanov and Profumo was closer than the latter has admitted. It is alleged that Ivanov visited Profumo's home, and that such was the <b>slackness</b> of security arrangements that the Russian was able to photograph sensitive documents left lying about in the minister's study.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the <b>slackness</b> of Congress for not {{picking up}} on the bill's {{perceived}} dangers: [...] "Those {{of us who have}} been in the study and research work of the United Nations, we feel that we are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things." [...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." [...] He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to [...] "usurp American nationality".|$|E
500|$|Whether based ashore or on board, the men's duties during Bounty's five-month stay in Tahiti were {{relatively}} light. Many led promiscuous lives among the native women—altogether, 18 officers and men, including Christian, received treatment for venereal infections—while others took regular partners. Christian formed {{a close relationship}} with a Polynesian woman named Mauatua, to whom he gave the name [...] "Isabella" [...] after a former sweetheart from Cumberland. Bligh remained chaste himself, but was tolerant of his men's activities, unsurprised that they should succumb to temptation when [...] "the allurements of dissipation are beyond any thing that can be conceived". Nevertheless, he expected them to do their duty efficiently, and was disappointed to find increasing instances of neglect and <b>slackness</b> on the part of his officers. Infuriated, he wrote: [...] "Such neglectful and worthless petty officers I believe were never in a ship such as are in this".|$|E
500|$|The Fugitive Slave Act {{continued}} to be contentious after its enactment: Southerners complained bitterly about any <b>slackness,</b> but enforcement was highly offensive to many Northerners. Abolitionists recited the inequities of the law: it punished severely any aid to an escaped slave, and if captured, he had no due process and could not testify before a magistrate who would be paid more for deciding he was a slave than for deciding he was not. Nevertheless, Fillmore believed himself bound by his oath as president and by the bargain made in the Compromise to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. [...] He did so even though some prosecutions or attempts to return slaves ended badly for the government, with acquittals or the slave taken from federal custody and to freedom by a Boston mob. Such cases were widely publicized North and South, and inflamed passions in both places, undermining the good feeling that had followed the Compromise.|$|E
500|$|Huggan died on 10 December. Bligh {{attributed}} this to [...] "the {{effects of}} intemperance and indolence... {{he never would}} be prevailed on to take half a dozen turns upon deck at a time, through the whole course of the voyage". For all his earlier favoured status, Christian did not escape Bligh's wrath. He was often humiliated by the captain—sometimes {{in front of the}} crew and the Tahitians—for real or imagined <b>slackness,</b> while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became increasingly common. On 5 January 1789 three members of the crew—Charles Churchill, John Millward and William Muspratt—deserted, taking a small boat, arms and ammunition. Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect. Among the belongings Churchill left on the ship was a list of names that Bligh interpreted as possible accomplices in a desertion plot—the captain later asserted that the names included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh was persuaded that his protégé was not planning to desert, and the matter was dropped. Churchill, Millward and Muspratt were found after three weeks and, on their return to the ship, were flogged.|$|E

2500|$|Since each {{inequality}} can {{be replaced}} by an equality and a slack variable, this means each primal variable corresponds to a dual slack variable, and each dual variable corresponds to a primal slack variable.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, face {{covering}} veils with caps velvet with trimmed with otter fur were worn {{in the streets}} by Turki women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by the adventurer Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s. Travelers of the period Sir Percy Sykes and Ella Sykes wrote that in Kashghar women went into the bazar [...] "transacting business with their veils thrown back" [...] but mullahs tried to enforce veil wearing and were [...] "in the habit of beating those who show their face in the Great Bazar"." [...] Uyghur women who had non-Muslim Han Chinese husbands did not wear veils due to their <b>slackness</b> in regards to religion in the period after Yaqub Beg's rule ended. Belonging to different social statuses meant a difference in how rigorously the veil was worn.|$|E
2500|$|Worse {{followed}} in 1952. Gimblett made 2,000 runs, {{and the rest}} of the batting was marginally improved over 1951, but inability to take wickets at reasonable cost consigned the side to the bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1913. Only two matches were won all season and, Wisden reported, [...] "even these meagre successes were due as much to the spin of the coin as the turn of the ball. When Somerset won the toss in the Bath Festival they triumphed over Middlesex and Warwickshire and when they lost it they went under to Leicestershire." [...] Wisden noted too that morale was low: [...] "General <b>slackness,</b> particularly in fielding, was Somerset's biggest handicap. Until the whole club develops a more enthusiastic spirit as portrayed by Gimblett, they will continue to disappoint their faithful supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freestyle slacklining (a.k.a. “rodeo slacklining") {{is the art}} and {{practice}} of cultivating balance {{on a piece of}} rope or webbing draped slack between two anchor points, typically about [...] apart and [...] off the ground in the center. This type of very [...] "slack" [...] slackline provides a wide array of opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A freestyle slackline has no tension in it, while both traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This <b>slackness</b> in the rope or webbing allows it to swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into popularity in 1999, through a group of students from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. It was first written about on a website called the [...] "Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo Slackline Research" [...] in 2004. The article [...] "Old Revolution— New Recognition - 3-10-04" [...] describes these early developments in detail.|$|E
2500|$|General of Brigade François Gilles Guillot was the {{governor}} of the fortress. His garrison was made up of replacements from the French-allied Kingdom of Italy and Kingdom of Naples. Guillot was [...] "negligent and easy-going" [...] according to historian Charles Oman. The small size of the garrison and {{the governor}}'s <b>slackness</b> inspired the fighting priest Francesc Rovira i Sala and the leaders of the miquelets to attempt to seize the fort in a coup de main. Rovira was in contact with three young Spaniards who had access to the fort and who posed as pro-French. Juan Marquez was the servant of Bouclier, the commissary of the fortress, while the brothers Ginés and Pedro Pons were under-storekeepers. Marquez managed to make copies of the keys to one postern gate and the storerooms. Rovira requested help from the commander of the Army of Catalonia, Captain General Luis Gonzalez Torres de Navarra, Marquess of Campoverde and the general promised support for the operation.|$|E
