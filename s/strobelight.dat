5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] was {{directed}} by Stuart Gosling. It was filmed {{on the day of}} its premiere on UK music TV station The Box on 21 September 2006. However, The Box had actually shown an early edit of the video, and the finished version was shown on Channel 4's Popworld on 30 September 2006. It features the girls [...] "driving" [...] sports cars in front of a green screen showing the streets of London. Cheryl has a car to herself, Nadine shares with Kimberley, and Nicola shares with Sarah. The featured sports cars of the video are a red TVR Tuscan 2 convertible, and a blue TVR Tamora. The group also perform a dance routine in front of flashing <b>strobelights.</b>|$|R

5000|$|However, Sawdey was {{critical}} on the song's {{presence on the}} album and lyrics, saying [...] "Me Up either sacrifices lyrical clarity {{for the sake of}} a good hook (the title track) or just wind up pandering to listeners with overwrought generalities (“I Don’t Wanna Wait”, the very T.A.T.U.-esque “I Can’t Stay Away”). He also pointed out that [...] "Most of these weaker moments hit right in the dead center of the album, killing Me Up‘s early momentum far too soon, these weak tracks all blurring together in one dizzying haze, as if designed specifically to soundtrack the movements of cold <b>strobelights</b> in the middle of a sweaty club." [...] David James Young from Sputnikmusic had felt that while the middle half of the album, including the song, tried too hard, he did say that [...] "I Can't Stay Away" [...] featured [...] "some lively beats." [...] A reviewer from State Magazine {{was critical}} towards the entire album, but said [...] "Meanwhile -This Love’ (unfortunately not a cover of the Pantera belter) and -I Can’t Stay Away’ translate as balladry filler on a record that really could do without it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Also their song [...] "Atoms" [...] {{has been}} {{included}} {{on a couple}} of later but favourable Gothic compilations, most notable with Germany's <b>Strobelight</b> Records. And still today, their songs can be found aired on the gothic club dance floors of Europe.|$|E
50|$|Screams for Tina was revived {{again in}} 2002 when their {{friends in the}} Austrian band Kiss the Blade invited them {{to be on their}} new label <b>Strobelight</b> Records. The band’s two {{remaining}} members, Mansfield and Budd, signed an interim deal and the label released a four-song EP, 2003 A.D., that included songs written and recorded after the breakup.|$|E
50|$|The duo {{recorded}} a 12” EP, <b>Strobelight</b> Funeral, in 1986, which was distributed {{in both the}} United States and Europe. Reviews cited other post-punk and gothic rock-related bands of the 1980s as influences, such as Bauhaus, The Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division and the Psychedelic Furs. “Deathrock” was another term frequently used by critics when describing their early sound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strobelight</b> Records {{was founded}} to release their first album, Different Degrees of Empty, in 2003, {{and all of}} the band's {{following}} albums have been released by the record label. In 2004, the band toured Europe {{for the first time to}} support their second album, Beggars Would Ride. The band played at the Wave Gotik Treffen music festival in May 2005.|$|E
5000|$|After the show, {{the band}} once again went their {{separate}} ways. <b>Strobelight</b> Records contacted Adame about including a Burning Image song on a compilation {{that they were}} releasing in 2006 titled Kaliffornian Deathrock. A new song, [...] "Haunted" [...] was submitted for the compilation. Burning Image featuring original members Adame, Bonanno and Burch with returning bass player Leyva, played the Wake the Dead festival in spring 2007, along with Ausgang, Cinema Strange, Tragic Black, Scarlets Remains and Pins and Needles. On November 12, 2007, Burning Image opened a show for Christian Death 1334 featuring original members James McGearty and Rikk Agnew as well as former Shadow Project founder, Eva O.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for The Official Charts Company, Rob Copsey {{named it}} the sexiest {{song on the}} album, also calling it a [...] "sultry number." [...] Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture.com claimed the song [...] "is not only one of her strongest tracks to date, but it’s also the least bad thing the Weeknd has done in recent memory." [...] Adam Workman of The National wrote Grande is [...] "effective" [...] on the track and that The Weeknd [...] "worryingly hits higher-pitched peaks than Grande." [...] Aimee Cliff of Fact picked it as the album's highlight, saying that the song [...] "is {{actually}} improved by The Weeknd’s presence, ... his sleaze is turned down several notches as his clean-cut falsetto battles Ariana’s octave-juggling over an irresistible thump." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy praised Grande for [...] "successfully dragging The Weeknd out of his Pitchfork mixtape mindset to sound like an upbeat popstar over subtle grooves and disco claps on the captivating serenade track." [...] Nick Levine wrote for Time Out that the song [...] "sounds like a gorgeous cross between Robyn and Mariah Carey," [...] while Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie found that the song has [...] "Grande at her most obviously sexy without being overly explicit, and it works fantastically." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters went out to describe it as [...] "the best song Grande has put out to date," [...] declaring: [...] "The dark, sensual throb of the Weeknd collaboration 'Love Me Harder' actually showcases Grande’s voice in its most effective setting, the slow-motion <b>strobelight</b> jam allowing her to come off as teasing, assertive, and knowing all at once." [...] Edwin Ortiz of Complex placed the song at number 8 on [...] "The 50 Best Songs of 2014" [...] list, declaring: [...] "The unlikely pairing of Ariana Grande and the Weeknd {{proved to be a}} stroke of genius on 'Love Me Harder', a seductive synth-pop duet that manages to push both artists out of their comfort zones, while also remaining appealing to each of their core values. ... "'Love Me Harder' is earmarked as a defining musical moment of 2014. Stroke of genius, indeed." ...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{distributed}} systems span thousands of independent hosts which come online and go offline at their users ’ whim. Such availability flux is ostensibly a key concern when systems are designed, but this flux is rarely measured {{in a rich}} way post-deployment, either by the distributed system itself or by a standalone piece of infrastructure. In this paper we introduce <b>StrobeLight,</b> a tool for monitoring per-host availability trends in enterprise settings. Every 30 seconds, <b>StrobeLight</b> probes Microsoft’s entire corporate network, archiving the ping results for use by other networked services. We describe two such services, one offline and the other online. The first service uses longitudinal data collected by our <b>StrobeLight</b> deployment to analyze large-scale trends in our wired and wireless networks. The second service draws live <b>StrobeLight</b> measurements to detect network anomalies like IP hijacking in real time. <b>StrobeLight</b> is easy to deploy, requiring neither modification to end hosts nor changes to the core routing infrastructure. Furthermore, it requires minimal network and CPU resources to probe our network of over 200, 000 hosts. ...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{contributing}} to the low fish guidance at Rocky Reach Dam were investigatedthrough laboratory experiments and a computer model. Particular attention was given todetermining how strobe lights {{could be used to}} improve fish guidance efficiency. In general, juvenile Chinook and coho salmon and rainbow trout tended to avoid or escape <b>strobelight</b> at intensities between 0. 1 and 5 ìE/m 2 /s. The EG 2 ̆ 6 G strobe lights used at Rocky ReachDam produced an intensity of about 1 ìE/m 2 /s at a distance of 10 ft. Escape speed averagedabout 7 bI/s and was dependent on strobe light intensity and the level of light that fish wereadapted to. Escape speed increased with strobe flash rate, with a flash rate of 200 /mm or abovebeing sufficient to induce speed near the maximum observed. Strobe intensity above 5 ìE/m 2 /sand flash rates above about 500 /mm tended to stun fish. Juvenile steelhead were attracted to thelow light intensities of the strobe 2 ̆ 7 s penumbra. A computer model was developed to describe the trajectories of fish as affected by water currentsand swimming to avoid strobe lights and the trashrack. A model suggested that trashrackpassage was a critical factor in fish guidance efficiency. In laboratory experiments, strobe lightcould be used to force rainbow trout through a trashrack-like barrier. However, at Rocky ReachDam, strobe lights were ineffective at forcing subyearling Chinook through the trashrack. Thus, ahypothesis was formulated that the submersible traveling screen behind the trashrack may havegenerated sound stimuli that inhibited trashrack passage; moreover, it appeared that strobe lightswere ineffective in counteracting this aversive stimuli...|$|E
