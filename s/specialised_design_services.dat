By taking on this job {{she was able to}} start writing in her spare time. Canavan states that until the age of 25 she dreamed of writing a novel but lacked the focus to do so. When she turned 25 she took several writing courses, worked on refining her fiction writing skills, while she fought her way through several rejections.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate a <b>specialised</b> <b>service</b> <b>designed</b> to improve parenting capacity, child safety and family functioning in the context of parental mental health, drug and alcohol and child protection concerns. Method: Client data was collected over a period of 3 years and 3 months, including demographic characteristics, service usage, presenting issues and pre and post revised North Carolina Family Assessment Scale (NCFAS-G) scores. Results: A significant improvement between intake and discharge occurred on the majority of the 58 NCFAS-G subscale items (32 / 58). In particular, most significant change occurred in the domains 'family safety' (p p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Specialised programs can assist families with child safety concerns suffering from mental health and/or drug and alcohol problems...|$|R

Background: Recently, exploratory <b>service</b> <b>design</b> cases by online service companies such as Google, Apple, and NHN has been developed. <b>Service</b> <b>design</b> and online <b>service</b> experience <b>design</b> has been booming among user experience professionals but these two areas are not clearly defined. It is interesting to study the definition and key factors of <b>service</b> <b>design</b> and online <b>service</b> experience <b>design.</b> Moreover, investigating <b>service</b> <b>design</b> cases by online service companies is needed.
