5000|$|So-called 'sandwich' immunoassays are {{particularly}} susceptible to this interference. (<b>Sandwich</b> <b>immunoassay</b> = two-site, noncompetitive immunoassays {{in which the}} analyte in the unknown sample is bound to the antibody site, then labeled antibody is bound to the analyte. The amount of labeled antibody on the site is then measured. It will be directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte because labeled antibody will not bind if the analyte is not present in the unknown sample. This type {{is also known as}} sandwich assay as the analyte is [...] "sandwiched" [...] between two antibodies.) Heterophile antibodies may thus give false positives (by bridging the capture and signal antibody) or false negatives (by blocking one or the other). Both detecting and deterring this interference is difficult in clinical medicine. One option is to repeat the test using a different type of assay. Other options include the use of heterophile blocking reagents, steps to remove immunoglobulins, serial dilutions and using non-mammalian capture and/or detection antibodies.|$|E

This thesis includes four approaches that address important limitations of current technologies, thus enabling highly sensitive, specific and parallel protein measurements. Paper I describes a method for sensitive singleplex protein detection in complex biological samples, namely solid phase proximity ligation assay (SP-PLA). SP-PLA exhibited improved sensitivity compared to conventional <b>sandwich</b> <b>immunoassays.</b> We applied SP-PLA to validate the potential of GDF- 15 as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease.   Paper II describes ProteinSeq, a multiplexed immunoassay based on the principle of SP-PLA, for parallel detection of 36 proteins using next-generation sequencing as readout. ProteinSeq exhibited improved sensitivity compared to multiplexed <b>sandwich</b> <b>immunoassays,</b> and the potential to achieve even higher levels of multiplexing while preserving a high sensitivity and specificity. We applied ProteinSeq to analyze 36 proteins, including one internal control, in 5 μl of plasma samples in a cohort of patients with cardiovascular disease and healthy controls. Paper III describes PLA-DTM, a strategy for recording all possible interactions between sets of proteins in clinical samples. Individual proteins and their interactions are first encoded to dual barcoded DNA by PLA, and the barcodes are interrogated by a method named dual tag microarray (DTM). We applied the method for studying interactions among protein members of the NFκB signaling pathway. Paper IV describes a novel probing strategy for analyzing individual biomolecules in solution or in situ. The technique employs a new class of probes for unfolding proximity ligation assays - uPLA probes. The probes are designed so that each probe set is sufficient in forming and replicating circular DNA reporter, without interactions among themselves when incubated with the sample. The uPLA probing strategy provides ease in the design of multiple probe sets in parallelized assays while enhancing the specificity of detection.
