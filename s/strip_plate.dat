40|$|A {{new idea}} on {{electrostatic}} deviation and capture of back-drifting avalanche-ions in cascaded gaseous hole-multipliers is presented. It involves a flipped reversed-bias Micro-Hole & <b>Strip</b> <b>Plate</b> (F-R-MHSP) element, the strips {{of which are}} facing the drift region of the multiplier. The ions, originating from successive multiplication stages, are efficiently deviated and captured by such electrode. Experimental results are provided comparing the ion-blocking capability of the F-R-MHSP {{to that of the}} reversed-bias Micro-Hole & <b>Strip</b> <b>Plate</b> (R-MHSP) and the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). Best ion-blocking results in cascaded hole-multipliers were reached with a detector having the F-R-MHSP as the first multiplication element. A three-element F-R-MHSP/GEM/MHSP cascaded multiplier operated in atmospheric-pressure Ar/CH 4 (95 / 5), at total gain of ~ 10 ^{ 5 }, yielded ion back-flow fractions of 3 * 10 ^{- 4 } and 1. 5 * 10 ^{- 4 }, at drift fields of 0. 5 and 0. 2 kV/cm, respectively.
