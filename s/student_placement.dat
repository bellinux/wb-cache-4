2500|$|Critics {{have often}} {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} the film is a social commentary that is reflecting the issues of Japanese society {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Some viewers see Battle Royale as a satire of the Japanese economy during the Lost Decade. Others view it as a criticism of the Japanese educational system, such as the issues of school violence and its failings to prepare students for the extremely competitive Japanese employment market that favors elitism, in which students must partake in fiercely competitive nationwide examinations in order to secure a spot into the more distinguished universities, as these will guarantee <b>student</b> <b>placement</b> into better careers. Other interpretations include the Japanese generational attitudes that is creating social, political and economic divides between the young and old. Fukasaku himself has stated: [...] "The children who have grown up and witnessed what happened to the adults, their anxiety became heightened as well. So I set Battle Royale within this context of children versus adults." ...|$|E
40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} extent of {{undergraduate}} health <b>student</b> <b>placements</b> in regional hospitals in northern Victoria in 1999, prior to substantial changes in rural undergraduate medical education in Australia. METHOD: Cross sectional postal survey with telephone follow-up in north-east Victoria. Subjects were all 17 regional and rural hospitals involved in health student teaching in North-east Victoria. Main outcome measures were the numbers, duration and discipline of health <b>students</b> <b>placements</b> and reported barriers to such placements. RESULTS: Large regional hospitals accounted for two-thirds of all undergraduate health <b>student</b> <b>placements.</b> Smaller sites placed few allied health students. Barriers to a larger, more sustainable system of rural placements and rotations included accommodation shortages and funding constraints, particularly in smaller rural hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate resourcing of placements of a meaningful duration, stronger institutional support, and improved resourcing of regional accommodation is required to facilitate a larger, more systematic and sustainable system of medical and health <b>student</b> <b>placements</b> in rural areas.
