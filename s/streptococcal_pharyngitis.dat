The rashes were characterized by maculopapules, which increased in size with coalescence and some developing into plaques, with a symmetrical distribution with a propensity for the extremities, including the palms and soles. The clinical courses of the patients were good, and the rashes subsided within 14 days. A non-immediate reaction to β-lactams, which usually manifests as a maculopapular rash, is a possible cause in our patients, however, repeated courses of amoxicillin in 3 patients did not induce the rash.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} a management approach for Group A <b>streptococcal</b> (GAS) <b>pharyngitis</b> that would address overuse of antibiotics {{and could be}} implemented immediately.

We report three cases of GBS pharyngitis in patients with underlying diseases, two of whom were treated with and responded incompletely to oral beta-lactam antibiotics. The susceptibility of 20 clinical isolates of GBS was tested by a broth dilution method to six antibiotics which could conceivably be used in the therapy of GBS pharyngitis. Penicillin G, clindamycin, and erythromycin were most active with mean minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0. 06 μg/ml or less.

Therapy traditionally used for Group A <b>streptococcal</b> (GAS) <b>pharyngitis</b> may, at times, be suboptimal for GBS pharyngitis in compromised patients. This may be due to higher minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of GBS than GAS, to inadequate penetration of penicillins into pharyngeal tissues or to host factors. It is suggested that GBS can cause pharyngitis in adults, particularly the compromised patient, and that in cases where there is a poor response to penicillin or ampicillin therapy, alternative drugs (erythromycin or clindamycin) may be used...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Group A <b>streptococcal</b> (GAS) <b>pharyngitis</b> is {{a common}} disease worldwide. We aimed to {{establish}} a pragmatic program as a clinical decision rule for GAS pharyngitis diagnosis. Materials And Methods: This article derived from a research project on children aged 6 – 15 years. Five hundred and seventy-one children met the enrollment criteria on whom throat culture and validities of clinical findings were assessed in positive and negative throat culture groups. Results: Positive GAS throat culture group included 99 (17. 3 %) patients with a positive culture. Negative GAS throat culture group included 472 (82. 6 %) patients. Exudate or enlarged tender nodes each one had 63 % and 68 % sensitivity and 31. 5 % and 37. 5 % specificity with {{a high percentage of}} negative predictive value (NPV) 80. 54 % and 85. 09 %, respectively. Sequence test revealed validities of exudate plus enlarged nodes at 43. 62 % sensitivity and 57. 19 % specificity with 83 % NPV. Conclusions: High NPV of 83 % indicated that similar prevalence in the absence of either exudate or enlarged tender lymph nodes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stratifying {{patients}} with a sore throat into the probability of having an underlying bacterial or viral cause may be helpful in targeting antibiotic treatment. We sought to assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms and validate a clinical prediction rule (CPR), the Centor score, for predicting group A β-haemolytic <b>streptococcal</b> (GABHS) <b>pharyngitis</b> in adults (3 ̆e 14 years of age) presenting with sore throat symptoms. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed up to July 2010. Studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms and/or validated the Centor score were included. For {{the analysis of the}} diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms and the Centor score, studies were combined using a bivariate random effects model, while for the calibration analysis of the Centor score, a random effects model was used. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies incorporating 4, 839 patients were included in the meta-analysis on diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms. The results were heterogeneous and suggest that individual signs and symptoms generate only small shifts in post-test probability (range positive likelihood ratio (+LR) 1. 45 - 2. 33, -LR 0. 54 - 0. 72).

40|$|Controversy remains {{about the}} need for {{antibiotic}} therapy of group A <b>streptococcal</b> (GAS) <b>pharyngitis</b> in high-resource settings. Guidelines on the management of GAS pharyngitis differ considerably, especially in children. We performed a literature search on the diagnosis and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in children and compared different guidelines with current epidemiology and the available evidence on management. Some European guidelines only recommend antibiotic treatment in certain high-risk patients, while many other, including all American, still advise antimicrobial treatment for all children with GAS pharyngitis, given the severity and re-emerging incidence of complications. Empirical antimicrobial treatment in children with sore throat and a high clinical suspicion of GAS pharyngitis will still result in significant overtreatment of nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. This is costly and leads to emerging antibiotic resistance. Early differential diagnosis between viral and GAS pharyngitis, by means of a 'rapid antigen detection test' (RADT) and/or a throat culture, is therefore needed if 'pro treatment' guidelines are used. Conclusion: Large scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to assess the value of antibiotics for GAS pharyngitis in high-resource countries, in order to achieve uniform and evidence-based guidelines. The severity and the possibly increasing incidence of complications in school-aged children suggests that testing and treating proven GAS pharyngitis can still be beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Background: Consensus {{guidelines}} recommend against testing or treating adults at {{low risk}} for group A <b>streptococcal</b> (GAS) <b>pharyngitis.</b> Objective: To help patients decide when {{to visit a}} clinician {{for the evaluation of}} sore throat. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: A national chain of retail health clinics. Patients: 71 776 patients aged 15 years or older with pharyngitis who visited a clinic from September 2006 to December 2008. Measurements: The authors created a score using information from patient-reported clinical variables plus the incidence of local disease and compared it with the Centor score and other traditional scores that require clinician-elicited signs. Results: If patients aged 15 years or older with sore throat did not visit a clinician when the new score estimated the likelihood of GAS pharyngitis to be less than 10 % instead of having clinicians manage their symptoms following guidelines that use the Centor score, 230 000 visits would be avoided in the United States each year and 8500 patients with GAS pharyngitis who would have received antibiotics would not be treated with them. Limitation: Real-time information about the local incidence of GAS pharyngitis, which is necessary to calculate the new score, is not currently available. Conclusion: A patient-driven approach to pharyngitis diagnosis that uses this new score could save hundreds of thousands of visits annually by identifying patients at home who are unlikely to require testing or treatment...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the utility of}} rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) for the diagnosis of group A <b>streptococcal</b> (GAS) <b>pharyngitis</b> in pediatric outpatient clinics in four countries with varied socio-economic and geographic profiles. MethodsWe prospectively evaluated the utility of a commercial RADT in children aged 2 – 12 years presenting with symptoms of pharyngitis to urban outpatient clinics in Brazil, Croatia, Egypt, and Latvia between August 2001 and December 2005. We compared {{the performance of the}} RADT to culture using diagnostic and agreement statistics, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The Centor scores for GAS diagnosis were used to assess the potential effect of spectrum bias on RADT results. ResultsTwo thousand four hundred and seventy-two children were enrolled at four sites. The prevalence of GAS by throat culture varied by country (range 24. 5 – 39. 4 %) and by RADT (range 23. 9 – 41. 8 %). Compared to culture, RADT sensitivity ranged from 72. 4 % to 91. 8 % and specificity ranged from 85. 7 % to 96. 4 %. The positive predictive value ranged from 67. 9 % to 88. 6 % and negative predictive value ranged from 88. 1 % to 95. 7 %.
