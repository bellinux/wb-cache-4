40|$|We study {{relaxation}} of a moving spin qubit caused by phonon noise. As we vary {{the speed of}} the qubit, we observe several interesting features in spin relaxation and the associated phonon emission, induced by Doppler effect. In particular, in the supersonic regime, the phonons emitted by the relaxing qubit is concentrated along certain directions, similar to the shock waves produced in classical Cherenkov effect. As {{the speed of the}} moving qubit increases from the subsonic regime to the supersonic regime, the qubit experiences a peak in the spin relaxation rate near the speed of sound, which we term a spin relaxation boom in analogy to the classical sonic boom. We also find that the moving spin qubit may have a lower relaxation rate than a static qubit, which hints at the possibility of coherence-preserving transportation for a spin qubit. While the physics we have studied here has strong classical analogies, we do find that quantum confinement for the spin qubit {{plays an important role in}} all the phenomena we observe. Specifically, it produces a correction on the Cherenkov angle, and removes the divergence in relaxation rate at the <b>sonic</b> <b>barrier.</b> It is our hope that our results would encourage further research into approaches for transferring and preserving quantum information in spin qubit architectures.

In this research we attempt to create quiet areas in cities using <b>sonic</b> crystal noise <b>barriers.</b> For aesthetic and security aspects, such protections do not exceed a size of 1 m× 1 m in a vertical section. Cylindrical scatterers with added acoustical properties of resonance and absorption are used in this work to improve the acoustic performance of low height <b>sonic</b> crystal <b>barriers.</b> Numerical simulations, using a 2 D Boundary Element Method (BEM), are carried out to evaluate their acoustic properties in terms of insertion loss.

50|$|The {{barrier is}} a spherical energy shield which {{surrounds}} and protects the player's character from one attack; when hit, the barrier is lost instead of rings or a life.

40|$|Barriers are {{commonly}} used as a control measure to reduce outdoor sound propagation from road traffic noise affecting nearby residential areas. This thesis explores novel numerical techniques and designs of barriers for tailored low frequency noise reduction. Analytical and numerical models of a straight noise barrier are initially presented. The effect of single and multiple sources and their location on barrier insertion loss is described. Elevated sources representing realistic locations of light and heavy vehicle engine and exhaust noise sources are considered. Diffraction over {{the top edge of}} the barrier and reflections from the ground on both the source and receiver sides of the barrier are taken into account. Numerical models of three-dimensional barriers are developed using a quasi-periodic boundary element method (BEM), whereby the barrier is represented by a finite number of periodic sections along its length. Using the quasi-periodic BEM technique, the size of the numerical domain and the computational cost associated with large-scale exterior acoustic models are significantly reduced. The quasi-periodic boundary element method is then implemented to design a three-dimensional barrier with embedded Helmholtz resonators tuned to single or multiple frequencies. Numerical models of <b>sonic</b> crystal <b>barriers</b> developed using both the finite element method and quasi-periodic boundary element method are presented. The acoustic performance of a <b>sonic</b> crystal <b>barrier</b> comprising of locally resonant scatterers is investigated using perforated and C-shaped cylindrical shell scatterers. The effects of the number, size and orientation of the holes in the perforated cylindrical shells, as well as the size of the opening of the C-shaped scatterers and their orientation with respect to the incident plane wave, on the barrier insertion loss are described in detail...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2013. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Vaughan Voller, Miki Hondzo. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 210 pages. The {{objective of this}} research was to investigate the ability of bubble curtain deterrent systems to inhibit the movement of invasive fish. Bubble curtains, which consist of a wall of bubbles (e. g. produced by forcing air through perforated pipes), fall into the category of behavioral deterrent systems that rely on aversive stimuli (e. g. sound and light) to guide fish in taxon specific manners. These systems provide advantages over physical/mechanical screens because they do not restrict fluid flow or negatively impact navigation. Bubble curtains are particularly appealing, because they are less expensive than other electrical or <b>sonic</b> <b>barriers,</b> are easily maintained, safe, and produce complex acoustic and hydrodynamic stimuli which may be optimized to deter fish movement. However, few studies have examined whether or how bubble curtains might work. In three studies, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), a cyprinid responsible for water quality degradation in shallow water ecosystems, was used to investigate how bubble curtains influence fish behavior and might be optimized. First, through a laboratory experiment, two different bubble curtains were shown to reduce passage of common carp by 75 - 80 % in both up- and down-stream directions. These findings also suggested that avoidance behaviors were attributed to fluid motion and sound stimuli. Second, a field test demonstrated that the performance of a bubble curtain under natural conditions was consistent with laboratory results, blocking 57 ± 12 % of downstream swimming carp, versus 75 - 80 % in the laboratory. Third, a fish movement model based on diffusion theory and phonotaxic response was derived. In a novel application, a stability analysis of the fish movement model demonstrated that acoustic stimuli produced by the bubble curtains can be sufficient to disrupt movement (i. e. deter passage) of common carp. Overall, I have shown through rigorous experimental and holistic quantitative analysis that bubble curtains can indeed deter common carp movement, but improvements must be identified in order for bubble curtains to remain a viable management tool in the future...|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} metamaterial made of {{a two-dimensional}} (2 D) periodic array of multi-resonant acoustic scatterers is analysed in this paper. The building blocks consist {{of a combination of}} elastic beams of Low-Density Polyethylene Foam (LDPF) with cavities of known volume. Sound inside the structure can excite elastic resonances of the material as well as acoustic resonances in the cavities producing several attenuation peaks in the low-frequency range. Due to this behaviour at the subwavelength regime we can define this periodic array as a Locally Multi-Resonant Acoustic Metamaterial (LMRAM) presenting strong dispersive characteristics of the effective properties with subwavelength multi-resonant structural units. The results shown in this paper could be use to design effective <b>Sonic</b> Crystal Acoustic <b>Barriers</b> with wide tunable attenuation bands in the low-frequency range...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{presence}} of a finite impedance surface on the wave propagation properties of a two-dimensional periodic array of rigid cylinders with their axes perpendicular to the surface is both numerically and experimentally analyzed in this work. In this realistic situation both the incident and the scattered waves interact with these two elements, the surface and the array. The interaction between the excess attenuation effect, due to the destructive interference produced by the superposition of the incident wave and the reflected one by the surface, and the bandgap, due to the periodicity of the array, is fundamental for the design of devices to control the transmission of waves based on periodic arrays. The most obvious application is perhaps the design of <b>Sonic</b> Crystals Noise <b>Barriers.</b> Two different finite impedance surfaces have been analyzed in the work in order to observe the dependence of the wave propagation properties on the impedance of the surface...|$|R
40|$|The thesis investigates how auralisation and {{qualitative}} research methodologies {{developed in the}} field of soundscape research, may be applied to the issue of environmental noise in urban areas. The project brings together research and assessment methodologies from traditionally distinct areas in acoustics, and attempts to develop a multidisciplinary approach to solving noise related urban design problems. Within this process, the author also explores the theory that part of a sustainable solution to noise annoyance lies in challenging negative attitudes to noise, particularly in urban environments, where attempts to reduce sound pressure levels are either not feasible or inappropriate. To demonstrate the application of the approach, a case-study is presented involving the auralisation and subjective evaluation of a real-world soundscape before and after the insertion of a <b>sonic</b> crystal noise <b>barrier.</b> The results of the case-study suggest that, with minimal adaptation, certain soundscape assessment methodologies are compatible with virtual acoustic environments. This leads to the conclusion that, using the virtual assessment methodology, one is able to predict with reasonable accuracy the impact of various physical types of noise intervention on the perceived sound quality in urban environments prior to their construction. The author also argues that a greater awareness and appreciation for the multiplicity of sound in urban environments might, in conjunction with sustainable noise control strategies, over more long-term benefits to society than over-speculation concerning the adverse effects of noise...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} nearfield airborne pressure signatures from the Lift and Nozzle Change Effect on Tail Shocks (LaNCETS) flight test experiment. The primary motivation for nearfield probing in the supersonic regime is {{to measure the}} shock structure of aircraft in an ongoing effort to overcome the overland <b>sonic</b> boom <b>barrier</b> for commercial supersonic transportation. LaNCETS provides the opportunity to investigate lift distribution and engine plume effects. During Phase 1 flight testing an F- 15 B was used to probe the F- 15 LaNCETS aircraft in order to validate CFD and pre-flight prediction tools. A total of 29 probings were taken at 40, 000 ft. altitude at Machs 1. 2, 1. 4 and 1. 6. LaNCETS Phase 1 flight data are presented as a detailed pressure signature superimposed over {{a picture of the}} LaNCETS aircraft. The attenuation of the Inlet-Canard shocks with distance as well as its forward propagation and the coalescence of the noseboom shock are illustrated. A detailed CFD study on a simplified LaNCETS aircraft jet nozzle was performed providing the ability to more accurately capture the shocks from the propulsion system and emphasizing how under- and over-expanding the nozzle affects the existence of shock trains inside the jet plume. With Phase 1 being a success preparations are being made to move forward to Phase 2. Phase 2 will fly similar flight conditions, but this time changing the aircraft's lift distribution by biasing the canard positions, and changing the plume shape by under- and over-expanding the nozzle. Nearfield probing will again be completed {{in the same manner as}} in Phase 1. An additional presentation focuses on LaNCETS CFD solution methodology. Discussions highlight grid preprocessing, grid shearing and stretching, flow solving and contour plots. Efforts are underway to better capture the flow features via grid modification and flow solution methodology, which will help to achieve better agreement with flight data. An included CD-ROM provides animations of the nearfield probing procedure and of real data from one of the probings integrated with GPS positional and velocity data. An additional in-flight video from the rear seat of the probing aircraft is also provided...|$|R
40|$|Two major hurdles {{associated}} with simulation of exterior acoustic problems are the memory requirement and computation time. A {{vast amount of}} memory is required to simulate and analyse a large 3 D acoustic problem, particularly at high frequencies. Acoustic scattering problems are commonly solved using the boundary element method (BEM). For complex structures, the frequency-dependent BEM coefficient matrices are very large {{and there is little}} {{that can be done to}} alleviate the computational and storage requirements. However, applying the BEM to periodic structures leads to formation of a structured coefficient matrix due to translational invariance of the free-space Green's function. This thesis shows when using the boundary element method to solve 3 D acoustic scattering problems for periodic structures, the coefficient matrix can be represented as a block Toeplitz matrix. By exploiting the Toeplitz structure, the computational time and storage requirements to construct the coefficient matrix are significantly reduced. It is also demonstrated that using the BEM, a multi-directional periodic acoustic problem can be formulated as a multilevel block Toeplitz (MBT) matrix. To ensure fast and stable convergence, the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm is used to solve the MBT matrix. A multi-dimensional discrete Fourier transform is employed in the GMRES method to accelerate the matrix-vector product and to obtain the acoustic pressure. The technique is implemented for a range of acoustic and aeroacoustic applications. To verify and evaluate the efficiency of the periodic BEM technique, the acoustic performance of a <b>sonic</b> crystal <b>barrier</b> with periodicity in one, two or three directions is initially examined. The noise reduction mechanism of a flat plate under flow noise source excitation is investigated by comparing results from unserrated and serrated trailing edges. Flow-induced noise by turbulent flow past a flat plate is also studied using a hybrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) - periodic BEM technique. The hybrid technique is further extended to efficiently predict acoustic scattering with non-uniform potential flow effects for structures with rotational/translational symmetries. The effect of background mean flow on aerodynamic noise from turbulent flow past a circular cylinder is presented, whereby the numerical results obtained from the technique developed in this thesis are validated by comparison with experimental data from literature...|$|R
