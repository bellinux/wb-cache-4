5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, {{but it is not}} usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have <b>some</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Her {{choice to}} {{film in the}} Kingdom met <b>some</b> <b>resistance.</b> In discussion, Bigelow found that her cast and crew shared {{stereotypes}} of the region from American culture. “Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions,” she said. “But once you {{get off the plane}} you realise it's like Manhattan without the trees,” she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, the 4th Parachute Brigade led {{the advance}} inland. By daybreak on 10September, {{they had reached}} Massafra, where they were welcomed by the population. The next town they reached was Mottola, which was still {{occupied}} by the Germans. The Germans put up <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> to the 156th Parachute Battalion's assault, but withdrew soon after. The division's first combat casualties resulted from this action. The wounded were evacuated to Taranto, where the 133rd (Parachute) Field Ambulance had established an 80-bed main dressing station at the Rendinella hospital.|$|E

40|$|Additional {{tests of}} 178 cultivars and lines of soybean against soybean cyst {{nematode}} are reported. Cultivars are available with <b>some</b> level of <b>resistance</b> to races 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 14, but in <b>some</b> cases the <b>resistance</b> level is moderate. No cultivar or line (except possibly PI 437654) has resistance {{to all of the}} races tested. Thirteen cultivars and lines, however, were resistant or moderately resistant to race 1, 14 to race 2, 87 to race 3, 2 to race 4, 3 to race 5, 42 to race 6, 18 to race 9, and 36 to race 14. <b>Some</b> have <b>resistance</b> to more than one race...|$|R

5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
50|$|All these {{fungicides}} are in {{the same}} cross-resistance group (same mode of action) and must be managed carefully to avoid the appearance of fungicide <b>resistance.</b> <b>Some</b> fungicide <b>resistance</b> has been observed in most crops (such {{as in the case of}} wheat powdery mildew), so the application of QoI products should respect effective rates and intervals to provides time and space when the pathogen population is not influenced by the product selection pressure.|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{decision}} to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with <b>some</b> <b>resistance.</b> The National Park Service {{expressed concern that the}} battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have <b>some</b> <b>resistance.</b> They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E

5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% {{of people will}} recover without treatment {{within a few days}} or weeks. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E
5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Four Kings {{were very}} popular in Cuba, and the Japanese media were proud of the {{reputation}} they were bringing to judo and Japan. Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan. There was <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling. In 1913, Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose; in response, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14, 1914.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} political {{division between the}} two emerged during the Georgian Affair. Stalin had suggested that both Georgia and neighbouring countries like Azerbaijan and Armenia should be merged into the Russian state, despite the protestations of their national governments. Lenin saw this {{as an expression of}} Great Russian ethnic chauvinism by Stalin and his supporters, instead calling for these nation-states to join Russia as semi-independent parts of a greater union, which he suggested be called the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. After <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> to the proposal, Stalin eventually accepted it, but – with Lenin's agreement – he changed the name of the newly proposed state to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Lenin sent Trotsky to speak on his behalf at a Central Committee plenum in December, where the plans for the USSR were sanctioned; these plans were then ratified on 30 December by the Congress of Soviets, resulting {{in the formation of the}} Soviet Union. Despite his poor health, Lenin was elected chairman of the new government of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The usurpation, {{which began}} in late March or early April 272, ended by August. Aurelian spent the winter of 271–272 in Byzantium, and {{probably}} crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272. Galatia fell easily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle. All the cities in Asia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor, with only Tyana putting up <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> before surrendering; this cleared the path for Aurelian to invade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland. A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans, followed {{by the rest of}} Egypt by the third week of June. Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria—which, if lost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The vessel, the 800-ton Portuguese carrack Santa Cruz, was {{pursued by}} three of Cumberland's ships. A storm arrived {{and forced the}} English away from the lee shore, but Santa Cruz was beached {{on the coast of}} Corvo. The {{following}} morning, once the storm had passed, the Portuguese who had disembarked set up entrenchments nearby, taking off the cargo and burning the vessel. Burrough immediately dispatched 100 soldiers who waded ashore and easily dispersed those who guarded the shore; after <b>some</b> <b>resistance</b> the site was captured, and the Portuguese fled. The cargo burnt inside the ship although some was salvaged by the English. Prisoners were taken, including the ship's purser and two foreign gunners. Under threat of torture they confessed that within fifteen days, three other carracks would arrive at the island. The fleet of five carracks had departed from Goa and were headed for Lisbon and consisted of the Santa Cruz, Buen Jesus admiral, Madre de Deus, San Bernardo, and San Christophoro. Madre de Deus was the largest of the fleet, a thirty-two gun vessel of 1,600 tons {{and was one of the}} Portuguese crown's greatest and one of the largest sailing ships ever built.|$|E
