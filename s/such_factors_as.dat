5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Richard Maxwell Brown argues in No Duty to Retreat that the Mussel Slough shootout did not fit the mold of the gunfight/hero myth, which usually ignores <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> ideology, and social and economic conflict, thus not implanting it in the lore of the American Old West.|$|E
5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts {{also point out that}} the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the splash dispersal of peridioles {{have shown a}} maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that observed for other Cyathus species. This reduced ejection distance {{may be due to}} <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> the greater size of peridioles, the looser construction of the funiculus, or the increased flaring seen in the upper lip of the splash cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors. Findings of incidence and prevalence in epidemiological studies vary based on <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> which grades of severity are included, whether deaths are included, whether {{the study is}} restricted to hospitalized people, and the study's location. The annual {{incidence of}} mild TBI {{is difficult to determine}} but may be 100–600 people per 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to termite attack; the differences are attributed to <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, borscht's {{popularity}} spread beyond its Slavic homeland, largely due to <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> territorial expansion of the Russian Empire, Russia's growing political clout and cultural stature, and waves of emigration out of the country. As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire, from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran, to Central Asia and China, to Alaska (Russian America).|$|E

5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E
5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ranked wing {{commander}} at {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges {{in his role as}} Director of Technical Services. Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment. He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary group captain, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, motion sickness, decompression and hypoxia.|$|E

Injury, in particular catastrophic injury, is a multi‐factorial event that involves the complex interaction {{of a number of}} risk factors. The effect of each individual factor and its importance can be measured by evaluating its relative risk.|$|R

5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by <b>such</b> <b>factors</b> <b>as</b> drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
