Players are also prompted to cook food after battles {{if they have the}} materials. Cooking recipes determine the benefits received such as health recovery.

5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input and stores a halved value for later use. Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by one bit is performed {{and the result}} <b>subtracted</b> from the magic number 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of the inverse square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E
5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or <b>subtracted</b> until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E

5|$|The {{regional}} ORCA {{card was}} introduced as an integrated smart card for transit {{agencies in the}} Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e-purse web interface. The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare <b>subtracted</b> from the e-purse or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010 a $5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or youth ORCA card. CT removed their paper transfers on January 1, 2010 after the ORCA card made them obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be <b>subtracted</b> from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E
