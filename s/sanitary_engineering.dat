This new science {{included}} the study of [...] "consumer nutrition" [...] and environmental education. This interdisciplinary branch of science was later specialized into what is currently known as ecology, while the consumer nutrition focus split off and was eventually relabeled as home economics., which provided another avenue for women to study science. Richards helped to form the American Home Economics Association, which published a journal, the Journal of Home Economics, and hosted conferences. Home economics departments were formed at many colleges, especially at land grant institutions.

Some of the specific health situations faced by General Draper and his staff were venereal disease, typhus brought about by louse infestations, typhoid fever, malnutrition, and the generally horrific living conditions endured by refugees and many people living under German occupation.|$|E

40|$|Scaling {{is a major}} {{barrier in}} {{increasing}} recovery of RO installations. One of the major unresolved scaling problems in RO is silica scaling. Depending on pH and temperature, the safe operation practice to prevent silica scaling is to keep silica concentration below 150 [mg/l] in the concentrate. In this study, it was investigated whether {{it is possible to}} gain the high recovery and the very high silica concentration by removing divalent ions from the feed water by using ion exchange column. A total recovery of 90 % is achieved without using antiscalant and with constant flux. The results show that in absence of antiscalant and divalent ions, silica concentration of about 280 [mg/l] in concentrate is possible without declining of mass transfer through the membrane. <b>Sanitary</b> EngineeringWatermanagementCivil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R

As a source, for their drinking water production, surface water from the river Meuse is used. Organic micro pollutants (OMPs), although in extremely low concentrations, have occasionally been detected in the river Meuse. Obviously, the presence of OMPs in drinking water is very undesirable. The effect of OMPs on human health, when ingested for a prolonged period of time or as a mixture of compounds, is still unknown. Moreover, the increased media attention for OMPs could lead to a loss of consumers trust in drinking water companies as safe and reliable drinking water producers. As a result, customers might tend to use bottled water instead of tap water which is undesirable from a environmental point of view. <b>Sanitary</b> EngineeringWatermanagementCivil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Iron is {{the primary}} source for {{discolouration}} problems in the drinking water distribution system. The removal of iron from groundwater is a common treatment step {{in the production of}} drinking water. Even when clear water meets the drinking water standards, the water quality in the distribution system can deteriorate due to settling of iron (hydroxide) particles or posttreatment flocculation of dissolved iron. Therefore it is important to remove dissolved and particulate iron to very low levels. The objective {{of this study was to}} reduce the particle load towards the distribution system and to improve the iron removal at the groundwater pumping station Harderbroek, consisting of aeration, rapid sand filtration and tower aeration. A maximum flow of 1800 m 3 /h can be treated and the average production is 800 m 3 /h. Although previous research showed the clear water meets the drinking water regulations, the drinking water company Vitens is not satisfied with the turbidity and iron concentration of the clear water. The mean iron concentration is 0. 04 mg/l. <b>Sanitary</b> EngineeringWatermanagementCivil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R
