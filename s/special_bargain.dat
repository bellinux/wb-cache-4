40|$|This article aims to effectuate a {{paradigm}} shift {{in the way we}} view cases involving pure advantage-taking in contract formation. By ‘pure advantage-taking’ it is meant that D in some sense took ‘unfair advantage of’ a <b>special</b> <b>bargaining</b> weakness or vulnerability that D found ‘ready-made’ in P: D neither caused P’s relevant weakness or vulnerability nor otherwise was legally responsible for relieving it. Certain undue influence and unconscionable dealing cases (for example) fit this scenario perfectly, yet senior Commonwealth courts consistently assert (or imply) that the doctrines of undue influence and unconscionable dealing are ordered, ostensibly exclusively, by a common law precept against interpersonal exploitation, and that judges are, when they invoke those doctrines, responding precisely to that particular concern. It is argued here, however, that the exploitation concept serves, or ought to be seen as serving, no necessary justificatory function in relation to state-assisted rescission or suppression of contracts objectively formed at common law. Instead, a principle of (what I shall call) ‘transactional neglect’ should be seen to eclipse and subsume the exploitation concept as the prevailing justification for interference with apparent contracts in pure ‘unfair advantage’ situations. The advocated shift is thus away from ‘exploitation’ towards ‘transactional neglect’—D’s corrective liability for failure to take reasonable precautions against the risk of foreseeable transactional harm to P, when P and D were, knowingly to D at the time, bargaining under conditions that make ‘exploitation’ possible...|$|R
40|$|In a Living Donor List Exchange program, {{the donor}} makes his kidney {{available}} for allocation to patients on the postmortal waiting-list and receives in exchange a postmortal kidney, usually an O-kidney, {{to be given}} to the recipient he favours. The program can be a solution for a candidate donor who is unable to donate directly or to participate in a paired kidney exchange because of blood group incompatibility or a positive cross-match. Each donation within an LDLE program makes an additional organ available for transplantation. But because most of the pairs making use of the program will be A/O incompatible, it will also tend to increase the waiting time for patients with blood group O, who already have the longest waiting time. It has therefore been objected that the program is materially unjust, because it further disadvantages the least advantaged. This objection appeals to John Rawls’ difference principle. However, the context for which Rawls proposed that difference principle, is significantly different from the present one. Applying the principle here amounts to a lop-sided trade-off between considerations of need and considerations of overall utility. Considerations of formal justice, however, may lead to a stronger objection to LDLE programs. Such a program means that one O-patient on the waiting list is exempted from the application of the general criteria used in constructing the list because he has a <b>special</b> <b>bargaining</b> advantage. This objection is spelled out and weighed against the obvious attraction of LDLE in a situation of (extreme) organ scarcity...|$|R

40|$|The “Nash program” {{initiated}} by Nash (Econometrica 21 : 128 – 140, 1953) {{is a research}} agenda aiming at representing every axiomatically determined cooperative solution to a game as a Nash outcome of a reasonable noncooperative bargaining game. The L-Nash solution first defined by Forgó (Interactive Decisions. Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, vol 229. Springer, Berlin, pp 1 – 15, 1983) is obtained as the limiting point of the Nash bargaining solution when the disagreement point goes to negative infinity in a fixed direction. In Forgó and Szidarovszky (Eur J Oper Res 147 : 108 – 116, 2003), the L-Nash solution {{was related to the}} solution of multiciteria decision making and two different axiomatizations of the L-Nash solution were also given in this context. In this paper, finite bounds are established for the penalty of disagreement in certain <b>special</b> two-person <b>bargaining</b> problems, making it possible to apply all the implementation models designed for Nash bargaining problems with a finite disagreement point to obtain the L-Nash solution as well. For another set of problems where this method does not work, a version of Rubinstein’s alternative offer game (Econometrica 50 : 97 – 109, 1982) is shown to asymptotically implement the L-Nash solution. If penalty is internalized as a decision variable of one of the players, then a modification of Howard’s game (J Econ Theory 56 : 142 – 159, 1992) also implements the L-Nash solution...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that when consumers miss an opportunity to purchase a product for a significantly reduced price, {{they are less likely}} to purchase this product later for its regular price or for a less significantly reduced price. Two possible explanations for this inaction-inertia ef-fect were considered: avoidance of regret (reluctance to purchase the product represents an at-tempt to avoid regret over missing the better price) and price contrast (reluctance to purchase the product results from a simple price comparison process). The results of 3 experiments favored the avoidance-of-regret explanation.

5000|$|Due to the {{mobility}} of the workforce in the construction sector, most jurisdictions set out <b>special</b> rules for <b>bargaining</b> for workers and employers in that sector. In that sector, local unions receive bargaining agent rights for a trade of workers at a single employer, similar to the industrial sector. However, union construction workers and unionized construction employers create provincial or regional bargaining agents with the authority to negotiate one contract that applies to all bargaining units. These regional bargaining units must be certified by the Labour Board of the jurisdiction and in making the decision regarding what group will be certified as the bargaining agent for workers, the Boards will consider which unions have the preponderance of membership in a given trade. This method tends to reinforce the focus of construction sector unions upon the trade(s) {{in which they have}} historic strength and thereby militates against [...] "competition" [...] (i.e.: raiding) between worker organizations—a benefit to both workers and employers of the sector. As a result of the legal framework, a chartered local union within the construction sector will typically have a charter to represent all workers in a specified trade and within a specified region.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. In {{this day}} and age, with the very strong impact of globalisation, {{digitalisation}} and the Web 2. 0, advertising {{as we know it}} is changing. Companies and advertising role players are forced to implement new consumer and business models and apply innovative business strategies. The target audience of tomorrow is the unique generation Y that has developed a personal filtering system against the onslaught of traditional media. The current idea is to try and build customised relationships with future clients from a young age by developing a relationship that complies with their requirements. This study attempts to investigate the opportunities and to match study behaviours and preferences relating to academic media utilised by undergraduate students, with avenues for targeted advertising. A questionnaire was circulated to second-year students (n= 129) at the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University. Their study habits and utilisation of media, as well as their interests in advertising were explored. Descriptive statistics and effect-size factors revealed that due to the stratification of the sample, very little differences were found among the students who were interviewed. No significant conclusions could be drawn from this study. Some trends of interest that were found were the fact that students predominantly use their prescribed books, a customised e-learning platform called eFundi and the internet for their studies. Although they are utilising the broader media such as television, radio, newspapers and cellular telephones, a slight preference towards electronic media seems to be emerging. Important factors to consider are the need for value-for-money, <b>specials</b> and <b>bargains</b> and future planning. This would require further investigation. In conclusion, despite a slight shift towards the electronic media, most of the behaviour and preferences of these students can probably be linked to generational behaviour rather than just a shift in media preferences. It is suggested that the questionnaire be reviewed and the study expanded to a less stratified and more multi-cultural and multi-campus environment. Master...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the interrelationship between {{economic}} development and the impact of industrialization on Newfoundland's construction workers. My starting assumption was that the economic and political had a strong impact on the social. A qualitative case study methodology was used wherein three mega-projects were subjected to examinations to determine what impact the quest for economic development and its resulting industrialization had on workers. A combination of archival research, newspaper and other documentary research was backed up by interviews of by informants, particularly in the third case study. [...] The empirical work focused on explaining the structure of Newfoundland's economy and the impact of the complex intertwinings of the social, political and economic environment on Newfoundland workers. The key shuctura 1 dynamics to understanding the impacts of economic development were found to be the degree and effectiveness of employer support for good labour relations (which often played out in initial support for a union site), the state of the economy, and the role of the government in the project. As the case studies demonstrate, structural properties of class and gender were crucial to understanding the ways in which economic development influenced workers and workplaces. [...] This study is also one of the first to provide an intimate portrait of the life of construction workers in Newfoundland. Examining the daily life on three different construction projects allows the study to determine change over time; and also provides a lens through which we can examine gender relations, occupational health and safety, and labour relations on the projects. This thesis, in providing a theoretically informed discussion of detailed case study material, contributes towards the debate on the role of the government in economic development. Because two of three case studies were legislated within a new set of legal parameters, by <b>special</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> provisions as <b>special</b> projects, the study may also aid our understanding of the relationship between economic development, collective bargaining and the role of the government.

40|$|Multimodal policy between railway and {{airlines}} is {{of importance}} in providing seamless transportation service to inter-regional passengers. However, {{it is difficult}} to make coordination among the railway and airline service suppliers, especially when they are fiercely competing for the share in passenger market in the target OD. Inter-regional transportation in Japan, fierce competitions are observed between Japan Railway companies and airlines, especially after the 1990 fs deregulation of the airline entrance; the number of new air service are parallel to the conventionally profitable railway service. Regardless to railway service improvements such as speed-ups, increase of frequency and <b>special</b> tickets of <b>bargain</b> fares, the number of airline passengers has been increased in the middle to long distant regions, while railway passengers continuously decreased. Such consequence would be brought by the multimodal route which has an airline link as the trunk line, and railway links as the access or egress service, considering inter-regional passenger behaviors. In other words, the improvement of railway service of middle to long distance would simultaneously and inevitably improve the short distant railway service, which can be used as the access line to airport. This phenomenon can be called the spatial externality of railway network. Spatial externality much strongly appears in railway network, comparing to airlines. If the above consideration is valid, inter-regional transportation market would not be efficient without considering the unintended multimodal use. This study purposes to clarify the existence and effects of spatial externality of railway service from investigation of longitudinal change in inter-regional transportation service and demand in Japan. The LOS of multimodal routes are calculated by the k-th shortest path algorithm which gives alternative routes to the shortest. In order to assess the LOS for each OD, the mode choice model is estimated, and passenger utilities of ODs are calculated. The results are aggregated for each distance range of ODs, and compared the LOS improvement measured by estimated utilities with the number of passengers of railway and of airlines. Implications for regional transportation administration are finally made. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} an agency-centered theoretical framework of institutional change at domestic level. It argues that institutional change {{should be understood}} as a conflictual process having two stages: initiation and bargaining. At the first stage, certain internal and external developments help change entrepreneurs mobilize for structural change through mechanisms of power shifts and/or negative feedback (ideational or material). At the second stage, institutional actors simply bargain over alternatives arrangements. However this is a <b>special</b> form of <b>bargaining</b> {{in the sense that it}} takes place within an institutionalized setting. Such a bargaining process is not only a strategic competition over material benefits but also a symbolic contestation among institutional actors over ideational interests (e. g. legitimacy). This {{study provides}} a two dimensional perspective on bargaining within an institutionalized setting by modifying two logics of action: the logic of consequentiality and the logic of appropriateness. This theoretical framework is illustrated by analyzing recent substantial institutional changes in Turkey in two crucial issue areas: civil-military relations and cultural rights (i. e. the Kurdish issue). This study shows that the EU's decision of recognition of Turkey as a candidate state for the EU membership in 1999 was the main trigger which mobilized change entrepreneurs for initiating structural changes. This decision not only empowered pro-change actors but also increased opportunity costs of institutional status quo. However, an intense bargaining between pro-status quo (e. g. nationalists, bureaucratic-military elite) and pro-change actors (e. g. liberals, business groups, and Western oriented domestic groups) preceded these changes. Pro-status quo actors tried to legitimate their position by securitizing reforms (framing reforms as a threat to national security, national unity). As a response, pro-change actors framed changes as further democratization and Westernization in Turkey. The winners of this bargaining process were pro-reform groups because pro-status quo veto players such as the military and the ultranationalist MHP simply failed to block reforms since such an action would cause huge damage to their ideational interests (loss of legitimacy, credibility and prestige as a result of being an obstacle to Turkey's century-old Westernization process) ...|$|R
