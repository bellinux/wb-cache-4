50|$|Salvia lavandulifolia (<b>Spanish</b> <b>sage)</b> {{is a small}} woody {{herbaceous}} perennial {{native to}} Spain and southern France, growing in rocky soil in Maquis shrubland, often found growing with rosemary, Lavandula lanata, and Genista cinerea.|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} {{part of this}} thesis consists of free main chapters: the method for the determination of polyunsaturated fatty acids by gas chromatography; the effect of addition of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Sage</b> seeds {{on the content of}} PUFA n- 3 in the tissues of animals; the effect of EPA and DHA content of blood plasma lipids and fatty acid in the tissues of rats. The aim was to increase the content of PUFA n- 3 in animal tissues improving the ratio of n- 6 /n- 3 fatty acids, and reduced levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels and to raise HDL cholesterol. The experimental part of this work was supported by the IGA. The effect of addition of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Sage</b> seeds on the content of n- 3 PUFA in the tissues of animals was analyzed in quail eggs, chicken meat and free species of insects to qualitative and quantitative analysis of fatty acids. The content of PUFA n- 3 in animal tissues was increased in groups with addition of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Sage</b> seeds in the diet (P < 0, 05). The addition of <b>Spanish</b> <b>sage</b> seeds to feed the animals {{had an impact on the}} sensory properties of their products. The effect of EPA and DHA content of blood lipid levels and fatty acids composition in rat tissues was achieved by the addition of salmon and palm oil to feed animals. The group with the addition of salmon oil in the diet had lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides as compared to the control group and the group with the addition of palm fat in feed (P < 0, 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{knowledge}} about the medicinal properties and marketing possibilities of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sage</b> (Salvia lavandulifolia Vahl.) requires additional studies about the management of this valuable species. To this end, essential oil yields and chemistries from eleven different mother plants collected in the wild and cultivated in a single plot were obtained and monitored during four years (2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014) at three different phenological stages ((LF) leaves formation-vegetative, (FB) full bloom and (SM) seed maturation). Significant differences {{have been found in}} the yield over the phenology being the maximum essential oil production at the stage of SM. Besides, the yield enhanced by both the shortage periods of rainfalls and the plant age with in turn a maximum average yield recorded of 4. 15 % v/w in SM in 2014, {{at the end of the}} experiment. However, no distinction by clonal lines could be made regarding yield. Essential oil chemistry conversely, showed deeply influenced by the genotype from which the material for hydrodistillation was taken. Thus, the main essential oil compound recorded was the oxygenated terpene 1, 8 -cineole (36. 7 % in average value for whole experiment), with other accompanying important components such as α-pinene (7. 8 %), β-pinene + myrcene (14. 5 %), limonene (6. 2 %) and camphor (7. 1 %). Besides, unlike the yield, essential oil chemistry was only partially influenced by the year of harvest with no relevant changes according to the phenological stage of the plant. Thus, phytochemical differences found in nature in the first place largely and even wider remain when plant growing under a common environment. Hence, some new and stable chemotypes were described according to their high values of α-pinene (> 10 %), limonene (> 17 %), 1, 8 -cineole (> 50 %), camphor (> 20 %) and β-caryophyllene (> 7 %). This information is highly relevant for standardizing, assuring crop quality and for the proper management of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sage</b> cultivation...|$|E
50|$|In the Philippines, picadillo is a soupy dish {{traditionally}} {{made with}} ground beef and either potatoes or chayote. There are also drier {{versions of the}} dish. It is also called giniling, Tagalog for ground meat. What Cubans call picadillo is known as Arroz a la Cubana to Filipinos. The Philippine version is similar to normal Latino picadillo usually made with raisins, tomato sauce and diced potatoes added, but without green olives and capers, and is often served with white rice, fried plantains (maduros in <b>Spanish,</b> <b>saging</b> na saba in Filipino) on the side, and a fried egg on top. Boiled eggs are also eaten with the dish.|$|R

40|$|In Valencia Region (Spain), {{some wild}} and {{cultivated}} sages {{are used for}} medicinal purposes. Among them, Salvia officinalis subsp. lavandulifolia (SL) is widely employed and known for production of <b>Spanish</b> <b>sage</b> oil and herbal products. Nevertheless, it shares the market with S. blancoana subsp. mariolensis (SB) and, to a lesser extent, with their hybrid S. x hegelmaieri (SH). The knowledge on these two species is far low and confusion between them is possible. The aim of the present paper {{is to improve the}} ethnopharmacological, morphological and chemical knowledge of these sages, and to contribute to setting up quality specifications for improving identification and distinction from other Salvia species, such as, S. officinalis subsp. officinalis, S. x auriculata and S. microphylla var. microphylla. Samples were collected in Valencia Region and surrounding mountain areas during the ethnopharmacological field work. Twenty-nine medicinal uses were reported for SL, 13 of them being also recorded for SB. Of particular interest is a homemade liquor, used as digestive and known as “salvieta,” which is mainly prepared with SB. The macro- and microscopic characters are insufficient for identification of cut, crushed or powdered material. The study of the essential oil and a HPTLC (High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography) fingerprint of their extracts could help to distinguish SB from the other sages. The essential oil from dried aerial parts of SB (content: 1. 8 – 4. 5 %) was characterized by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) showing a composition close to that currently accepted for <b>Spanish</b> <b>sage</b> essential oil in the European Pharmacopoeia, ISO (International Standard Organization) and UNE (Una Norma Española) standards, with 1, 8 -cineole (13. 7 – 45. 7 %) and camphor (12. 1 – 28. 6 %) as major constituents. HPTLC methods, based on the analysis of hydroalcoholic and dichloromethane extracts, allowed to distinguish SB from other Salvia taxa currently found in Valencia region, except from its hybrid SH. This interdisciplinary study, that combines popular knowledge with botany and chemistry, allows to identify the raw herbal material from SB and to distinguish it from other Salvia species, ensuring a proper commercialization as herbal teas or for the preparation of spirits. This work had the financial support through the Borsa d'Estudi Països Catalans of the Institute for Catalan Studies to VM, and the financial support from an ERASMUS Internship (FsTRASBO 48) to EH...|$|E
