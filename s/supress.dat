Campbell's own position was somewhat undermined when he instigated Argyll's Rising, against the reign of James VII. The loyalty of subsequent Campbell leaders ensured the Campbells retained possession of Duart (indeed, {{it was only after}} the Campbells sold it, and it had spent a century under other owners, that the MacLeans were able to recover it, by purchase). Under Campbell pressure, shrieval authority was established under the sheriff of Argyll, which they controlled.|$|E

5000|$|P. hermaphrodita was {{developed}} into a natural molluscicide to prevent crop damage from horticultural slug pests from the families Arionidae, Milacidae, Agriolimacidae, Limacidae [...] and Vaginulidae. P. hermaphrodita is the only nematode of the eight families associated with molluscs, which has been developed as a biological molluscicide, first released under the name Nemaslug® by MicroBio Ltd in 1994, then acquired by Becker Underwood in 2000 and finally taken over by BASF in 2012. Nemaslug® is sold in 15 European countries and is widely used by farmers and gardeners. It can only kill slugs and snails and does not harm non-target organisms like earthworms, insects & acarids. Other methods of slug control include chemical molluscicides such as metaldehyde, iron phosphate and carbamate compounds (Methiocarb and Thiodicarb) {{have been shown to}} cause damage to many beneficial/non-beneficial non-target organisms including mammals.P. hermaphrodita is currently mass produced in fermenters (up to 20,000 litres) in a monoxenic liquid broth of the bacterium Moraxella osloensis. In the fields, P. hermaphrodita is applied at 3 x 109 nematodes per ha. Nemaslug® {{has been found to be}} successful at reducing agricultural damage from slug in crops such as Winter wheat, lettuce, rapeseed, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, asparagus [...] and others. Even though Nemaslug® takes longer (1-3 weeks) to kill slugs than chemical molluscicides, it has been shown to be equally or more effective at killing slugs. An added advantage to P. hermaphrodita is its ability to strongly <b>supress</b> feeding of infected slugs [...] and to deter non-infected slugs away from treated soil.|$|E

Administration of fentanyl and clonidine is one way {{that can be used}} to reduce the cardiovascular response. This study aimed to prove the differences between the administration of fentanyl 2 μg/kg and clonidine 3 μg/kg intravenously in reducing cardiovascular response due to laryngoscopy and intubation. Method : A retrospective observational study with cross sectional design. Data derived from secondary data with a sample of 48 patients. Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into 2 groups. In the group 1 given fentanyl 2 μg/kg intravenously and group 2 given clonidine 3 μg/kg intravenously. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded in the 1 st, 3 rd, and 5 th minutes after intubation. Data analysis using SPSS 15 for Windows. Result : In the 1 st, 3 rd, and 5 th minutes after intubation showed significant differences in systolic blood pressure (p 0. 05). Conclusion : There is a difference between administration of fentanyl 2 μg/kg and clonidine 3 μg/kg intravenously in <b>supressing</b> blood pressure.

The aim {{of this research was}} to improve the effect of Porterweed leaf extract to the TNF-Î± level and considered the optimum dosage in wistar rats with chronic infl ammation model. Twenty fi ve rats was divided into negative control group, positive control group, and treatment groups with dosage 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg BW. Data obtained through microscopical histologic observation on aortic organ after immunohistochemistry staining and was analyzed descriptively. The result revealed that Porterweed leaf extract is able to inhibit the increasing of TNF-Î± level. This phytochemical substance is predicted capable of preventing the oxidation reaction progession of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) to produce prostaglandins. The decreasing of prostaglandin level causes a negative feedback to TNF-Î± production and iniciating the declining level of TNF-Î±.
