40|$|BACKGROUND Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) {{nowadays}} is {{a commonly}} used treatment for patients suffering from severe osteoarthritis. The success of TKA {{is influenced by}} a complex interaction between the bony anatomy, the geometry of the components and the soft tissue balancing. Valgus angle subtended between the mechanical and anatomical axis of femur {{is one of the}} major factors influencing the alignment of implants. The objective of this study is to determine the variation of this valgus angle using a <b>scannogram</b> in patients with severe osteoarthritis presenting for TKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS 150 consecutive patients of osteoarthritis of the knee joint presenting for total knee arthroplasty participated in our study. All patients underwent a preoperative <b>scannogram,</b> the mechanical and anatomical axis were drawn and the valgus angle was measured on the PACS (picture archiving and communication system) software. RESULTS The mean age of patients undergoing TKA was 63. 62 ± 8. 38 years. Although, the mean valgus angle for the patients was 6. 009 ± 0. 89 degrees, only 45 (30...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the results of open wedge high tibial osteotomy with using an Aescula open wedge plate and an allogenic bone graft as a surgical technique for the {{patients who suffer from}} osteoarthritis of the knee with a genu varum deformity. Methods: From March 2007 to August 2007, 33 patients (37 cases) with osteoarthritis of the knee and a genu varum deformity underwent a high tibial osteotomy with using an Aescula open wedge plate and an allogenic bone graft. The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. Before and after surgery, the correction angle of the genu varum was measured by the lower extremity <b>scannogram</b> and the posterior tibial slope, the joint space distance and the time to bone union were evaluated. The functional factors were evaluated using the Knee Society Score. Results: The average knee score and function score improved from 52. 19 ± 11. 82 to 92. 49 ± 5. 10 and 52. 84 ± 6. 23 to 89. 05 ± 5. 53, respectively (p < 0. 001). According to the lower extremity <b>scannogram,</b> the mean preoperative varus angle was- 1. 86 ± 2. 76 °, and the average correction angle at the last follow-up was 10. 93 ± 2. 50 ° (p < 0. 001). The tibial posterior slope before surgery and at the last follow-up were 8. 20 ± 1. 80 ° and 8. 04 ± 1. 30 °, respectively (p = 0. 437). The joint space distance increased from 4. 05 ± 1. 30 mm to 4. 83 ± 1. 33 mm (p < 0. 001). The average time to complete bone union was 12. 69 ± 1. 5 weeks. Conclusions: An open wedge high tibial osteotomy using an Aescula open wedge plate and an allogeneic bone graft to treat osteoarthritis of the knee with a genu varum deformity showed good results for the precision of the correction angle, the time t...|$|E
