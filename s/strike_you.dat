That's all that counts." [...] Conversely, Doby was criticized from players both active and retired. Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said, after watching Doby play one time in 1947: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{when the}} voice actors for The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{requesting}} additional income, The Scotsman cited a quote by Homer from the episode: [...] "If you don't like your job, you don't <b>strike.</b> <b>You</b> just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American Way." [...] The Scotsman asserted [...] "Homer would not approve" [...] of the strike by the voice actors. The voice actors were asking for an increase from US$125,000 to $360,000 per episode. The same quote by Homer to Lisa was cited by Michael Schneider in Daily Variety, who wrote: [...] "...insiders note that the actors work just six to seven hours to voice an episode—which would mean $ 360,000 for a day's work, a figure that even Everybody Loves Raymond star Ray Romano doesn't match." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{price of}} VVVVVV {{when it was}} {{originally}} released was $15. [...] This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's [...] "one unfortunate barrier" [...] to entry: [...] "While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off." [...] Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost [...] "does <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> as a lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that [...] "it is worth the money". [...] Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV {{has been reduced to}} $5. [...] On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, [...] "I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people".|$|E

500|$|Point System - Depending on the {{character}} and LARP, your PC will {{have some form of}} Body and/or Armor that is measured nominally. Weapons also have a numerical value assigned, where upon a successful weapon <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> deal 'damage' equal to the number associated with your weapon type. This damage is dealt against your opponents Body/Armor. Typically, once you reach 0 body or less, you then begin the death stage which will be found in the [...] A subset of the point system is the Location System, where points vary depending on where your opponent is struck. If they are wearing armor in that location, then the 'damage dealt' effects their Armor Points (AP), versus if you strike a location without armor you deal damage against your opponents Body Points (BP). The majority of LARP's utilize this system.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, {{writing in}} the New York Daily News, stated {{that the idea of}} putting Monk in New York [...] "sound great" [...] on paper but it did not take {{advantage}} of what could be [...] "a delightful study in contrasts." [...] Bianculli called it a [...] "misstep", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it [...] "too outrageous." [...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers {{go out of their way}} to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> as altogether shopworn." ...|$|E

To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor!

2500|$|Dutch manners {{are open}} and direct with a no-nonsense attitude; informality {{combined}} with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, [...] "Their directness gives many {{the impression that they}} are rude and crude — attributes they prefer to call 'openness.'" [...] A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is [...] "Dealing with the Dutch" [...] from Jacob Vossestein: [...] "Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status." [...] As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. [...] "What may <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather." [...] That attitude of honesty explains how the Dutch accept each person as he or she is, because it is what the Dutch society asks so everyone is gelukkig ("happy").|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Stephen Frears read The Damned Utd while {{travelling}} to the Venice Film Festival. He {{enjoyed the}} book and talked with The Queen producer Andy Harries about it. He then sent it to Peter Morgan, with whom he also worked on The Queen, {{on the eve of}} that film's premiere in Venice; Morgan read it by the next morning. Morgan enjoyed it, stating, [...] "It deals with themes I love: Alcoholism and self-destruction and psychotic male competitiveness and treachery." [...] Development of the project continued through February 2007, when BBC Films executive producer Christine Langan, another producer of The Queen, became involved. Frears had Michael Sheen in mind for Clough right from the start. Sheen had appeared in three other Frears projects: Mary Reilly, The Deal and The Queen. He was chosen because of his physical resemblance to Clough. When Frears suggested to Sheen that he play the part, Sheen [...] "rolled his eyes and burst into a wonderful impersonation" [...] of Clough. Sheen said Clough was [...] "one of those people who's decided he's going to shape {{the rest of the world}} in his image.
