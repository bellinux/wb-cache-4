5|$|Newly issued Irish {{postage stamps}} are {{available}} from the Philatelic Bureau of An Post in the Dublin, General Post Office. Commemorative and <b>special</b> <b>issue</b> stamps are usually available for one year from the date of issue. Until the mid-1960s the Irish stamp-issuing policy was very conservative, with only a few new ones each year; up to four or five commemoratives, usually of two values, plus the occasional updated, or new, definitives. During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, on 28 June 1938 {{the judge}} gave a {{sentence}} of one month– equal to the time PahWongso had served– and he was released. PahWongso appealed the court sentence, calling for an acquittal; in August 1938 his sentence {{was reduced to a}} 25-cent fine.

However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited <b>special</b> <b>issue</b> of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E

Indeed, we believe that service-focused implications of new information technologies and e-commerce are only beginning to command research attention in proportion to their economic importance.
