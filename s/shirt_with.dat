5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> a horizontal red and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and white kit.

50|$|Founded in 1919, {{the club}} {{currently}} plays in Segunda División B - Group 1, holding home games at Estadio da Malata.

5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, {{was made of}} a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. Birmingham have only worn stripes on their home shirt once; in 1999 they wore a blue <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.|$|E

The partnership saw a portion of kit sale revenue being donated to Breast Cancer Care.

5|$|The club's home kit {{has always}} {{consisted}} of a black-and-white vertically striped <b>shirt,</b> <b>with</b> black shorts and white or black socks. The width of {{the black and white}} stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits, dedicated to the fans.|$|E

5|$|The club's third kit {{is often}} all-blue, this was most {{recently}} the case during the 2014–15 season. Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons {{and once in}} 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06. From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from 2008–09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967–68 European Cup success.|$|E
5|$|The first {{club was}} founded as Naples Foot-Ball & Cricket Club in 1904 by English sailor William Poths and his {{associate}} Hector M. Bayon.

The name of the club was shortened to Naples Foot-Ball Club in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2006 World Cup, Kinský {{signed a}} {{contract}} extension {{to stay at the}} club for another three years. He was named the best goalkeeper of the Russian Football Premier League in 2007. He kept his 100th top division clean sheet in a match against Tomsk in September 2008, becoming the 17th Czech goalkeeper to reach this figure. In October 2008, Kinský was offered the chance to move to Chelsea to be the backup goalkeeper for Petr Čech, an offer which he rejected. In November 2010 Kinský played his 200th competitive match for the club. Before the last game of the 2010 season, he was presented with a football <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> the number 201 on it, intended to represent the number of games he had played for the club. However, due to injury Kinský was unable {{to take part in the}} match, so 200 was his actual number of competitive appearances. He left Saturn upon the expiry of his contract in December 2010.|$|E
