5000|$|<b>Sendzimir</b> <b>process</b> (named after Tadeusz Sendzimir) {{is used to}} {{galvanize}} a steel strip by using {{a small amount of}} aluminum in the zinc bath and producing a coating with essentially no iron-zinc alloy. The process guarantees high resistance and durability characteristics. About 75% of hydrogen was needed in the original <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>process</b> but all the newer nonoxidizing methods of degreasing require only 7 - 15%.|$|E
50|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the world's {{galvanized}} steel production went through the <b>Sendzimir</b> <b>process</b> by the early 1980s. Poland, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada purchased his steel mills and technologies over the years. Most notably, Sendzimir was a major financial and personal supporter of the Kościuszko Foundation, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America and Alliance College in Pennsylvania. Sendzimir died after a massive stroke and was buried by his family in a zinc-plated coffin made according to his design.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} ModelPredictive Control (MPC) and more precisely three ofits most popular algorithms, Dynamic Matrix Control(DMC), Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) andPredictive Functional Control (PFC) for the controlof a <b>Sendzimir</b> steel mill <b>process.</b> A comprehensiveprocess overview, is given along with a detaileddescription of a Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) model, representing the system. The mill model is thenmanipulated to suit the three MPC configurations. The obtained full decoupled models are approximatedby first orders transfer functions and embeddedwithin the controller formulation in both the originaland the simplified forms, thus obtained two PFCcontrol strategies. Finally the model is put on aControlled Auto-Regressive and Integrated MovingAverage (CARIMA) on order to develop the MIMOGPC controller. Later, all MPC performances arecompared to a benchmark PID response, taking intoaccount the process input constraints...|$|R
40|$|Previously, {{researchers}} {{investigated the}} mechanism of surface defect evolution in rolling. It was highlighted how the lubricant plays an essential role for the final strip surface quality. In some cases the lubricant can be entrapped in pits or in other defects where hydrostatic pressure tends to prevent its elimination; however, when some favorable conditions are satisfied, the lubricant can be drawn out by hydrodynamic actions and defects can be recovered. This mechanism {{has been described as}} microplastohydrodynamic lubrication (MPHL) and recent studies report a suitable parameter (the ratio of the oil drawn out from the pit to the initial pit volume) as MPHL characterization coefficient. The present paper deals with the recovery of isolated surface defects in the <b>Sendzimir</b> rolling <b>process</b> of AISI 304 stainless steel; the analyses have been conducted on two rolling conditions, which although quite similar, regularly showed opposite capability of defect recovery, moreover, with a trend that is in contrast with the predictions made by standard MPHL. Two effects, which are usually ignored in literature modeling, have been considered in this work: The former is the back-tension, which has relevant outcome on the contact pressure and the latter is the position of the neutral point, which cannot be assumed to lie {{at the end of the}} roll bite. The analytical treatment was supported by FEM simulations, which permitted to put realistic data into the MPHL equations, thus, to explain the experimental behavior. The analysis was then validated with two further rolling schedules that seem to confirm the proposed approach. Copyright © 2011 by ASME...|$|R
