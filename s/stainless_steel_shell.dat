It was equipped with a parallax correcting viewfinder, which was coupled to a Cooke triplet type Minostigmat 15mm f/3.5 lens. The lens was capable of focusing as close as 20cm, and, due to its small image size, provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary. The maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity. In front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter, which was itself protected by a window.

The Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) is developing this Type B package for the shipment of tritium, replacing the outdated LP- 50 shipping container. Regulatory accident resistance requirements for Type B packages, including this new tritium package, are specified in 10 CFR 71 (NRC 1983). The regulatory requirements include a 9 -meter free drop onto an unyielding target, a 1 -meter drop onto a mild steel punch, and a 30 -minute 800 {degrees} C fire test. Impact limiters are used to protect the package in the free-drop accident condition in any impact orientation without hindering the package`s resistance to the thermal accident condition.

Proper prebond surface preparation is critical in order to obtain an acceptable adhesive bond. Improperly treated surfaces will exhibit decreased bond strength and durability, especially in metallic bonds where interface are susceptible to degradation due to heat and moisture. Most treatments for titanium and stainless steel alloys require the use of strong chemicals to etch and clean the surface. This processes are difficult to perform due to limited processing facilities as well as safety and environmental risks and they do not consistently yield optimum bond durability. Boeing Phantom Works previously developed sol-gel surface preparations for titanium alloys using a PETI- 5 based polyimide adhesive. In support of part of NASA Glenn Research Center, UDRI and Boeing Phantom Works evaluated variations of this high temperature sol-gel surface preparation, primer type, and primer cure conditions on the adhesion performance of titanium and stainless steel using Cytec FM 680 - 1 polyimide adhesive. It was also found that a modified cure cycle of the FM 680 - 1 adhesive, i. e., 4 hrs at 370 F in vacuum + post cure, significantly increased the adhesion strength compared to the manufacturer's suggested cure cycle.

Very small fractions of Cs- 137 (< 2 E- 5), Cs- 134 (< 1 e- 5), and Eu- 154 (< 4 e- 4) were detected outside of the fuel compacts. Additionally, the distribution of select fission products in some of the components including the fuel compacts and the graphite holders were measured and will be discussed...|$|E
5000|$|In 1963 the {{financial}} {{condition of the}} Pennsylvania and Reading Railroads was such that neither was able to upgrade their money losing commuter operations on their own. As a result {{state and local government}} stepped in to purchase new cars that would be in turn used by the private railroads to run the required commuter operations through an entity known as the Passenger Service Improvement Corporation. [...] The new cars would be a production order based on 6 1958 Pioneer III type cars with improvements based on the lessons learned from the earlier design. [...] A total of 38 cars were purchased for the PRR with the remaining 17 going to the Reading. While some referred to the new vehicles as [...] "PSIC Cars", the modern <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> body <b>shells</b> quickly defined the fleet and the name [...] "Silverliner" [...] was soon adopted.|$|R
40|$|For the {{containment}} post accident {{monitoring and control}} system, the applicant stated that the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> hydrogen monitor pumps, filter housings, valves, piping, tubing, fittings, and orifices; carbon steel tubing and fittings; aluminum pump casings; brass piping and fittings and copper tubing and fittings are exposed to air/gas. As discussed in Table 3. 3 - 7 of the LRA, for these items exposed to air/gas there is no aging effect. For the post accident sampling system <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> cooler <b>shells,</b> covers and tube coils exposed only to treated water, loss of material is the applicable aging effect. There are no aging effects for containment post accident monitoring and control system components exposed to external environments on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> aluminum, brass or copper. For valves, piping, fittings, and tubing made of carbon steel, which are exposed to an "indoor not air-conditioned, " containment air environment, or borated water leaks, the applicable aging effect is loss of material. For carbon steel bolting that is exposed to borated water leaks, the aging effect is loss of mechanical closure integrity. Based on the description of {{the containment}} post-accident monitoring and control system components in the internal and external environments, and the materials used in the fabricatio...|$|R
30|$|The {{precursor}} {{mung bean}} husk used for preparation of activated carbon was purchased from Durgapur (India) local market. Distilled water {{was used to}} wash MBH several times followed by drying to obtain the desired precursor. In {{the first step of}} operation in a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> cylindrical <b>shelled</b> furnace chamber, the precursor was gradually carbonized with the rate of heating of 55 Â Â°C per 15 Â min at 550 Â Â°C for 1 Â h. After carbonization, temperature was heated up to 650 Â Â°C into the furnace chamber and superheated steam was introduced at a pressure of 1.5 â€“ 2.0 Â kgÂ cmâˆ’ 2 for 1 Â h for activation of carbon (Mondal et al. 2015). The prepared activated carbon was then placed to desiccators to cool down to room temperature. Characterization of the sorbent was done properly using different instrumental techniques such as SEM, BET, FTIR and point of zero charge.|$|R
