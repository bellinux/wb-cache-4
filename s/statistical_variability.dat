40|$|Key words: {{constrained}} sintering; coatings and films; crack; material point method. Abstract. The sintering of {{thin films}} {{is widely used}} for surface coatings and because of its technological importance has generated extensive research interest. During the sintering process, the thin film is constrained by the substrate, which generates considerably high levels of stresses. Crackings are often observed and are considered {{as one of the}} major problems of the surface coating technique. This paper has proposed a new numerical method in order to tackle the traditional difficulties in simulating multi-crackings during constrained sintering. Main features of the present method include: (i) the material data is represented by an anisotropic constitutive law, (ii) a new numerical scheme is developed for the crack initialization and growth based on the material point method, (iii) the 3 D viscous film shrinkage model is solved by using a dynamic FE scheme, and (iv) the random nature of the initial green body density is represented by <b>statistical</b> <b>variabilities.</b> It is shown that the model proposed by the present paper is capable for the nucleation and propagation of multi-cracks in a straightforward manner. Cracking patterns are shown to be consistent with experimental understandings. The focus of the paper is on the numerical issues and demonstrating the capacity of the model. 1...|$|R
50|$|Consider fitting a {{straight}} line for the relationship of an outcome variable y to a predictor variable x, and estimating {{the slope of the}} line. <b>Statistical</b> <b>variability,</b> measurement error or random noise in the y variable cause uncertainty in the estimated slope, but not bias: on average, the procedure calculates the right slope. However, variability, measurement error or random noise in the x variable causes bias in the estimated slope (as well as imprecision). The greater the variance in the x measurement, the closer the estimated slope must approach zero instead of the true value.|$|E

50|$|In {{defining}} hazard, {{whether it}} be of natural or anthropogenic origin, Keith Smith argues that what may {{be defined as a}} natural hazard is not in fact a hazard unless there is the presence of humans to make it a hazard and that it is merely an event of scientific interest. In this sense the environmental conditions we may consider hostile or hazardous can really be seen as neutral in that it is our perception, human location and actions which identify resources and hazards with the range of natural events. In this regard human sensitivity to environmental hazards is a combination of both physical exposure (natural and/or technological events at a location related to their <b>statistical</b> <b>variability)</b> and human vulnerability (in regard to social and economic tolerance of the same location).|$|E

50|$|Data {{assimilation}} periodically {{adjusts the}} model state to incorporate new data using statistical methods. Because fire is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, {{such as the}} ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) do not work well. <b>Statistical</b> <b>variability</b> of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, {{which tend to be}} preceded or accompanied by large spatial gradients. In order to ease this problem, the regularized EnKF penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of linear combinations of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The morphing EnKF combines the ideas of data assimilation with image registration and morphing to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of artificial light curves with known <b>statistical</b> and <b>variability</b> properties {{is of great}} importance in astrophysics. Consolidating the confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding the artefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits for future observatories {{are just some of}} the applications of simulated data sets. Currently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomisation is able to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying power spectral density (PSD) but which are strictly Gaussian distributed. This restriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curves e. g. active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts show strong deviations from Gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their light curves yielding long-tailed probability distribution functions (PDFs). In this study we propose a simple method which is able to precisely reproduce light curves which match both the PSD and the PDF of either an observed light curve or a theoretical model. The PDF can be representative of either the parent distribution or the actual distribution of the observed data, depending on the study to be conducted for a given source. The final artificial light curves contain all of the <b>statistical</b> and <b>variability</b> properties of the observed source or theoretical model i. e. same PDF and PSD, respectively. Within the framework of Reproducible Research, the code, together with the illustrative example used in this manuscript, are both made publicly available in the form of an interactive Mathematica notebook.

40|$|As feature sizes shrink, random {{fluctuations}} gain importance in semiconductor manufacturing and integrated circuit design. Therefore, <b>statistical</b> device <b>variability</b> {{has to be}} considered in circuit design and analysis to properly estimate their impact and avoid expensive over-design. Statistical MOSFET compact modeling is required to accurately capture marginal distributions of varying device parameters and to preserve their statistical correlations. Due to limited simulator capabilities, variables are often assumed to be normally distributed. Although correlations may be captured using Principal Component Analysis, such an assumption may be inaccurate. As an alternative, Nonlinear Power Models have been proposed. Since we see some limitations in this approach, we analyze whether the multivariate Generalized Lambda Distribution is an alternative for statistical device modeling. Applying both approaches to extracted statistical device parameters, we conclude that both methods do not differ significantly in accuracy, but the multivariate Generalized Lambda Distribution is more general and less computationally expensive...|$|R
