40|$|A correct {{description}} {{of the evolution of}} moisture concn. profiles in shrinking materials is complicated by the influence of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> mass transfer. <b>Shrinkage</b> has to be accounted for in the diffusion equation. Simulations have been performed for three types of shrinkage: isotropic, unidirectional and no shrinkage. Since many materials show isotropic shrinkage behavior, unidirectional and no shrinkage should be considered as approxns. of the actual material behavior.

40|$|Abstract. Soft wavelet {{shrinkage}} {{and total}} variation (TV) denoising are two frequently used techniques for denoising signals and images, while preserving their discontinuities. In this paper {{we show that}} – under specific circumstances – both methods are equivalent. First we prove that 1 -D Haar wavelet <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> a single scale is equivalent to a single step of TV diffusion or regularisation of two-pixel pairs. Afterwards we show that wavelet <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> multiple scales {{can be regarded as}} a single step diffusion filtering or regularisation of the Laplacian pyramid of the signal. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Bayesian variant of global vector autoregressive (B-GVAR) models to forecast an international set of {{macroeconomic and financial}} variables. We propose a set of hierarchical priors and compare the predicive performance of B-GVAR models in terms of point and density forecasts for one-quarter-ahead and four-quarter-ahead forecast horizons. We find that forecasts can be improved by employing a global framework and hierarchical priors which induce country-specific degrees of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> the coefficients of the GVAR model. Forecasts from various B-GVAR specifications tend to outperform forecasts from a naive univariate model, a global model without <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> the parameters and country-specific vector autoregressions...|$|R

40|$|Soft wavelet shrinkage, total {{variation}} (TV) diffusion, total variation regularization, and a dynamical {{system called}} SIDEs are four useful techniques for discontinuity preserving denoising of signals and images. In this paper we investigate under which circumstances these methods are equivalent in the 1 -D case. First we prove that Haar wavelet <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> a single scale {{is equivalent to}} a single step of space-discrete TV diffusion or regularization of two-pixel pairs. In the translationally invariant case we show that applying cycle spinning to Haar wavelet <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> a single scale {{can be regarded as}} an absolutely stable explicit discretization of TV diffusion. We prove that space-discrete TV difusion and TV regularization are identical, and that they are also equivalent to the SIDEs system when a specific force function is chosen. Afterwards we show that wavelet <b>shrinkage</b> <b>on</b> multiple scales can be regarded as a single step diffusion filtering or regularization of the Laplacian pyramid of the signal. We analyse possibilities to avoid Gibbs-like artifacts for multiscale Haar wavelet shrinkage by scaling the thesholds. Finally we present experiments where hybrid methods are designed that combine the advantages of wavelets and PDE / variational approaches. These methods are based on iterated shift-invariant wavelet shrinkage at multiple scales with scaled thresholds...|$|R
