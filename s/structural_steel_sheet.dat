40|$|A {{series of}} column tests on cold-formed steel {{built-up}} closed sections with intermediate stiffeners {{is presented in}} this paper. The test specimens were first brake pressed from <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> to form open sections with intermediate web stiffeners, then two of the open sections were connected at their flanges using self-tapping screws to form the built-up closed sections. The high strength <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> had the measured 0. 2 % proof stress up to 586 MPa. Initial and overall geometric imperfections as well as material properties and residual stresses of the test specimens were measured. Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that column curves could be obtained. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the direct strength method in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Three different methods were used to obtain the local and distortional buckling stresses for the calculation of the direct strength method. Reliability analysis was performed to assess {{the reliability of the}} direct strength method on cold-formed steel built-up closed section columns. It is shown that the direct strength method using single section to obtain the buckling stresses is generally conservative. © 2008 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The report {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} test strengths and the behaviour of cold-formed lipped channel columns compressed between fixed ends and pinned ends. It is well-known that local buckling of pin-ended channel columns induces overall bending of the section. However, this phenomenon does not occur in fixed-ended channel columns which remain straight after local buckling until overall buckling occurs. Consequently, local buckling has a fundamentally different effect on the behaviour of pin-ended and fixed-ended channel columns. A series of tests was performed on lipped channels brake-pressed from zinc-coated Grade G 450 <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Two different cross-section geometries were tested at various lengths which involved pure local buckling, distortional buckling as well as overall flexural buckling and flexural-torsional buckling. The different effects of local buckling on the behaviour of fixed-ended and pin-ended channels are investigated by comparing strengths, load-shortening, load-deflection, load-end-rotation and load-end-moment curves, as well as longitudinal profiles of buckling deformations. Detailed measurements of geometric imperfections, material properties and residual stresses were conducted. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometry}} of angle sections is simple, but the behaviour and design calculations of angle sections {{can be quite}} complicated. Furthermore, lipped angle sections with unequal flange widths form a non-symmetric section and the behaviour of the section is even more complicated than a singly-symmetric angle section with equal flange widths. A test program on cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns is presented. The non-symmetric angle sections were brake-pressed from high strength <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> having nominal yield stresses of 450 and 550 MPa with plate thicknesses of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 1. 9  mm. The material properties of the column specimens were obtained by tensile coupon tests. The behaviour and strengths of cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns were investigated. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification {{for the design of}} cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>structural</b> members.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the behaviour of cold-formed plain and lipped channel columns compressed between fixed and pinned ends is presented in this paper. It is shown experimentally that local buckling does not induce overall bending of fixed-ended singly symmetric columns, as it does of pin-ended singly symmetric columns. Consequently, local buckling has a fundamentally different effect on the behaviour of pin-ended and fixed-ended singly symmetric columns. In order to show this fundamental different effect caused by local buck-ling, {{a series of tests}} was performed on plain and lipped channels brake-pressed from high strength <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Four different cross-section geometries were tested over a range of lengths which involved pure local buckling, distortional buckling as well as overall flexural buckling and flexural-torsional buckling.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of cold-formed steel channels with complex stiffeners subjected to pure axial compression for fixed-ended columns. The complex stiffeners {{of the channel}} sections consist of simple lips with return lips. A total of 30 column specimens were tested. The specimens were brake pressed from high strength zinc-coated <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Four different cross sections with different flange slenderness were tested over a range of column lengths. Detailed measurements of material properties, geometric imperfections, and local buckling loads of the specimens were conducted. Interaction of local and overall buckling was observed in the tests. Failure modes include local buckling, distortional buckling, and flexural-torsional buckling. The test strengths of the columns are compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Design column curves are also plotted. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the American Specification are generally unconservative for short and intermediate columns, whereas the design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard are generally conservative for all column lengths. This is because the Australian/New Zealand Standard has a separate check for distortional buckling of singly symmetric sections. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The test specimens were brake pressed from high strength <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> In addition, the test strengths were compared with the design strengths calculated using the Indian Standard and North American Specification for Cold –Formed steel structures. Compression members are linear members in which axial forces act to cause elongation (stretch). Such members can sustain loads up to the ultimate load, at which stage they may fail by rupture at a critical section. However, if the gross area of the member yields over a major portion of its length before the rupture load is reached, the member may become non – functional due to excessive elongation. I.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} cold-formed channels subjected to combined bending and web crippling {{is described in}} this paper. A series of tests was performed on unlipped channels rolled from high strength <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> having nominal plate thickness up to 6 mm, and a maximum web slenderness value of 45. This value is considerably lower than the intended web slendemess values used in the Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 4600, 1996) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI, 1996) Specification for cold-formed steel structures. In the past, the typical thickness of cold-formed steel members was less than 3 mm, and {{this was due to}} the limitations of the cold-forming technology in the 1980 s. The design rules in the AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification for members subjected to combined bending and web crippling are mainly based on test results having plate thickness less than 3 mm with web slendemess values greater than 45. Therefore, the appropriateness of the design rules for members having plate thickness greater than 3 mm is investigated in this paper. The specimens were tested at various lengths using the Interior-One-Flange (IOF) loading condition specified in the AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification.
