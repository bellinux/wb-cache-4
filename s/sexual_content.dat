5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games.

Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E

The result also revealed that users of social media in age group 10 - 14 years are 4. 614 {{times more likely to be}} exposed to sexual activity at P-value = 0. 000.
