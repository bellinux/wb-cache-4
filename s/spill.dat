40|$|Oil <b>spills</b> lead to {{pollution}} {{of water and}} land in the surrounding environment. The health and the farmland of the people living around {{the area of the}} <b>spills</b> are also adversely affected. Numerous laws are usually in place {{to deal with the issue}} of oil <b>spills</b> but often times some of these laws are not totally enforced or the institutions set up to deal with the <b>spills</b> are inefficient. Oil <b>spills</b> cannot be left unabated. The problem of oil <b>spills</b> have to be dealt with in order to avoid the devastating effects of oil <b>spills</b> on the environment. In a place like the Niger-Delta in Nigeria where oil <b>spills</b> are rampant, an effective means of curbing the menace have to be thought out to deal with <b>spills.</b> Oil theft, pipeline vandalism and sabotage are the order of the day and thus, oil <b>spills</b> are a recurring decimal in the Niger-Delta. The question then is can the polluter-pays principle play a role in the prevention and control of oil <b>spills</b> especially in Nigeria? This article seeks to answer this question by examining whether the Polluter Pays Principle, an international environmental law principle, can act as a deterrent to oil <b>spills</b> especially deliberate oil <b>spills.</b> This paper examines the tenets of the polluter-pays principle, the deterrence theory, challenges militating against the prevention and control of oil <b>spills</b> in Nigeria and then relevant recommendations and conclusion as regards the role of the polluter-pays principle in preventing and controlling oil <b>spills</b> are put forward.

5|$|Oil tankers {{are only}} one source of oil <b>spills.</b> According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil <b>spilled</b> in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery <b>spills.</b> Only 5% of the actual <b>spills</b> came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total <b>spills</b> but more than 60% of the volume. Tanker <b>spills</b> are much more rare and much more serious than <b>spills</b> from non-tank vessels.|$|R

(approximately 220 thousand cubic metres). A UNDP report states that there have been a total of 6,817 oil <b>spills</b> between 1976 and 2001, which account for a loss of three million barrels of oil, of which more than 70% was not recovered. 69% of these <b>spills</b> occurred off-shore, a quarter was in swamps and 6% <b>spilled</b> on land.|$|R

5|$|Anger at Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a <b>spill</b> motion against his leadership three days later. The motion was moved by Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on the <b>spill</b> motion was considered a blow to Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' <b>spill,</b> he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E

5|$|The <b>spill</b> was the {{culmination}} of a dispute within the Liberal Party over its response to the Rudd Government's proposed emissions trading scheme (ETS).

After Turnbull survived a <b>spill</b> motion (a motion to declare the leadership vacant) against his leadership in late November 2009, Abbott declared his candidacy and a subsequent <b>spill</b> was moved on 1 December. Hockeya moderate who had been a supporter of Turnbull's position on the ETSalso stood. While Hockey had been expected to win, he was knocked out {{in the first round of}} voting.

5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the <b>spill.</b> Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the <b>spill</b> into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury <b>spill.</b>|$|E
