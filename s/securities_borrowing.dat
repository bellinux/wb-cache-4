40|$|This paper {{begins with}} an {{evaluation}} of the performance of the Malaysian market for financial derivatives. Despite a headstart, Malaysia appears to be lagging substantially when compared to the performance of other Asian derivative markets. While the other Asian markets though newer, have seen explosive growth in volume, trading volume in Malaysia appears to have shrunk. We examine why this has been the case and identify several macro and micro level impediments. Among macro level impediments have been the imposition of Capital controls, reduced equity market volatility, falling interest rates and a fragmented regulatory/operational structure. The lack of market makers, regulation and settlement rules were identified as impediments at the market micro structure level. We propose several measures to develop the local derivatives market. This includes, privatizing and deregulating risk management, facilitating market making, liberalization of unit trust guidelines with regard to their use of derivatives and the initiation of derivative funds. We also recommend the reactivation of <b>securities</b> <b>borrowing</b> and lending, introduction of new derivative products and streamlining of licensing / regulations...|$|E

Their stabilizing properties imply that, when bond prices fall, prices for puttable and extendible bonds fall by less. Their embedded options work as a cushion and replicate the trading gains from hedging long-term bonds with interest rate derivatives. These bonds can help develop interest-rate derivative markets in developing countries and eventually increase demand for long-term government bonds. Informal evidence from OECD countries suggests that these bonds were useful in the 1980 s, when interest rates were volatile.

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{estimates}} of the total amount of funding provided by the Federal Reserve to bail out the financial system. For example, Bloomberg recently claimed that the cumulative commitment by the Fed (this includes asset purchases plus lending) was $ 7. 77 trillion. As part of the Ford Foundation project "A Research and Policy Dialogue Project on Improving Governance of the Government Safety Net in Financial Crisis," Nicola Matthews and James Felkerson have undertaken an examination of the data on the Fed's bailout of the financial systemâ€”the most comprehensive investigation of the raw data to date. This working paper is the first in a series that will report the results of this investigation. The extraordinary scope and magnitude of the recent financial crisis of 2007 - 09 required an extraordinary response by the Fed in the fulfillment of its lender-of-last-resort function. The purpose of this paper is to provide a descriptive account of the Fed's response to the recent financial crisis. It begins with a brief summary of the methodology, then outlines the unconventional facilities and programs aimed at stabilizing the existing financial structure. The paper concludes with a summary of the scope and magnitude of the Fed's crisis response. The bottom line: a Federal Reserve bailout commitment in excess of $ 29 trillion.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{potential}} impact on securities settlement systems (SSSs) of a major market disruption, caused by the default of the largest player. A multi-period, multi-security model with intraday credit is used to simulate direct and second round settlement failures triggered by the default, {{as well as the}} dynamics of settlement failures, arising from a lag in settlement relative to the date of trades. The effects of the defaulter's net trade position, the numbers of securities and participants in the market, and participants' trading behaviour are also analysed. We show that in SSSs â€“ contrary to payment systems â€“ large and persistent settlement failures are possible even when ample liquidity is provided. Central bank liquidity support to SSSs thus cannot eliminate settlement failures due to major market disruptions. This {{is due to the fact}} that securities transactions involve a cash leg and a securities leg, and liquidity can affect only the cash side of a transaction. Whereas a broad program of <b>securities</b> <b>borrowing</b> and lending might help, it is precisely during periods of market disruption that participants will be least willing to lend securities. Interestingly, settlement failures continue to occur beyond the period corresponding to the lag in settlement. This is due to the fact that, upon observation of a default, market participants must form expectations about the impact of the default, and these expectations affect current trading behaviour. If, ex post, fewer of the previous trades settle than expected, new settlement failures will occur. This result has interesting implications for financial stability. On the one hand, conservative reactions by market participants to a default - for example by limiting the volume of trades â€“ can result in a more rapid return of the settlement system to a normal level of efficiency. On the other hand, limitation of trading by market participants can reduce market liquidity, which may have a negative impact on financial stability. contagion; liquidity risk; securities clearing and settlement; systemic risk...|$|E
40|$|Small {{emerging}} economies, {{despite their}} significant growth, lack the scale to develop thriving capital markets from their local investor and issuer base that {{are able to}} deliver the benefits of a large, mature market. Slovenia is such an example. Despite the necessary infrastructure in place, trading has remained thin and issuance activity has been dormant. This paper proposes a two-pronged strategy for capital market development that leverages the existing setup in the context of regional integration such as within the EU.

50|$|Security dealers {{choose the}} degree of price and {{liquidity}} risk to bear, their price risk is evidenced by their price quotes, meanwhile, their liquidity risk {{comes in the form}} of their yield quotes. Dealers find themselves constrained by their quantity of cash and the securities available to them in the market. Dealers will choose a short position when they can sell <b>borrowed</b> <b>securities</b> priced above their anticipated, fundamental value. Dealers profit from such short position transactions if the price for the <b>security</b> <b>borrowed</b> falls at the time they must return the security to its owner. Conversely, dealers elect long positions, taking on positive inventories of securities as assets, to compensate for liquidity risks. If dealers believe the fundamental price for a security to be lower than the future price, the dealer will buy low and sell high. Crucially for the money markets, dealers can be thought of as borrowing short term and lending long term, motivated by liquidity. VBTs, by contrast, are the bargain hunters in the market for securities, they search for differences in prices and intrinsic values, therefore, motivated by a price quote and in no hurry to transact.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{makes an}} {{assessment}} of the progress made in developing local debt markets in emerging Asia. Market development has been limited by hurdles confronting borrowers and lenders, current and potential liquidity providers, and insufficient support from government policies and regulations. Besides fostering a credit culture to deepen local debt markets, the issue of critical size can be addressed through an integrated regional market for local currency bonds that provides greater scale, efficiency, and access. With rapid economic growth in Asia, a key challenge is to generate financial assets that can provide the underlying collateral for expanding fixed-income markets, and hence domestic and regional investment opportunities.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{aggregate}} {{effects of a}} social security reform in a large overlapping generations model where markets are incomplete and households face uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks. We depart from the previous literature by assuming that, {{because of lack of}} commitment in the credit market, the borrowing constraint in the unique asset is endogenously determined by the agents' incentives to default on previous debts. We find that a model with exogenous borrowing constraints overestimates the positive eÂ¤ect of reforming social security on the capital stock and the saving rate, compared to our model with endogenous borrowing limit. The reason is that, in the latter, the size of precautionary savings is smaller because after the reform the incentives to default on previous debts are lower and consequently households face more relaxed borrowing limits. Adding retirement accounts to the basic model does not change these conclusions, although the quantitative importance of endogenizing borrowing constraints is reduced.

What he didnâ€™t anticipate, as he choreographed fifty couples, was that the actorâ€”whose intervention was designed to give coherence to the sceneâ€”would go crazy, punch him in the chops, and walk off the set. I was already working on another project, but Yordan insisted that I write some lines for a minor actor, which would account for the miscreantâ€™s absence. This would allow the ballroom scene to continue, save having to locate the crazy or drunk actor, and save having to reshoot. While Siodmak kept the dancers in motion, I rehearsed the new actor in his role, and tailors stitched together a bespoke uniform. Within minutes he burst upon the scene, apologised on behalf of the government minister for his absenceâ€”due to a crisis in Washingtonâ€”and announced an impending honour for Custer. It was a weak solution, but it saved a lot of money. Thatâ€™s show business for you.The film was originally known as Custer's West.
