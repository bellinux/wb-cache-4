2500|$|Although trusts do not, generally, {{require any}} {{formality}} to be established, formality {{may be required}} in order to transfer property the settlor wishes to entrust. There are six particular situations which have returned to the cases: (1) transfers of company shares require registration, (2) trusts and transfers of land require writing and registration, (3) transfers (or [...] "dispositions") of an equitable interest require writing, (4) wills require writing and witnesses, (5) gifts that are only to be transferred in the future require deeds, and (6) bank cheques usually need to be endorsed with a signature. The modern view of formal requirements is that their purpose is to ensure the transferring party has genuinely intended to carry out the transaction. As the American lawyer, Lon Fuller, put it the purpose is to provide [...] "channels for the legally effective expression of intention", particularly where there's a common danger in large transactions that people could rush into it without thinking. However, older case law saw the courts interpreting the requirements of form very rigidly. In an 1862 case, Milroy v Lord, a man named Thomas Medley signed a deed for Samuel Lord to hold 50 Bank of Louisiana shares on trust for his niece, Eleanor Milroy. But the Court of Appeal in Chancery held that this did not create a trust (and nor was any gift effective) because the shares had not finally been registered. Similarly, in an 1865 case, Jones v Lock, Lord Cottenham LC held that because a £900 cheque was not endorsed, it could not be counted as being held on trust for his son. This was so even though the father had said [...] "I give this to baby... I am going to put it away for him... he may do what he likes with it" [...] and locked it in a safe. However, the more modern view, starting with Re Rose was that if the transferor had taken sufficient steps to demonstrate their intention for property to be entrusted, then this was enough. Here, Eric Rose had filled out forms to transfer company shares to his wife, and three months later this was entered into the company <b>share</b> <b>register.</b> The Court of Appeal held, however, that in equity the transfer took place when the forms were completed. In Mascall v Mascall (1984) the Court of Appeal held that, when a father filled out a deed and certificate for the transfer of land, although the transfer had not actually been lodged with HM Land Registry, in equity it the transfer was irrevocable. The trend was confirmed by the Privy Council in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani (2000), where a wealthy man publicly declared he would donate a large sum of money to a charitable foundation he had set up, but died before any transfer of the money took place. Although a gift, which is not transferred, was traditionally thought to require a deed to be enforced, the Privy Council advised this was not necessary as the property was already vested in him as a trustee, and his intentions were clear. In the case of [...] "secret trusts", where someone has written a will but also privately told the executor that they wished to donate their some part of their property in other ways, this has long been held to not contravene the Wills Act 1837 requirements for writing, because it simply works as a declaration of trust before the will. The modern trend, then, has been that so long as the purpose of the formality rules will not be undermined, the courts will not hold trusts invalid.|$|E

40|$|We present two {{algorithms}} for the Group Mutual Exclusion (GME) Problem that {{satisfy the}} properties of Mutual Exclusion, Starvation Freedom, Bounded Exit, Concurrent Entry and First Come First Served. Both our algorithms use only simple read and write instructions, have O(N) Shared Space complexity and O(N) Remote Memory Reference (RMR) complexity in the Cache Coherency (CC) model. Our first algorithm is developed by generalizing the well-known Lamport's Bakery Algorithm for the classical mutual exclusion problem, while preserving its simplicity and elegance. However, it uses unbounded <b>shared</b> <b>registers.</b> Our second algorithm uses only bounded registers and is developed by generalizing Taubenfeld's Black and White Bakery Algorithm to solve the classical mutual exclusion problem using only bounded <b>shared</b> <b>registers.</b> We show that contrary to common perception our algorithms {{are the first to}} achieve these properties with these combination of complexities.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general {{definition}} of self-stabilizing wait-free shared memory objects. The definition ensures that, {{even in the}} face of processor failures, every execution after a transient memory failure is linearisable except for a bounded number of actions. <b>Shared</b> <b>registers</b> have been used extensively as communication medium in self-stabilizing protocols. We give particular attention to the self-stabilizing implementation of such registers, thus providing a large body of previous research with a more solid fundament. In particular, we prove that one cannot construct a self-stabilizing single-reader singlewriter regular bit from self-stabilizing single-reader single-writer safe bits, using only a single bit for the writer. This leads us to postulate a self-stabilizing dual-reader singlewriter safe bit as the minimal hardware needed to achieve self-stabilizing wait-free interprocess communication and synchronisation. Based on this hardware, adaptations of well known wait-free implementations of regular and atomic <b>shared</b> <b>registers</b> are proven to be self-stabilizing. ...|$|R
