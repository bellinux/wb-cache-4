30|$|The {{decoding}} complexity {{is proportional}} to the number of iterations. In order {{to reduce the number of}} iterations, several serial scheduling methods have been proposed. Unlike classical decoding, iteratively generated information is updated following a certain sequence in a serial <b>scheduling.</b> <b>Check</b> node-wise and variable node-wise schedules have been known as layered decoding [17] and shuffled decoding [18], respectively. The required number of iterations can be reduced to half of that of parallel decoding while the performance is maintained. A stopping criterion can also reduce the average number of iterations. Recently, a stopping criterion for reducing not only the average number of iteration but also the number of calculations per iteration was proposed [19].|$|E
40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the implementation of}} a Total Quality Management (TQM) process to enhance Professional Development at a New England College. The goals of the study were: [1) {{to improve the quality of}} academic instruction (Excellence). [2] to improve the quality of faculty responsiveness to student concerns (Access). [3] to improve the quality of the faculty development process (Innovation). A search of the literature produced a number of studies showing the need for quality improvement in faculty productivity on a national scale. A cross-functional team composed of faculty, staff and administrators made up the TQM process group. A systemic evaluation model of disciplined inquiry was used to collect data for decision making. The purpose of the TQM group was to improve the faculty development process, to educate faculty in terms of alternate strategies for improving services and to enhance professional competencies. The Team used formal TQM tools such as fishbone, check sheet and histogram in its process. The TQM process group chose a feedback mechanism for measuring progress towards attainment of goals and objectives. This progress measurement compared baseline data with outcome data in a number of key areas of concern. The study showed that an ongoing process of continuous improvement in these key areas did affect student retention rate, course evaluations and student service satisfaction rate. There were two measures of baseline information: the Cause and Effect diagram and the student conference <b>scheduling</b> <b>check</b> sheet. These were not designed to directly test the hypothesis. There were four outcome measures that provided information for testing the thesis of improved faculty productivity through a TQM system improvement and assessment process. Two of these measures, the Student Services Survey and the Phone calls returned study, showed statistically significant differences in pre and post TQM groups. A third study, the Student Retention Study, showed an improvement of 7 % in the number of program dropouts after the intervention. The Evaluation forms (Course and Instructor) showed an improvement of six percent for the post TQM group but this was not found to be statistically significant...|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} whether a significant, positive relationship exists between flexible scheduling in elementary school library media centers and per-pupil circulation statistics. Design – Online survey. Setting – Library media centers in public elementary schools in two states of the United States. Subjects – A total of 88 elementary school library media specialists completed the survey. Methods – A 22 -question online survey was created using Inquisite software. A link to the survey was sent via e-mail to a 600 -person random sample of public school library media specialists whose names were drawn from the memberships of the North Carolina School Library Media Association and the Virginia Educational Media Association, with combined memberships totalling approximately 2, 000. A random sample of 600 was chosen to provide a 95 % confidence level with a confidence interval of plus or minus three points. The survey included questions about school schedules (flexible, partially flexible, or fixed), collection size, circulation statistics, total student enrolment, school type (elementary, middle, or high), school location (urban, rural, or suburban), percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch, numbers of full-time professional library media specialists employed at the school, access procedures, and library closure information. The survey response rate was 29. 3 % (176 respondents). Because fixed versus flexible scheduling {{is an issue that}} primarily affects elementary schools, the authors further narrowed their subject pool to 88 elementary school respondents. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16. 0 statistical software. Correlation analysis, including the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), was used to compare differences in the three scheduling types and to control for other variables (such as location, socioeconomic status, collection size, staffing, days closed, and others) that may affect circulation. Main Results – Of the 88 elementary school responses, 33 (38 %) had fixed schedules, 44 (50 %) had partially flexible schedules, and 11 (13 %) had totally flexible schedules. Fifty-three schools supplied data regarding per-pupil check-out, and the average number of books checked out per student per year was 52, across all types of schools. The number of book check-outs per pupil differed according to schedule type. Students in schools with fixed <b>schedules</b> <b>checked</b> out an average of 51 books per year, those in schools with partially flexible <b>schedules</b> <b>checked</b> out 46 books per year, and those in schools with totally flexible <b>schedules</b> <b>checked</b> out 71 books per year. When the authors adjusted the data for other factors affecting circulation (such as location, socioeconomic status, collection size, staffing, and others), they found that students in schools with fixed <b>schedules</b> <b>checked</b> out 57 books per year, those in schools with partially flexible <b>schedules</b> <b>checked</b> out 68 books per year, and those in schools with totally flexible <b>schedules</b> <b>checked</b> out 102 books per year. The authors concluded that schedule accounts for 21 % of variation in the rate of book check-out per pupil. Conclusion – These results suggest that the type of schedule used in elementary school library media centers does have a significant relation to circulation statistics. Specifically, when library media centres employ flexible scheduling, students are likely to check out more books per year on average. Although these results are not generalizable, this study provides much-needed research into the relationship between scheduling and circulation, and establishes a basis for further studies in this area...|$|R

40|$|Background: Monitoring {{performance}} of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) generators and leads is important. Methods available are with in person evaluations or by automatic remote home monitoring (HM). These were prospectively evaluated and compared in the TRUST trial. The HM technology tested performed daily self-checks and databasing with rapid event notifications (EN) for out-of-range (including asymptomatic) conditions. Methods and Results: 1, 339 patients were randomized post-ICD implant 2 : 1 to HM or to Conventional (C) groups. Both groups underwent <b>scheduled</b> <b>checks</b> {{every three months}} and were followed for 15 months. In HM, in-person office visits were scheduled at 3 and 15 months. At 6, 9, and 12 months, HM only was used with subsequent office visits if necessary. Between these time points, ICDs triggered EN for system integrity problems. Patients randomized to C follow-up were evaluated with office visits only. HM and C patients were similar (age 63. 3 ± 12. 8 vs. 64. 0 ± 12. 1 yrs, 72. 0 vs. 73. 1 % male, NYHA II class 55. 9 vs. 60. 4 %, LVEF 29. 0 ± 10. 7 vs. 28. 5 ± 9. 8 %, CAD 64. 8 vs. 71. 7 %, primary prevention 72. 2 vs. 73. 8 %, DDD devices 57. 8 vs. 56. 6 %). 4 patients crossed over from C to HM because of advisories. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>checks</b> were more successfully accomplished in HM (92. 7...|$|R

Broadly, these intrusions can becategorized as network-based or host-based intrusions. Defense against network-based attacks involves increas-ing the perimeter security of the system to monitor the network environment, and setting up firewall rules toprevent unauthorized access. Host-based defenses are deployed within each system, to detect attack signaturesor unauthorized access to resources. We developed a host-based system which performs integrity checking atthe file system level. It detects unauthorized access, malicious file system activity, or system inconsistencies,and then triggers damage control in a timely manner...|$|R
