40|$|Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem {{provides}} a means for transforming any program p into a program e(p) which first creates a quiescent <b>self</b> <b>copy</b> and then runs p on that <b>self</b> <b>copy</b> together with any externally given input. e(p), in effect, has complete (low level) self knowledge, and p represents how e(p) uses its self knowledge (and its knowledge of the external world). Infinite regress is not required since e(p) creates its <b>self</b> <b>copy</b> outside of itself. One mechanism to achieve this creation is a self replication trick isomorphic to that employed by single-celled organisms. Another is for e(p) to look in a mirror to see which program it is. In 1974 the author published an infinitary generalization of Kleene's theorem which he called the Operator Recursion Theorem. It {{provides a}} means for obtaining an (algorithmically) growing collection of programs which, in effect, share a common (also growing) mirror from which they can obtain complete low level models of themselves and the other prog [...] ...|$|R

The <b>copies</b> were often <b>paper</b> of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies).

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that the integrated LCA and MCDA approach provided a structured and comprehensive methodology for impact analysis and environmental decision making. In the background of growing concerns over global warming, carbon emission became an important factor. Carbon footprint, however, should not be merely one element in decision-making. The developed method could thus improve previous studies in comprehensive assessment on carbon footprints of products and service on multiple issues. The developed method was then applied to <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> and printing services of China. The application indicated that the hybrid MCDA-LCA method can provide a structured and comprehensive methodology for accounting CFP as well as assessing environmental impacts of products and services. The {{results indicated that the}} most emergent environmental impacts caused by paper production and printing services were resource consumption and hazardous waste. At the same time, {{due to a lack of}} life-cycle inventory data of planting trees, carbon storage was not included in system boundary of <b>copying</b> <b>paper.</b> The next study would be furthered in detailed carbon emission of paper-making industry. Moreover, when purchasing <b>copying</b> <b>paper,</b> consumers should pay attention on coal consumption of the product.
