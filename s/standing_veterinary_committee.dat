A recent review of welfare in battery cages made the point that such welfare issues are problems of management, unlike the issues of behavioural deprivation, which are inherent in a system that keeps hens in such cramped and barren conditions. [...] Free range egg producers can limit or eliminate injurious pecking, particularly feather pecking, through such strategies as providing environmental enrichment, feeding mash instead of pellets, keeping roosters in with the hens, and arranging nest boxes so hens are not exposed to each other's vents; similar strategies are more restricted or impossible in battery cages.|$|R

30|$|The {{limitations}} {{of our study}} are the rather small numbers of animals per group. Our data are therefore underpowered to exclude that the observed beneficial effect of nalbuphine on the wellbeing of Wistar rats had an adverse effect on mortality. No repeated blood sampling was performed in long-term experiments. However, repetitive blood sampling (e.g., via tail vein under brief sedation) likely would have influenced the outcome during the 48 -h mortality study. Premature termination of experiments affected the outcome. A clinical score of six had been defined as a humane endpoint by our <b>veterinary</b> <b>committee.</b> There is however scarce evidence in septic rats that this threshold corresponds to imminent death.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Animal Machines (Harrison, 1964), there has been wide-spread public pressure in Europe—supported by European institutions—to “ban the battery cage. ” The European Union (EU) and national governments (particularly in Northern Europe) funded research on noncage systems for egg production and en-riched cages. In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion—again particularly in the North—continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation {{than the rest of}} Europe. A 1999 Direc-tive with details based on advice from the EU’s Scientific <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Committee</b> will phase out conventional laying cages but allow enriched cages. Implementation de-pends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Eu-rope almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media. On June 15, 1999, the new European Union (EU) Directive on welfare of laying hens was passed, which requires conventional laying cages to be phased out by 2012. Enriched laying cages will still be allowed. In this article, I outline how this came about and the scientific, social, economic, and political issues in-volved.

40|$|<b>Veterinary</b> {{admission}} <b>committees</b> {{are asked}} to create and implement a fair, reliable, and valid system to select the candidates {{most likely to succeed}} in veterinary school from a large pool of applicants. Although numerous studies have explored grade point average (GPA) as a predictive value of later academic success, there has been little attention paid to how and where an applicant acquires his/her undergraduate coursework. Quality of academic program is an important component of applicant files, and it is suggested that the source of a candidate’s coursework might influence admissions committee decisions, perhaps even outside of the committee’s immediate awareness. Options for undergraduate education include taking classes at a traditional four-year institution, a community college, or online. This study provides an overview of the current state of online courses and community colleges in the US as a foundation to explore the views of <b>veterinary</b> admissions <b>committee</b> members pertaining to coursework completed at traditional residential 4 -year schools or at community colleges and whether they are delivered on campus or online (at either type of institution). Survey participants reported a pattern of preference for traditional four-year residential coursework compared to online or community college courses. These results are interesting given the exponential growth of students taking online courses and data showing community colleges are providing a successful gateway to obtaining a four-year degree. This also points to the need for admission committees to discuss potential biases since the information about type of school and/or course may not be consistently available for all applicants. Finally, at a time when admitting a diverse class of students is a goal of many programs, it is of special concern that there are potential biases against courses taken online or from community colleges - venues that tend to draw a more diverse population than traditional 4 -year universities...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Weifare {{assessment}} of segregated early weaning (SEW) in pigs – a review The technology of segregated early weaning (SEW) {{has been established}} primarily in large pig farm enterprises across North America. SEW is characterised by weaning piglets at days 7 to 21 of age (mostly between days 12 to 16) and isolated housing in nurseries and growing / finishing units (multi-site production with all-in all-out pig flow). The goal of this technology is to break the infection chain by utilising acquired maternal (passive) immunity from the dam before piglets develop their own active immunity in response to pathogens. A high Standard of feeding and hygiene management facilitates a superior health Status resulting in improved growth rates. The EU-Report on the welfare Status of intensively housed pigs (SCIENTIFIC <b>VETERINARY</b> <b>COMMITTEE,</b> 1997) suggests that the technology of SEW should be allowed {{only if it is}} demonstrated that any welfare advantages to sows and piglets outweigh the disadvantages. Recent research on the behaviour of piglets showed that piglets weaned before days 21 of age develop higher levels of nosing and chewing each other which persist into the grow/ftnish period. Longer-term consequences of SEW for the reproduetive Performance of sows are not yet sufficiently evaluated, although reduced nursing periods result into reduced litter sizes and piglet weights. That does, however, not exciude that the total number of litters/sow/year increases, resulting in greater number of piglets produced. Considering the EU legislation laying down a minimum weaning age of 21 days, it is recommended that SEW technology could be implemented by utilising the appropriate health management features (multi-site production, all-in all-out). The benefits of isolated housing on health Status and Performance of pigs seem to outweigh the additional advantages of weaning piglets {{at a very early age}} (< 21 days of age) ...|$|R

The measured dorsal–palmar/plantar, medial–lateral, and proximal–distal random wobbling motions in the standing sedated horse were several centimeters in magnitude and generated severe motion-artifacts during axial MRI of the cadaveric specimens. Two retrospective motion-correction techniques (autocorrection and navigator-based adaptive correction) were used to correct the corrupted images. The motion artifacts were nearly eliminated with the use of both techniques in series.

40|$|Abstract There is an {{increasing}} need for more accurate prognostic and predictive markers in veterinary oncology because of {{an increasing}} number of treatment options, the increased financial costs associated with treatment, and the emotional stress experienced by owners in association with the disease and its treatment. Numerous studies have evaluated potential prognostic and predictive markers for veterinary neoplastic diseases, but there are no established guidelines or standards for the conduct and reporting of prognostic studies in veterinary medicine. This lack of standardization has made the evaluation and comparison of studies difficult. Most important, translating these results to clinical applications is problematic. To address this issue, the American College of <b>Veterinary</b> Pathologists' Oncology <b>Committee</b> organized an initiative to establish guidelines for the conduct and reporting of prognostic studies in veterinary oncology. The goal of this initiative is to increase the quality and standardization of veterinary prognostic studies to facilitate independent evaluation, validation, comparison, and implementation of study results. This article represents a consensus statement on the conduct and reporting of prognostic studies in veterinary oncology from veterinary pathologists and oncologists from around the world. These guidelines should be considered a recommendation based on the current state of knowledge in the field, and they will need to be continually reevaluated and revised as the field of veterinary oncology continues to progress. As mentioned, these guidelines were developed through an initiative of the American College of <b>Veterinary</b> Pathologists' Oncology <b>Committee,</b> and they have been reviewed and endorsed by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association...|$|R
40|$|Tendon {{problems}} are frequent among horses and humans as both species face athletic challenges. Repetitive exercise {{often leads to}} overuse injuries in tendons {{and the number of}} reported cases of tendon injuries has increased enormously during the last decades, due to changes in demographics and lifestyle. Of the many existing treatment options none can be classified as sufficiently effective. In this thesis, the subject of tendon injuries is approached from various angles. The first study describes a model for tendinopathy in the equine superficial digital flexor tendon; a tendon which is often injured in horses and is comparable to the human Achilles tendon. For testing the efficacy of different treatments it is crucial to have a well-characterized model which mimics the clinical signs of naturally occurring tendinopathy. This equine model met all the important criteria and therefore has interesting potential for further studies. The second study investigates whether casting of the limb, thereby preventing loading of an injured tendon, would be beneficial. After casting one of two front legs of horses having similar tendon injuries in both front legs lesion propagation was monitored. The lesion in the cast-protected leg remained significantly smaller. This result may influence <b>standing</b> <b>veterinary</b> practice for the treatment of acute tendon injuries in the horse. In the third study the model described above was used to test the efficacy of platelet rich plasma (PRP) a new and popular treatment made directly from the patient’s own blood.. The repair tissue from the PRP-treated tendon had a better structure and better mechanical properties than from its placebo-treated counterpart. The fourth study focuses on genipin, a drug from traditional Chinese medicine, which is a strong cross-linker and hence might improve the quality of the repair tissue. Unfortunately, cell survival was insufficient at effective concentrations. In the fifth study the healing potential of two cell populations, one from the tendon core and one from the sheaths surrounding the tendons (the peritenon) was studied. Peritenon-derived cells showed in vitro a higher reactive potential for healing than cells from the tendon core, but showed also increased propensity to differentiate towards bone cells or myofibroblasts; cells that are associated with permanent scarring. The last study looks in closer detail into the differentiation of tendon cells into myofibroblasts and their subsequent contraction. Differentiation into myofibroblasts was influenced by matrix stiffness and by the tethering of the collagen ligands on the matrix. The different contraction assays also revealed the stimulating effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 on cell contraction. In summary, this thesis addresses then problem of tendon healing from various angles (immobilization, PRP and Genipin) and contributes {{to the understanding of the}} etiopathogenesis of defective healing...|$|R
