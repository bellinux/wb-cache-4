25|$|The {{first years}} of the 20th century <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> VR (as {{elsewhere}} in the world) a considerable increase in both the amount of traffic and the size and weight of rolling stock being hauled. In 1907, the DD class was supplanted by the much larger and more powerful A2 class on principal mainline services. However, with their light axle load (just 12 t 10 cwt in their original form), they were quickly reassigned to the VR's branchline network, where they became a fixture for the next fifty years.|$|E
25|$|Race officials, federations, {{even the}} law on the Continent have been lax. Before Tom's death I <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continent the overcautious way riders were tested for dope, as if the {{authorities}} feared to lift the veil, scared of {{how to handle the}} results; knowing all the while what they would be. They called on the law to act, enabling them to shelter under its wing and feel secure from interminable court actions and claims. They let the show carry on while the law acted light-heartedly, without vigour and purpose – and its deterrent had no effect.|$|E

25|$|According to reports, Wahdat {{soldiers}} {{as well as}} male Hazara citizens were being arrested and executed mostly by Ittihad forces. Unarmed civilians as well were being killed, with men in particular being targeted. Other men were abducted and taken {{to the base of}} Sayyaf's Ittihad in Paghman and made to dig trenches and bury the dead. Those who survived stated they <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bodies evidence of torture and mutilations. Human Rights Watch suggests that 70-80 people were killed in the streets fighting, while 700-750 people disappeared. It states that between 80-200 people were later released after ransoms were paid to Sayyaf's Ittihad commanders.|$|E
25|$|A {{highlight}} of Dunham's later career was the invitation from New York's Metropolitan Opera to stage dances {{for a new}} production of Aida with soprano Leontyne Price. Thus, in 1963, {{she became the first}} African-American to choreograph for the Met since Hemsley Winfield set the dances for The Emperor Jones in 1933. The critics acknowledged the historical research she did on dance in ancient Egypt but did not particularly care for the results they <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Met stage. Subsequently, Dunham undertook various choreographic commissions at several venues in the United States and in Europe. In 1967 she officially retired after presenting a final show at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Even in retirement Dunham continued to choreograph: one of her major works was directing Scott Joplin's opera Treemonisha in 1972 at Morehouse College in Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{government}} setting large bounties on them, it proved difficult {{to crack the}} organization. On one hand, it was popular among many workers; on the other hand, {{those who did not}} sympathize with them were fearful of the group practice of murdering informants. Dłużewski died in the spring of 1911 {{as a result of the}} tip-off of an informant, who was later executed by the group when his betrayal was discovered. One year later, on the anniversary of Dłużewski's death, the group declared that they would kill all policeman they <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets. On that day, 75% of the police officers did not turn up for work. In another well-known event, one of the group members survived a three-day siege in an attic; he killed a policeman, and then left the scene in his victim's uniform. In October 1939 Piątek was arrested. Heavily injured, Piątek was taken to hospital. He scared the policeman interviewing him into believing that he had a bomb, and according to reports, died laughing. Eventually, in around November 1913, a high-ranking member of the group, Michał Zakrzewski, was captured and successfully interrogated. The arrest enabled the group to be dismantled by the authorities by February next year, with 51 of its active members arrested. Due to outbreak of World War I, many of the accused were transported to Moscow, where the trials were finished. Many were executed, others were deported to Siberia.|$|E

[...] Dorothy's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and her curiosity, which was created and enhanced by Elmo's imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Pennant met and corresponded widely {{over many}} years with other naturalists. This gave him privileged access to manuscripts and specimens, and his {{writings}} sometimes provide information about otherwise lost discoveries. For example, he visited the botanist Joseph Banks in September 1771 on his return from Captain James Cook's four-year voyage of exploration; Banks appears to have passed his bird specimens on to Pennant. Pennant's manuscripts describe the birds that Banks <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> voyage; and when he read John Latham's A General Synopsis of Birds (1781–1785), Pennant saw that Latham had omitted some of the land birds from Eastern Australia that Banks had collected, and wrote to Latham {{to fill in the}} gaps.

500|$|Hindley {{made the}} first of two visits to assist the police search of Saddleworth Moor on 16 December 1986. Four police cars left Cookham Wood at 4:30am. At about the same time, police closed all roads onto the moor, which was patrolled by 200 officers, 40 of them armed. Hindley and her {{solicitor}} arrived by helicopter from an airfield near Maidstone, touching down at 8:30am. Wearing a donkey jacket and balaclava, she was driven, and walked around the area. It was difficult for Hindley to make a connection between her memories of the area and what she <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day, and she was apparently nervous of the helicopters flying overhead. At 3:00pm she was returned to the helicopter, and taken back to Cookham Wood.

500|$|Sesame Street's creators {{recognized}} that television lent itself {{well to the}} use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. [...] One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning. [...] If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.|$|E
