5|$|Hugh Foliot (c. 1155– 7 August 1234) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. Related <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> his {{predecessor}} at Hereford, {{he served as}} a priest and papal judge as well as being an unsuccessful candidate as Bishop of St David's in Wales. In 1219, he was appointed Bishop of Hereford. During his time in office, he mostly attended to ecclesiastical duties, but did occasionally serve as a royal administrator. He helped found a hospital and a priory, and died in 1234 after a months-long illness.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

25|$|Women who miscarry {{early in}} their {{pregnancy}} usually do not need any subsequent medical treatment. They can benefit from support and counselling. Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception {{can be used to}} remove remaining tissue. While bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit. Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> blame.|$|E

25|$|Though Scriabin's late {{works are}} often {{considered}} {{to be influenced by}} synesthesia, a condition wherein one experiences sensation in one sense in response to stimulus in another, it is doubted that Scriabin actually experienced this. His colour system, unlike most synesthetic experience, accords with the circle of fifths: it was a thought-out system based on Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks. Note that Scriabin did not, for his theory, recognize a difference between a major and a minor tonality of the same name (for example: c-minor and C-Major). Indeed, influenced also by the doctrines of theosophy, he developed his system of synesthesia toward what would have been a pioneering multimedia performance: his unrealized magnum opus Mysterium was to have been a grand week-long performance including music, scent, dance, and light {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas Mountains that was <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> bring about the dissolution of the world in bliss.|$|E
25|$|Culme-Seymour was {{concerned}} {{to restore the}} efficiency of his squadron, in particular through exercises to build the confidence of his ships' captains that they could work together effectively and without further mishaps. Evan-Thomas gained considerable experience in working with a fleet, and in particular a comprehensive knowledge of the signal book. Control of a fleet at this time was by a system of flag signals from the command ship, {{which had to be}} read and obeyed by other ships. The signal book had grown to contain thousands of flag combinations to give detailed instructions, and controversy had arisen within the navy whether this system would be practical in battle. Tryon had been an advocate of a much simpler system, where captains had greater latitude simply to 'follow the leader' and use their own initiative rather than waiting for explicit orders. Ironically, the ship collision had happened during manoeuvres using the traditional system, not when captains were supposed to be acting independently, and had they used initiative rather than following incorrect flag commands, the accident could have been avoided. Nonetheless, a perception arose that the simplified system giving more independence to captains was <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> blame, and the navy as a whole moved back to detailed flag instructions. Evan-Thomas at the centre of this reversal of policy in the Mediterranean squadron, gained an expectation for accurate and detailed flag commands which contributed to later difficulties at the Battle of Jutland, where signal failures contributed to the loss of British ships. Other experiments continued to try to improve the effectiveness of communication between ships, including semaphore, searchlight and carrier pigeon.|$|E

2500|$|Mann, {{born and}} raised in Virginia, was the {{daughter}} of Robert Munger and Elizabeth Munger. In Mann’s introduction for her book [...] "Immediate Family", she [...] "expresses stronger memories for the black woman, Virginia Carter, who oversaw her upbringing than for her own mother." [...] Elizabeth Munger was not a big part of Mann's life, and Elizabeth said “Sally may look like me, but inside she’s her father’s child.” Virginia (Gee-Gee) Carter, born in 1894, [...] raised Mann and her two brothers and was an admirable woman. “Left with six children and a public education system for which she paid taxes but which forbade classes for black children beyond the seventh grade, Gee-Gee managed <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> send each of them to out-of-state boarding schools and, ultimately, to college.” Virginia Cater died in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|Lindbergh sat in {{a cramped}} cockpit which was 94cm wide, 81cm long and 130cm high (36in× 32in× 51in). The cockpit was so small, Lindbergh could not stretch his legs. The Spirit of St. Louis was powered by a , air-cooled, nine-cylinder Wright J-5C [...] "Whirlwind" [...] radial engine. The engine was rated for a maximum {{operating}} time of 9,000 hours (more than one year if operated continuously), and had a special mechanism that could keep it clean for the entire New York-to-Paris flight. It was also, for its day, very fuel-efficient, enabling longer flights carrying less fuel weight for given distances. Another key feature of the Whirlwind radial engine {{was that it was}} rated to self-lubricate the engine's valves for 40 hours continuously. Lubricating, or [...] "greasing," [...] the moving external engine parts was a necessity most aeronautical engines of the day required, to be done manually by the pilot or ground crew prior to every flight and would have been otherwise required <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> be done during the long flight.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Alter {{wrote about}} Gold's contention: [...] "Again and again Gold asks why Amichai did not {{represent}} his German childhood in his poetry, except fragmentarily and obliquely. The inconvenient fact that his major novel, Not of This time, Not of This Place, devotes elaborate attention to Wurzburg (which is given the fictional name Weinburg) {{is not allowed to}} trouble Gold's thesis of suppression, because the book is fiction, not poetry, and hence is thought <b>somehow</b> <b>to</b> belong to a different category in regard to the writer's relation to his early years. But Gold's notion of Amichai's 'poetics of camouflage' rests on an entirely unexamined assumption- that it is the task of the poet to represent his life directly and in full..." [...] However, Gold argued that Amichai only wrote extensively about Wuerzburg in his novel because it was not his primary genre and therefore would be read by fewer people. [...] Moreover, [...] "Not of This Time, Not of This Place" [...] does not hide {{the fact that it is}} based on Amichai's autobiography, including both his trip to his former hometown (and, explicitly, his search for closure about Little Ruth) and his affair with an American woman.|$|E

In England he read extensively about his grandfather. [...] Zionism had not been a significant part of his background in Austria, but Stephan became an ardent Zionist, was the only descendant of Theodor Herzl to have become one. Anglicizing his name to Stephen Norman, during World War II, Norman enlisted in the British Army rising to the rank of Captain in the Royal Artillery. [...] In late 1945 and early 1946 he took the opportunity to visit the British Mandate of Palestine [...] "to see what my grandfather had started." [...] He wrote in his diary extensively about his trip. [...] What most impressed him was the [...] "look of freedom" [...] on the faces of the children, which were not like the sallow look of those from the concentration camps of Europe.
