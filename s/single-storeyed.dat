5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase {{on the second}} floor. However, the butlery and pantry was <b>single-storeyed,</b> but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} of the sportsground there is a {{concrete}} block public toilet with a skillion roof and a <b>single-storeyed</b> weatherboard Guide hut with timber stumps and a gabled roof.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} the former offices of the Dutch steamtram company, Joana Stoomtram Maatschappij in Semarang by Thomas Karsten (1930). The ground plan of this <b>single-storeyed</b> {{building}} is identical {{to that of a}} traditional Javanese Joglo: tall columns support a hipped, two-tiered roof, which facilitates cross ventilation of the roof cavity.|$|E
25|$|Internally, the {{building}} has a concrete floor throughout and exposed unpainted timber truss arches. Sections of the roof have translucent sheeting for light, and the eastern end is supported by scaffolding. The <b>single-storeyed</b> office accommodation along the southwest projects into the space, and is constructed in hardboard sheeting and is surmounted by air handling equipment. The hangar is currently used for freight storage.|$|E
25|$|Access is via a bitumen {{drive from}} {{the western end of}} Gunyah Street which encircles the sportsground around to the south west. A row of trees lines the drive to the east and the {{entrance}} is between square gateposts. Next to these is a <b>single-storeyed</b> weatherboard library with a corrugated iron skillion roof. Two park benches with cast iron supports which contain the letters McCP are located here.|$|E
25|$|The gun emplacements are symmetrical, <b>single-storeyed</b> {{structures}} of off-form concrete, waffle slab roof supported on three columns with earth fill on top, Australian-designed circular recoil pit with central pad and outlying rail for gun carriage traverse, side magazines {{of concrete and}} concrete block construction. Camouflage net pivot points are extant, and doors remain on the lower emplacement magazines. The robust off-form concrete construction is unlike the two-storeyed coastal battery gun emplacements of Moreton Bay, where timber as well as concrete was used structurally.|$|E
25|$|Residential {{buildings}} occupy 26.46% of the city, or 71.11% of its built-up area; 5–14-storey buildings {{dominate the}} central part and the outlying areas are mostly built up with <b>single-storeyed</b> houses. The population rise in the 1990s–2000s due to the inflow of external workforce sharply {{increased the number of}} substandard housing, mainly {{on the outskirts of the}} city. More than half of the slums (1,242,490 m²) are located in northern Bogor, whereas their area is only 89,780 m² in southern part of the city. To improve this situation, the city administration launched a program of construction of cheap housing types (light prefabricated houses) in the western Bogor. These houses combine reasonable rent ($22 per year) at acceptable living conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{generator}} shed (...) is a <b>single-storeyed,</b> orange {{brick building}} located close to both lighthouses (south {{of the concrete}} signal station and east of the old lighthouse). Entrance to the building is through a roller door on the northern facade. The flat concrete roof overhangs on {{the north and south}} sides to form a narrow awning, and a projecting brick sill runs around the building beneath high windows. The interior contains two rooms: a larger room housing a generator, remnant equipment and a workbench; and a smaller room in the north–west corner, accessed by an internal door.|$|E
60|$|You must figure these mighty forms, {{forty feet}} high {{the least of}} them was, {{reclining}} {{on a patch of}} turf that would have seemed a stubble of reeds to a common man. One sat up and chipped earth from his huge boots with an iron girder he grasped in his hand; the second rested on his elbow; the third whittled a pine tree into shape and made a smell of resin in the air. They were clothed not in cloth but in under-garments of woven rope and outer clothes of felted aluminium wire; they were shod with timber and iron, and the links and buttons and belts of their clothing were all of plated steel. The great <b>single-storeyed</b> house they lived in, Egyptian in its massiveness, half built of monstrous blocks of chalk and half excavated from the living rock of the hill, had a front a full hundred feet in height, and beyond, the chimneys and wheels, the cranes and covers of their work sheds rose marvellously against the sky. Through a circular window in the house there was visible a spout from which some white-hot metal dripped and dripped in measured drops into a receptacle out of sight. The place was enclosed and rudely fortified by monstrous banks of earth, backed with steel both over the crests of the Downs above and across the dip of the valley. It needed something of common size to mark the nature of the scale. The train that came rattling from Sevenoaks athwart their vision, and presently plunged into the tunnel out of their sight, looked by contrast with them like some small-sized automatic toy.|$|E
