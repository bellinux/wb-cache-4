5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E

For this purpose water, sediment and <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> of Tadjan River (southern part of the Caspian Sea) were collected. In the vicinity of the river many polluting sources were recognized; for instance, pulp and paper mill, dairy factory and municipal sewage that can introduce various amounts of heavy metals into the river water.

25|$|Cairo is an {{expanding}} city, {{which has led}} to many environmental problems. The air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like catalytic converters. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.|$|E

According to the CAG report, tabled in the Bihar Legislative Assembly in April 2015, respirable <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (RSPM) level (PM-10) in Patna was 355, three-and-a-half times higher than the {{prescribed}} limit of 100 micro-gram per cubic metre, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions and construction activities in the city. In May 2014, a World Health Organization survey declared Patna the second most air polluted city in India, only after Delhi, with the survey calculating the airborne particulate matter in the state capital's ambient air (PM-2.5) to be 149 micro-grams, six times more than the safe limit, which is 25 micro-grams. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer, asthma, dysentery and diarrhoea. The dense smog in Patna during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.|$|E

25|$|Air pollution, or <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> locally {{generated}} from the increased number of automobiles in the area, from point sources such as factories, dust carried into the air by construction activity, and the contribution of similar pollutants from the Los Angeles area has regularly caused the Inland Empire to be at, or near, the bottom of many air quality ratings. In 2004, the EPA rated the San Bernardino-Riverside area as having the worst particulate air pollution in the United States, (although the San Joaquin Valley in central California had the worst overall air pollution). Air pollution in the Los Angeles region is still an issue, although improvements have been made over the years. But the problem is exacerbated in the Inland Empire, which is surrounded by mountains on {{the north and the}} east. Prevailing winds move bad air eastward from Los Angeles, but once the pollution reaches the Inland Empire it cannot be carried further east as it becomes trapped by the mountains surrounding the region.|$|E
25|$|Respirable <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> of {{less than}} 10 {{micrometers}} (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|E

40|$|International audienceFrom top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, {{atmospheric}} correction for ocean color inversion aims at distinguishing atmosphere and water contributions. From a methodological point of view, our approach {{relies on a}} Bayesian inference using Gaussian Mixture Model prior distributions on reference spectra of aerosol and water reflectance. A reference spectrum for the aerosol characterizes the specific signature of the aerosols on the observed aerosol reflectance. A reference spectrum for the water characterizes the specific signature of chlorophyll-a, <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> and colored dissolved organic matters on the observed sea surface reflectance. In our Bayesian inversion scheme, prior distributions of the marine and aerosol variables are set conditionally to the observed values of covariates, typically acquisition geometry acquisition conditions and pre-estimates of the aerosol and water reflectance in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The numerical inversion exploits a gradient-based optimization from quasi-randomized initializations. We evaluate our estimates of the sea surface reflectance from the MERIS TOA observations. Using the MERMAID radiometric in-situ dataset, we obtain significant improvements in the estimation of the sea surface reflectance, especially for the 412, 442, 490 and 510 nm bands, compared with the standard ESA MEGS algorithm and the a state-of-the-art neural network approach (C 2 R). The mean gain value on the relative error for the 13 bands between 412 and 885 nm is of 57 % compared with MEGS algorithm and 10 % compared with the C 2 R. The water leaving reflectances are used in Ocean Color for the estimation of the chl-a concentration, the colored dissolved organic matters absorption and the <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> concentration underlying the potential of such approach to improve the standard level 2 products in coastal areas.
