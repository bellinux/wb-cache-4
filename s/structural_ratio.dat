5000|$|Restricted rocket staging {{is based}} on the {{simplified}} assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific impulse, <b>structural</b> <b>ratio,</b> and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage. Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage. This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design. One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system. Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages. However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment. The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number, as shown in the figure below. [...] In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.|$|E

The going concern ability is expressed through the survival time to insolvency/bankruptcy. In the study, we use duration models (the Kaplan-Meier estimator) to assess the general status of the company and to signal its financial difficulty, by the combined effect of the economic and financial indicators (the financial leverage and the general solvency ratio).

40|$|Questions such {{as whether}} a tomato is fruit, or whether chess is a sport, reveal {{differences}} between individuals’ concepts. How can the same perceptual information result in different representations? Perhaps people’s initial attention to particular category information determines what representations they will form. When first learning about chess, for example, attention to its competitive aspect may cause one to classify it as a sport, whereas attention to its non-athletic nature will cause one to classify it as a game. Early concept acquisition research focused not on individual differences but rather on basic questions about categories {{such as whether}} people can learn nonlinearly separable (NLS) categories, as predicted by exemplar memorization, or whether they favor linearly separable (LS) categories, as predicted by prototype abstraction. Indeed, it is generally believed that this question was laid to rest by Medin and Schwanenflugel (1981), who found that NLS can be learned as easily as LS categories—favoring the exemplar view. However, questions of generalizability shifted the focus to factors that could influence the linear separability constraint. For example, {{it has been found}} that knowledge, category size, <b>structural</b> <b>ratio,</b> and inference learning can each affect the average relative difficulty of NLS and LS categories. Importantly, Blair and Homa (2001) found individual differences, with some subjects favoring LS, others NLS categories, and others neither. The present study investigates why individuals might prefer LS over NLS categories, or vice versa. We do this in a novel and direct way, by using categories with independently predictive dimensions that provide an LS solution, and additional, configurally predictive dimensions that provide an NLS solution...|$|E

40|$|THE BALTIC ROOT *d  -ž- Summary An {{attempt is}} made {{here to give}} a {{satisfactory}} explanation of the provenance of various allomorphs based on the Common Baltic root *d-ž-> *dirž- attested in Lith. diržti “to flay, skin”, dir̃žas “belt, girdle; sash”, Latv. dir̂ža “belt, girdle; strap, thong”, Lith. déržti “hurry, make haste”, dar̃žas, Latv. dā̀rzs “kitchen-garden, flower garden”. The root *d-ž- {{seems to be a}} Baltic innovation: it might contain a primitive root *d- attested in Lith. dir̃ti “skin, strip off, bark, tear”, Latv. dirât “flay, skin” (cf. their cognates OCS derą, Goth. dis-taíran, Gr. δέρω, OInd. dnā́ti, Arm. ter̆em, Toch. AB tsär-), enlarged with a suffix - ž -, A set-variant *der-H- seems to have existed as well, cf. Lith. dìrti, OInd. dīrṇa-. Therefore it would not be unreasonable to assume that in proto-Baltic dialects there existed a full grade va­riant *dr-eH- as well as *d(e) r-H- and that the former functioned in a preterite system and the lat­ter most likely belonged to a present system. Due to the analogy of *der-ž- / *d-ž- they could have been enlarged with a suffix -ž-. After the syllabic laryngeal had been vocalized, i. e. *d(e) r-H-ž- →*dr-H̥-ž- →*draž-, a “heteroclitic” paradigm praes. *draž- ( Lith., Latv. uo) seem to have been generated on the basis of praet. *drēž-: Lith. drúožas “stripe; region, zone”, druožė̃ “stripe”, druožlė̃ “shaving”, Latv. druõztala “shaving, small piece, bit”, from which afterwards such verbs as Lith. druõžti, driúožti “to wear, tear”, Latv. druoztalât “to cut a little and frequently” could have been derived. After the above model had ceased to operate nouns could have been produced without any vowel alternation: drêzt 2 →drza “scolding; wigging”, drzns “moist, damp”, drę̃gzna „ cold and damp weather”; dróžti, drāzt → drožlỹs "plane“, drãzlis “shaving, chip, sliver”, drožnùs “which is easily to plane”, drāzns “naughty, frisk”, drožlė̃ “shaving”, dra­̀za 2 “crowd, throng; scab” etc. The allomorphs *driž- and *drīž- seem to be of late origin in both Lithuanian and Latvian. As a pattern for their formation the <b>structural</b> <b>ratio</b> TeR-T- : TiR-T-=TRe-T- : x, where x equ­ates to TRi-T-/ TR ī -T-, can be suggested. In this way {{on the basis of the}} verb drė́žti, drêzt 2 all forms with a vocalism in reduced grade could rather easily have been brought about: thus praet. *drēž → Lith. drýžti “to carry”, drỹžti “tear”, drýžas “streaky, striped, in streaks”, Latv. dr ī zna, drīzna „beam, ray”, and praes. *drež- → Lith. drìžti „take pains, weaken; feel shy”, drižė́ti “be afraid, feel shy, be diffident”, Latv. driz-nêt „grow stiff”. The full grade forms dríežti „tear“, dreĩžti „linger; tarry; be slow”, dríežas „lizard“ (cf. drýžas „lizard“ and drýžas „striped; stripy; motley”) and others are used only in Lithuanian. Thus being apparently late innovations they might have followed the productive pattern TRī-T- : TRie-T-   resp. TRī-T- : TRēi-T-. In a similar way, i. e. by the ratio TaR-T- : TuR-T-= TRa-T- :x (x= TRu-T-/TRū-T-), the origin of the allomorphs *druž-/*drūž- can be accounted for. The basis for their formation could have been the forms of the verb Lith. dróžti, Latv. drāzt: praes. *draž- → Lith. drùžti „weaken, grow weaker”, drùžas „flogging, thrashing”, Latv. druzas „mud, mire, dirt” etc.; praet. *drāž - → Lith. Drūžė̃ „ stripe” etc., Latv. drũzêt „ be chilly; shiver with cold”, drūze “crowd, press, throng” etc. On the basis cf this zero grade allomorphs, forms with an a- vocalism might have been generated in Latvian, cf. drauzs „brittle; rough, rude, coarse, harsh”, drauzs “Schinn, Schelfer”, drauza,,mud, mire; waste, rubbish, offal (from a bark) ” etc...|$|E

40|$|As the {{technology}} for solar electric propulsion has been further matured in the past years, the number of current and planned electric propelled spacecraft is rising. This technology {{can be applied to}} different mission scenarios such as: Deep space probes, communication satellites (transferred from a GTO or LEO to a GEO) or even reusable Moon or Mars supply modules. Although electric propulsion requires only a relatively small portion of fuel it does demand a lot of power. For deep space probes or Moon and Mars supply modules constant power supply with some hundred kW and up to 1 MW are realistic. State-of-the art solar array concepts could be adapted to such dimensions but the question needs to be asked if these architectures are the most suited for very huge arrays. Moreover, the availability and constant maturing of flexible photovoltaic cells raises the question if membrane based, gossamer structures could be a more weight efficient alternative. Based on current DLR technologies for deployable space structures two concepts for large solar arrays are examined. The analysis is done for a power spectrum of 2 : 5 kW to 500 kW and two types of solar cell technologies: thin-film solar cells (TF) applied to a thin membrane substrate and state-of-the-art high performance multi-junction cells (MJ). The first concept is based on the DLR GOSSAMER solar sail architecture while the second is a flexible blanket design similar to the ISS. To evaluate conceptual design changes several sub-configurations are examined as well by use of parametric finite element models. The configurations are analysed regarding their performance parameters specific power (power per array mass), stowage volume efficiency (power per stowed volume) and <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> (<b>structural,</b> mechanism and residual mass divided by photovoltaic blanket mass). For all configurations a partially dramatic decrease in performance with increasing power and size is observed. While in the small to medium power region (2 : 5 [...] 100 kW) good performance is achieved for both configurations, in the high power region (100 [...] 500 kW) especially stowage volume efficiency and stowed dimensions become a critical factor. The impact of array size can be observed when comparing both cell technologies. To compensate for the loss in cell efficiency, TF arrays are significantly larger. While in the small power regions performance values to MJ arrays show small differences this diverges strongly with increasing array power and thereby size. In case of <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> a difference up to a factor of 3 and in stowage volume up to a factor of 5 is observed. Comparing the concepts among each other the flexible blanket design outperforms the solar sail structure. Typical values for a 100 kW-array of the best performing sub-configurations using MJ cells are 184 W=kg specific mass, <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> of 0 : 5 and stowage volume efficiency of 35 kW=m 3 in case of the solar sail configuration. For the flexible blanket design 273 W=kg in specific mass, a <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> of 0 : 2 and a stowage volume efficiency of 110 kW=m 3 is achieved. Furthermore critical components, development needs and recommendations for further enhancement of array performance are identified and a break-even cell efficiency for the thin-film photovoltaic technology is calculated...|$|R

Due to the high dose rate of ionizing radiation outside the canisters holding the nuclear waste, radiolysis of the interlayer and pore water in the compacted bentonite is unavoidable. Upon reaction with the oxidizing and reducing species formed by water radiolysis (OH•, e-(aq), H•, H 202, H 2, H 02 •, H 30 +), the overall redox properties in the bentonite barrier may change. In this study the influence of γ-radiation on the structural Fe(II) /Fe(III) content in montmorillonite and its reactivity towards hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was investigated in parallel experiments. The results show that under anoxic conditions the <b>structural</b> Fe(II) /FeTot <b>ratio</b> of dispersed montmorillonite are increased from ≤ 3 to 25 - 30 % after γ-doses comparable to repository conditions.

Optical properties of all InAlN films were also investigated by an ultraviolet/visible/infrared (UV/Vis/IR) reflection spectrophotometer with integrating sphere.|$|R
