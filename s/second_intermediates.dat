40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} Romer [Journal of Political Economy 98 (Part 2) (1990) S 271] model in two ways. First we include energy {{consumption}} of intermediates. <b>Second,</b> <b>intermediates</b> become heterogeneous due to endogenous energy-saving technical change. We {{show that the}} resulting model can still generate steady state growth, but the growth rate depends negatively on the growth of real energy prices. The reason is that real energy price rises will lower the profitability of using new intermediate goods, and hence, the profitability of doing research, and therefore {{have a negative impact}} on growth. We also show that the introduction of an energy tax that is recycled in the form of an R&D subsidy may increase growth. We conclude that in order to have energy efficiency growth and output growth under rising real energy prices, a combination of R&D and energy policy is called for. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to answer the question whether human lymphocytes and spleen cells were capable of de novo purine biosynthesis. Experiments were carried out in cell-free extracts prepared from human spleen, and from a cell line established from Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma cells and human spleen cells could synthesize the first and <b>second</b> <b>intermediates</b> of the purine biosynthetic pathway. Cell-free extracts of all cell lines studied contained the enzyme systems which catalyze the synthesis of phosphoribosyl- 1 -amine, the first intermediate unique to the purine biosynthetic pathway and of phosphoribosyl glycinamide, the second intermediate of this pathway. Phosphoribosyl- 1 -amine could be synthesized in cell-free extracts from α- 5 -phosphoribosyl- 1 -pyrophosphate (PRPP) and glutamine, from PRPP and ammonia, and by an alternative pathway, directly from ribose- 5 -phosphate and ammonia. These findings suggest that extrahepatic tissues may be an important source for the de novo synthesis of purine ribonucleotide in man. They also indicate that ammonia may {{play an important role in}} purine biosynthesis. The alternative pathway for the synthesis of phosphoribosyl- 1 -amine from ribose- 5 -phosphate and ammonia was found to be subject to inhibition by the end products of the purine synthetic pathway, particularly by adenylic acid and to a lesser degree by guanylic acid. The alternative pathway for phosphoribosyl- 1 -amine synthesis from ribose- 5 -phosphate and ammonia may contribute significantly towards the regulation of the rate of de novo purine biosynthesis in the normal state, in metabolic disorders in which purines are excessively produced and in myeloproliferative diseases...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{propose a}} model that {{accounts}} for the time courses of PEG-induced fusion of membrane vesicles of varying lipid compositions and sizes. The model assumes that fusion proceeds from an initial, aggregated vesicle state ((A) membrane contact) through two sequential intermediate states (I 1 and I 2) {{and then on to}} a fusion pore state (FP). Using this model, we interpreted data on the fusion of seven different vesicle systems. We found that the initial aggregated state involved no lipid or content mixing but did produce leakage. The final state (FP) was not leaky. Lipid mixing normally dominated the first inter-mediate state (I 1), but content mixing signal was also observed in this state for most systems. The second intermediate state (I 2) exhibited both lipid and content mixing signals and leakage, and was sometimes the only leaky state. In some systems, the first and <b>second</b> <b>intermediates</b> were indistinguishable and converted directly to the FP state. Having also tested a parallel, two-intermediate model subject to different assumptions {{about the nature of the}} intermediates, we conclude that a sequential, two-intermediate model is the simplest model sufficient to describe PEG-mediated fusion in all vesicle systems studied. We conclude as well that a fusion intermediate ‘‘state’ ’ should not be thought of as a fixed structure (e. g., ‘‘stalk’ ’ or ‘‘transmembrane contact’’) of uniform properties. Rather, a fusion ‘‘state’ ’ describes an ensemble of similar structures that can have different mechanical properties. Thus, a ‘‘state’ ’ can have varying probabilities of having a given functional property such as content mixing, lipid mixing, or leakage. Our data show that the content mixing signal may occur through two processes, one correlated and one not correlated with leakage. Finally, we consider the implications of our results in terms of the ‘‘modified stalk’ ’ hypo...|$|E
