40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry is a}} constantly changing market regarding design and choice of materials. The steel has since the early 1900 s been the single largest component of a car, both in percentage and weight. Consumers are now demanding more fuel-efficient cars inter alia to reduce global energy consumption. This leads car manufactures to make lighter, but still safer cars. This study mainly focuses on the factors that will influence the steel usage in the {{automotive industry}}. The study will also answer what effect the future <b>steel</b> <b>intensity</b> in the automotive industry will have on LKAB’s customer portfolio. The study showed that customers of LKAB {{would have to spend}} a substantial capital in R&D to ensure the future development of new types of steel {{and to be able to}} continue their relationship with car producers. The study also showed that the future <b>steel</b> <b>intensity</b> in passenger cars would decrease with an increasing usage of high strength steels as well as an increased usage of different materials to ensure customers future demands.

40|$|Steel {{production}} emits a {{large share}} of a country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore {{it is important that the}} steel production is accurately modeled in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). This thesis focusses on using physical drivers, rather than GDP, in a method to model steel demand. These drivers are based on the two largest steel consuming end-use sectors: construction and automotive. Within those sectors, 9 drivers for steel demand were identified. After statistical analysis, only population, new dwellings constructed, total floor area and motor vehicles produced showed strong correlations with their sectors’ steel consumption. These four drivers were then used to model the steel demand for the entire end-use sector. The method used for modeling is a bottomup model based on population size and historical trends of <b>steel</b> <b>intensity</b> and product intensity...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the likely future path of China’s metal intensity by referencing the experience of relevant peers through initial engagement with a technology-led strategy and beyond. This question cuts to the very roots of Chinese long run economic strategy and performance. The broad conclusion is that there is no ‘silver bullet’ quantitative model that captures the dynamics of metal intensity through the entirety of the industrialisation process. Even the identification of a robust non-linear long run relationship between <b>steel</b> <b>intensity</b> and income per capita in the United States, styled here as the “metal intensity Kuznets curve”, does not overturn this position. Each national industrialisation process, its entry into the global strategic transition and its relationship to metal intensity, appears to be sui generis and should be dealt with accordingly. China will not continue to follow a metal intensity path similar to Korea’s for more than another decade. After that point, similarities with the Japanese and United States’ experiences will increase, but a distinct Chinese character will develop. The peak in Chinese steel usage per capita should occur within a handful of years from 2020. metal intensity, Asian industrialisation, China, strategic transition, Kuznets curve...|$|E

The paper analyses the wear process of 38 GSA steel, used in working elements which cut soil, depending on the corrosiveness of the chemical environment. The tests were conducted in natural soil conditions. Changes in the mass of samples depending on soil pH were measured during the tests. Based on the obtained results, it has been concluded that along with an increase in soil acidity, the <b>steel</b> wear <b>intensity</b> also increases.

Bending strength, compression strength, porosity and density of mortars were determined and related to the CNT dosages. CNT cement paste specimens were exposed to carbonation and chloride attacks, and results on steel corrosion rate tests were related to CNT dosages. The increase in CNT content implies no significant variations of mechanical properties but higher <b>steel</b> corrosion <b>intensities</b> were observed.

40|$|Quick {{analysis}} of chemical composition {{is very important}} for process control and quality assessment in metallurgical industry, especially in steelmaking process. A prototype equipment for online {{analysis of}} molten steel composition was developed based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. The effect of steel temperature on different spectral line intensities was studied, and calibration curves of Cr, Ni, Si and Mn were built. Results show that most line intensities are greatly enhanced when steel temperature is higher than 1200 degrees C, and the detection capability of minor elements in molten steel is higher than in normal solid <b>steel.</b> Line <b>intensity,</b> however, is easier saturated in molten steel, leading to narrow linear ranges of calibration curves for molten steel.

40|$|High speed {{compressible}} jets {{are used}} {{in a number of}} steel-making applications. In the case of the BOF, a compressible oxygen jet reacts with a carbon-rich iron bath to reduce carbon levels and produce <b>steel.</b> The <b>intensity</b> of the process is governed by the speed of the jet and by {{the size and shape of}} the depression created in the metal and slag by the force of the jet, i. e. by the corresponding free surface. This is a difficult CFD problem, since there are compressible and incompressible regions in the flow domain, which need to be handled differently in a finite volume (FV) pressure-correction scheme. Also, standard turbulence models do not account for compressibility, or the large difference in density between the cold oxygen jet and the hot reacting surroundings. Corrections are introduced to the k-ε model to remedy this deficiency and the results are validated against experimental data. The compressible/incompressible boundary is handled through a transition region, based on Mach number...|$|R
40|$|In warm rolled <b>steels,</b> the <b>intensity</b> of the //ND {{annealing}} texture, which favours formability, {{has been}} related {{to the formation of}} shear bands during rolling. Coarse hot band grain sizes (HBGS's) facilitate flow localization, the mechanism associated with the formation of shear bands. In this work, the effect of grain size after hot rolling was studied in a low carbon steel containing small additions of Cr and Mn. The formation of shear bands and their subsequent influence on the normal anisotropy r(m) and planar anisotropy Delta r in the annealed steels were of particular interest. Two HBGS's (18 and 30 mu m) were employed and the specimens were warm rolled to reductions of 65 and 80 % at various temperatures between 640 and 700 degrees C. The results show that the frequency of shear banding is slightly lower for the smaller grain size. The normal anisotropy was not affected by the HBGS; by contrast, much lower Delta r values were associated with the finer grained steel. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{whether a}} long-run stationary equilibrium relationship holds between economic {{activity and the}} consumption of crude steel within the UK. Using the theory of fractionally integrated and cointegrated processes, and allowing {{for the possibility that}} the equilibrium path changes abruptly at occasional points in time, it is possible to determine if steel consumption and economic activity follow a common stochastic trend or whether the two series randomly drift apart over time. Evidence is found to support such a long term relationship. This result is at odds with the conclusions drawn by previous researchers in the area. The reason for this difference may be due to these researchers concentrating only on I(0) and I(1) specifications, without consideration of fractional possibilities and also to a failure to account for structural breaks in the equilibrium relationship. Such conclusions are made {{within the framework of the}} ARFIMA methodology that yields reliable inferences on the degree of fractional integration and cointegration. Critical values for fractional contegration with an ARFIMA model in the presence of structural breaks are also derived in this paper. <b>Steel</b> consumption <b>Intensity</b> of use Fractional integration Fraction cointegration ARFIMA...|$|R

The positive effect of shot peening on ero-sion resistance of the magnesium alloy AZ 80 was clearly observed during the experiment on an erosion testing lnachine. On average, 33 to 45 percent reduction in erosion was found in shot peened as compared to non-peened specimens. Shot peening was also beneficial in fatigue even under conlbined bending and torsion.

Natural gas and electricity {{are the main}} energy forms, with coal and oil now almost specialty fuels. Declining energy use per ton of production has characterized materials manufacture, especially since 1972. An in-depth examination of trends and future possibilities in energy use per ton of product is made for the steel industry. Energy use in 1983 is analyzed by stage of production and for the integrated and secondary sectors. Ongoing reductions in energy use by means of technical improvements are discussed for iron making, steel making and shaping-treating. A conservation plan is presented for an integrated mill, which could reduce energy use by 20 % and total costs by $ 12 per ton of mill product.

40|$|The present thesis {{depicts the}} results of the {{research}} of tribological high speed steel HS 6 - 5 - 2 remelted with the electric arc. Steel was remelted with different parameters. The amperage of electric arc was changed, the scanning speed was changed and the single, overlapping remeltings were used. There was also the influence of conventional tempering defined, which was conducted after remelting on the tribological resistance of hardened steel. For the previously mentioned processing variants, the intensity of tribological wear was defined and the linear wear were presented, and the friction coefficients. The type of tribological wear was also given, present during the friction, technically dry, of the hardened <b>steel.</b> The lower <b>intensity</b> of tribological wear was received for the single remelting by electric arc of 50 and 70 A. Using the overlapping remeltings for the strengening of the surface layer of the high speed steel HS 6 - 5 - 2 causes the increase of the intensity of tribological wear in comparison to the steel with the single remelting.

40|$|In recent years, {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} ultrafine hydroxyapatite (HAp) powder coating on {{stainless steel substrate}} by electrophoretic deposition gives an active area of research due to their enhanced applicability in the medical field. This makes them very attractive as prosthetic replacements. Ultrafine HAp powder was obtained by milling elemental calcium phosphate mineral. The HAp powder was dispersed into isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonication and magnetic stirring. The HAp powder was deposited by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) using lead as anode and stainless steel substrate as cathode. Powder was coated on stainless steel substrate at a voltage of 60 volt and time was varying from 15 minutes to 1. 5 hours. It was observed that HAp powder deposited at 60 volt for 45 minute gives the best coating. In another set of experiment, coating time was 45 minutes having periodic time of 10 minutes with gap of 2 minutes. It was also observed that there is lack of adherence of powder particles with the substrate. To improve adherence of particles with substrate a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS or NaDS) (C 12 H 25 SO 4 Na) was added during EPD process and subsequently sintering was performed at 8000 C for 2 hours in open atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows the peaks of HAp after deposition. It was observed from XRD spectra that XRD patterns of HAp powder that was prepared by planetary milling and HAp powder was deposited on stainless steel substrate by EPD at 60 volts for 15 minutes. Here the some peaks of HAp are visible in the coated substrate along with peaks of stainless <b>steel.</b> The <b>intensity</b> of HAp peaks in the coated substrate is lesser than pure HAp powder. This {{is due to the}} presence of large peak of stainless steel along with HAp. It was observed from SEM analysis that HAp deposited on stainless steel substrate at 1 hour shows smooth and good adherence where as for deposition of 1. 5 hours shows discontinuous and non-adherence deposition. As the time of deposition is increased there may be formation of thick layer which may generate cracks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} {{stocks in}} a society provide services. Future demand for materials {{is determined by the}} future level of stocks needed to fulfil the services demanded and by the rate of stock retirement. In the present contribution the example of steel use in UK vehicles is examined. Future demand for steel is an important consideration due to its widespread use, and high energy and emissions <b>intensity.</b> <b>Steel</b> production accounts for approximately 9 % of global emissions from energy use and industrial processes. Around 15 Mt of steel is used each year to supply the UK's demand for a variety of goods. Much of this steel is imported, either directly as steel products, or indirectly, being embodied in other goods. The in-use stocks of steel are much higher than this annual flow, in-use stocks were estimated as 820 Mt in 2008 based on extant models. The vehicles sector accounts for around 30 % of annual steel demand in the UK, and is estimated to represent 12 % of the steel stock (due to the long lifetime of buildings and infrastructure these uses dominate steel stocks). It is estimated that currently 40 % of the annual steel demand for vehicles represents net additions to the stock, whilst the remainder is used to replace retired stock. Using a bottom-up analysis, the steel stock in passenger cars is examined in detail. Historic trends in the stock are examined and these are linked to the transport service provided. The future stock of steel in UK passenger cars is estimated under a range of scenarios informed by these historic trends and future transport service requirements. Variations in the rate of vehicle ownership, vehicle mass, steel use per vehicle and vehicle lifetime are considered. The demand for steel implied by each of these estimates of future steel stock is analysed. The implications on the availability of end-of-life steel are also assessed. The energy use and emissions associated with both material production and vehicle fuel use are discussed. The effect of the future scenarios on demand for other materials is examined, this is especially relevant when considering opportunities for material substitution (e. g. replacing steel with aluminium) ...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{iron and}} steel is an {{energy-intensive}} manufacturing process. In 2006, the {{iron and steel industry}} accounted for 13. 6 % and 1. 4 % of primary energy consumption in China and the U. S., respectively (U. S. DOE/EIA, 2010 a; Zhang et al., 2010). The energy efficiency of steel production has a direct impact on overall energy consumption and related carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a methodology for making an accurate comparison of the energy intensity (energy use per unit of steel produced) of steel production. The methodology is applied to the steel industry in China and the U. S. The methodology addresses issues related to boundary definitions, conversion factors, and indicators in order to develop a common framework for comparing steel industry energy use. This study uses a bottom-up, physical-based method to compare the energy intensity of China and U. S. crude steel production in 2006. This year was chosen in order to maximize the availability of comparable steel-sector data. However, data published in China and the U. S. are not always consistent in terms of analytical scope, conversion factors, and information on adoption of energy-saving technologies. This study is primarily based on published annual data from the China Iron & Steel Association and National Bureau of Statistics in China and the Energy Information Agency in the U. S. This report found that the energy <b>intensity</b> of <b>steel</b> production is lower in the United States than China primarily due to structural differences in the steel industry in these two countries. In order to understand the differences in energy <b>intensity</b> of <b>steel</b> production in both countries, this report identified key determinants of sector energy use in both countries. Five determinants analyzed in this report include: share of electric arc furnaces in total steel production, sector penetration of energy-efficiency technologies, scale of production equipment, fuel shares in the iron and steel industry, and final steel product mix in both countries. The share of lower energy intensity electric arc furnace production in each country was a key determinant of total steel sector energy efficiency. Overall steel sector structure, in terms of average plant vintage and production capacity, is also an important variable though data were not available to quantify this in a scenario. The methodology developed in this report, along with the accompanying quantitative and qualitative analyses, provides a foundation for comparative international assessment of <b>steel</b> sector energy <b>intensity...</b>|$|R
