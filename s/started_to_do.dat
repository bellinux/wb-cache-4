5|$|Vlad Ţepeş's only ally, Mihály Szilágyi, was {{captured}} in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szilágyi's men were tortured to death, while Szilágyi was killed by being sawed in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay the delayed Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Vlad Ţepeş provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Braşov), he warned them of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support. Vlad Ţepeş had not paid the annual Jizya (tax on non-Muslims) of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad Ţepeş refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their own recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them. The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him.|$|E

500|$|The {{effects of}} the Great Depression were not felt only on Alberta's farms. [...] By the winter of 1930–1931, {{unemployment}} in Edmonton and Calgary was at record levels, which were only exacerbated by a migration of farmers' offspring, hoping to find work, to the cities. [...] Brownlee, who had long advocated curtailed immigration to the western provinces, urged {{the federal government to}} prevent new migrants from swelling the ranks of Alberta's unemployed. [...] He also asked that it shoulder a greater share of ever-rising relief payments; by 1932, it <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

Andrew Ford interviewed Kelly for ABC radio's The Music Show in May. Ford found the album [...] "very exciting, very visceral ... you can almost smell the sex". Kelly admitted that he preferred R & B music which deals with sex, love, and joy without becoming [...] "either banal or smug". He finds such songs more difficult to write but believes he has <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. 1998 also saw Kelly undertaking a three-week tour of Canada and the US to promote Words and Music.|$|E

Angelou had matured as a writer by the time she wrote Traveling Shoes, to the point {{that she was able to}} play with the form and structure of the work.

500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, [...] "the two of us would go in {{with a lot of}} keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> demos for six, seven months." [...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted to do what we used to do with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} popular social dances created during the 1980s was the Cabbage Patch. The rap group Gucci Crew II created the dance and {{introduced}} it in their 1987 song of the same name, [...] "The Cabbage Patch". Another popular social dance was the Roger Rabbit. This dance imitates the floppy movements of the lead cartoon character as seen in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The rap duo Kid 'n Play created the Kid 'n Play kick-step and performed it in their 1990 movie House Party. It is a variation on the Charleston with elements of the Roger Rabbit and the Running Man. The Running Man {{is one of the most}} recognizable hip-hop social dances. According to Essence magazine, Paula Abdul created the Running Man and taught the dance to Janet Jackson when she was working as her choreographer during Jackson's Control era. Jackson further popularized the dance when she performed it in her 1989 music video [...] "Rhythm Nation", and rapper MC Hammer kept the fervor going when he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Running Man in his performances. The pop duo LMFAO brought the Running Man back into the mainstream with their song [...] "Party Rock Anthem", which was named the 2011 song of the summer by Billboard.com. The accompanying dance in the song called The Shuffle combines three social dances: the Running Man, the (half) Charleston, and the T-step.|$|E

[...] In the 1920s, George Gershwin, Bessie Smith, and Louis Armstrong were in the forefront American popular music and jazz. By the end of the decade, Copland felt his music was going in a more abstract, less jazz-oriented direction. However, as large swing bands such as those of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller became popular in the 1930s, Copland took a renewed interest in the genre.|$|E
2500|$|True American is a fictional, {{convoluted}} drinking {{game that}} the New Girl characters first {{played in the}} season 1 episode [...] "Normal". In September 2012, Producer Brett Baer felt {{the concept of the}} game [...] "deserves its own episode at some point", but the writers were reluctant to repeat the established rules and rather wanted to make it fresh.
