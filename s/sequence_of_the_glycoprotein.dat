The HVS gH gene is located within a block of genes encoding products conserved in all herpesvirus subgroups as represented by the human herpesviruses herpes implex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. In agreement with the biological grouping of HVS as a lymphotropic gammaherpesvirus, its gH amino acid sequence shows greatest similarity to that of the B lymphotropic Epstein-Barr virus, although the nucleotide sequences of their respective gH genes show little similarity given different G +C compositions of 31 ~ and 54 ~. The similarity observed between the gH amino acid sequences of the two representative gammaherpesviruses i greater than that between the two human alphaherpesviruses varicella-zoster vi us and herpes implex virus.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> {{genes of}} fully virulent Sindbis virus and derived mutants that have reduced neurovirulence for neonatal mice (attenuated mutants) has been determined. A single amino acid difference, arginine instead of serine at position 114 of the mature E 2 glycoprotein, distinguished the prototype attenuated mutant from its virulent wild-type parent. Virulent revertants of the attenuated mutant showed same-site reversion to the wild-type sequence. An identical single amino acid substitution, an arginine for the serine at E 2 position 114, {{was found in}} a second independently selected attenuated mutant. The strains are characterized by genetic linkage between attenuation, accelerated penetration of baby hamster kidney cells, and efficient neutralization by the E 2 -specific monoclonal antibodies R 6 and R 13; selection for change in one property simultaneously selected for change in the other two (Olmsted, R.

40|$|The {{cysteine}} residue in the cytoplasmic domain {{at position}} 489 of the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (G protein) isolated from vesicular-stomatitis virions is completely blocked for carboxymethylation. After release of covalently bound fatty acids by hydroxylamine at pH 6. 8, this cysteine residue could be specifically labelled by iodo[14 C]acetic acid. Reaction products were analysed after specific cleavage of labelled G protein at asparagine-glycine bonds by hydroxylamine at pH 9. 3, which generated a C-terminal peptide of Mr 15, 300 containing only the single cysteine residue. Bromelain digestion of [3 H]palmitic acid-labelled membrane fractions of vesicular-stomatitis-virus-infected baby-hamster kidney cells removed almost completely the 3 H radioactivity from the cytoplasmic {{domain of the}} G protein, whereas the ectodomain was completely protected by the microsomal membrane. This result indicates that the acylation site of the G protein is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of intracellular membranes. Taken together, both biochemical techniques strongly suggest that the single cysteine- 489 residue, which is located six amino acid residues distal to the putative transmembrane domain, is the acylation site. The thioester bond between palmitic acid and the G protein is quite resistant to hydroxylamine treatment (0. 32 M at pH 6. 8 for 1 h at 37 degrees C) compared with the reactivity of the thioester linkage in palmitoyl-CoA, which is cleaved at relatively low concentrations of hydroxylamine (0. 05 M) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe first {{potential}} N-glycosylation {{site of the}} {{rabies virus}} glycoprotein, the antigen that carries epitopes for glycoprotein-specific T-cells and virus neutralizing; antibodies, is glycosylated inefficiently. Recently, we showed that addition of a β-N-acetyl-glucosamine moiety to the asparagine residue in the corresponding synthetic fragment V V E D E G C T N L S G F (amino acids 29 – 41), significantly diminished the T-cell stimulatory activity and reduced the characteristic α-helicity of the peptide. The amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> in this region exhibits some degree of variability among different rabies virus and rabies virus related strains, including {{the replacement of the}} asparagine residue with aspartic acid or threonine. In the current study, stimulation of a specific T-cell clone by various viral strains and appropriate tridecapeptide sequences and their analogs was investigated. The T-cell recognition pattern of the rabies and rabies-related viruses was identical to that of the synthetic peptides representing the respective epitope sequences. While the asparagine could be replaced without complete loss of T-cell stimulatory activity, amino acid modifications at the C-terminus of the peptide were not tolerated. In contrast to glycosylation of the asparagine, coupling of an N-acetyl-galactosamine moiety at the serine, or galactosyl-N-acetyl-galactosamine moieties at the threonines preceding or replacing the asparagine (all O-linked sugars in the natural α-anomeric configuration) resulted in epitopes that lowered rather than abolished the T-cell stimulatory activity. All non-glycosylated peptides assumed a low-to-medium helicity in trifluoroethanol. O-glycosylation was more efficient than N-glycosylation in breaking the helical conformation of the peptides to result in the formation of reverse-turns or unordered structure...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{infectious}} diseases {{have been documented}} in reptiles, however minimal information is available concerning their immunological response. One of the most diffuse and lethal reptile pathogen is Testudinid herpesvirus 3 (TeHV 3), a Alphaherpesvirinae. All species of tortoises (Testudinide) are considered susceptible to TeHV 3, however the virus is over represented in the genus Testudo, which includes, among others, T. graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, and T. horsfieldii, that are popular pets in Europe. Incidence of TeHV 3 -associated disease is highest right after hibernation (Origgi, 2012). The aim of this work is to partially characterize the immunological response of T. graeca against TeHV 3. A bacteriophage library composed of about 5. 000 clones containing genomic DNA fragments of TeHV 3 was produced. Bacteriophages were amplified in a specific strain of E. coli and were screened with TeHV 3 -seropositive sera from T. graeca. Phagemids were excised from the positive bacteriophages, sequenced, and compare with the TeHV 3 genome to identify the encoding genes. Six different structural and non-structural proteins have identified as immune relevant. Vero cells where transfected with phagemids of the positive clones, to confirm previous results. TeHV 3 ’s proteins expression was assessed by F. A. C. S using T. graeca seropositive sera. Of all the six selected clones, only that expressing the partial <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> B (gB) showed a positive signal in the F. A. C. S. analysis.

Phylogenetic analysis distinguished seven genotypes, which could {{be divided into two}} major phylogroups having the highest bootstrap values. Phylogroup I comprises the worldwide genotype 1 (classic Rabies virus), the European bat lyssavirus (EBL) genotypes 5 (EBL 1) and 6 (EBL 2), the African genotype 4 (Duvenhage virus), and the Australian bat lyssavirus genotype 7. Phylogroup II comprises the divergent African genotypes 2 (Lagos bat virus) and 3 (Mokola virus). We studied immunogenic and pathogenic properties to investigate the biological significance of this phylogenetic grouping. Viruses from phylogroup I (Rabies virus and EBL 1) were found to be pathogenic for mice when injected by the intracerebral or the intramuscular route, whereas viruses from phylogroup II (Mokola and Lagos bat viruses) were only pathogenic by the intracerebral route. We showed that the glycoprotein R 333 residue essential for virulence was naturally replaced by a D 333 in the phylogroup II viruses, likely resulting in their attenuated pathogenicity. Moreover, cross-neutralization distinguished the same phylogroups. Within each phylogroup, the amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> ectodomain was at least 74 % identical, and antiglycoprotein virus-neutralizing antibodies displayed cross-neutralization. Between phylogroups, the identity was less than 64. 5 % and the cross-neutralization was absent, explaining why the classical rabies vaccines (phylogroup I) cannot protect against lyssaviruses from phylogroup II.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> gB gene of equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV- 4) was determined. The gene {{was located}} within a BamHI genomic library {{by a combination}} of Southern and dot-blot hybridization with probes derived from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) gB DNA sequence. The predominant portion of the coding sequences was mapped to a 2. 95 -kilobase BamHI-EcoRI subfragment at the left-hand end of BamHI-C. Potential TATA box, CAT box, and mRNA start site sequences and the translational initiation codon were located in the BamHI M fragment of the virus, which is located immediately to the left of BamHI-C. A polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, occurs nine nucleotides past the chain termination codon. Translation of these sequences would give a 110 -kilodalton protein possessing a 5 ' hydrophobic signal sequence, a hydrophilic surface domain containing 11 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 3 ' highly charged cytoplasmic domain. A potential internal proteolytic cleavage site, Arg-Arg/Ser, was identified at residues 459 to 461. Analysis of this protein revealed amino acid sequence homologies of 47 % with HSV- 1 gB, 54 % with pseudorabies virus gpII, 51 % with varicella-zoster virus gpII, 29 % with human cytomegalovirus gB, and 30 % with Epstein-Barr virus gB. Alignment of EHV- 4 gB with HSV- 1 (KOS) gB further revealed that four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and all 10 cysteine residues on the external surface of the molecules are perfectly conserved, suggesting that the proteins possess similar secondary and tertiary structures. Thus, we showed that EHV- 4 gB is highly conserved with the gB and gpII glycoproteins of other herpesviruses, suggesting that this glycoprotein has a similar overall function in each virus...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanism by which envelope glycoproteins mediate membrane fusion, we utilized the retroviral avian sarcoma and leukosis virus subgroup A (ASLV(A)) envelope (EnvA) as a model. Molecular modeling based on the amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> predicts the existence of numerous domains including two α-helical regions within the transmembrane (TM) subunit that are conserved throughout other retroviral envelope glycoproteins as well as envelope glycoproteins from other viral families. Substitutions were made within these α-helical regions of both EnvA-TM and the TM subunit of the envelope glycoprotein of the Ebola virus, which shares {{a high degree of}} sequence homology, in order to identify critical residues for envelope function. To further study envelope mediated membrane fusion, we designed and characterized synthetic peptide inhibitors to ASLV(A) entry. The peptide inhibitors derived from the C-terminal α-helix of EnvA-TM proved to be potent inhibitors of both EnvA-mediated infection and cell-cell fusion. Furthermore, the peptide inhibitors were determined not to block the insertion of the fusion peptide domain into a target membrane {{through the use of a}} liposome association assay and allowed the determination of the time course of the conformational changes that occur within EnvA-TM during envelope-mediated membrane fusion. In addition, these peptides were found not to block the receptor-induced oligomerization of EnvA-TM and, in fact, led to the identification of the EnvA-TM oligomer as a pre-hairpin intermediate by cross-linking experiments. A site-directed substitution within EnvA-TM along with substitutions identified from the passaging of a replication-competent version of ASLV(A) in the presence of peptide inhibitor were found to be resistant to the peptide inhibition. A subset of the isolated mutant envelopes were found in regions within EnvA-TM outside of the predicted binding domain of the peptide inhibitor and another subset of the substitutions allow for the infection of cell types that do not express the ASLV(A) receptor, Tva. Further characterization of these mutant envelopes has led to a {{better understand}}ing of how envelope glycoproteins can escape peptide inhibition and has implications in the use of peptide inhibitors as therapeutic agents. ...|$|E

Although this mutant adsorbed to the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature (NPT), it failed to penetrate the cell membrane.

40|$|A steroidogenic tilapia gonadotropin (taGtH=LH) was {{purified}} from pituitaries {{of hybrid}} tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus×O. aureus) and a homologous RIA was established. This RIA enabled {{the study of}} the endocrine regulation of GtH release, the transduction pathways involved in its secretion and its profile during the spawning cycle. Discrepancies between steroid and taGtH peaks during the cycle led to the conclusion that an additional gonadotropin similar to salmonid FSH operates early in the cycle. In order to identify this hormone and to study the endocrine control of synthesis of all gonadotropin (GtH) subunits, a molecular approach was taken. The cDNA sequences and the entire gene sequences encoding the FSHβ and LHβ subunits, as well as an incomplete <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> hormone α subunit (GPα), were cloned. Salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH) elevated mRNA steady-state levels of all three GtH subunits in cultured pituitary cells. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) also stimulated the expression of these subunits and potentiated the effect of GnRH, except that NPY did not affect FSHβ. The GnRH and NPY effects were found to be mediated mainly through protein kinase C (PKC), while protein kinase A (PKA) cascade was involved to a lesser extent. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade takes part in mediating GnRH effects, possibly via PKC. Testosterone (T) and estradiol (E 2), but not 11 -ketotestosterone (KT), are able to elevate GPα and LHβ mRNAs in pituitary cells of early maturing or regressing males. Low levels of T exposure are associated with elevated FSHβ mRNA in cells of mature fish, while higher levels suppress it, but elevate LHβ mRNA. In vivo observations also showed the association of low T levels with increased FSHβ mRNA and high T levels with elevated LHβ mRNA. In accordance with these findings, analysis of LHβ and FSHβ 5 ′ gene-flanking regions revealed on both gene promoters a GtH-specific element (GSE), half site estrogen response elements (ERE), cAMP response element (CRE) and AP 1. In vitro experiments showed that recombinant human activin-A leads to higher levels of GPα, FSHβ and LHβ mRNAs in pituitary cell culture. Porcine inhibin marginally decreased the mRNA levels of GPα and FSHβ, but at a low level (1 ng/ml) it stimulated that of LHβ. These results shed some light on certain hypothalamic and gonadal hormones regulating the expression of GtH subunit genes in tilapia. In addition, they provide evidence for their differential regulation, and insight into their mode of action...|$|E

The BF 19 and BF 21 class I MHC alleles were expressed on these insect cell lines. H 5 -BF 19 produced anti-BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21 produced anti-BF 21 antibodies when injected into a BF 2 / 2 chicken. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence analysis, conventional anti-BF 19 and anti-BF 21 antisera specifically stained the H 5 -BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21 cell lines. Due to the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum transport found in vertebrate cells, the H 5 -BF 19 and H 5 -BF 21 insect cell lines do not insert peptide epitopes into class I MHC glycoproteins that are expressed on the surface of insect cells.

H 5 -BF 19 cells, loaded with peptide 1 (GRRVAAKML), were specifically killed by anti-glycoprotein B CTL. During the cloning and sequencing of the BF 19 and BF 21 class I MHC alleles, a new class I MHC sequence designated BF 21 P was discovered. Comparison of BF 21 P with known MHC class I allele sequences indicates BF 21 P has 80 to 85 % sequence homology with BF 19 and BF 21.

Comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different biological and biochemical properties of isolates of this virus with those of a coyote street rabies virus (COSRV) revealed that there are unique features associated with SHBRV. In vitro studies showed that, while <b>the</b> susceptibility <b>of</b> neuroblastoma cells to infection by both viruses was similar, <b>the</b> infectivity <b>of</b> SHBRV was much higher than that of COSRV in fibroblasts (BHK- 21) and epithelial cells (MA- 104), particularly when these cells were kept at 34 degrees C. At this temperature, low pH-dependent fusion and cell-to-cell spread of virus is seen in BHK- 21 cells infected with SHBRV but not with COSRV. It appears that SHBRV may possess an unique cellular tropism and the ability to replicate at lower temperature, allowing a more effective local replication in the dermis. This hypothesis is supported by in vivo results which showed that while SHBRV is less neurovirulent than COSRV when administered via the intramuscular or intranasal routes, both viruses are equally neuroinvasive if injected intracranially or intradermally.

However, several earlier observations, including <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> EDTA to selectively solubilize the protein, are inconsistent with <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a trans-membrane <b>sequence.</b> In the present report, sequential solubilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-layer <b>glycoprotein</b> by EDTA {{and then with}} detergent revealed <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> two distinct populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-layer <b>glycoprotein.</b> Whereas both S-layer glycoprotein populations underwent signal peptide cleavage and N-glycosylation, base hydrolysis followed by mass spectrometry revealed that a lipid, likely archaetidic acid, modified only <b>the</b> EDTA-solubilized version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein. These observations are consistent with <b>the</b> S-layer <b>glycoprotein</b> being initially synthesized as an integral membrane protein and subsequently undergoing a processing event in which <b>the</b> extracellular portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein is separated from the membrane-spanning domain and transferred to a waiting lipid moiety...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{nucleotide}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IHNV <b>glycoprotein</b> gene {{has been}} determined from a cDNA clone containing the entire coding region. <b>The</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> cDNA clone contained a leader <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> 48 bases, a coding region of 1524 nucleotides, and 39 bases at the 3 foot end. The entire cDNA clone contains 1609 nucleodites and encodes a protein of 508 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence gave a translated molecular weight of 56, 795 daltons. A hydropathicity profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deduced amino acid sequence indicated {{that there were two}} major hydrophobic domains: one,at the N-terminus,delineating a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and the other, at the C-terminus,delineating <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmembrane. Five possible sites of N-linked glyscoylation were identified.

40|$|Three {{outbreaks}} of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have recently occurred in Gabon. Virus has been isolated from clinical materials {{from all three}} outbreaks, and nucleotide <b>sequence</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> gene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolates and virus present in clinical samples has been carried out. These data indicate that each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three outbreaks should be considered an independent emergence of a different Ebola virus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zaire subtype. As in earlier Ebola virus outbreaks, no genetic variability was detected between virus samples taken during an individual outbreak. Since the first recognized {{outbreaks of}} human Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever in Africa in the 1970 s, biological and genetic differences have been described among the four distinct Ebola viruses isolated: Zaire, Sudan, and Côte d’Ivoire, all isolated from humans, and Reston virus isolated from macaque monkeys from the Philippines (1 - 5).

40|$|A cDNA clone {{representing}} <b>the</b> mRNA coding <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fusion <b>glycoprotein</b> (F) gene {{of human}} {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) was constructed and inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of vaccinia virus (WR strain) under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> a vaccinia virus promoter. The resulting recombinant vaccinia virus, vaccinia F, expressed the F 1 and F 2 cleavage products (48 and 20 kDa, respectively) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> F <b>glycoprotein</b> in cell culture. F 1 and F 2 were indistinguishable from their authentic RSV counterparts with respect to glycosylation, disulfide linkage, electrophoretic mobility, cell-surface expression, and antigenic specificity. Cotton rats infected intradermally with vaccinia F developed a high titer of serum F-specific antibodies, which neutralized infectivity of RSV.

40|$|Gastroenteritis is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading causes <b>of</b> {{morbidity}} and mortality among young and newborn animals and is often caused by multiple intestinal infections, with rotavirus and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) being the main viral causes in cattle. Given that BCoV is better studied than equine coronaviruses and given <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> interspecies transmission of these viruses, this research was designed to compare <b>the</b> partial <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spike <b>glycoprotein</b> (S), hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), and nucleoprotein (N) genes from coronaviruses from adult cattle with winter dysentery, calves with neonatal diarrhea, and horses. To achieve this, eleven fecal samples from dairy cows with winter dysentery, three from calves, and two from horses, all from Brazil, were analysed. It could be concluded that the enteric BCoV genealogy from newborn and adult cattle is directly associated with geographic distribution patterns, when S and HE genes are taken into account. A less-resolved genealogy exists for the HE and N genes in cattle, with a trend for an age-related segregation pattern. The coronavirus strains from horses revealed Betacoronavirus sequences indistinguishable from those found in cattle, a fact previously unknown...|$|R

These proteins share sequence homology to nidogen, an extracellular matrix component that appears to participate in cell-matrix adhesion. These proteins also share a homologous domain found in the B 1 chain of laminin, a matrix adhesion protein, and placental protein 12, an insulin-like growth factor I binding protein secreted during pregnancy that has been implicated in regulation of fetal growth. This common domain is also repeated multiple times within the thyroglobulin precursor.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{described}} the alpha 4 /c 113 baby hamster kidney cell line which constitutively expresses the alpha 4 protein, the major regulatory protein of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1). Introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSV- 1 <b>glycoprotein</b> B (gB) gene, regulated as a gamma 1 gene, into these cells yielded a cell line which constitutively expressed both the alpha 4 and gamma 1 gB genes. <b>The</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gB gene was dependent on <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> functional alpha 4 protein. In this article we report that we introduced into the alpha 4 /c 113 and into the parental BHK cells, the HSV- 1 BamHI J fragment, which encodes <b>the</b> domains <b>of</b> four genes, including those of glycoproteins D, G, and I (gD, gG, and gI), and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coding <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> E (gE) gene. In contrast to the earlier studies, we obtained significant constitutive expression of gD (also a gamma 1 gene) in a cell line (BJ) derived from parental BHK cells, {{but not in a}} cell line (alpha 4 /BJ) which expresses functional alpha 4 protein. RNA homologous to the gD gene was present in significant amounts in the BJ cell line; smaller amounts of this RNA were detected in the alpha 4 /BJ cell line. RNA homologous to gE, presumed to be polyadenylated from signals in the vector sequences, was present in the BJ cells but not in the alpha 4 /BJ cells. <b>The</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSV- 1 gD and gE genes was readily induced in the alpha 4 /BJ cells by superinfection with HSV- 2. The BJ cell line was, in contrast, resistant to expression of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 genes. The BamHI J DNA fragment copy number was approximately 1 per BJ cell genome equivalent and 30 to 50 per alpha 4 /BJ cell genome equivalent. We conclude that (i) the genes specifying gD and gB belong to different viral regulatory gene subsets, (ii) the gD gene is subject to both positive and negative regulation, (iii) both gD and gE mRNAs are subject to translational controls although they may be different, and (iv) <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> gD in <b>the</b> alpha 4 /BJ cells reflects <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alpha 4 protein in these cells...|$|R
