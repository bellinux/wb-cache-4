40|$|Abstract. This {{work was}} carried out in a tile ceramic company that works with the wet milling process. The main {{objective}} was to evaluate the variations in the characteristics of the <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder</b> transported vertically using compressed air. The particle size distribution, moisture and fluidity of the <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder</b> were evaluated. The granule morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscope. The main concern was the <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder</b> fluidity, which in turn can impair the loading of the press, causing compaction fluctuations and thereby geometrical and size variations in the pressed samples. The results show that the vertical transportation by compressed air significantly impairs the fluidity of the <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder,</b> reduces the moisture content and change the sphericity of the granules...|$|E

In this study, aztreonam (AZT) was used as the model antibiotic and <b>spray-dried</b> to prepare <b>powders</b> for inhalation. Amino acids of glycine (GLY), histidine (HIS) and leucine (LEU) were used as excipients to modify the spray-dried particles. It was demonstrated that the GLY-AZT <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders</b> formed huge agglomerates with the size of 144. 51 [*]µm, which made it very difficult to be delivered to the lungs (FPF: 0. 29 % w/w only). In comparison with the AZT <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders,</b> HIS-modified <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders</b> showed increased compressibility, indicating larger distance and less cohesion between particles; while the LEU-modified spray-dried particles showed a hollow structure with significantly decreased densities.

The in vitro aerosolisation profile of these systems was assessed using the twin stage impinger; fine particle fractions (FPF) ≥ 50 % of the recovered dose were obtained. Following storage for five months, the aerosolisation performance was reassessed; the NaCMC-free formulation demonstrated a significant decrease in FPF, whereas the performance of the NaCMC-modified formulations was statistically equivalent to their initial performance. Thus, formulation of pMDI suspensions using NaCMC-based <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders</b> is a promising approach for the pulmonary delivery of proteins and peptides...|$|R

40|$|Two areas {{attracting}} {{considerable attention}} when developing effective pulmonary drug delivery systems include {{the improvement of}} aerosolisation efficiency of the inhaled formulation and the controlled release of drug from the formulation following deposition within the lung. In this study, four saccharides were employed as excipients {{in the preparation of}} <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder</b> formulations for the pulmonary drug delivery. Beta-cyclodextrin-, starch-, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) -based spray-dried powders showed a significant (one-way ANOVA, Duncan's test, p < 0. 05) increase in lower stage drug deposition in the Next Generation Impactor (NGI) when compared to lactose-based spray-dried powders. Furthermore, NaCMC-based <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder</b> formulations exhibited a sustained drug release profile in dissolution testing; approximately 80 % of salbutamol sulphate was released after an hour, whereas drug from the lactose-based <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powder</b> formulation was released within 5 min.

The influence of formulation components {{on the characteristics}} of the resultant <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders</b> was examined {{through the use of a}} range of ethanol concentrations (10 - 50 % v/v) in the solvent used to prepare the initial formulations.

The dispersibility of <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders</b> is limited however, and needs to be enhanced to improve lung deposition and subsequent biological activity. In this study, we investigate the utility of leucine as a dry powder dispersibility enhancer when added prior to spray-drying a model non-viral gene therapy formulation (lipid:polycation:pDNA, LPD). Freeze-dried lactose-LPD, spray-dried lactose-LPD and <b>spray-dried</b> leucine-lactose-LPD <b>powders</b> were prepared. Scanning electron microscopy showed that leucine, increased the surface roughness of spray-dried lactose particles. Particle size analysis revealed that leucine-containing <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powders</b> were unimodally dispersed with a mean particle diameter of 3. 12 μm. Both gel electrophoresis and in vitro cell (A 549) transfection showed that leucine may compromise the integrity and biological functionality of the gene therapy vector.

Feedstock powders were then deposited on austenitic stainless steel coupons using APS. Hydrogen or helium was used as secondary plasma gas. Coating microstructure and phase composition were characterised using FEG-ESEM and XRD techniques; coating anatase content was quantified by the Rietveld method. A significant amount of anatase to rutile transformation was found to take place during the plasma spraying process. In general, the coatings had a bimodal microstructure characterised by the presence of completely fused areas in addition to non-molten areas consisting of agglomerates of anatase nanoparticles. Results also showed that anatase content and porosity of the coatings largely depend on the secondary plasma gas nature, {{as well as on the}} characteristics of the feedstock. Finally the photocatalytic activity of the coatings was determined by measuring the degradation of methylene blue dye in an aqueous solution.

The powders generated were of a suitable size for inhalation???with emitted doses over 90 % and fine particle fractions up to 72 % of the loaded dose. Sustained drug release profiles were observed in dissolution tests for both agents: increased chitosan molecular weight associated with increased duration of drug release. The controlled co-delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic entities underlines the capability of spray drying to produce respirable particles with sustained release for delivery to the lung...|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus robusta (Sm.) (ER) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} tree native to {{the east coast of}} Australia, which has also been established in numerous other countries. ER leaves contain high levels of essential oils and are rich in total phenolic compounds (TPC), which have been linked with health benefits; however, there is limited information on the bioactivity of ER leaf extracts. This study aimed to optimise water extraction conditions for TPC, prepare a <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powdered</b> extract and test its physicochemical, antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties. The results showed that optimal water extraction conditions for TPC were 85 °C, 15 min and a water-to-leaf ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g. Under these conditions, <b>spray-dried</b> <b>powdered</b> extract was prepared with a recovery yield of 85 %. The extract was water-soluble and had a TPC level of 407 mg GAE/g. It also possessed potent antioxidant capacity, comparable to pure ascorbic acid, but higher than pure α-tocopherol. In addition, the powdered extract demonstrated significant activity against a panel of cancer cell lines, which included cancers of the pancreas, breast, lung, brain, skin, colon and ovary. Of note, the ER extract exerted a more significant toxic effect on pancreatic cancer (PC) cells compared to gemcitabine, the first line chemotherapeutic agent for PC. We suggest that future studies should purify individual bioactive compounds from ER for further investigation of its potential health promoting and anti-cancer activity...|$|R
