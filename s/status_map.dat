40|$|Abstract — The {{instantaneous}} {{knowledge of}} road course, condition and traffic situation {{ahead of the}} vehicle is of major value {{for all kinds of}} driver assistance systems. In this paper, a method for self-generating an up-to-date road <b>status</b> <b>map</b> of the local area onboard a driving vehicle is presented. A commercial digital road map is not required, since vehicles generate the map based upon satellite based positioning (e. g. GPS) and vehicular ad hoc communication. The vehicles record Geo-Reference Points (GRP) for the driven track, which – besides their geographic location – also include dynamic information recorded by the vehicle, such as road condition, temperature and traffic status. A number of GRPs is combined to form a Geo-Reference List (GRL) which is broadcasted using vehicular ad hoc communication. By integrating received GRLs in the local data basis, a dynamic road <b>status</b> <b>map</b> of the local area can be created. The required market penetration is low (< 5 %) since only occasional communication with a vehicle on the opposite lane is required. In addition to the proposed scheme for self-generated maps, the paper presents first simulative and experimental results. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{evolving}} and standardizing the methodology for desertification <b>status</b> <b>mapping</b> using satellite data for the sub-humid regions under Thematic Programme Network- 1 (TPN- 1) of Regional Action Programme (RAP) formulated by UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Panchkula district of Haryana {{was selected as the}} case study. A reconnaissance survey of the study area was conducted to assess the type, extent, cause and possible consequence of the problem which helped in standardizing the image signatures. It was also used in generating an interpretation key. A number of parameters related to desertification that are amenable to remote sensing and conventional survey were identified and listed. Preparation of Desertification <b>Status</b> <b>Maps</b> (DSM) was an ordered process of certain logical steps carried out using visual interpretation of Satellite data (IRS- 1 D LISS-III geo-coded FCC paper prints) followed by ground truth data collection at selected points and then finalization of preliminary DSM. Latest cloud free satellite data for kharif and rabi season was acquired from NRSA, Hyderabad. The maps prepared were evaluated for their quality based upon spatial accuracy, classification accuracy and cartographic accuracy. A digital database of the information generated was created in GIS. The study revealed that 47. 5 per cent of the total geographical area of the district faces desertification. Five major land uses viz. dryland agriculture, irrigated agriculture, land with scrubs, forest areas and urban areas were found to be affected by desertification. About 32 % of the total desertified area is scrublands while 30 % comes under dryland agriculture. Urbanization constituted 18 % of the desertified lands. Study established that satellite data is very useful in the preparation of three tier DSM maps indicating land use / land cover, process and severity of desertification. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{assessment}} of sensitivity to land degradation of Deliblato sands (the northern part of Serbia), as a special nature reserve. Sandy soils of Deliblato sands are highly sensitive to degradation (given their fragility), while the system of land use is regulated according to the law, consisting of three zones under protection. Based on the MEDALUS approach and {{the characteristics of the}} study area, four main factors were considered for evaluation: soil, climate, vegetation and management. Several indicators affecting the quality of each factor were identified. Each indicator was quantified according to its quality and given a weighting of between 1. 0 and 2. 0. ArcGIS 9 was utilized to analyze and prepare the layers of quality maps, using the geometric mean to integrate the individual indicator map. In turn, the geometric mean of all four quality indices was used to generate sensitivity of land degradation <b>status</b> <b>map.</b> Results showed that 56. 26 % of the area is classified as critical; 43. 18 % as fragile; 0. 55 % as potentially affected and 0. 01 % as not affected by degradation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{pressure}} on forests in Indonesia increases as population growth continues, {{together with the}} rise of higher demand for land for development purposes. This study was conducted in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The objectives of the study are: (i) to analyze changes in land use and land cover in forest areas, (ii) to model changes in land use and land cover, focusing on production forests, the area of forest where land cover should be maintained, and (iii) to formulate policy recommendations based on the two previous objectives. Changes in land use and land cover were analyzed using a series of Landsat imageries from 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2014. The supervised classification imagery analysis was performed using image interpretation software. The results of the image analysis were then overlaid with the Forest Area <b>Status</b> <b>map,</b> which outlined a delineation of production forest in the forest area. The results of the quantitative data were used as inputs for dynamic system modeling, which was performed using Powersim Constructor 8. 1. Descriptive policy recommendations were compiled based on interviews with experts which then analyzed using interpretative structural modeling. The result showed an increasing shift trend inside production forest, from forest land cover towards non-forest land use and land cover. An analysis using dynamic system models can predict a decrease in forest cover if land use policies in forest area are functioning unde...|$|E

40|$|Despite several {{approaches}} that aimed at mobilising East African farmers to embrace {{soil and water}} conservation (SWC) activities, farmers hardly responded since they were seldom involved in the planning of SWC activities. Two tools that employ farmers' participation were developed and applied at Gikuuri catchment in Kenya. The first tool involved farmers to map soil erosion using their own indicators and determine the soil erosion status at catchment scale. This formed the basis upon which they undertook to plan for SWC measures at catchment scale. Farmers also predicted crop yield losses based on the soil erosion status. Farmers widely approved the soil erosion <b>status</b> <b>map</b> since their own indicators and perceptions were used. The second tool provided cash flow trends for a variety of SWC activities and farmer situations. Farmers can use land with a high, moderate or low erosion status and often have rather different socio-economic settings. The net benefits over 5 yr for bench terraces, fanya juu terraces and grass strips were illustrated to assist farmers in making informed decisions on SWC adoption. The two tools increased awareness on the need for collective actions among farmers and showed fields that cause run-on on downslope fields. The improved awareness of erosion problems and the related financial consequences increased farmers' willingness to share the investment costs for cut-off drains...|$|E

40|$|Online {{databases}} containing {{geographic and}} related tabular data for maps and attributes often require continuous updates from widely distributed sources afield. For some applications, {{these data are}} dynamic, and thus are of little value {{if they do not}} reflect the latest information or changes. A <b>status</b> <b>map</b> that depicts graphically temporal data affecting accountability is an example of this type of data. How can accommodations be made collectively for the perpetual data updates in the database and the need to deliver online information in real time without making concessions? The goal of the dissertation was to analyze and evaluate techniques and technology for data collection and storage, online data delivery, and real-time upload. The result of this analysis culminated in the design and prototype of a system that allowed real-time delivery of up-to-date maps and attributes information. A literature review revealed that an ample amount of research material existed on the theory and practice of developing dynamic update techniques. Despite that fact, no research literature was available that specifically dealt with dynamic update techniques that provide for real-time delivery of up-to-date maps while allowing online update of attributes information.

The valley, located in the rain shadow region of Tethys Himalaya, is studded by eight major glaciers and witnesses permafrost condition for nearly six months. The valley experiences semi-arid to arid type of cold climate designated as Bc. The temperature in the valley fluctuates between- 480 C to- 200 C in winters at different altitude levels. The permafrost conditions lead to solifluctuation and gelifluction process producing immature soils and triggering the natural geomorphic hazards, such as snow and rock avalanches, landslides, and fluvio-glacial erosion. The hazards have been largely responsible in the generation of mass movement and other catastrophic activities that result in high morpho-dynamic activity of weathering, breaking of ice, and damming and bursting of lakes causing the desertification of the region.
