5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in <b>south-western</b> France. These divisions raced {{north along the}} Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire to link up {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While {{they did not have to}} fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in <b>south-western</b> France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E

5|$|The Nine Stones, {{also known}} as the Devil's Nine Stones, the Nine Ladies, or Lady Williams and her Dog, is a stone circle located near to the village of Winterbourne Abbas in the <b>south-western</b> English county of Dorset. Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in <b>south-western</b> Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and <b>south-western</b> Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
