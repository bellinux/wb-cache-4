5|$|By {{the time}} Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811–1896) moved to Florida in 1867, {{she was already}} internationally famous for {{authoring}} Uncle Tom's Cabin, published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning slavery in the United States. Stowe's opposition to slavery sprang from a moral passion based on her Christian faith. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up {{the daughter of a}} Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{the court was}} central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. Lavish court display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from into an ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule, Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI, the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated {{the image of a}} philosopher king.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{the court was}} central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated {{the image of a}} philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine. After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.|$|E

5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. {{roll-call}} at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving her sentence, but her absence was not officially noted until she also {{failed to show up}} at a second roll-call later that evening. The news of her disappearance was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been heading for the last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> close while they were in prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely to have jurisdiction in the case.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism. In her stories and novels, Edith Wharton (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, Eastern-seaboard society in which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up. One of her finest books, The Age of Innocence, centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider.|$|E
25|$|Grossman was {{credited}} with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company. She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.

Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers.

She would read books to them, write letters to their families for them, talk to them, and support them.|$|E
25|$|The {{researcher}} Gareth Medway {{noted that}} in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated {{that she had been}} a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had psychic powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a chaos magickian.|$|E
25|$|Gervas's second {{marriage}} was to Elspeth Grant (19071997) in 1931; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up in Kenya {{and was a}} friend of Joy Adamson. After the marriage she wrote White man's country: Lord Delamere and the Making of Kenya. Her life and work are the subject of a 2002 biography. As an author, Elspeth Huxley was well up to Huxley standards, {{and one of the few}} wives who was better-known than her husband. The Flame Trees of Thika (1959) was perhaps the most celebrated of her thirty books; it was later adapted for television. They had one son, Charles (19442015).|$|E

25|$|When Hunt Stromberg, {{the last}} {{producer}} she respected, left MGM to produce independently, Loos {{tried to get}} out of her contract as well, but by then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> into too valuable a property to the studio. Throughout the war Loos wrote screenplays, grew vegetables in her Victory garden and knitted socks and sweaters for the boys overseas. MGM let her go before her contract ran out. This time she decided to become a free agent, and even returned to New York to work on a new play. When she returned to California, she had a new partner who had a drinking problem; the relationship would be short-lived.|$|E
25|$|Shown this {{evidence}} by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, {{which can cause}} liver cancer; clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It {{was because of the}} discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material.|$|E
25|$|Josephine {{wrote in}} I Married Wyatt Earp {{that she and}} Wyatt were married in 1892 {{offshore}} by the captain of Lucky Baldwin's yacht.
