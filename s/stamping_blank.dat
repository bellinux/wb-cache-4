The development of automated lay-up technologies further extends {{the applicability of}} stamp forming by allowing rapid lay-up of tailored blanks and partial preconsolidation.

This paper aims to highlight consolidation challenges that can appear when <b>stamp</b> forming <b>blanks</b> manufactured by automated lay-up.

Additionally, deconsolidation of the prepreg does not seem to obstruct interlaminar bonding, while intralaminar voids initially present in a prepreg cannot be removed during stamp forming. An additional preconsolidation step after automated lay-up seems necessary to remove blank thickness variations and intralaminar voids for the current prepregs. Eliminating this process step and the successful combination of rapid automated lay-up and stamp forming requires prepregs which are void-free and have less thickness variation...|$|R

These parts are mainly made from steel, high strength steel, stainless steel and aluminum. New requirements from industry in particular with lightweight design calls for the increased use of new construction materials, such as aluminum, magnesium titanium or steel alloys with maximum strengths of up to 1. 000 MPA and higher. Parallel to the requirement for alternative materials, the shape of the parts is also becoming increasingly complex. Conventional hydro-forming techniques are coming closer and closer to their technological limits. Improvements to hydro-forming technology incorporate new solutions for using temperature as an additional process factor. Most of the materials used for hydro-forming demonstrate much better formability at elevated temperatures. In order to make full use of these possibilities it was necessary to find new temperature-resistant forming media. The first step was thermal oil up to 300 °C, the second step permits the utilisation of gaseous medias, such as nitrogen, forming temperatures up to 1 000 °C. During this development process not only a large number of test parts and prototypes were produced, also first series applications were realized, mainly in aluminum. Increasing the thermal process limits has also made it possible today to produce parts not only in magnesium but also in titanium (600 °C) and steel (900 °C).

These parts are mostly made of the steel, mild steel, high strength steel, stainless steel and aluminium. New requirements of the global market demand lightweight designs especially for mobility. The reduction of weight can be achieved by using lightweight materials, materials with higher strengths (1000 MPa or higher), optimised structural design or a combination of those. In any case, advanced forming technologies are required to reach the necessary formability to form these materials in the demand shapes. To meet the new requirements, the forming temperature has been introduced as a variable process parameter. Lightweight materials need elevated temperatures to achieve the necessary formability. These, in turn require increasingly complex geometries. To use the potential of higher forming temperatures it is necessary to deal with temperature resistant forming medias. In the first step, a thermal oil was used up to 300 °C, in the second step, gaseous medias, such as nitrogen, were chosen to reach forming temperatures up to 1. 000 °C.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{lifetime}} of blanking tools, the application of high quality steel, heat treatment and coatings has become an interesting issue for many European companies dealing with <b>stamping,</b> punching and <b>blanking</b> operations. Important trends such as longer lifetime, higher accuracy and higher complexity of the products are challenging and require more special materials and techniques. The technological solutions to improve the existing processes are not obvious because of the enormous amount of possibilities in available materials, heat and surface treatments such as PVD coatings for the envisaged industrial processes and applications. An in-depth research to understand the manufacturing processes with the consequence of an increased performance and lifetime of the tools {{as well as the}} opportunity of further optimization was the main goal of this project. In many blanking processes where heavy duty conditions are applied, the use of hard metals, durable coatings and wear resistant tool steel is already established to extend the lifetime. The tools studied in this project were applied without coatings. The increasing production rate and the use of high strength steel sheet induce wear, crack formation and flaking of blanking tools with consequent low lifetimes. This project studied the tribological synergy of the substrate-heat treatment-surface preparation relationship and their influence on lifetime in heavy load conditions.

40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{has been}} widely studied and increasingly applied in the automotive industry. This process is characterized by its ability to stamp high strength steels, yielding products with high mechanical strength, thus reducing the weight of stamped components and therefore the vehicles weight. It also demands less energy because steel sheets can be heated by induction, more efficient than electric furnaces. With controlled thinning, {{it is possible to}} manufacture thinner stamped parts with high mechanical strength, therefore it is necessary to know the formability limits to prevent failure and achieve the largest possible thickness reduction. In this work the hot formability of DIN 27 MnCrB 5 steel sheets 4 mm thick, under thinning conditibns was evaluated by numerical simulation with the finite element (FEM) software Forge 2008. Tensile tests were carried out at 500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C and with strain rates from 0. 1 to 4 s(- 1). With the results of tensile tests, it was possible to calculate Hensel-Spittel coefficients to model the steel sheet and simulate the hot Nakazima test to evaluate the highest dome which could be formed without failure risks caused by sheet thinning. Simulation results obtained with specimens 200 mm long and 125, 150 or 200 mm wide that were stamped at 930 degrees C, showed the radial position and dome height associated to plastic instability as well provided the thickness distribution along the specimen. The numerical results were compared to experimental tests and showed a good agreement in terms of failure initiation and localization. As a result, a new numerical and experimental strategy was elaborated to define the hot formability based on the plastic instability and necking localization as a function of <b>stamping</b> temperature and <b>blank</b> dimensions. This strategy proved to be useful to define the safe formability region and therefore the larger thickness reduction that can be done during hot stamping to reduce vehicular components weight and to avoid cracks and failures usually observed in components like clutch covers.

On the other hand, demands as far as component complexity, function integration and component quality are concerned are becoming ever higher. The press hardening technology involving the use of boron-manganese alloyed steel for blank- based component applications represent {{the state of the}} art. Typical applications include reinforcement parts in crash-relevant car body structures. Consistent use of these components will enable the needs of current and future car models as regards crash performance to be met whilst maintaining acceptable structural weights. In addition to press hardened components, hydro-formed profiles also provide a high level of potential for applications in structural car body elements with high loads. At the same time, hydro-forming tubes and blanks at room temperature is also representative {{of the state of the}} art for a number of applications in car body structures or exhaust systems, as well as for special applications outside the car industry. These parts are mainly made from materials such as steel, high-strength steel, stainless steel and aluminium. Increased demands on hydro-formed parts in terms of maximum strength and complexity mean that the limits of conventional hydro-forming processes have been reached. The use of temperature as a process parameter in hydro-forming offers the opportunity to increase the application field of this innovative technology. The potential of this strategy has been identified; complex car body parts fabricated in aluminium and magnesium have been produced at high temperatures. However, fluids available today can only be used up to 300 °C because of the limited thermal resistance of these fluids. Gaseous media (e. g. nitrogen) offer the chance to make use of the potential of temperature-assisted hydro-forming in steel forming as well. Consequently, temperatures up to 1000 °C can be provided.
