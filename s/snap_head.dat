The last HouseGuest standing {{will be the new}} Head of Household. William was the winner. Karen and Kevin were given a secret mission to throw a tiki party and convince seven people to give them a piece of clothing. If they succeed, there will be no Have-Nots for the week. if they fail, Karen and Kevin will be the only Have-Nots for the week. They passed their task and there were no Have-Nots for the week. Half of the HouseGuests were given a task to create snack bites to represent the other HouseGuests. The tasters must identify which taster the snack represents. If they can identify four snacks, the HouseGuests will receive a reward. The HouseGuests passed their task and received a campfire sleepover. On Day 28, William nominated Dillon and Emily for eviction. On Day 29, William, Dillon, and Emily, joined by Karen, Dre, and Kevin, flipped out in the Flip It to Win Power of Veto competition, sponsored by the Brick. In this competition, HouseGuests will compete in head-to-head matches. In each round, they will be shown a series of items from the Brick. They will then be asked a question based on the items. They must go to the items and flip over the cards next to the correct answer and buzz in. The HouseGuest who correctly flips the most items quicker will win the round and eliminate their opponent. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto and a $5000 gift card from the Brick. Kevin was the winner. He was given the opportunity to double his money by finding the two correct couch cushions. He was successful and earned another $5000. On Day 31, Kevin decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 34, Emily was evicted by a vote of 8-1. The HouseGuests were then informed that Neda's immunity was up and that it was a double eviction. The HouseGuests immediately competed in Before or After the Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had to answer if one event happened before or after another event. If they were incorrect, they were eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Sindy was the winner. Sindy nominated Dillon and Jackie for eviction.

50|$|Ballroom tangos use {{different}} music and styling from the tangos from the River Plata region (Uruguay and Argentina), with more staccato movements and the characteristic <b>head</b> <b>snaps.</b> The <b>head</b> <b>snaps</b> are totally foreign to Argentine and Uruguayan tango, and {{were introduced in}} 1934 {{under the influence of}} a similar movement in the legs and feet of the tango from the River Plate, and the theatrical movements of the pasodoble. This style became very popular in Germany and was soon introduced to England. The movements were very popular with spectators, but not with competition judges.|$|R

40|$|Background: : Essential tremor is {{characterized}} by several hyperkinetic movements, including arm and head tremors.   We report another movement of the head in patients with essential tremor, which we term the "head snap. " This was observed as a jerking motion of the head in some patients while they performed the finger-nose-finger maneuver. Methods: : We compared the prevalence of the <b>head</b> <b>snap</b> in essential tremor patients vs. Parkinson's disease patients. We also assessed the clinical correlates of the <b>head</b> <b>snap.</b>   Results: : Ten (20 %) of 50 essential tremor patients exhibited a <b>head</b> <b>snap</b> of any severity (rating ≥ 0. 5) vs. 0 of 50 Parkinson's disease patients (p = 0. 001). Patients with <b>head</b> <b>snap</b> had more severe arm tremor on Archimedes spiral drawings (p = 0. 019) {{and were more likely}} to have head tremor (p = 0. 03) than those without it. Conclusions: This sign could be a useful aid in the clinical diagnosis of tremor. </p...|$|R
