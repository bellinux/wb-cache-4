Based on crystal plasticity theory, one assesses how {{the distribution of}} strain and stress {{is influenced by the}} presence of a <b>soft</b> <b>b.</b> c. c. phase and a strong f. c. c. phase. The two phases have been characterized by neutron diffraction. Initial textures are used as input in crystal plasticity simulations. Lattice strains measured in the tensile direction serve to fit hardening parameters. Three modeling hypotheses are tested: the Taylor model assumes uniform strain, the ALAMEL model considers the interaction of pairs of adjacent grains, and a finite element mesh is used to distribute strain and stress over the complete aggregate. The accuracy of each modeling is evaluated based on experimental measurements of the macroscopic stress, the heterogeneity of plastic strain, and the texture development in the two phases. status: publishe...|$|E

Postprocessing tools with automated detection, segmentation, and volumetric analysis of lung nodules may expedite radiological processes and give additional confidence to the radiologists. PURPOSE To compare two different postprocessing software algorithms (LMS Lung, Median Technologies; LungCARE®, Siemens) in CT volumetric measurement and to analyze the effect of <b>soft</b> (<b>B</b> 30) and hard reconstruction filter (B 70) on automated volume measurement.

The structural varia-tions were attempted by changing chemical composition and molecular weight of both hard A and <b>soft</b> <b>B</b> segments and their weight ratio in the polymer. In ad-dition, the influence of bulk and/or surface modifiers, such as "reacted-in " poly-siloxanes and fluorinated polyalkylether glycols, was also investigated. The degree of softening, expressed as a percentage decrease of the elastic modulus (5 % tensile modulus) upon two hours exposure to the testing environ-ment, is significant, reversible and depends on the ratio of hard to soft segment and the extent of microphase separation. Since these parameters can be se-lected during the polymer synthesis and processing into desirable shapes, the degree of softening can thus be controlled. This softening at body temperature represents one of the most notable performance advantages of these biomate-rials.

The common characteristics of these models are that they use the see-saw with right-handed neutrinos, predict a normal hierarchy of masses for the neutrinos observed in oscillating experiments and in the basis where the right-handed Majorana mass is diagonal, the charged lepton mixings are tiny. In addition these models link the up-quark Yukawa matrix to the neutrino Yukawa matrix Y ν with → 0. Using this condition, we find that the required baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be explained by the soft leptogenesis using the <b>soft</b> <b>B</b> parameter of the second lightest right-handed neutrino whose mass turns out to be around 108 GeV.

The calculated Raman spectra under different pressures are in good agreement with available experimental results and the symmetry assignments of the Raman peaks of alpha-PbO 2 -type TiO 2 are given for the first time. In addition, we identified two anomalously IR-active soft phonon modes, B 1 u and B 3 u, respectively, around 200 cm- 1 which have not been observed in high pressure experiments. Comparison of the phonon dispersions at 0 and 10 GPa reveals that softening of phonon modes also occurs for the zone-boundary modes.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{standard}} model to include a weak-triplet and color-octet scalar. This `octo-triplet' field consists of three particles, two charged and one neutral, whose masses and renormalizable interactions depend only on two new parameters. The charged octo-triplet decay into a W boson and a gluon is suppressed by a loop factor and an accidental cancellation. Thus, the main decays of the charged octo-triplet may occur through higher-dimensional operators, mediated by a heavy vectorlike fermion, into quark pairs. For an octo-triplet mass below the tb̅ threshold, the decay into Wbb̅ or Wbs̅ through an off-shell top quark has a width comparable to that into cs̅ or cb̅. Pair production with one octo-triplet decaying into two jets and the other decaying into a W and two <b>soft</b> <b>b</b> jets may explain the dijet-plus-W excess reported by the CDF Collaboration. Using a few kinematic distributions, we compare two mechanisms of octo-triplet pair production: through an s-channel coloron and through the coupling to gluons. The higher-dimensional operators that allow dijet decays also lead to CP violation in B_s - B̅_s mixing. Comment: 18 pages.

40|$|We have {{designed}} and successfully prepared a well-defined ABA type triblock {{copolymer consisting of}} poly(n-butyl acrylate) as <b>soft</b> <b>B</b> block and poly{ 2, 5 -bis[(4 -methoxyphenyl) oxycarbonyl]styrene} (PMPCS) as hard A block with potential as liquid crystalline thermoplastic elastomer (LCTPE). The synthetic strategy is to obtain a difunctional poly(n-butyl acrylate) first and then {{use it as a}} macroinitiator for chain extension. Both steps employ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Kinetic study of the chain-extension polymerization demonstrates a well-controlled process. The resulted triblock copolymers have high molecular weights (M(n) > 70 000) and low molecular weight distributions (M(w) /M(n) < 1. 2). Their chemical structures are confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Curves of differential scanning calorimetry indicate the immiscibility of the two components. Morphological investigations were made with transmission electrical microscopy and gave direct evidence of the existence of nanophase-separated structures with long-range order. After examinations by polarized optical microscopy, we found the triblock copolymers are LC only if the molecular weight of PMPCS block exceeds 20 000. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements indicate a very stable nematic phase between glass transition of PMPCS block and decomposition. We found three samples are elastomeric. Preliminary mechanical tests were done on their films. Typical dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile tests prove that the sample has the potential as thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). According to our best knowledge, the unique triblock copolymer is the first reported well-defined ABA type TPE imparting liquid crystallinity to the hard domains which serve as "physical cross-links".

40|$|A {{series of}} poly[methyl {{methacrylate}} (M) -b-styrene (S) -b-butadiene (B) -b-S-b-M], or MSBSM, pentablock copolymers {{have been successfully}} synthesized by sequential living anionic polymerization initiated with the diadduct of tert-butyllithium (t-BuLi) onto m-diisopropenylbenzene (m-DIB) in a cyclohexane/diethyl ether mixture for the butadiene and styrene polymerization at room temperature and in a cyclohexane/THF mixture for the MMA polymerization at − 78 °C. All the pentablock copolymers have a monomodal and narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn < 1. 20), and their weight composition varies from 11 to 55 % M, 18 to 55 % S, and 15 to 64 % B. Toluene-cast films of these copolymers have been analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All these materials show a phase separation of the <b>soft</b> <b>B</b> component from the hard S and M blocks, which cannot, however, be distinguished one from each other by DSC or DMA. Indeed, a single transition is observed for the binary hard phase at a temperature intermediate between the glass transition temperature of polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). In addition to classical phase morphologies, such as cylindrical and lamellar phase organization, two nonclassical morphologies, i. e., catenoid−lamellar and strut phase structures have been observed by TEM. The phase morphology strongly depends on the pentablock composition and any chemical modification of blocks. For instance, the cylindrical morphology, characteristic of an MSBSM copolymer containing equal amounts of hard and soft phases, is changed into a lamellar morphology upon hydrogenation of the B midblock. Copolymers of a relatively low hard phase content typically behave as thermoplastic elastomers of high ultimate tensile strength (ca. 30 MPa) and elongation at break (ca. 900 %). These mechanical properties, however, depend on the casting solvent. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} and electronic {{properties of the}} intercalation compound LixSnO 2 (x = 1 / 16, 1 / 8, 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 1) {{as well as the}} inherent diffusion mechanism of Li ion into the rutile SnO 2 were investigated by means of periodic density functional calculations. Optimized structural parameters, cohesive energies, electronic band structure, and density-of-states and Mulliken charges for the LixSnO 2 system at different Li ordering for each Li content are reported. The energetic profiles for the Li diffusion process into rutile SnO 2 are also presented. Our calculation indicates substantial host distortion around intercalation sites, predominantly along the ab-planes. These deformations are found {{to be related to the}} <b>soft</b> <b>B</b> 1 g, Eu, A 2 g, and A 1 g vibrational modes of very low frequency and therefore easy to be achieved. The corresponding variation in volume monotonically increases with the Li concentration. Cohesive energies are consistent with continuous and reversible intercalation process. In lithiated SnO 2, lithium is significantly ionized; however, the distribution pattern of the charge transferred from the lithium to the host is very dependent upon the ion concentration. By increasing the Li content, the relative amount of charge transferred to the Sn atoms decreases whereas the charge transferred to oxygen atoms increases. Lithium intercalation causes a chemical reduction of SnO 2 and yields metallic properties. Effects induced by Li intercalation on the electronic band structures of SnO 2 were assessed according to their origins, i. e., if they originate from lattice expansion or from chemical reduction. The energy difference between the valence-band maximum and conduction-band minimum of lithiated SnO 2 decreases with increasing Li content. Lithium diffusion along the c-direction demands significantly lower activation energy than the energy required for diffusion along ab-planes. Energetic barriers related to the lithium diffusion into SnO 2 were found to be dependent upon the Li content...|$|E
