Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though {{it is difficult to}} <b>say</b> <b>why</b> these two received particular mention, it could be related to the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.|$|E

25|$|An operatic {{version of}} The Wicked World {{had been on}} Gilbert's mind for some time. As early as 1897, he had {{suggested}} the idea to Helen Carte, the wife and partner of Richard D'Oyly Carte. Arthur Sullivan, André Messager, Jules Massenet, Liza Lehmann and Alexander Mackenzie, to whom he offered it in turn, all objected {{to the absence of}} a male chorus. Edward Elgar also turned it down, but did not <b>say</b> <b>why.</b> Gilbert finally found a willing collaborator in Edward German.|$|E

In June 2006, Moazzam Begg, a British man who had also been held at Guantanamo Bay but was released in 2005, claimed in his book, Enemy Combatant: A British Muslim's Journey to Guantanamo and Back, that Hicks had abandoned his Islamic beliefs, and had been denounced by a fellow inmate, Uthman al-Harbi, for his lack of observance. This has also been confirmed by his military lawyer, Major Michael Mori. He declined to <b>say</b> <b>why</b> Hicks {{was no longer a}} Muslim, saying it was a personal issue.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{mathematical}} empiricism, {{formulated by}} Quine and Putnam, is primarily {{supported by the}} indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and {{if we want to}} believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to <b>say</b> <b>why</b> light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.|$|E

During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as [...] "violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm". He was quoted in 1950 remarking, [...] "If you <b>say</b> <b>why</b> not bomb [...] tomorrow, I <b>say,</b> <b>why</b> not today?

500|$|Avogadro {{developed}} this hypothesis {{in order to}} reconcile Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac's 1808 law on volumes and combining gases with Dalton's 1803 atomic theory. The greatest difficulty Avogadro had to resolve was the huge confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules—one {{of the most important}} contributions of Avogadro's work was clearly distinguishing one from the other, admitting that simple particles too could be composed of molecules, and that these are composed of atoms. Dalton, by contrast, did not consider this possibility. [...] Curiously, Avogadro considers only molecules containing even numbers of atoms; he does not <b>say</b> <b>why</b> odd numbers are left out.|$|E
500|$|On 9 February, {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of Charles Portal, Chief of the Air Staff and Sholto Douglas, Cunningham arrived at the Air Ministry. He was ordered to report to Geoffrey de Havilland at Hatfield, though neither of the senior officers would <b>say</b> <b>why.</b> When Cunningham met Geoffrey de Havilland he was summoned to a hangar. It {{was the first time}} Cunningham had laid eyes on the de Havilland Mosquito. Cunningham flew W4050—the prototype—on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the [...] "lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics"; Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it would be a perfect replacement for the Bristol Beaufighter.|$|E

500|$|Gilruth said, [...] "I {{remember}} that Piccard was very, very {{hurt by the}} National Geographic that would not give them a dime....Both he and Jeanette {{said that they were}} discriminated against by the National Geographic. That's not a good word. They were not aided in any way by the National Geographic, and they felt it was not really warranted. They felt they should have gotten some help from them.... didn't <b>say</b> <b>why,</b> but they certainly didn't feel they'd been handled fairly." [...] The Piccards struggled to gain financial support until the Grigsby-Grunow Radio Company advanced them several thousand dollars. The Detroit Aero Club and People's Outfitting Company also backed them. To supplement their sponsorship, Jeannette designed and sold commemorative stamps and souvenir programs and folders. She also raised a good deal of money by selling their story in press releases to the North American Newspaper Alliance.|$|E
500|$|Lewinski was succeeded {{that year}} as rabbi by Hyman Rosenberg, and in October {{of the same}} year a new {{secretary}} was elected, in a close-fought battle between two factions. When {{it was time for the}} former secretary to hand over the financial books, a member, Simon Freudenthal, was alleged to have grabbed them, jumped out a window, and ran away with them. When he returned, he refused to <b>say</b> <b>why</b> he took them, and insisted he would keep them. A warrant was issued for his arrest on the charge of larceny, and he was released on bail. Ten days later the synagogue president, American Civil War veteran Colonel Solomon Monday, was arrested and charged in turn with libel, for allegedly claiming that Freudenthal stole [...] "sacred books". Monday, in turn, had Freudenthal charged in November with stealing $8 (today $) worth of [...] "sacred books" [...] during [...] "divine service". Later that month both cases were dismissed. In early 1888, another case was brought, and dismissed, over attempts by one faction to expel members of the other faction.|$|E
