25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by the}} size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since <b>scanning</b> <b>time</b> directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E

50|$|The {{contrast}} seeker is {{a simple}} device that can be implemented using very basic analog electronics. It first uses some form of automatic gain control to adjust the image brightness until it contains some areas with high-contrast spots. This produces a bias voltage signal to represent the background brightness level, making brighter objects stand out. Any rapid change in contrast along a given scan line causes the voltage from the camera to suddenly change. If the change is greater than a selected threshold, it triggers a second circuit that sends {{the output of the}} <b>scanning</b> <b>time</b> base generator into capacitors. Thus the capacitors store a voltage value representing the Y and X locations of any high contrast spot within the image.|$|E

50|$|The {{increased}} use of CT scans has been the greatest in two fields: screening of adults (screening CT of the lung in smokers, virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, and whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients) and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the <b>scanning</b> <b>time</b> to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, {{is one of the}} main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population (especially for the diagnosis of appendicitis). As of 2007 in the United States a proportion of CT scans are performed unnecessarily. Some estimates place this number at 30%. There are a number of reasons for this including: legal concerns, financial incentives, and desire by the public. For example, some healthy people avidly pay to receive full-body CT scans as screening, but it is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the risks and costs, because deciding whether and how to treat incidentalomas is fraught with complexity, radiation exposure is cumulative and not negligible, and the money for the scans involves opportunity cost (it may have been more effectively spent on more targeted screening or other health care strategies).|$|E
50|$|Medical {{sonography}} (ultrasonography) is an ultrasound-based diagnostic {{medical imaging}} technique used to visualize muscles, tendons, and many internal organs, to capture their size, structure and any pathological lesions with real time tomographic images. Ultrasound {{has been used by}} radiologists and sonographers to image the human body for at least 50 years and has become a widely used diagnostic tool. The technology is relatively inexpensive and portable, especially when compared with other techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Ultrasound is also used to visualize fetuses during routine and emergency prenatal care. Such diagnostic applications used during pregnancy are referred to as obstetric sonography. As currently applied in the medical field, properly performed ultrasound poses no known risks to the patient. Sonography does not use ionizing radiation, and the power levels used for imaging are too low to cause adverse heating or pressure effects in tissue.Although the long-term effects due to ultrasound exposure at diagnostic intensity are still unknown, currently most doctors feel that the benefits to patients outweigh the risks. The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle has been advocated for an ultrasound examination - that is, keeping the <b>scanning</b> <b>time</b> and power settings as low as possible but consistent with diagnostic imaging - and that by that principle non-medical uses, which by definition are not necessary, are actively discouraged.|$|E

Moreover, the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> {{correction}} of SUV does of course not reduce the independent substantial influence of inter-study variability in blood concentration on the resulting SUV [7].

40|$|In the {{conventional}} single-echo three dimension (3 D) time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), it always takes long <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> {{to obtain the}} good images. In addition, high-resolution MRA with flow compensation requires long echo time (TE). Here, a reverse elliptical centric dual-echo 3 D TOF MRA pulse sequence was developed to reduce the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> and minimize the effective TE. Dual-echo and reverse elliptical centric acquisition in the phase encoding and slice phase encoding direction were used to reduce the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> by 61 %. Furthermore, the effective echo time (TE) was also minimized from 4. 8 ms to 4. 1 ms.

The {{results show that the}} CNR only decrease by 2. 5 % with the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> reduced to 39 % when compared with {{the conventional}} single-echo 3 D TOF. Compared with the conventional dual-echo 3 D TOF acquisition, the developed pulse sequence brings advantages in three aspects: (1) reduce <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> by 22 %; (2) increase CNR by 10 %; (3) reduce the artifacts induced by dual-echo effects.

Increasing the illumination area thus reduces the amount of generated nonlinear photons unless the energy is increased. Optical damage depends on the energy density, i.e. peak intensity per area Ip=E/(τA). Therefore, both the area and energy can be easily increased without the risk of optical damage if the peak intensity per area is kept low, and yet a gain in the amount of generated nonlinear photons can be obtained because of the quadratic dependence. For example, increasing both the area and energy 1000 fold, leaves the peak intensity unchanged but increases the generated nonlinear photons by 1000 fold. This 1000 extra photons are indeed generated over a larger area. In imaging this means that the extra 1000 photons are spread over the image, which at first might not seem an advantage over multiphoton scanning microscopy. The advantage however becomes evident when the size of the image and the <b>scanning</b> <b>time</b> are considered.

Written informed consent was provided by all volunteers at enrollment. The 26 healthy volunteers enrolled in this study underwent Doppler ultrasound of both kidneys using audible and inaudible pulses in randomized order and at 1 -week intervals. Doppler waveforms were obtained at the interlobar or arcuate arteries using a 2 -mm Doppler gate. Each session was considered complete when reproducible waveforms were obtained for 5 s in three predefined regions of the kidney. The <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> needed to obtain waveforms of the right and left kidneys were recorded separately. Measurements were compared using a paired t-test and a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The total recorded Doppler sonography <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> for each kidney ranged from 33 to 146 s.
