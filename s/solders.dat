5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} <b>solders,</b> {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for <b>solders</b> is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth <b>solders</b> (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth <b>solders</b> about average. The acidification potential for the <b>solders</b> is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth <b>solders</b> about average.|$|E
5|$|The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) for {{reduction}} of lead has broadened bismuth's use in electronics {{as a component}} of low-melting point <b>solders,</b> as a replacement for traditional tin-lead <b>solders.</b> Its low toxicity will be especially important for <b>solders</b> to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes, although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry, in the EU for example.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{copper alloys}} have been formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat <b>solders</b> used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free <b>solders</b> consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solder</b> mask or <b>solder</b> stop mask or <b>solder</b> resist {{is a thin}} lacquer-like {{layer of}} polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent <b>solder</b> bridges from forming between closely spaced <b>solder</b> pads. A <b>solder</b> bridge is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of <b>solder.</b> PCBs use <b>solder</b> masks to prevent this from happening. <b>Solder</b> mask is not always used for hand <b>soldered</b> assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are <b>soldered</b> automatically using reflow or <b>solder</b> bath techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the <b>solder</b> mask wherever components are <b>soldered,</b> which is accomplished using photolithography. <b>Solder</b> mask is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic <b>soldering</b> is a flux-less <b>soldering</b> {{process that}} uses {{ultrasonic}} energy, {{without the need}} for chemicals to <b>solder</b> materials, such as glass, ceramics, and composites, hard to <b>solder</b> metals and other sensitive components which cannot be <b>soldered</b> using conventional means. Ultrasonic (U/S) <b>soldering,</b> as a flux-less <b>soldering</b> process, is finding growing application in <b>soldering</b> of metals and ceramics from solar photovoltaics and medical shape memory alloys to specialized electronic and sensor packages. U/S <b>soldering</b> has been reported since 1955 as a method to <b>solder</b> aluminum and other metals without the use of flux.|$|R

5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, <b>solders</b> and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} â€“ bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for <b>solders,</b> fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as <b>solders,</b> in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of powder size in <b>solder</b> paste on the <b>solder</b> volume applied by paste printing has been examined. The applied <b>solder</b> volume {{increased with decreasing}} the average diameter of <b>solder</b> powder which are contained in the <b>solder</b> paste. The <b>solder</b> paste with fine <b>solder</b> powder easily caused a <b>solder</b> bridging failure between the electrodes for a fine pitch QFP after reflow <b>soldering.</b> The measurement value of the applied <b>solder</b> volume was good accordance with the approximate half of the calculated volume using the close-packed model in which the powder with the average diameter is close-packed in the opening space of the stencil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Solder</b> joint shape {{refers to}} {{geometry}} that molten <b>solder</b> {{can be achieved}} with spreading and wetting along the metal surface in the junction between components <b>solder</b> pins and printed circuit board (PCB) pad, to the metal surface contact angle and <b>solder</b> fillet shape[1]. BLP (Bottom Leaded Plastic) [2] {{which is not a}} type of thin out-line surface mount device(SMD) without the side lead is widely used in manufacturing of new generation memory such as SDRAM RDRAM DDR. For this non-lead SMD, the shape and reliability of <b>solder</b> joint is the focus of the study. In this paper, we select the C-BLP of 28 -pin device as the research object, complete the forming model of <b>solder</b> joint shape based on minimum energy principle and the <b>solder</b> joint shape theory by using Surface Evolver software, and analyze two critical process parameters (<b>solder</b> volume and <b>solder</b> pad width) impacting on the <b>solder</b> joint shape. The study results show that the <b>solder</b> volume and pad width {{have a significant impact on}} the three-dimensional shape of BLP <b>solder</b> joint. The law of which is that: in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the <b>solder</b> volume, <b>solder</b> joint surface gradually changes from the relatively flat to the convex, <b>solder</b> joint gradually changes from the completely <b>soldered</b> to the partly <b>soldered</b> in the pad connections, and <b>solder</b> joint heights are gradually decreased; in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the pad in width, the <b>solder</b> joint surface gradually changes from the convex to the flat, <b>solder</b> joint gradually changes from the completely <b>soldered</b> to the partly <b>soldered</b> in the pad connections, and <b>solder</b> joint heights are gradually decreased. The actual <b>solder</b> joint shape designs of BLP devices can be instructed based on predicted results...|$|R
25|$|A preform is a pre-made {{shape of}} <b>solder</b> {{specially}} {{designed for the}} application where {{it is to be}} used. Many methods are used to manufacture the <b>solder</b> preform, stamping being the most common. The <b>solder</b> preform may include the <b>solder</b> flux needed for the <b>soldering</b> process. This can be an internal flux, inside the <b>solder</b> preform, or external, with the <b>solder</b> preform coated.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, <b>solders,</b> pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited ontoâ€”and become part ofâ€”an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature <b>solders,</b> slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Conductive glass <b>solders</b> can be also prepared.|$|E
50|$|To simplify <b>soldering,</b> beginners {{are usually}} advised {{to apply the}} <b>soldering</b> iron and the <b>solder</b> {{separately}} to the joint, rather than the <b>solder</b> being applied direcly to the iron. When sufficient <b>solder</b> is applied, the <b>solder</b> wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the <b>solder</b> will flow around the workpieces. The iron is then removed from the joint.|$|R
50|$|The {{required}} accuracy in alignment {{can also be}} achieved by controlling the flow of <b>solder</b> on the PWB during reflow <b>soldering.</b> For this purpose, {{the space between the}} pads is often coated with a <b>solder</b> mask. The <b>solder</b> mask materials have no affinity to the molten <b>solder</b> and hence, no positive bonding is formed between them as the <b>solder</b> solidifies. This process {{is often referred to as}} <b>Solder</b> Masking. The mask must be centered correctly. The mask protects the PWB against oxidation, and prevents unintended <b>solder</b> bridges from forming between closely spaced <b>solder</b> pads.|$|R
40|$|Voiding in <b>solder</b> joints poses {{a serious}} {{reliability}} concern for electronic products. The {{aim of this}} research was to quantify the void formation in lead-free <b>solder</b> joints through X-ray inspections. Experiments were designed to investigate how void formation is affected by <b>solder</b> bump size and shape, differences in reflow time and temperature, and differences in <b>solder</b> paste formulation. Four different lead-free <b>solder</b> paste samples were used to produce <b>solder</b> bumps on a number of test boards, using surface mount reflow <b>soldering</b> process. Using an advanced X-ray inspection system void percentages were measured for three different size and shape <b>solder</b> bumps. Results indicate that the voiding in <b>solder</b> joint is strongly influenced by <b>solder</b> bump size and shape, with voids found to have increased when bump size decreased. A longer soaking period during reflow stage has negatively affected <b>solder</b> voids. Voiding was also accelerated with smaller <b>solder</b> particles in <b>solder</b> paste...|$|R
25|$|Lead-tin <b>solders</b> readily {{dissolve}} {{gold plating}} and form brittle intermetallics.|$|E
25|$|Tin-based <b>solders</b> readily {{dissolve}} gold, forming brittle intermetallics; for Sn-Pb alloys {{the critical}} concentration of gold to embrittle the joint is about 4%. Indium-rich <b>solders</b> (usually indium-lead) are {{more suitable for}} soldering thicker gold layer as the dissolution rate of gold in indium is much slower. Tin-rich <b>solders</b> also readily dissolve silver; for soldering silver metallization or surfaces, alloys with addition of silvers are suitable; tin-free alloys are also a choice, though their wettability is poorer. If the soldering time is long enough to form the intermetallics, the tin surface of a joint soldered to gold is very dull.|$|E
25|$|The bonding {{between the}} glass or {{ceramics}} {{and the glass}} solder can be either covalent, or, more often, van der Waals. The seal can be leak-tight; glass soldering is frequently used in vacuum technology. Glass <b>solders</b> can be also used as sealants; a vitreous enamel coating on iron lowered its permeability to hydrogen 10 times. Glass <b>solders</b> are frequently used for glass-to-metal seals and glass-ceramic-to-metal seals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

This result indicates that the <b>soldering</b> process with lead-free <b>solder</b> still needs to be further improved.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>solder</b> bump containing an inhomogenous material composition, in particular for connecting terminal area metallizations of different electronic components or substrates in flip chip technology, and {{a process for}} producing such a <b>solder</b> bump.
