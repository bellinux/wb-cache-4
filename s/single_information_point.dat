The data collected under this scheme meets the criteria of the standard 3 V’s to identify big data - Volume, Variety and Velocity of data. Usually a large number of cluster reports and isolated can help identify trends and patterns that will help track the spread of diseases with the help of syndromic surveillance data. A single portal under which data about such diseases can be traced, acts as a <b>single</b> <b>information</b> access <b>point</b> for all other health programs in the country. While the disease outbreak reports help in timely response and action to mitigate damage, the scheme will also be instrumental in policy decisions and changes for the government.|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{is a very}} data-intensive sector, {{producing}} and consuming {{a great amount of}} biomedical information. In healthcare organizations, especially hospitals, the big amount of data gets increasingly obscure due to their decentralized organization which has allowed different departments to meet specific or local requirements. This has led to fragmented and heterogeneous data resources, so called islands of information, which contain biomedical data about patients. Access and aggregation of data across systems results very difficult. This situation has created a large gap between the potential and actual value of biomedical data stored in healthcare systems. In order to reduce that gap giving easy access to those amounts of hidden data, we present here an overview of the Pangea-LE system, emphasising its flexibility and quick organisation deployment process. Background Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different sources and providing the user with a unified view of these data [1]. This unified view may be created from a set of existing data repositories in order to facilitate information access through a <b>single</b> <b>information</b> access <b>point,</b> or when a certain information need arises it may be constructed by combining different bu...|$|R

Because SSI form provides a new name for each variable at each <b>information</b> definition <b>point,</b> it provides excellent support for both predicated analyses, which exploit information gained from conditionals, and backwards dataflow analyses.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} an <b>information</b> <b>point</b> {{factor and}} attempts to identify how it affects saturation flow and their relationship at signalized intersections. An <b>information</b> <b>point</b> is defined as any object, structure, or activity located outside of a traveling vehicle that can potentially attract the visual attention of the driver. Saturation flow rates are studied at three pairs of signalized intersections in Toledo, Ohio, USA. Each pair of intersections consists of one intersection with {{a high number of}} <b>information</b> <b>points</b> and one intersection with a low number of <b>information</b> <b>points.</b> Study results reveal that, for each pair of intersections, the one with high <b>information</b> <b>points</b> has a lower saturation flow rate than the one with low <b>information</b> <b>points.</b> A statistical analysis shows that the differences are significant. Based on the saturation flow data of the paired intersections, <b>information</b> <b>point</b> effect models are developed and presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Small scale {{industries}} {{are the main}} employment provider in any developing country. Most of the micro, small and medium (MSME) scale industries development {{is due to the}} efforts of individual entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs lack the knowledge of various technical and legal aspects of MSMEs. Many times, {{due to the lack of}} information, these individual entrepreneurs do not know the latest development in the technology and the market dynamics. They lack the knowledge of the availability of funds required to establish the industry. These issues hamper the MSMEs significantly and undermine the potential of the entrepreneur community as a whole. Difficulties to establish an industry also causes a deterrent to many potential entrepreneurs. A <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>information</b> centre called common facilitation centre (CFC) can resolve these issues. CFC can cover all aspects of the industry including availability of technology, machinery, sources of funds, material requirement, new developments and human resource development. CFC can help in changing, not only the development of the industry, but the whole society. In this work, we have presented an overview of a sports goods MSMEs cluster in Meerut city, India. It covers the various aspects of problems and how CFC can help in resolving these issues...|$|R

40|$|Borehole radar is an {{electromagnetic}} {{tool that}} can be applied to assist in the delineation of orebody geometry, ideally using routinely drilled cover and exploration boreholes. Successful trials of borehole radar for delineating reef horizons on South African gold and platinum mines have {{led to the development of}} a borehole radar system specifically designed for routine application in those enyironments. The radar design includes novel elements, including a receiver with instantaneous sampling down the borehole, and it is implemented in probes that can operate in 48 mm boreholes, with development planned for 38 mm boreholes. The radar is known as the Aardwolf BR 40. The need for information about dislocations of 3 m to reefs determines the desirable radar resolution while available access geometry determines the range requirement. The electrical properties of typical gold and platinum rocks show that the range/resolution trade-off is feasible for the majority of economically important reef horizons. Boreholes drilled horizontally or upwards are accessed using a borehole crawler. Trials of the radar show that it meets its performance specification. The radar is robust enough for routine work imderground and is easy to use. The borehole radar is a useful addition to the toolbox of the mining geoscientist because it can give information about the reef plane along a line, rather than the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>information</b> about the reef given by a borehole...|$|R
