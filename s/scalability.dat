5|$|Checked {{exceptions}} are {{not present in}} C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based {{on the issues of}} <b>scalability</b> and versionability.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its investment activities the IFC provides a range of advisory services to support corporate decisionmaking regarding business, environment, social impact, and sustainability. The IFC's corporate advice targets governance, managerial capacity, <b>scalability,</b> and corporate responsibility. It prioritizes the encouragement of reforms that improve the trade friendliness and ease {{of doing business in}} an effort to advise countries on fostering a suitable investment climate. It also offers advice to governments on infrastructure development and public-private partnerships. The IFC attempts to guide businesses toward more sustainable practices particularly with regards to having good governance, supporting women in business, and proactively combating climate change.|$|E
25|$|Monero an {{open source}} {{cryptocurrency}} created in April 2014 {{that focuses on}} privacy, decentralisation and <b>scalability.</b>|$|E
25|$|SDRAM is also {{available}} in registered varieties, for systems that require greater <b>scalability</b> such as servers and workstations.|$|E
25|$|Frontera is web {{crawling}} framework implementing crawl frontier component and providing <b>scalability</b> primitives for web crawler applications.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency: The {{source code}} and {{software}} architecture attributes are {{the elements that}} ensure high performance once the application is in run-time mode. Efficiency {{is especially important for}} applications in high execution speed environments such as algorithmic or transactional processing where performance and <b>scalability</b> are paramount. An analysis of source code efficiency and <b>scalability</b> provides a clear picture of the latent business risks and the harm they can cause to customer satisfaction due to response-time degradation.|$|E
25|$|Because of the decentralization, fault tolerance, and <b>scalability</b> of DHTs, {{they are}} {{inherently}} more resilient against a hostile attacker than a typical centralized system.|$|E
25|$|Theorem (Gunther 2008): The {{universal}} <b>scalability</b> law {{is equivalent}} to the synchronous queueing bound on throughput in a modified Machine Repairman with state-dependent service times.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{methods to}} {{previously}} defined classes {{is often called}} monkey-patching. If performed recklessly, the practice can lead to both behavior collisions with subsequent unexpected results and code <b>scalability</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|While parallelization and <b>scalability</b> are not {{considered}} seriously in conventional , all learning for s and s is done in batch mode, to allow parallelization. Parallelization allows scaling the design to larger (deeper) architectures and data sets.|$|E
25|$|Fog {{computing}} is {{a viable}} alternative to prevent such large burst of data flow through Internet. The edge devices' computation power can be used to analyse and process data, thus providing easy real time <b>scalability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Solar PV has {{specific}} advantages as {{an energy}} source: once installed, its operation generates no pollution and no greenhouse gas emissions, it shows simple <b>scalability</b> {{in respect of}} power needs and silicon has large availability in the Earth’s crust.|$|E
25|$|Indoor tray growing is {{the most}} common {{commercial}} technique, followed by containerized growing. The tray technique provides the advantages of <b>scalability</b> and easier harvesting. Unlike wild harvests, indoor techniques provide tight control over growing substrate composition and growing conditions. Indoor harvests are much more predictable.|$|E
25|$|Adobe's first {{products}} after PostScript were digital fonts, {{which they}} released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full <b>scalability</b> and precise {{control of the}} pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.|$|E
25|$|Windows NT 4.0 was the {{successor}} of 3.51 (1995) and 3.5 (1994). Microsoft released Windows NT 4.0 to manufacturing in July 1996, {{one year after}} the release of Windows 95. Major new features included the new Explorer shell from Windows 95, <b>scalability</b> and feature improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC.|$|E
25|$|PCFGs have {{application}} in areas {{as diverse as}} natural language processing to the study the structure of RNA molecules and design of programming languages. Designing efficient PCFGs has to weigh factors of <b>scalability</b> and generality. Issues such as grammar ambiguity must be resolved. The grammar design affects results accuracy. Grammar parsing algorithms have various time and memory requirements.|$|E
25|$|As with Reliability, {{the causes}} of {{performance}} inefficiency are often found in violations of good architectural and coding practice which can be detected by measuring the static quality attributes of an application. These static attributes predict potential operational performance bottlenecks and future <b>scalability</b> problems, especially for applications requiring high execution speed for handling complex algorithms or huge volumes of data.|$|E
25|$|Datacenter: SQL Server 2008 R2 Datacenter is a full-featured {{edition of}} SQL Server and is {{designed}} for datacenters that need high levels of application support and <b>scalability.</b> It supports 256 logical processors and virtually unlimited memory and comes with StreamInsight Premium edition. The Datacenter edition has been retired in SQL Server 2012; all of its features are available in SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition.|$|E
25|$|This <b>scalability</b> law was {{originally}} developed by Gunther in 1993 {{while he was}} employed at Pyramid Technology. Since there are no topological dependencies, C(N) can model symmetric multiprocessors, multicores, clusters, and GRID architectures. Also, because {{each of the three}} terms has a definite physical meaning, they can be employed as a heuristic to determine where to make performance improvements in hardware platforms or software applications.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{existing}} SNS sites use one or multiple dedicated data centers to serve all its users. Such infrastructure-based systems faces over-provisioning during non-peak hours, while may encounter service outage during peak hours, due to the highly dynamic of SNS users' activities. There are several proposals, leveraging a decentralized architecture to ensure the <b>scalability</b> of SNS sites with low infrastructure cost. These proposals include Fethr, uaOSN, and Cuckoo.|$|E
25|$|Quicksort {{has some}} {{disadvantages}} {{when compared to}} alternative sorting algorithms, like merge sort, which complicate its efficient parallelization. The depth of quicksort's divide-and-conquer tree directly impacts the algorithm's <b>scalability,</b> and this depth is highly dependent on the algorithm's choice of pivot. Additionally, {{it is difficult to}} parallelize the partitioning step efficiently in-place. The use of scratch space simplifies the partitioning step, but increases the algorithm's memory footprint and constant overheads.|$|E
25|$|Using {{standard}} IC {{packaging and}} test facilities (called subcons in the IC industry) gives MEMS oscillators production <b>scalability.</b> These facilities {{are capable of}} large production volumes, often {{hundreds of millions of}} ICs per day. This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so ramping production volumes of specific ICs, or in this case specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating standard production equipment. Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|Collocation of a waste {{generator}} with a waste-to-ethanol plant {{can reduce the}} waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called holistic systems engineering. Collocation disposal elimination {{may be one of}} the few cost-effective, environmentally sound, biofuel strategies, but its <b>scalability</b> is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels. Due to the higher cost of transporting ethanol, it is a local partial solution, at best.|$|E
25|$|An n-gram {{model is}} a type of {{probabilistic}} language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence {{in the form of a}} (n−1)–order Markov model. n-gram models are now widely used in probability, communication theory, computational linguistics (for instance, statistical natural language processing), computational biology (for instance, biological sequence analysis), and data compression. Two benefits of n-gram models (and algorithms that use them) are simplicity and <b>scalability</b> – with larger n, a model can store more context with a well-understood space–time tradeoff, enabling small experiments to scale up efficiently.|$|E
25|$|The FAT {{file system}} is a legacy file system which is simple and robust. It offers good {{performance}} even in very light-weight implementations, but cannot deliver the same performance, reliability and <b>scalability</b> as some modern file systems. It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed operating systems for personal computers and many home computers, mobile devices and embedded systems, and thus is a well-suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981 up to the present.|$|E
25|$|Most wikis {{offer at}} least a title search, and {{sometimes}} a full-text search. The <b>scalability</b> of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as PmWiki, use flat files. MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by Lee Daniel Crocker in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external search engines such as Google Search can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions {{in order to obtain}} more precise results.|$|E
500|$|Several {{software}} programs {{are available in}} which variants of HMM-based methods have been implemented and which are noted for their <b>scalability</b> and efficiency, although properly using an HMM method {{is more complex than}} using more common progressive methods. The simplest is [...] (Partial-Order Alignment); a similar but more generalized method is implemented in the packages [...] (Sequence Alignment and Modeling System). and HMMER.|$|E
500|$|Internet Information Services 8.5: Support for logging to Event Tracing for Windows and {{the ability}} to log any request/response headers. [...] To improve <b>scalability,</b> if IIS is {{configured}} with 100 or more web sites, by default it will not automatically start any of them. Alongside this, a new [...] "Idle Worker Process Page-Out" [...] configuration option has been added to application pools to instruct Windows to page-out the process if it has been idle for the idle time-out period (by default, 20 minutes).|$|E
2500|$|The Internet {{of things}} {{requires}} huge <b>scalability</b> {{in the network}} space to handle the surge of devices. IETF 6LoWPAN {{would be used to}} connect devices to IP networks. With billions of devices being added to the Internet space, IPv6 will {{play a major role in}} handling the network layer <b>scalability.</b> IETF's Constrained Application Protocol, ZeroMQ, and MQTT would provide lightweight data transport. [...] "MQ" [...] in [...] "MQTT" [...] came from IBM's MQ Series message queuing product line.|$|E
2500|$|Cellular automata {{were used}} {{in the early days of}} {{artificial}} life, and are still often used for ease of <b>scalability</b> and parallelization. [...] Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.|$|E
2500|$|PCFG based {{approaches}} are desired to be scalable and general enough. Compromising speed for accuracy needs to as minimal as possible. Pfold addresses {{the limitations of}} the KH-99 algorithm with respect to <b>scalability,</b> gaps, speed and accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{release on}} September 30, 2004 was {{originally}} numbered 1.5, {{which is still}} used as the internal version number. The number was changed to [...] "better reflect the level of maturity, stability, <b>scalability</b> and security of the J2SE".|$|E
2500|$|... 1992 saw the {{publication}} of the correlation method, an algorithm which used the fast Fourier transform to give a vastly improved <b>scalability</b> for evaluating coarse shape complementarity on rigid-body models. This was extended in 1997 to cover coarse electrostatics.|$|E
2500|$|Alternate energy {{collection}} location: [...] While GEO is most typical {{because of its}} advantages of nearness to Earth, simplified pointing and tracking, very small time in occultation, and <b>scalability</b> to meet all global demand several times over, other locations have been proposed: ...|$|E
2500|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are gaining}} attention as a low-cost treatment technology {{that can be}} constructed in many instances using local materials and labor. [...] For sites with enough land and a ready supply of gravel and sand, this technology offers low cost, <b>scalability,</b> and simple operation.|$|E
