5000|$|The band's roots {{were first}} formed when Red Rice and Han-kun first {{performed}} together in Shōnan in central coastal Japan. Han-kun first formed {{an interest in}} reggae after by chance hearing Buju Banton's song [...] "Untold Stories" [...] in a friend's girlfriend's car, after coming home from a dance. Red Rice was a casual fan of reggae/hip-hop, until attending festivals which made him develop a great love of these genres. The pair met <b>Shock</b> <b>Eye</b> while performing, who previously worked as a hip-hop DJ. <b>Shock</b> <b>Eye</b> was friends with Wakadanna in high school, and met him again by chance in Shōnan. Wakadanna had been managing a reggae bar in Shōnan.|$|R
6000|$|Then as gloom {{descended on}} {{me with my}} uttered thought, my heart smote me at Sally's broken: [...] "Oh, Russ! No! No!" [...] Diane Sampson bent dark, <b>shocked</b> <b>eyes</b> upon the hill and ranch in front of her; but they were sightless, they looked into space and eternity, and in them I read the truth {{suddenly}} and cruelly revealed to her--she loved Steele! ...|$|R
50|$|While {{the doctor}} is driving his car at a breakneck speed through the old village lanes, he takes a wrong turn in confusion, bangs on a tree and stops right in middle of the lonely forest. The witch, who is lying in wait for him, {{suddenly}} comes out from the dark shadows and while {{the doctor is}} barely conscious {{to look at her}} with wide <b>shocked</b> <b>eyes,</b> pierces his body and brutally kills him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I don't think he's {{going to}} kill himself," [...] said Mrs. Lillie, who, it must be understood, was {{secretly}} somewhat sceptical {{about the power of}} her friend's charms, and looked on this little French romance with the eye of an outsider: [...] "never you believe that, dearest. These men make dreadful tearings, and <b>shocking</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouths; but they take pretty good care to keep in the world, after all. You see, if a man's dead, there's an end of all things; and I fancy they think of that before they quite come to any thing decisive." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, rock {{musician}} Alice Cooper {{was photographed}} by Bailey for Vogue magazine, almost naked {{apart from a}} snake. Cooper used Bailey the following year to shoot for the group's chart topping 'Billion Dollar Babies' album. The shoot included a baby wearing <b>shocking</b> <b>eye</b> makeup and, supposedly, one billion dollars in cash requiring the shoot to be under armed guard. In 1976, Bailey published Ritz Newspaper together with David Litchfield. In 1985, Bailey was photographing stars at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium. As he recalled later: [...] "The atmosphere on the day was great. At one point I got a tap {{on my shoulder and}} spun round. Suddenly there was a big tongue down my throat! It was Freddie Mercury." ...|$|R
60|$|Josie's {{self-control}} wasn't proof {{against this}} second <b>shock.</b> Her blue <b>eyes</b> stared amazed. With a low exclamation {{she stood up}} and faced the woman.|$|R
50|$|Shōnan no Kaze (or rather Gaim no Kaze) {{were first}} {{announced}} to be performing {{the theme song}} of the new Kamen Rider Series Kamen Rider Gaim {{at a press conference}} for the TV show in late July 2013. In an interview at the conference, band member Red Rice felt honored that he would join the ranks of famous artists who have performed the series' theme songs. <b>Shock</b> <b>Eye</b> revealed he had long been a fan of the series as a child, and even in adulthood. Wakadanna spoke of how he liked the motorcycles and as a child wished he had one as well, as the show seems to have instilled a fighting spirit in those who watch it. Han-kun was jokingly critical about the show's fruit motif, but then said that he knew children would love the show.|$|R
6000|$|... "'But surely, madam,' cried my cousin, to whom {{a demand}} for poor persons was an entirely new idea, 'you don't {{mean to say that}} you want poor people! Why, we've always {{considered}} it one of the chief attractions of the property--nothing to <b>shock</b> the <b>eye</b> or wound the susceptibilities of the most tender-hearted occupant.' ...|$|R
60|$|She had nerved {{herself for}} the last {{culminating}} ordeal, and his remark was like a blow to her self-possession. So far, everything had seemed phantom-like, as in a dream, but the brutal truth {{of what he had}} said <b>shocked</b> her <b>eyes</b> wide open to the reality of what was taking place. Nor was her distress unnoticed by the Irishman.|$|R
6000|$|In the {{absorbing}} {{interest of}} the moment, I poured out those words one after another {{as fast as they}} would pass my lips. Miserrimus Dexter completely falsified the lawyer's prediction. He shuddered under the <b>shock.</b> His <b>eyes</b> opened wide with amazement. [...] "Say it again!" [...] he cried. [...] "I can't take it all in at once. You stun me." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{police and}} Lanyon are {{standing}} over Carew's {{body in the}} garden. Recognizing the broken cane found next to the body, Lanyon tells them that he knows whose cane that is and agrees {{to take them to}} its owner. The police later arrive at Jekyll's lab looking for Hyde and find only Jekyll, who lies that Hyde has escaped. They begin to leave when Lanyon arrives and tells them that Jekyll is the man they're searching for (because the man they are looking for is hiding inside him). Just then a nervous Jekyll begins changing into Hyde before their <b>shocked</b> <b>eyes.</b> Outraged at Lanyon for betraying him, Hyde leaps from behind the table and attacks him. Hyde then tries to escape from the police but is fatally shot before he can again hurt Lanyon. As Hyde lies dead on the table full of Dr. Jekyll's experiments and potions, he transforms one last time back into Henry Jekyll.|$|R
50|$|Lebedev {{was left}} with a <b>shocking</b> <b>eye</b> injury after losing his WBA world cruiserweight title to Guillermo Jones on 17 May 2013. By {{the end of the}} bout, he could not see out of the injured eye but two judges had him winning 96-94 while the third had scored the bout 97-93 before he was knocked out in the {{eleventh}} round. According to most experts, Jones should have been winning clearly, and the suspicion is that the Russian Federation had fixed the bout. This would also explain the fact that the bout was not stopped, even after Lebedev's eye was grotesquely disfigured. However, Jones was stripped of his title later in the year for failing a drug test for this fight, resulting in Lebedev being reinstated as Champion by the WBA. The fight was reversed to a no-contest after originally being ruled a TKO. A rematch was planned for 25 April 2014, in Moscow, Russia. After Jones was tested positive for the same substance he was tested for after the first fight, the planned rematch was cancelled.|$|R
60|$|In {{the tense}} hush which {{had fallen on}} {{the crowd at the}} {{restarting}} of the wheel, Sally's laugh rang out with an embarrassing clearness. It had a marked effect on all those within hearing. There is something almost of religious ecstasy in the deportment of the spectators at a table where anyone is having a run of luck at roulette, and if she had guffawed in a cathedral she could not have caused a more pained consternation. The earnest worshippers gazed at her with <b>shocked</b> <b>eyes,</b> and Ginger, turning with a start, saw her and jumped up. As he did so, the ball fell with a rattling click into a red compartment of the wheel; and, as it ceased to revolve and it was seen that at last the big winner had picked the wrong colour, a shuddering groan ran through the congregation like that which convulses the penitents' bench at a negro revival meeting. More glances of reproach were cast at Sally. It was generally felt that her injudicious behaviour had changed Ginger's luck.|$|R
60|$|At length, he got up, {{and with}} an effort went upstairs. Half an hour later, a heavy sleep that came as a {{reaction}} after the <b>shock</b> closed his <b>eyes</b> and banished his troubles for a time.|$|R
6000|$|What {{is it that}} in the Albino man so peculiarly repels {{and often}} <b>shocks</b> the <b>eye,</b> as that {{sometimes}} he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men-- has no substantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so? ...|$|R
6000|$|Goodwin glanced swiftly at the woman, and saw, with {{surprise}} and a thrill of pleasure that he wondered at, {{that she had}} experienced an unmistakable <b>shock.</b> Her <b>eyes</b> grew wide, she gasped, and leaned heavily against the table. She had been ignorant, then, he inferred, that her companion had looted the government treasury. But why, he angrily asked himself, should he be so well pleased to think this wandering and unscrupulous singer not so black as report had painted her? ...|$|R
60|$|Will any reader {{remember}} the loves,--no, not the loves; that word is so decidedly ill-applied {{as to be}} incapable of awakening the remembrance of any reader; but the flirtations--of Lady Dumbello and Mr Plantagenet Palliser? Those flirtations, {{as they had been}} carried on at Courcy Castle, were laid bare in all their enormities to the eye of the public, and it must be confessed that if the eye of the public was <b>shocked,</b> that <b>eye</b> must be <b>shocked</b> very easily.|$|R
60|$|As {{they dropped}} into Innocent's attic they nearly tumbled over its {{entertaining}} impedimenta again. Inglewood, {{staring at the}} littered floor, thought instinctively of the littered floor of a nursery. He was therefore the more moved, and even <b>shocked,</b> when his <b>eye</b> fell on a large well-polished American revolver.|$|R
5000|$|In the Abu Dhabi-based {{newspaper}} The National, Noori Passela {{writes that}} the stories [...] "range from expeditions featuring a bold hero and an elusive princess to be won over (The Gazelle with the Golden Horns) to the more symbolic and moral (The Birth of the Sahara). Interestingly, there are also many that border on scandal, using a repertoire of love, lust and betrayal to <b>shock</b> (The <b>Eyes</b> of Ben'Adi). Dramatic fare all around, but with entertainment being the sole purpose, this is hardly a let-down. Instead, this is addictive material." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the Baumettes {{prison and}} at [...] Gestapo {{headquarters}} in 425 Rue Paradis Marseille the Gestapo under agent Ernst Dunker tortured their three British captives by delivering very powerful electric <b>shocks</b> between the <b>eyes</b> {{and the results}} were so bad that when the British were seen by French prisoners they were almost unrecognizable.|$|R
50|$|Liza Alert {{takes its}} name from 5-year-old Liza Fomkina. In 2010 Liza has died of {{hypothermia}} in the Russian wildwood after 9 day long unsuccessful search mission.Liza's death was a great <b>shock</b> and an <b>eye</b> opener for many caring people. The foundation was born in less than 21 days after the devastating event.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 9: Bolingbroke's Works, vol. ii. p. 315, 317, 320. [...] "The sole question," [...] says Bolingbroke, [...] "is, {{who caused}} this disunion?--and {{that will be}} easily decided by every {{impartial}} man, who informs himself carefully of the public anecdotes of that time. If the private anecdotes were to be laid open as well as those, and I think it almost time they should, the whole monstrous scene would appear, and <b>shock</b> the <b>eye</b> of every honest man." [...] The prediction has been fulfilled, and the vaunting prophet consigned to infamy through the evidence he invoked.] ...|$|R
60|$|Mistress Dorothy was, Rupert thought, softer and kinder than of old. Her pride, and to {{some extent}} her heart, had met with a rude <b>shock,</b> but her <b>eyes</b> were now fully open to the worthlessness of her former suitor, who had lately been obliged to fly the country, having been {{detected}} at cheating at cards.|$|R
60|$|The eminent Usher was {{regarding}} the bellowing monster with an amazement which had dried up all other sentiments. The mere <b>shock</b> to his <b>eyes</b> had rendered his ears, almost useless. At last he rang a bell {{with a hand}} of violence. While the bell was still strong and pealing, the voice of Father Brown fell soft but distinct.|$|R
6000|$|I deeply regret being {{obliged to}} <b>shock</b> the <b>eyes</b> and ears of such of my readers as have a {{prejudice}} {{in favor of}} pure English by expressions like the above, but, having rashly undertaken to write a little story about Young America, for Young America, I feel bound to depict my honored patrons as faithfully as my limited powers permit. Otherwise, I must expect the crushing criticism, [...] "Well, I dare say it 's all very prim and proper, {{but it is n't}} a bit like us," [...] and never hope to arrive at the distinction of finding the covers of [...] "An Old-Fashioned Girl" [...] the dirtiest in the library.|$|R
60|$|Just inside us lay two {{or three}} ironclads; strong and ugly: untidy, too, to a degree <b>shocking</b> to English <b>eyes.</b> All sorts of odds and ends were hanging over the side, and about the rigging; the yards were not {{properly}} squared, and so forth; till--as old sailors would say--the ships had no more decency about them than so many collier- brigs.|$|R
60|$|Golf {{has not yet}} caught on, but tennis {{is firmly}} {{established}} from St. Petersburg to Bordeaux. The German, with the thoroughness characteristic of him, is working hard. University professors, stout majors, rising early in the morning, hire boys and practise back- handers and half-volleys. But to the Frenchman, as yet, it is a game. He plays it in a happy, merry fashion, that is <b>shocking</b> to English <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the Baumettes {{prison and}} at Gestapo {{headquarters}} in 425 Rue Paradis Marseille the Gestapo tortured their three British captives by delivering very powerful electric <b>shocks</b> between the <b>eyes</b> {{and the results}} were so bad that when the British were seen by French prisoners they were almost unrecognizable. When Skepper was seen in the Gestapo offices in the custody of Gestapo Agent Dunker by Villevielle two weeks after their arrests he also reported being unable to recognize his friend.|$|R
6000|$|I {{dropped a}} nickel {{out of the}} window and got my paper; the Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change; is around the corner yet. It was delicious to see a {{newspaper}} again, yet I was conscious of a secret <b>shock</b> when my <b>eye</b> fell upon the first batch of display head-lines. I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence, respect, deference, so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me: ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Ruff {{was left}} alone for {{nearly a quarter of}} an hour. Then the door was softly opened and Letty Shaw entered. There was no doubt {{whatever}} about her suffering. Ruff, who had seen her only lately at the theatre, was <b>shocked.</b> Under her <b>eyes</b> were blacker lines than her pencil had ever traced. Not only was she ghastly pale, but her face seemed wan and shrunken. She spoke to him the moment she entered, leaning with on hand upon the sideboard.|$|R
6000|$|A slave warehouse! Perhaps {{some of my}} readers {{conjure up}} horrible visions of such a place. They fancy some foul, obscure den, some horrible Tartarus [...] "informis, ingens, cui lumen ademptum." [...] But no, {{innocent}} friend; in these days men have learned the art of sinning expertly and genteelly, {{so as not to}} <b>shock</b> the <b>eyes</b> and senses of respectable society. Human property is high in the market; and is, therefore, well fed, well cleaned, tended, and looked after, that it may come to sale sleek, and strong, and shining. A slave-warehouse in New Orleans is a house externally not much unlike many others, kept with neatness; and where every day you may see arranged, under a sort of shed along the outside, rows of men and women, who stand there {{as a sign of the}} property sold within.|$|R
60|$|The salt tang {{of the sea}} gladdened his nostrils, and {{he snorted}} with the {{pleasure}} of the stench of the mangrove swamp. But, another Crusoe chancing upon the footprint of another man Friday, his nose, not his <b>eyes,</b> <b>shocked</b> him electrically alert as he smelled the fresh contact of a living man's foot with the ground. It was a nigger's foot, but it was alive, it was immediate; and, as he traced it a score of yards, he came upon another foot-scent, indubitably a white man's.|$|R
40|$|Rabbits were classically {{conditioned}} to emit a nictitating membrane response (NMR) {{to either a}} light or tone conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with an <b>eye</b> <b>shock</b> unconditioned stimulus (UCS) They then received lesions of the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) or served as unoperated controls.

60|$|And now we {{pass through}} ragged uplands, woody and moorish, {{with the long}} yellow maize-stalks of last year's crop rotting in the swampy glens. For the 'petite culture,' {{whatever}} be its advantages, gives no capital or power of combined action for draining wet lands; and the valleys of Gascony and Bearn in the south, as well as great sheets of the Pas de Calais in the north, are in a waterlogged state, equally <b>shocking</b> to the <b>eye</b> of a British farmer, and injurious {{to the health and}} to the crops of the peasants.|$|R
6000|$|As Polly freed her mind, and {{emphasized}} her opinion with a decided rap {{of the boot}} she had just taken off, Fanny laughed, and said, while she pirouetted about the room, like Mademoiselle Therese, [...] "Polly was <b>shocked,</b> grandma. Her <b>eyes</b> were as big as saucers, her face as red as my sash, and once I {{thought she was going}} to cry. Some of it was rather queer; but, of course, it was proper, or all our set would n't go. I heard Mrs. Smythe Perkins say, 'It was charming; so like dear Paris;' and she has lived abroad; so, of course, she knows what is what." ...|$|R
