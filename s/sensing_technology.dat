40|$|SUMMARY: Various <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as video cameras, ultrasonic, radars and {{tag-based}} systems, {{have been}} developed and tested to prevent collisions within blind areas of construction equipment. However, the performance of <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> varies in different environments, such as dynamic vehicle conditions or characteristics of <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies.</b> Also, there are little standardized testing protocols to evaluate sensor systems performance in an objective manner. Therefore, this paper focuses on evaluating sensing systems performance based on a test design developed specifically for construction back-over safety practices. The presented testbed designs include sensor installation, static test, dynamic test, and dirty sensor test. Each test presents a generalized sensor evaluation factors {{that should be considered}} and results are shown in tabular and graphical formats. Contents of this study are expected to help researchers evaluate new technologies objectively and provide users with {{a better understanding of the}} implementation of <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> in constructio...|$|R

500|$|Warhawk {{was first}} {{announced}} {{to the public in}} May 2005, with a working build shown at E3 in 2006. This version was the first PlayStation 3 title to be shown with the newly announced Sixaxis motion <b>sensing</b> <b>technology.</b> In February 2007, it was announced that the single player element of the game was to be pulled. This was due to concerns Incognito had over the quality of the single-player campaign, particularly when compared to the multi-player modes. Dylan Jobe, the game's director, stated, [...] "If we were to continue down our single-player/multiplayer approach, it would have resulted in not as good single player or not as good multiplayer". The extra development of the multiplayer mode was used to improve existing elements such as in-game communication, and to implement new features such as On Demand Split Screen, whereby players can easily enter split screen mid-game. Split screen can only be used in battles that allow it. Only unranked servers have the ability to have it and even then, it is an option whether or not the host wants it on or off. It was also revealed {{at the same time that}} Warhawk would be made available for download over the PlayStation Network.|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of motion controllers for the Xbox 360 (Kinect) and the PlayStation 3 (PlayStation Move) in 2010 and 2011, some analysts stated that the rhythm market would resurge thanks to dance- and band-based games that use platform-agnostic controllers. Dance games such as Just Dance, Dance Central and [...] {{were based on the}} new motion <b>sensing</b> <b>technology.</b> Industry pundits believe that, because sales of peripheral-based music games are lagging and the popularity of pop music is surging, dance-based games will continue to thrive. Dance games such as Ubisoft's Just Dance and Harmonix's Dance Central boosted the rhythm genre's late-2010 sales; the latter was the top-selling game for the Kinect in North America in November 2010. Both games helped the genre increase its sales by 38% over November 2009, according to NPD. Harmonix is expected to post more than $100 million in profit for 2011 buoyed by sales of Dance Central and downloadable content for the game, according to Bloomberg. Just Dance overcame a poor critical reception to topple [...] best-seller status, while Just Dance 2 (2010) became the best selling non-Nintendo game for the Wii. The Just Dance series competed with top action franchises for sales. Tap Tap Revenge, the first installment of the iPhone rhythm series Tap Tap, was the platform's most downloaded game in 2008. The Tap Tap franchise ultimately generated 15 million downloads and received a Guinness World Record as the [...] "most popular iPhone game series".|$|E

40|$|In many {{fields of}} civil engineering, the needs for {{innovative}} <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> are growing. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is {{actually one of}} the most advanced <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> available, allowing a nonintrusive inspection of the materials under investigation. GPR uses radar pulses to image the subsurface, exploiting electromagnetic (EM) radiation and then detecting the reflected signals from subsurface structures. This chapter provides an overview of GPR <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> for civil engineering applications and related research topics. In particular, a number of promising concepts for GPR are introduced and discussed in this chapter, starting from the theoretical EM background of GPR signal propagation in soils and construction materials. Then, we illustrate the applications of GPR to civil engineering fields, from the construction and inspection of transportation infrastructures and hydraulic works, to geotechnical surveys, environmental monitoring, as well as building and bridge structural assessments. We will demonstrate why GPR is currently considered {{as one of the most}} effective and efficient <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> and is a potential candidate to become the best available remote-sensing technology for civil engineering applications.

30|$|When {{attempting}} {{to obtain the}} location of an interface, an alternative to using <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> is to utilise a technique driven by user input. An example {{of this approach is}} where users measure the locations of the interface directly and input the information into the system through text entry. User input approaches have the disadvantage of relying on the accuracy of the human input, whereas <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies</b> can be relied on to be precise within certain parameters. The accuracy of users can be influenced by a range of factors which would not affect the accuracy of <b>sensing</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as the magnitude of the distances being measured [15]. An inaccurate user-generated measurement, input as part of a location determining technique, would result in the calculated position of the interface being incorrect. Therefore, it is important to take into consideration the accuracy of human-generated input when utilising techniques which rely on this approach.|$|R
