40|$|Purpose: Determining {{the effects}} of neoadjuvant {{chemotherapy}} (NAC) on benign breast lesions and to evaluate their response in comparison to breast cancers. Methods: A retrospective analysis performed on breast cancer patients between 2008 and 2014 to identify patients who had a pre- and post-NAC magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy-proven benign lesions. Pre- and post-NAC size and intensity of enhancement of benign lesions and cancers were measured. Breast glandularity and background enhancement were graded. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVAs and Sidak post hoc tests were conducted for multiple comparisons. Paired t-tests were conducted to examine changes over time, and two-tailed P values were reported. Results: The effects of NAC in 38 cancers were compared to {{the effects of}} NAC in 47 benign lesions in these patients. From pre- to post-NAC, the mean <b>size</b> (<b>cm)</b> of malignant lesions on MRI decreased from 4. 09 (±standard deviation [SD] 2. 51) to 1. 54 (±SD 2. 32), (P < 0. 001); the mean <b>size</b> (<b>cm)</b> of benign lesions decreased from 0. 83 (±SD 0. 54 cm) to 0. 28 (±SD 0. 51), (P < 0. 001). Both benign and malignant lesions decreased in size after NAC, the size reduction in malignant lesions was significantly greater than benign lesions. From pre- to post-NAC, the mean lesion enhancement of the malignant lesions (scale 1 - 4) decreased from 3. 43 (±SD 0. 80) to 1. 02 (±SD 1. 34); the mean lesion enhancement of benign lesions decreased from 2. 96 (±SD 1. 04) to 0. 98 (±SD 1. 51). For both benign and malignant lesions, there was a significant overall reduction in enhancement after NAC from moderate at pre-NAC to minimal at post-NAC, P < 0. 001. There was no overall difference in the enhancement of cancers (mean = 2. 22, SD = 0. 79) versus benign lesions (mean = 1. 97, SD = 1. 08), (P = 0. 23). There was no significant change in glandularity from pretherapy (mean = 3. 11, SD = 0. 84) to posttherapy (mean = 3. 13, SD = 0. 82), P < 0. 001. Conclusion: Similar to cancers, benign breast lesions also show a significant decrease in size and enhancement after NAC; however, the decrease in size is less compared to cancers...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{integrate}} {{two or more}} {{compliant mechanisms}} to get enhanced functionality for manipulating and mechanically characterizing the grasped objects of varied <b>size</b> (<b>cm</b> to sub-mm), stiffness (1 e 5 to 10 N/m), and materials (cement to biological cells). The concepts of spring-lever (SL) model, stiffness maps, and non-dimensional kinetoelastostatic maps are used to design composite and multi-scale compliant mechanisms. Composite compliant mechanisms comprise two or more different mechanisms within a single elastic continuum while multi-scale ones possess the additional feature of substantial difference in the sizes of the mechanisms that are combined into one. We present three applications: (i) a composite compliant device to measure the failure load of the cement samples; (ii) a composite multi-scale compliant gripper to measure the bulk stiffness of zebrafish embryos; and (iii) a compliant gripper combined with a negative-stiffness element to reduce the overall stiffness. The prototypes of all three devices are made and tested. The cement sample needed a breaking force of 22. 5 N; the zebrafish embryo is found to have bulk stiffness of about 10 N/m; and the stiffness of a compliant gripper was reduced by 99. 8 % to 0. 2 N/m...|$|E

The work was carried out in the Center of Sciences and Technology Agroalimentar of the Federal University of Campina Grande, Campus Pombal. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a 4 x 2 factorial scheme, with two cultivars (BRS Marataoã and BRS Rouxinol) and four weeds (mechanical, chemical, physical and uncontrolled) with four replications. The production components were: Mass (kg) of the pods, number of grains per pod, <b>size</b> (<b>cm)</b> and diameter (mm) of the pods, Mass (kg) of one thousand seeds and total grain yield (kg).

Cytotoxicity assay {{showed that the}} IC 50 of liposomes containing DOX was greater than that DOX only. Tumor growth inhibition curves in terms of mean tumor <b>size</b> (<b>cm</b> 3) were presented. All the DOX formulations were effective in preventing tumor growth compared to saline. Treatment with DOX loaded liposomes displayed a pronounced inhibition in tumor growth than treatment with DOX only. Histopathological examination of the entire tumor sections for the various groups revealed marked differences in cellular features accompanied by varying degrees in necrosis percentage ranging from 12 % for saline treated mice to 70 % for DOX loaded liposome treated mice. The proposed liposomal formulation can efficiently deliver the drug into the tumor cells by endocytosis (or passive diffusion) and {{lead to a high}} concentration of DOX in the tumor cells. The study showed that the formulation of liposomal doxorubicin improved the therapeutic index of DOX and had increased anti-tumor activity against Ehrlich tumor models...|$|E

40|$|The main criterion, in {{the design}} of {{propellant}} charge for a tank gun, is to achieve the highest possible muzzle velocity for fin stabilized arm our piercing discarding sabot (FSAPbS) projectile~. This ensures penetration through the toughest armour plates by the kinetic energy of the projectile. One of the solutions, is to increase the force constant of the propellant. Higher force constants from conventional double and triple base propellant compositions lead to prohibitive linear rates of burning coefficients. ERDL has developed a high energy propellant based on RDX, with very high force constant and low linear rate of burning coefficient. The objective of the present paper is to discuss various aspects of the interior ballistics of the three types of propellants in question in 105 film tank gun with FSAPDS ammunition.

The aim of our study is to construct and validate a new Malignancy Probability Score based on four simple sonographic findings and age. Methods: In a cross sectional study; histopathological files of 3303 ovarian mass patients and tertiary hospitals, have reviewed within 6 years (2000 - 2006). Pathology, age, sonographic findings including solid area, ascetic, size and bilateralism were recorded.
