50|$|If a {{power outage}} occurs on {{system with a}} weak backup battery it can cause the alarm to trigger. Preventing this type of false alarm {{requires}} alarm owner to periodically replace the backup battery.Most people should have <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> on the AC power {{as well as the}} RJ31X area. If properly installed, the surges should bypass the system. So to help prevent a feedback loop up case ground, never install the RJ31X <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> inside the burglar alarm panel, and only ground it to the ground lug of the AC <b>surge</b> <b>suppression.</b> To even reduce more false alarms, tie three to four knots in the phone line between the RJ31X <b>Surge</b> <b>suppression</b> and the panel as well as three to four knots in the low voltage AC power source feeding the panel after the AC <b>surge</b> <b>suppression.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} where multiple socket types are in use, a single power strip can {{have two or}} more kinds of socket.

50|$|Close {{proximity}} strikes {{by lightning}} will always {{set off the}} ground fault circuit and at times blow the system out if the system did not follow NEC code Art. 250.94 which illustrates how {{to get rid of}} grounding differentials. A good ground filter/notch filter will prevent a feedback loop up case ground which causes false alarms. Also <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> improperly installed inside a fire alarm panel will also cause a feedback loop up case ground and cause false alarms. So the <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> must be outside the box, in a plastic box and not grounded directly to the fire panel, rather the grounded to the ground side/line side of the in-line series three stage two tank circuit designed AC <b>surge</b> <b>suppression.</b> Parallel will not protect a fire alarm panel nor prevent false alarms. In series <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> will at least help one control where the surges are coming from and the ground filter will also help. Tie three to four knots in the low voltage wire between the low voltage surge suppress and the fire alarm panel, and tie at least one knot in the phase/neutral/and ground wire attached to the power supply. This will help mitigate false alarms, as well as help one's <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> do a better job.|$|R

50|$|<b>Surge</b> <b>suppression</b> {{is usually}} {{provided}} {{by one or}} more metal-oxide varistors (MOVs), which are inexpensive two-terminal semiconductors. These act as very high speed switches, momentarily limiting the peak voltage across their terminals. By design, MOV surge limiters are selected to trigger at a voltage somewhat above the local mains supply voltage, so that they do not clip normal voltage peaks, but clip abnormal higher voltages. In the US, this is (nominally) 120 VAC. It should be borne in mind that this voltage specification is RMS, not peak, and also that it is only a nominal (approximate) value.|$|R

Some <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> systems use multiple technologies, since each method has its strong and weak points.The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a parallel (or shunted) topology. The last two methods also block unwanted energy by using a protective component connected in series with the power feed to the protected load, and additionally may shunt the unwanted energy like the earlier systems.|$|R
