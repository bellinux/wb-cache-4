40|$|This thesis {{study the}} {{possibility}} of riser slugging control in oshore oil productionusing a subsea choke valve. A 5 -state <b>simplied</b> model of a well-pipelinerisersystem is introduced and tted to a reference model in the ow simulatorOLGA. The models have two inputs, a subsea valve at the wellhead and a topsidevalve {{at the top of}} the riser. The eect the valves have on the behavior ofthe <b>simplied</b> model are tted to simulation data from the OLGA-model usingbifurcation diagrams. An input-output controllability analysis of the <b>simplied</b> model show thatanti-slug control using a subsea valve at the wellhead is more dicult than theconventional solution, which is to use the topside choke valve. This is conrmedby simulations on the <b>simplied</b> model using Hinfinity-controllers. Stabilizing control of the OLGA-model using the subsea valve was unsuccessful,despite testing dierent measurement combinations and control structures. A more promising solution for controlling riser slugging using a subsea valve istested in OLGA, where a subsea valve located near the base of the riser can keepthe system stable at riser slugging conditions. This is also seen in an experimenton a small scale ow lab. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sequential {{learning}} techniques, such as auto-context, {{that applies}} {{the output of}} an intermediate classier as contextual features for its subsequent classier has shown impressive performance for semantic segmentation. We show that these methods {{can be interpreted as}} an ap-proximation technique derived from a Bayesian formulation. To improve the effectiveness of applying this approximation technique, we propose a new sequential learning approach for semantic segmentation that solves a segmentation problem by breaking it into a series of <b>simplied</b> segmenta-tion problems. Sequentially solving each of the <b>simplied</b> problems along the path leads to a more effective way for solving the original segmen-tation problem. To achieve this goal, we also propose a learning-based method to generate <b>simplied</b> segmentation problems by explicitly con-trolling the complexities of the modeling classiers. We report promising results on the 2013 SATA canine leg muscle segmentation dataset. ...|$|R

For this reason <b>simplied</b> models represent an alternative approach that needs to be improved.
