25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. <b>Saccharose</b> {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E

Methods: Healthy and voluntary male subjects were included.

OBJETIVO: Determinar se a sacarose é um bom veículo para a suplementação de folato em camundongos. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS: Quarenta camundongos Swiss fêmeas foram divididos nos grupos: C: ração {{comercial}} + água ad libitum; DS: ração balanceada isenta de folato + folato adicionado à sacarose diluída na água por 14 dias; D/DS: ração balanceada isenta de folato + água com sacarose sem folato por 14 dias seguida de ração balanceada isenta de folato + folato adicionado à sacarose diluída na água por mais 14 dias; D: ração balanceada isenta de folato + água com sacarose sem folato por 14 dias. Os animais de todos os grupos experimentais receberam ração balanceada isenta de folato + folato adicionado à sacarose diluída na água durante os três dias do acasalamento e nos 15 dias restantes até o sacrifício. RESULTADOS: Os animais dos grupos D e D/DS apresentaram alopecia, palidez ocular e adinamia enquanto consumiam água com sacarose sem folato, sinais que foram revertidos quando receberam folato adicionado à sacarose diluída na água. Não houve diferença entre os grupos em relação a prenhez, implantes, fetos vivos, reabsorção, morte fetal tardia, nível sérico de folato e contagem de hemácias ao final do experimento, não tendo sido observadas anomalias congênitas em nenhum dos grupos.

Mice from all experimental groups received folate-free balanced diet + <b>saccharose</b> with folate diluted in water during their three-day mating period and thereafter 15 days until animals were put down. RESULTS: Mice from groups D and D/DS showed alopecia, pale eyes and adynamia while on folate-free <b>saccharose</b> water regimen.

The increase in SOD and CAT activities of F. equiseti correlated with increases in <b>saccharose</b> concentration. When glycerol and <b>saccharose</b> were used as carbon sources, the maximum SOD, CAT and GSH-Px enzymes activities and the minimum LPO level were determined in the medium containing 15 g/L of <b>saccharose</b> on the 12 th day at 66. 61, 182. 79, 1. 045 IU/mg and 1. 41 nmol MDA / gr wet weight, respectively. The eects of peptone and glycine as nitrogen sources were also investigated: 53. 4 % and 48. 03 % decreases were observed in the SOD and CAT activities of F. equiseti in the presence of 10 g/L of peptone in the culture medium. The presence of 15 g/L of glycine caused 5. 30 % and 69. 90 % decreases in the SOD and CAT activities in comparison to the presence of 15 g/L of <b>saccharose,</b> respectively. On the other hand, LPO levels increased in proportion to the decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities in glycine and peptone supplemented media...|$|E
