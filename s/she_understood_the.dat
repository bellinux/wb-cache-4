5|$|Solanas {{moved to}} New York City in the mid-1960s, {{working as a}} writer. She met pop artist Andy Warhol {{and asked him to}} produce her play, Up Your Ass. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing and/or stealing, {{followed}} by Warhol expressing additional indifference to her play. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in the spring of 1968.|$|E

25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. <b>She</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> impact of their journeys on others, but unlike Ai, {{did not have the}} maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

500|$|Lori Loughlin {{auditioned for}} the role of Debbie and was given the part {{straight}} away. Sachs thought that Loughlin was too established to read for the part, but realized that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> role immediately. The producers were fans of Jessica Walter after watching her film, Play Misty for Me. Sachs found that Walter knew pieces of scenes, and suggested [...] "stuff that works". Sachs described Ryan Eggold, who portrayed Matthews, as [...] "a sophisticated actor, and he's also very funny". Sachs believed that every time Eggold would be on screen, [...] "people are going to go, 'Wow!'".|$|E
500|$|Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria {{wrote that}} Zenobia did not [...] "hand over churches to the Jews {{to make them}} into synagogues"; {{although}} the queen was not a Christian, <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> power of bishops in Christian communities. In Antioch—considered representative of political control of the East and containing a large Christian community—Zenobia apparently maintained authority over the church by bringing influential clerics, probably including Paul of Samosata, under her auspices. She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of ducenarius (minor judge); he apparently enjoyed the queen's protection, which helped him keep the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as bishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 268.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{felt that}} the album focused on two subjects: {{listening}} to one's heart, and being a rebel. Madonna explained that these concepts were not the initial inspiration, but emerged during the sessions with Avicii. Madonna observed two distinct themes emerging organically, and {{felt the need to}} express them. The record was titled [...] Rebel Heart, since it dealt with two different aspects of the singer's character — her rebellious, renegade side, and her romantic side; she wanted the album to represent both. On the French radio station NRJ, she explained that Rebel Heart could be both autobiographical and fictional, since she mixed both her own experiences with imaginary narratives while writing the songs. The title also stemmed from Madonna's belief that contemporary music artists are not encouraged or inspired to be rebellious, take risks, or speak-up, and she wanted to highlight this. However, <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> importance of having love in the rebellious nature, so added the word Heart to the title.|$|E

500|$|Used in {{the opening}} sequence, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was played 13minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being {{tortured}} {{for over a year}} in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day. Nevertheless, <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like [...] "I'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this" [...] were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about [...] "destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of American Life and was also featured on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009).|$|E
500|$|Johansson had {{aspired to}} appear on Broadway since her childhood. She made her debut in a 2010 revival of the drama A View from the Bridge, written by Arthur Miller. Set in the 1950s, in an Italian-American {{neighborhood}} in New York, it tells the tragic tale of Eddie (played by Liev Schreiber), who has an inappropriate love for his wife's orphaned niece, Catherine (played by Johansson). Johansson was initially uncomfortable playing a teenage character, but later agreed to do the play after a friend convinced her {{to take on the}} part. Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote of Johansson's performance that she [...] "melts into her character so thoroughly that her nimbus of celebrity disappears". [...] Varietys David Rooney was impressed with the play and Johansson in particular, describing her as the play's chief performer. She won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. Some critics and Broadway actors criticized the award committee's decision to award the work of mainstream Hollywood actors, including Johansson. In response, she said that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> frustration, but had worked hard for her accomplishments.|$|E
500|$|John Keegan from Critical Myth {{gave the}} episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode was a disappointing sequel {{to one of}} the most popular episodes of the series. Bringing back Modell for this story was an ill-advised attempt to capitalize on impressions of continuity, especially since the character aspects of 'Pusher' were completely absent this time around. It's hard to believe that Vince and Tim, both strong writers on their own, were responsible for this material." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She called the entry [...] "tame" [...] compared to its original, although <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> show's desire to write a sequel. Vitaris also criticized the fact that Modell never murdered anyone and called the episode's basic plot [...] "cheesy". She did, however, compliment several of the episode's set pieces, such as [...] "Nathan Bowman covered in cerulean blue paint"—which she called [...] "striking"—and the scene wherein [...] "Linda stops the heart of the suffering Modell", calling the latter [...] "sensately performed." ...|$|E

500|$|In Cheek to Cheek, Gaga sings solo on [...] "Lush Life", [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" [...] and [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", while Bennett's solo {{includes}} [...] "Don't Wait Too Long" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady". According to Gaga, [...] "Lush Life" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] complemented each other; for Bennett, the complement {{came from}} the fact that Duke Ellington wrote [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] and later collaborated with Strayhorn for [...] "Lush Life". Gaga sang [...] "Lush Life" [...] in her school choir, but it was only later <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> lyrical interpretation of the track, about failure and heartache. While recording Cheek to Cheek she was emotionally upset about her professional and personal conflicts encountered during the Artpop era; Bennett had to support and guide her through the process. Newman recalled that [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" [...] was recorded during the taping of the duo's show at Lincoln Center. Gaga had informed the musicians about performing the song, and piano player Alex Smith made the necessary musical arrangements the night before the concert. They did not rehearse it, and recorded it live when Gaga performed the song in front of the audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E
2500|$|Horney {{also shared}} Abraham Maslow's view that {{self-actualization}} {{is something that}} all people strive for. By [...] "self" [...] <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> core of one's own being and potential. Horney believed that if we have an accurate conception of our own self, then we are free to realize our potential and achieve what we wish, within reasonable boundaries. Thus, she believed that self-actualization is the healthy person's aim through life—as opposed to the neurotic's clinging {{to a set of}} key needs.|$|E

2500|$|By {{at least}} 1975 Genie clearly {{understood}} and incorporated {{the concept of}} temporality into her speech, and unusually for people acquiring a first language <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> words before and after before learning past or future tense markers. She could also use sentences to indicate causation, albeit without saying the words if and then. Despite this, by 1975 Genie remained largely unable to respond to sentences where the nouns {{were not in the}} same sequence as the events, such as [...] "Touch your ear after you touch your nose", although she improved more with sentences asking her to do something after instead of doing something before. In a 1981 paper Curtiss interpreted Genie's temporal utterances as an expansion of Genie's vocabulary, but an outside analysis of Curtiss' writings concluded that Genie had to have acquired some degree of grammar to have formed these sentences.|$|E
2500|$|Egyptologists {{who knew}} Omm Sety were {{impressed}} by her knowledge of ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that [...] "she had visions and worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods. But <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> methods and standards of scholarship, which is usually {{not the case with}} nuts," [...] nor did she [...] "desire to convert anyone." [...] Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, [...] "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," [...] who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of ancient Egyptian religion, believing that [...] "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." [...] She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. [...] One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented [...] "I was deeply shocked when, one night, I attended a party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid...and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing! I couldn't believe my eyes!" [...] William Murnane of the Oriental Institute recalled [...] "It was always a pleasure to be with her and listen to whatever she said...you really couldn't take her anything but seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} part of the trial for Mendleson was her final speech in her own defence, which took a day and a half of court time. She urged the jury to understand her political work and lifestyle, which would help them see why the police should have planted guns and explosives on her. She noted that at the time of the Manchester bombing she had been living in Wivenhoe where doors were left open and people borrowed each other's magazines, and she had been able to produce unchallenged alibi witnesses to the fact that she was in Wivenhoe when the bomb was planted. Although she knew others in the case, she asserted that there was no evidence of any plots or conspiracies. Mendleson said that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> feelings behind those who would make bomb attacks on cabinet ministers but doing so [...] "isn't going to get rid of the capitalist system, because there is always somebody to step into his place unless the situation and conditions are right". In conclusion she stressed that those in dock [...] "are working together for a happier and more peaceful world".|$|E

2500|$|From {{tapes of}} Genie's {{first two months}} in the hospital, {{linguists}} discerned that by January 1971 she knew her own name, the words mother and father, the four color words red, blue, green, and brown, the words no and sorry, and a few miscellaneous nouns such as jewelry box, door, and bunny. She also appeared to understand negative commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them {{in the context of}} sentences was unclear. There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> intonation to indicate a yes or no question and that she understood imperative mood sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar. Her active vocabulary at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could remember what they might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not know whether she acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality? In checking off your list of taboos, how far can you take them? At what point does it just stop being interesting?". Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked [...] "Haven’t we seen most of this stuff before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so it’s difficult to identify with or care about the characters". The video was nominated for the 1993 Billie Awards in four categories: Consumer print, trade print (music) and consumer print (retail), the most for a single entry. It also was ranked at number 16 on VH1's [...] "50 Sexiest Video Moments".

Sachs believed that every time Eggold would be on screen, [...] "people are going to go, 'Wow!'". The producers were looking for an actor who could portray Silver as a [...] "quirky kid who moves to her own beat". Sachs explained that Jessica Stroup [...] "came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her hair up and she had a bandanna. She nailed it." [...] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked about Michael Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said [...] "he's just great". Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was cancelled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and {{he thought it was a}} great idea.
