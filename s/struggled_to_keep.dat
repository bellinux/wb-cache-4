5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E

He became an {{enthusiastic}} member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and {{was concerned about the}} fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming more interested in the lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E
5|$|Staunton {{challenged}} Saint-Amant to {{a longer}} match {{to be played}} in Paris for a stake of £100, equivalent to about £73,000 in 2015. Then he prepared new opening lines, especially those beginning 1.c4, which {{became known as the}} English Opening after this match. He also took Thomas Worrall and Harry Wilson to Paris as his assistants; this is the first known case where seconds were used in a match. Staunton gained a seven-game lead but then <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it before winning the match 13–8 (eleven wins, four draws, and six losses) in December 1843.|$|E

5|$|Because of his studies, he mainly {{played for}} Worksop's reserves, {{but in a}} first-team match against Northampton Town he caught the opposition's eye and they offered him a contract, leading him to turn {{professional}} {{for the first time}} in 1901. He played for Northampton for the whole 1901–02 season, finishing as top scorer with 14goals in 22games for the club. During that season he had impressed in an FA Cup match against Sheffield United, leading them to offer Chapman a contract at the end of the season; Chapman accepted but dropped down to amateur status, wishing to make use of his engineering qualifications in the local area. He played 22matches and scored twice for United, but <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his place in a team full of internationals, and was sold to Notts County for £300 at the end of 1902–03. Chapman turned professional again, but only made seven appearances in two years for County, scoring once.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased {{the size of the}} debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|Thơ {{turned against}} Diệm {{and played a}} passive role in the coup. Upon the {{formation}} of the new government, he <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the nation under control as the MRC and civilian cabinet often gave contradictory orders. Media freedom and political debate were increased, but this backfired as Saigon became engulfed in infighting, and Thơ had a series of newspapers shut down after they used the new-found freedom to attack him. During that time, South Vietnam's military situation deteriorated as the consequences of Diệm's falsification of military statistics and the misguided policies that resulted were exposed. Minh and Thơ had a plan to try to end the war by winning over non-communist members of the insurgency, believing that they constituted the majority of the opposition and could be coaxed away, weakening the communists. As part of this policy, which the U.S. opposed, the government chose to take a low-key military approach in an attempt to portray themselves to the Vietnamese public as peacemakers. However, they were deposed in Khánh's U.S.-backed coup before they could pursue their strategy.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Gilchrist scored two centuries in four matches {{for the state}} Colts and Second XI teams, and was rewarded with selection to make his first-class debut for New South Wales during the 1992–93 season, although he played purely as a batsman, due {{to the presence of}} incumbent wicketkeeper Phil Emery. In his first season, the side won the Sheffield Shield, Gilchrist scoring an unbeaten 20 in the second innings to secure an easy win over Queensland in the final. Gilchrist made 274 runs at an average of 30.44 in his debut season, a score of 75 being his only effort beyond fifty. He also made his debut in Mercantile Mutual limited overs competition. He <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his place in the side, playing only three first-class matches in the following season. He scored on 43 runs at 8.60; New South Wales won both competitions, but Gilchrist was overlooked for both finals and did not play a single limited overs match.|$|E
5|$|Soubise has {{historically}} taken {{the blame for}} the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the Rhineland. Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks that sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the advanced guard and also the rear guard that <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.|$|E
5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
