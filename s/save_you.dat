500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Savior" [...] {{deviates}} {{from the}} social and political topics normally discussed in Rise Against songs, and is instead about forgiveness and broken relationships. It {{tells the story of a}} couple who have recently split up. The two attempt to reconcile their differences, with lines such as [...] "I don't hate you, boy / I just want to <b>save</b> <b>you</b> while there's still something left to save." [...] Hanson and Liz Ramanand of Loudwire have characterized the lyrics as [...] "poignant", and [...] "poetic".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rolling Stone called the single [...] "a soaring ballad featuring Timberlake's falsetto, with verses and choruses that pile {{on top of}} one another with dizzying effect." [...] About.com reviewer Bill Lamb stated that the song [...] "is one of the most gorgeous pop melodies of the year." [...] He complimented the string-based arrangement of the song. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "superior", along with [...] "LoveStoned". Zach Baron of Pitchfork Media referred to it [...] "some real can't-let-go shit that'll <b>save</b> <b>you</b> the repeat stabs on the bad night." [...] Spence D. of IGN called it [...] "annoying" [...] but he complimented the use of echo vocals and swirling synths.|$|E
500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to <b>save</b> <b>you.</b> It's always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E
500|$|Still, Achebe {{seeks to}} portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: [...] "I never {{will take the}} stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth {{satisfied}} me—and this is well founded in the Ibo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct." [...] His perspective {{is reflected in the}} words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: [...] "whatever you are is never enough; you {{must find a way to}} accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to <b>save</b> <b>you</b> from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism." [...] And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: [...] "Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can <b>save</b> <b>you</b> from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E

If thy righteousness can <b>save</b> <b>thee,</b> then Christ died in vain; if nothing below or besides the death of Christ could <b>save</b> <b>thee,</b> then thy righteousness is in vain; {{one of the two}} must be cast away, either Christ's or thine.
