25|$|A <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> (also {{called a}} road hump, or undulation, and speed ramp) is a rounded traffic calming device {{used to reduce}} vehicle speed and volume on {{residential}} streets.

40|$|Abstract: Although {{there are}} no {{legislations}} governing the installation of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in Taiwan, their existence is of need in certain road sections, in particular, traffic calm areas. This study compares the effectiveness of single and tandem <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in <b>speed</b> reduction. Data collected include {{the distance from the}} <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> where drivers brake to reduce speed, which would shed light on the effective area of <b>speed</b> <b>humps.</b> Difference in <b>speed</b> reduced by single and tandem <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> are also determined by the before-after study to compare the effectiveness of these two types of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in <b>speed</b> reduction. The results reveal that <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> are effective in reducing speed and that tandem <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> are more effective than single <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in <b>speed</b> reduction. The findings in this study can be useful references for traffic engineering and can serve as guidelines for deciding which type of humps to be installed on certain road sections...|$|R

25|$|A speed table (or {{flat top}} hump or raised {{pedestrian}} crossing) is {{designed as a}} long <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally {{long enough for the}} entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top. The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions. Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.|$|E

They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Speed humps {{have become}} a common traffic calming {{technique}} to reduce vehicle speeds in residential neighborhoods. There {{is a need to}} develop standard <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> warning signs as well as to determine <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings that take into account both motorist comprehension and community preference. This study had two major goals. The first was to examine preference for various configurations for signs that are placed next to a <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> as well as for lead signs when approaching a series of speed humps. The second was to examine which type of <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings people prefer. There were 103 research participants in this study. In the first task, participants developed <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> signs that included <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> symbols, speed advisory messages, and location indication messages. In the second task, participants compared ten different <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings and determined which markings they: (1) liked the most, (2) thought made it easiest to actually detect a hump, (3) thought made it most difficult to do so, and (4) thought best indicated a raised pedestrian crosswalk. The paper discusses the various <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> sign configurations and roadway markings that participants preferred or thought would most effectively warn drivers. The results of this study will be used in future research to objectively evaluate comprehension, conspicuity, and driver behavior for different <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> sign and marking designs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, the topics {{concerning}} vehicular communications have been in conducting researches. One research topic is to acquire important information (e. g., traffic conditions, weather conditions) necessary to disseminate to car drivers. Road profile information is very important information that the drivers who know this in advance can use to avoid accidents. <b>Speed</b> <b>hump</b> on a road, {{which is one of}} the road profile information, can cause an accident especially at night if a driver has never passed through the road before. This paper proposes a technique to estimate <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile using quarter car model. In this technique, two acceleration sensors are needed to install at sprung mass and unsprung mass of a car. The signals of the two sensors are then passed through the estimation model to get the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile in time unit (i. e., height versus time). To obtain the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile in space unit (i. e., height versus distance), the information of car velocities while passing the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> is required. Simulation results from Simulink confirm that the proposed technique can estimate <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile accurately...|$|E

Data were collected in one hour or at least 50 vehicles at three locations. The effectiveness of the humps is measured by comparing the reduction in speed at the hump.
