40|$|In wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> of pile driving, it is ordinarily {{assumed that}} quake values are about 2. 5 mm (Smith 1962, Goble and Rausche 1976, Hirsh et al. 1976). Although {{theoretical}} {{studies have been}} made {{on the influence of}} the different parameters used in wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis,</b> the influence of the quake value has received little attention, only. Forehand and Reese (1964) correlated bearing capacity predictions with results from static loading tests using quake values ranging from 1. 3 to 7. 6 mm (0. 05 in to 0. 30 in). The same range of values was used by Ramey and Hudgins (1977) in a study of the sensitivity of the wave equation program solution to the soil parameters used in the analysis. From these studies, it was concluded that the original quake od 2. 5 mmvalue proposed by Smith (1962) is sufficiently precise and that variations of this parameter do not greatly influence the program solution. In the beginning of the use of wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis,</b> there was no possibility of determining the quake values for the soils other than by the general correlation of the wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> with results of loading tests. However, some ten years ago, research at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, developed a technique of obtaining measurements of force and acceleration at the pile head during the driving by means of the Pile Driving Analyzer (Goble et al., 1970). The continued development work by the same group resulted in the CAPWAP program (Rausche et al., 1972), which processes the measure...|$|R

40|$|Although dynamic {{methods such as}} driving {{formulas}} {{and wave}} equation analyses {{have been used for}} the determination of the bearing capacity of piles for decades, experience with dynamic methods for very long piles is still limited. This papers aims at evaluating performance of Hiley's formula and a wave equation program GRLWEAP using four cases of very long steel H-piles driven into weathered materials. The pile length studied varies from 78 in to 108 in. The geotechnical pile capacities and pile driving characteristics predicted using Hiley's formula and GRLWEAP are compared and the maximum stresses during installation of these long piles are studied. The wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> shows superiority over Hiley's formula at hard driving.

One of the methods currently available is the Dynamic or Energy Formulae that are the oldest and frequently used formulae in determining the bearing capacity of piles. The more recent methods are based on the Wave <b>Equation</b> <b>Analysis</b> and different formulations such as Case Method, TNOWave, CAPWAP® and TEPW AP were developed for pre-driving analysis and post-driving measurement applications. The energy or dynamic formulae, which were developed based on the Newtonian Impact theory, have been regarded as being unreliable and less accurate than the more analytical Wave <b>Equation</b> <b>Analysis</b> methods. The two main reasons for the poor performance of the dynamic formulae are that the hammer energy is assumed and that they do not take the dynamic resistance into account...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of {{axial bearing}} {{capacity}} plays {{an essential role}} in pile design. A part from semi-empirical and numerical methods, axial bearing capacity of piles can be either predicted by means of a maintain load test or dynamic load test. The latter test is based on wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> and it is provided by Pile driving analyzer (PDA). Combination of wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> with dynamic monitoring of the pile can result in prediction of axial bearing capacity of the pile and its distribution. This paper compares the axial capacity of pile obtained from PDA records and maintain load test (static load test) with predicted axial capacities obtained using analytical, empirical and finite element analysis.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a numerical one-dimensional wave <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> technique for piles and pile groups subjected to seismic horizontal ground motions in liquefiable zones. The so-called Earthquake Wave <b>Equation</b> <b>Analysis</b> for Piles (EQWEAP) procedure is introduced for piles subjected to horizontal earthquake excitations. Disregarding {{the effects of}} kinematic soil–pile interaction, the seismic responses of piles {{can be obtained by}} approximating the free-field ground response analysis, the ultimate earth pressure model, and the ground displacement profiles. The nonlinearities of the concrete piles were modeled using the approximate tri-linear moment–curvature relationships. A case study and application concerns were presented. Although the analysis is in one dimension, it is found to be effective and able to provide a rapid estimation in foundation design when seismic pile behaviors are of interest. The advantages of this analysis are the time efficiency of the seismic design of pile foundations and the relative simplicity of the analysis. In addition, it suggests alternative modeling for the dynamic analysis adopting the commonly known static models and/or methods...|$|R
