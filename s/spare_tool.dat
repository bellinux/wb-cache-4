5|$|Once the {{handrail}} was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} attaching the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a <b>spare</b> <b>tool</b> and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E
50|$|Another type of locking skewer uses {{a uniquely}} shaped nut {{that can only}} be turned using the {{matching}} socket/key, which is typically a wrench-like tool that is small enough to fit on a keychain. Though expensive, locking skewers provide additional security and convenience. Locking wheels with an additional U-Lock or removing the front wheel and locking it to the frame and rear wheel would provide the highest security. A disadvantage is that if the owner loses the special tool then {{they will not be able}} to undo the skewer, and will need to obtain a <b>spare</b> <b>tool</b> from the manufacturer. The same type of uniquely shaped nut used for the locking skewer can also be found for suspension forks, V-brakes, and solid-axle wheels in addition to regular wheels and seatposts. Manufacturers such as Pitlock and Pinhead offer services to supply additional lock nuts to an existing key number registered by the owner.|$|E

50|$|As Modern Air's West Berlin charter permit did not {{authorise}} {{the carriage}} of cargo, the airline's Berlin management decided to utilise the only lightly filled cargo holds of its Tegel-based CV-990s to carry inbound catering and essential <b>spares</b> and <b>tooling,</b> including a <b>spare</b> tyre. The reason for carrying catering destined for passengers booked on return flights {{all the way}} from Berlin rather than appointing local suppliers at destination airports was that it worked out cheaper and was deemed more reliable and safer (compared with relying on overseas suppliers with varying quality and hygiene standards and who often plied their trade only seasonally) while the reason for carrying essential <b>spares</b> and <b>tooling</b> on outbound aircraft was to ensure emergency serviceability at destination airports lacking CV-990 spares inventories, given the type's narrow operator base (compared with the then ubiquitous Boeing and Douglas types and other popular contemporary aircraft types).|$|R

50|$|Found in Jiu Hua Mountains. Originally it was dug up {{from the}} farmlands of Jiu Hua many years ago. Not knowing of the mystical powers it possessed, the merchants decided to melt it down so it could turn into <b>spare</b> <b>tools.</b> However, {{before it could be}} melted down, a con artist, Wong Seiyo, bought it from them. Since he saved it from being melted down, the Holy Copperware decided to let him {{be able to use the}} mystical powers even though he wasn't a worthy successor. Using its powers, Seiyo decided to take {{advantage}} of the people of Jiu Hua by using the land's legends to make the people believe he was a god. When Mao arrived, he stopped Seiyo's scheme, made the people believe in their homeland again, and found another Legendary Cooking Utensil. The Holy Copperware has the power to instantly soften dried ingredients, such as dried abalone (which would usually take three or more days to do).|$|R

40|$|Condition-based {{maintenance}} (CBM) {{has received}} increasing {{attention in the}} literature over the past years. The application of CBM in practice, however, is lagging behind. This is, at least in part, explained by the complexity of real-life systems {{as opposed to the}} stylized ones studied most often. To overcome this issue, research is focusing more and more on complex systems, with multiple components subject to various dependencies. Existing classifications of these dependencies in the literature are no longer sufficient. Therefore, we provide an extended classification scheme. Besides the types of dependencies identified in the past (economic, structural, and stochastic), we add resource dependence, where multiple components are connected through, e. g., shared <b>spares,</b> <b>tools,</b> or maintenance workers. Furthermore, we extend the existing notion of structural dependence by distinguishing between structural dependence from a technical point of view and structural dependence from a performance point of view (e. g., through a series or parallel setting). We review the advances made with respect to CBM. Our main focus is on the implications of dependencies on the structure of the optimal CBM policy. We link our review to practice by providing real-life examples, thereby stressing current gaps in the literature...|$|R

25|$|The Finns modernized their T-26s in 1942–1943. Eight T-26 mod. 1931 tanks {{received}} turrets {{from the}} single-turreted T-26 or BT tanks. Additionally, turrets from irreparable T-26s or BTs of different models were mounted on KhT-26s, KhT-130s and KhT-133s, which had flame-throwing equipment removed. A ball mount for the DT tank machine gun was installed {{on some of}} these tanks in the front armoured plate of the underturret box.

The command’s engineering responsibilities soon expanded beyond missiles, assuming engineering work for many new weapon and combat systems used by the Navy’s surface fleet. The workforce also took on the responsibility of providing logistics support—referring to the procurement, maintenance and transportation of what the fleet needed—including maintenance and repair, training manuals, essential <b>spare</b> parts, <b>tools</b> and test equipment. The command also adopted the program of underway replenishment, which allows ships to receive fuel, ammunition and supplies while at sea.|$|R

Despite minor aerodynamic modifications and weight-saving made to the van - removal of the passenger seat, <b>spare</b> tyre, <b>tools,</b> windscreen wipers, Hammond himself - and using a Dodge Viper driving in front allowing the Transit to slipstream behind it, Schmitz was unable to do a lap time of less than 10 minutes, achieving a lap time of 10 minutes and 8 seconds.|$|R
