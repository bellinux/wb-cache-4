5|$|A {{series of}} {{negotiations}} between <b>Sultan</b> Ali and the Temenggong ensued with the British colonial government {{acting as the}} intermediary, after <b>Sultan</b> Ali had questioned the Temenggong's rights of keeping the state revenue to himself. Initially, the Temenggong proposed to split the trade revenue of Johor on condition that <b>Sultan</b> Ali surrendered his claims of sovereignty over Johor. The term was declined by <b>Sultan</b> Ali. Both parties agreed to seek the direct intervention of the British government, among which, the British Governor of the Straits Settlement, Colonel William Butterworth, and his successor, Edmund Blundell were roped in to act as meditators.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, <b>Sultan</b> Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} <b>Sultan</b> Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which <b>Sultan</b> Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, <b>Sultan</b> Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, <b>Sultan</b> Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, <b>Sultan</b> Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate <b>Sultan</b> Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} with his grandfather, <b>Sultan</b> Ibrahim, <b>Sultan</b> Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained relations with the Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved <b>Sultan</b> Iskandar. Nevertheless, <b>Sultan</b> Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E

5|$|In 1698, Zanzibar {{became part}} of the {{overseas}} holdings of Oman, falling {{under the control of the}} <b>Sultan</b> of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin <b>Sultan</b> moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the <b>Sultan</b> of Oman while Majid became the first <b>Sultan</b> of Zanzibar. During his 14-year reign as <b>Sultan,</b> Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third <b>Sultan,</b> Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sultan</b> Iskandar also {{fostered a}} fairly close {{relationship}} with the <b>Sultan</b> of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, particularly during his days as the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong.

5|$|<b>Sultan</b> Iskandar is {{a fourth}} {{generation}} descendant of <b>Sultan</b> Abu Bakar, {{who in turn}} {{was the son of}} Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, the Temenggong of Johor. In turn, some of Daeng Ibrahim's patrilineal ancestors were also Temenggongs of Johor serving under their respective Sultans. It is from this ancestral heritage to which the dynastical name of his lineage is known—Temenggong dynasty. The preceding <b>Sultan</b> prior to <b>Sultan</b> Abu Bakar, Ali and his predecessors who ruled Johor from the 17th to 19th centuries, were descended from Abdul Jalil, a Bendahara. Abdul Jalil became <b>Sultan</b> in 1699 after the death of <b>Sultan</b> Mahmud Shah and adopted the title <b>Sultan</b> Abdul Jalil Shah IV. In this pattern, the names of the dynasties which the ruling houses of Johor were known. The Temenggong dynasty is also related to the Bendahara dynasty by bloodline; genealogical records show that <b>Sultan</b> Abdul Jalil IV is also a direct patrilineal ancestor of <b>Sultan</b> Iskandar.|$|E

5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the <b>Sultan.</b> <b>Sultan</b> Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was {{quick to point out that}} the Sultan's late father, <b>Sultan</b> Hussein had never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was under the control of the Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the <b>Sultan</b> of Lingga, <b>Sultan</b> Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with <b>Sultan</b> Ali.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sultan</b> {{responded to}} the ban by putting {{pressure}} on the state authorities to enforce isolation of the Johor hockey teams from all national tournaments.

The incident {{attracted the attention of}} the <b>Sultan,</b> who personally summoned Gomez to his palace, Istana Bukit Serene, where he was promptly reprimanded and assaulted by the <b>Sultan.</b> Following Gomez's meeting with the <b>Sultan,</b> Gomez sought treatment to his face and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the <b>Sultan</b> for assault. Gomez elaborated that the <b>Sultan</b> bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the <b>Sultan</b> was solely responsible for the injuries.|$|E

The first <b>Sultan</b> of Terengganu, <b>Sultan</b> Zainal Abidin I established his court near Kuala Berang, then he moved his court a few more times until he settled near Bukit Keledang, Kuala Terengganu. During the early 18th century, Kuala Terengganu was still a small town. It was described as having about one thousand houses that were scattered around the town. The Chinese were already present in Kuala Terengganu at that time. Half of the population were Chinese and they were engaged in agriculture and trading. After the death of <b>Sultan</b> Daud in 1831, a brief civil war erupted between two claimants to the throne, namely Tengku Mansur and Tengku Omar. Tengku Omar was based at Bukit Puteri while Tengku Mansur was based at Balik Bukit. Tengku Omar was defeated by Tengku Mansur and he fled from Terengganu. Tengku Mansur became the next <b>Sultan</b> as <b>Sultan</b> Mansur II. His son, <b>Sultan</b> Muhammad succeeded him as the next <b>Sultan</b> after his death in 1837.
