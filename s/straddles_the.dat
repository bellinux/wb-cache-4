5|$|The Pasadena–Baytown area, {{including}} Deer Park and La Porte, <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> Houston Ship Channel and {{has since}} the world wars been defined by the heavy industry along its shores. The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to the oil industry earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate. But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of heavy industry.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|Wagga Wagga is at {{the eastern}} end of the Riverina region where the slopes of the Great Dividing Range flatten and form the Riverina plain.

5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E

After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E
5|$|NY286 {{begins at}} the ramp {{connecting}} NY590 southbound to Browncroft Boulevard just inside the Rochester city limits. It heads east through residential surroundings as a four-lane highway, proceeding through the remainder of NY590 exit7 as it enters the northernmost portion {{of the town of}} Brighton. East of NY590, NY286 widens to become a divided highway. It passes into Penfield upon crossing Irondequoit Creek and curves southeast as it <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> northern boundary of Ellison Park. During this stretch, it intersects with Old Browncroft Boulevard, the pre-divided highway alignment of Browncroft Boulevard which is now discontinuous near its midpoint.|$|E

5|$|Scarborough is {{represented}} by five ridings for the Provincial government and five full ridings plus one partial riding for the Federal government. The Federal riding of Pickering—Scarborough East <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> border between Scarborough and Pickering. Municipal riding boundaries were harmonized within the City of Toronto to match the provincial boundaries in 1999 through provincial legislation called The Fewer Municipal Politicians Act of 1999. This took effect on December 1, 2000. Each provincial riding is split between two city councillors. Thus Scarborough {{is represented}} by ten councillors.|$|E

5|$|The South Mountain Freeway, {{presently}} under construction, is a southerly bypass of Downtown Phoenix {{which will}} {{run along the}} southern edge of the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix and pass just to the south and west of South Mountain Park. It begins at the already complete traffic interchange of the Santan Freeway and Interstate 10. Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee, the freeway <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> border with the Gila River Indian Reservation. Turning northwest and eventually north, the freeway will follow the 59th and 55th Avenue alignments north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a total area of , making it the second-largest city in Slovakia by area (after the {{township}} of Vysoké Tatry). Bratislava <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> Danube River, which it had developed around and for centuries was the chief transportation route to other areas. The river passes through the city from the west to the southeast. The Middle Danube basin begins at Devín Gate in western Bratislava. Other rivers are the Morava River, which forms the northwestern border {{of the city and}} enters the Danube at Devín, the Little Danube, and the Vydrica, which enters the Danube in the borough of Karlova Ves.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> SchuylerTompkins county line, with the {{northbound}} lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Sinatra {{bought a}} share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, a casino hotel which <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> California-Nevada state line on the north shores of Lake Tahoe. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which {{attracted}} the Sinatra show business pals, Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel. Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands. That year, Sinatra's son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., was kidnapped, but was eventually released unharmed. Sinatra restored his gaming license in February 1981, following support from Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|In Mechanicville, US4 and NY32 briefly overlap NY67. Farther north, the two routes split {{north of}} Stillwater at the {{southern}} edge of the Saratoga National Historical Park. While US4 <b>straddles</b> <b>the</b> park to the east, NY32 follows the southern and western extents of the park before rejoining US4 south of Schuylerville. In Schuylerville, the two routes are concurrent with NY29 for a short distance before exiting the village. To the north of the village in Northumberland, NY32 separates from US4 and heads northwest to Gansevoort, where it meets NY50. NY32 continues north on the right-of-way of NY50 to South Glens Falls, where US9 joins NY32 northward across the Hudson River into Glens Falls.|$|E
