5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens {{to give us a}} coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E

Tedd Kessler of the NME called the album [...] "teeth-clattering but exhilarating", writing that [...] "behind every wall of hip hop noise ... there lurks a heart-bursting tune and that's what makes it alluring." [...] Pitchfork wrote that Herren had [...] "painted {{a portrait of the}} peculiar <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> urbanity." [...] Reviewing the album alongside two other Warp releases (Plaid's Double Figure and Squarepusher's Go Plastic), Uncut described Vocal Studies as [...] "the pick of this crop" [...] and concluded that it [...] "genuinely seems like a next step for a genre in perpetual need of reinvention." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{committees}} in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining {{funds for the}} construction of the pedestal. The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete. There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and {{of the fact that the}} gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. Harper's Weekly declared its wish that [...] "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once." [...] The New York Times stated that [...] "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> finances." [...] Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.|$|E

2500|$|One {{position}} {{is to say}} that the constant increase of entropy we observe happens only because of the initial <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> universe. Other possible states of the universe (for example, a universe at heat death equilibrium) would actually result in no increase of entropy. In this view, the apparent T-asymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology: [...] why did the universe start with a low entropy? This view, if it remains viable in the light of future cosmological observation, would connect this problem to one of the big open questions beyond the reach of today's physics [...] the question of initial conditions of the universe.|$|E
2500|$|The ‘argument from hallucination’ has {{traditionally}} {{been one of those}} used by proponents of the philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism.

[...] That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> health, and so on. [...] Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{hindrance}} {{to effectively}} organizing the militia was the scattered population of only 14,273; and of this number, {{the majority were}} scattered around the state on isolated farms. The only real town in Arkansas in 1820 was Arkansas Post, a tiny village {{of no more than}} forty houses. To make matters worse, there were few roads in Territorial Arkansas, thereby making communication with the militiamen very difficult. Adjutant General A. P. Spencer noted that some militia units were unable to drill since [...] "the extent of Territory they cover is [...] great to muster them at one point..." [...] As late as 1827, Governor George Izard was complaining of the difficulty of organizing the rural Arkansans into a cohesive militia force: [...] "The scattered <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Population here and the constant changes of Residence among the Inhabitants make it impractical to organize the Militia in such a manner as may render their Service prompt and efficient".|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} theory of {{intrinsic}} photoluminescence of two-dimensional electron systems {{in the vicinity of}} the v= 1 quantum Hall state. We focus predominantly on the recombination of a band of initial ''excitonic states'' that are the low-lying energy <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> model at v= 1. It is shown that the recombination <b>of</b> excitonic <b>states</b> can account for recent observations of the polarization-resolved spectra of a high-mobility GaAs quantum well. The asymmetric broadening of the spectral line in the sigma_ polarization is explained to be the result of the ''shakeup'' of spin waves upon radiative recombination <b>of</b> excitonic <b>states.</b> We derive line shapes for the recombination <b>of</b> excitonic <b>states</b> in the presence of long-range disorder that compare favorably with the experimental observations. We also discuss the stabilities and recombination spectra of other (''charged'') initial <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> model. An additional high-energy line observed in experiment is shown to be consistent with the recombination of a positively charged state. The recombination spectrum of a negatively charged initial state, predicted by our model but not observed in the present experiments, is shown to provide a direct measure of the formation energy of the smallest ''charged spin texture'' of the v= 1 state...|$|R
40|$|Hematopoiesis is {{an ideal}} model system for stem cell biology with {{advanced}} experimental access. A systems view on the interactions of core transcription factors is important for understanding differentiation mechanisms and dynamics. In this manuscript, we construct a Boolean network to model myeloid differentiation, specifically from common myeloid progenitors to megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. By interpreting the hematopoietic literature and translating experimental evidence into Boolean rules, we implement binary dynamics on the resulting 11 -factor regulatory network. Our network contains interesting functional modules and a concatenation of mutual antagonistic pairs. The <b>state</b> space <b>of</b> <b>our</b> model is a hierarchical, acyclic graph, typifying the principles of myeloid differentiation. We observe excellent agreement between the steady <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> model and microarray expression profiles of two different studies. Moreover, perturbations of the network topology correctly reproduce reported knockout phenotypes in silico. We predict previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions and alterations of the differentiation process, and line out reprogramming strategies...|$|R
