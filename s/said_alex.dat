500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", <b>said</b> <b>Alex</b> Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything {{you would want to}} see." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Henson worked with {{illustrator}} / designer William Stout on {{a feature film}} starring animatronic dinosaurs with the working title of The Natural History Project. In 1991, news stories written around the premiere of The Jim Henson Company-produced Dinosaurs sitcom highlighted the show's connection to Henson. [...] "Jim Henson dreamed up the show's basic concept about three years ago," [...] said a New York Times article in April 1991. 'He {{wanted it to be}} a sitcom with a pretty standard structure, with the biggest differences being that it's a family of dinosaurs and their society has this strange toxic life style,' said [...] Brian Henson. But until The Simpsons took off, <b>said</b> <b>Alex</b> Rockwell, {{a vice president of the}} Henson organization, 'people thought it was a crazy idea.' A New Yorker article said that Henson continued to work on a dinosaur project (presumably the Dinosaurs concept) until the [...] "last months of his life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once he and Hamish Imlach {{were heading}} for a gig, and stopped for a drink. In the lounge bar, the barmaid <b>said</b> 'Yes, gentlemen.' <b>Alex</b> <b>said</b> 'Gentlemen? Before you is the cream of Scottish folk music - Alex Campbell and Hamish Imlach. We'll have two pints of your best and twenty Benson & Hedges.'

6000|$|... "Well, I {{have no more}} to say," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alex,</b> [...] "only please to mind this, Langford junior, you may do just as {{you please}} with our horse, drive him to Jericho for what I care. It was for your own sake and Beatrice's that I spoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I don't {{happen to}} have a sixpence," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alex,</b> with an honest openness, {{overcoming}} his desire to add [...] "in my pocket." [...] It cost him an effort; for at school, where each slight advantage was noted, and comparisons perpetually made, Fred's superior wealth and larger allowance had secured him the adherence of some; and though he either knew it not, or despised such mammon worship, his rival was sufficiently awake to it to be uncomfortable in acknowledging his poverty.|$|E
50|$|Mammary {{intercourse}} is <b>said</b> by <b>Alex</b> Comfort {{to produce}} mutual orgasm {{in women with}} sensitive breasts (what Margot Anand terms local orgasms of the breast), {{and it was one}} of the nine substitute exercises for penetrative sexual activities, as detailed in the Paradis Charnels of 1903. This act can be combined with fellatio.|$|R
5000|$|Rodrigues {{also wrote}} soap operas, movie scripts, and novels. In the 1960s and 70s {{he became a}} {{well-known}} TV persona and sports commentator. His fanciful columns on soccer, where he melded scant commentary on the games' happenings with his literary obsessions and stock phrases, are <b>said</b> by <b>Alex</b> Bellos to take have taken football-writing [...] "into a new dimension".|$|R
5000|$|Wujciak was {{considered}} one of the top inside linebacker prospects of 2006. As such, he was heavily recruited by several major colleges and received offers from Maryland, Michigan State, Nebraska, Rutgers, Wisconsin, and Louisville. His mother, Erin Wujciak, <b>said</b> that <b>Alex</b> chose Maryland because he believed that head coach Ralph Friedgen and recruiting coordinator Dave Sollazzo were [...] "straight shooters" [...] and did not make unrealistic promises about playing time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who said so? No, {{not a bit}} of it!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alex.</b> [...] "No {{one thought}} so in reality, {{though it was a}} good joke to put him in a rage, and pretend to think that he could not do anything. Why, it took a dozen times more spirit for him to be first in {{everything}} than for me, who had been knocked about all my life. And he was up to anything, Bee, to anything. The matches at foot-ball will be good for nothing now; I am sure I shan't care if we do win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but six months--a {{whole year}} is an immense time," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alex.</b> [...] "O yes, he must, Bee! Reading does not cost him half the trouble it does other people; and his verses, they never fail--never {{except when he}} is careless; and the sure way to prevent that is to run him up for time. That is right. Why there!" [...] exclaimed Alex joyfully, [...] "I do {{believe this is the}} very best thing for his success!" [...] Beatrice could not help laughing, and Alex {{immediately}} sobered down as the remembrance crossed him, that if Fred were living a week hence, they would have great reason to be thankful.|$|E

50|$|Alex {{is one of}} Nathan and Simon’s enemies. He is {{considered}} to be the school bully. Not much is <b>said</b> about <b>Alex’s</b> appearance but Nathan often refers to him as looking like an ‘ape’ or a ‘monkey’. Alex is not the smartest kid on the block. This is seen when Nathan makes fun of him saying “his brain is rolling around in his head”. Although Alex is a bully, when Simon died he was sensitive to Nathan.|$|R
5000|$|... "Possibly {{the most}} famous person you've never heard of," [...] {{reviewed}} Dan Carrier, Camden New Journal, in April, 2013. [...] "The Promoter makes clear that boring is perhaps the one thing this 56-year-old is not. Documenting his past infamy as a nightclub promoter who could have shocked Iggy Pop into sobriety, director Ed Edwards also captures the modern-day Pereno at a creative peak, before disaster inevitably strikes," [...] <b>said</b> - <b>Alex</b> Bellotti of the Hampstead & Highgate Express, 16 May 2013.|$|R

5000|$|When {{describing}} the new record, <b>Alex</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "the next record {{is a concept}} record. If The Beatles had Sgt.

5000|$|Dead Birds, Turner's first feature, {{starring}} Henry Thomas, Isaiah Washington and Patrick Fugit, premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.

5000|$|Rock Hard Ten was {{the second}} {{favorite}} for the Belmont after finishing second in both the Derby and Preakness.

According to Newsnight editor Peter Barron, some viewers questioned {{the premise of the}} interview; that the new SNP government appeared to be picking a fight with London. Other viewers thought that Wark's line of questioning was too aggressive and therefore discourteous. The biggest controversy, however, regarded how the interview ended.
