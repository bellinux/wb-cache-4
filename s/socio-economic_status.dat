5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.

5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>status</b> between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E

The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same <b>socio-economic</b> <b>status.</b> Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E

For example, according to a research conducted in Vancouver, Canada, 82.9% of mothers breastfeed their babies at birth, but the number differed between Caucasians (91.6%) and non-Caucasians (56.8%), with the difference essentially attributed to marital status, education and family income. In the United States, mothers of lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>status</b> have been found less likely to breastfeed, although this may be partly related to adverse effects of government nutrition supplementation programs that provide subsidies for infant formula.|$|E

30|$|A more {{inclusive}} vision of engineering crossed with Making could build future engineering capacity by engaging individuals not {{attracted to the}} traditional engineering community. Additionally, the actions of Makers as citizen engineers could raise awareness among the public about engineering. The Center for the Advancement of Engineering Educationâ€™s Academic Pathways Study (Atman et al. 2010) studied undergraduate persistence in engineering and found two groups of students with different motivations for engagement. The first group sought financial security, aiming for graduation while overcoming barriers of foundational math and science courses. The second group approached their studies with intrinsic psychological motivation, seeking meaning and impact through their studies. Students in the second group represented myriad races, ethnicities, and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>statuses</b> (Atman et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2010. Fertility {{is one of}} {{the major}} tenets of demography. Its {{importance}} lies in the determination of fertility trends in a country, in a specific time period. These statistical inferences of fertility play an imperative role in population policy formation and planning. Thus the importance of the measurement of fertility remains undisputed. Due to the significance of fertility, its measurement and its profound impact on societies, acknowledging and addressing the quality of fertility data is of great importance. This research study was conceived in response to the above concern. This study aims at addressing and providing insight into birth history data irregularities and determining interventions of working with this issue in the context of South Africa. Through secondary analysis (i. e. descriptive exploratory and comparative analysis) the study sought to firstly establish a demographic profile of women associated with inconsistent and inaccurate reporting of their birth histories. Secondly the research attempted to ascertain a relationship between the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>statuses</b> of individuals and retrospective reporting. A third objective was to note the sex-selectiveness of reporting (i. e. were more girls or boys reported or misreported on in the retrospective birth histories). The study has established that older, married women with some educational attainment, of rural areas from either the middle and lower income categories tend to misreport more frequently than their converse counterparts. Furthermore, a plausible relationship between the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>statuses</b> of individuals was observed. In terms of the sex-selectiveness of reporting, in general, boys were reported on more consistently than girls. However in certain cases, it was found that rural and middle income women reported accurately on girl children born alive and dead girl children. Recommendations made with respect to improve the quality of fertility data for include the proper training of enumerators and data capturers, quality control during data collection, testing of questionnaires, dealing with social, cultural and language barriers and the reinforcement of publicity campaigns for censuses and surveys...|$|R

40|$|In {{the midst}} of the Revolutionary fervor, fifty-one women from Edenton, North Carolina stood against British policies, {{specifically}} the Tea and Coercive Acts. While it is easy to assume that the women banded together for the not just the Revolutionary but the Feminist cause due to their gender and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>statuses,</b> a deeper analysis of the petition shows that the petition was gender-neutral and influenced by the earlier North Carolina Provincial Congress Resolutions. Incidentally, it was Penelope Barker, the supposed ring-leader of the Edenton Tea Party, who sent a fiery letter along with the petition to London that spurred most of the controversy and had a Feminist flare. Through an analysis of Edenton, the signers of the petition, the details surrounding the event, and the response to the petition and letter, this thesis demonstrates the importance of the Edenton Tea Party in the discussion of Revolutionary America...|$|R
