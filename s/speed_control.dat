Regenerative VFDs are widely used where <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of overhauling loads is required.|$|E
5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to be {{substantially}} automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E

25|$|For safety {{reasons the}} railcars {{could not be}} run as single {{vehicles}} since they each had only one set of pinions.

25|$|When in forward flight, the Aeroscraft is {{controlled}} by the aerodynamic control surfaces (vertical stabilizers, empennages and canards); however, the low <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> system aids the pilot in lower wind conditions such as during VTOL and hover. The LSC system acts as a rear thruster to propel the vehicle in forward flight, and permits the thrust to be redirected while in hover to help the vehicle maintain desired positioning and orientation.|$|E
25|$|The Sea Vampire {{has several}} key {{differences}} from their land-based counterparts. It {{could be easily}} distinguished be {{the presence of a}} V-shaped arrestor hook that retracted to a high-mounted position above the jet pipe. The Sea Vampire was fitted with enlarged air brakes and landing flaps for superior low <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> during landing approaches, along with construction to higher load factors to account for the greater stresses involved in carrier landings.|$|E

25|$|Variable <b>speed</b> <b>controlled</b> AC motors are {{provided}} {{with a range of}} different power inverter, variable-frequency drive or electronic commutator technologies.|$|R
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped <b>speed</b> <b>control.</b> Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E
25|$|Frank J. Sprague {{improved}} on the DC motor in 1884 by {{solving the}} problem of maintaining a constant speed with varying load and reducing sparking from the brushes. Sprague sold his motor through Edison Co. It is easy to vary speed with DC motors, which made them suited {{for a number of}} applications such as electric street railways, machine tools and certain other industrial applications where <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> was desirable.|$|E

This version featured Solar Yellow brake calipers, body-color grille, solar-tinted sunscreen glass, liftgate mounted spoiler, 17-inch all-season performance tires, four-wheel anti-lock brakes with low-speed traction control, <b>speed</b> <b>control,</b> and a sport suspension. Brightwork accents included chrome body-side moldings, a chrome exhaust tip and , chrome-plated, and five-spoke Empire aluminum wheels. Exterior identification included a 'Street Cruiser' badge with Solar Yellow accents on the liftgate and 'Route 66' badges {{on the front}} doors. A total of 1443 Route 66 models were produced in North America, with 142 of those equipped with 5 speed manual transmissions.|$|E

25|$|Robinson {{remained}} with Jupiter for its shakedown cruise, {{during which the}} collier traveled from the West Coast to the Atlantic {{and became the first}} naval vessel to transit the Panama Canal. At the end of Jupiter 's trials, Robinson reported that turboelectric drive was lighter and more compact than the competing propulsion methods, and moreover was easily operated by relatively unskilled sailors, permitted accurate <b>speed</b> <b>control,</b> and exceeded General Electric's economy estimates by a remarkable 18 percent. Based on his report, turboelectric drive was selected for installation in the new battleship California, and Robinson was assigned to superintend the construction of Californias electric equipment at the Mare Island Navy Yard.|$|E
25|$|Today's LIRR {{signal system}} {{has evolved from}} its legacy Pennsylvania Railroad-based system. The {{railroad}} utilizes a variety of wayside railroad signals including position light, color light and dwarf signals. In addition, much of the LIRR {{is equipped with a}} bi-directional Pulse code cab signaling called automatic <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> (ASC), though portions of the railway still retain single direction wayside only signalling. Unlike other railroads which began using color light signals in the 20th century, the LIRR did not begin using signals with color lights on its above ground sections until 2006. Some portions of the railway lack automatic signals and cab signals completely, instead train and track car movements are governed only by timetable and verbal/written train orders.|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon pile}} {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a stack of carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A carbon pile resistor {{can also be used}} as a <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts. A carbon pile resistor can be incorporated in automatic voltage regulators for generators, where the carbon pile controls the field current to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the carbon microphone.|$|E

25|$|AC {{traction}} still occasionally uses dual {{overhead wires}} instead of single phase lines. The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> and the two-phase lines are problematic.|$|E
500|$|The steel {{track is}} [...] {{in length and}} {{the height of the}} lift is {{approximately}} [...] The angle of the first descent is approximately 74 degrees. Also, the roller coaster includes trim brakes and magnetic brakes for <b>speed</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
500|$|The 147 is the [...] "universal" [...] {{version of}} the 122, {{designed}} for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and motor <b>speed</b> <b>control,</b> but is otherwise identical. The signal input is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The motor speed switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than the DC voltage control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 {{is identical to the}} 147, except that it is housed in a [...] cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond's new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66. It contained seven different tab controls and six speakers. It has a completely different interface from other Leslies, using a 12-pin amphenol connector.|$|E
