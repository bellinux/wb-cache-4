40|$|The wet sclerophyll {{forests in}} {{southern}} Tasmania {{are dominated by}} Eucalyptus obliqua and are managed on a notional <b>silvicultural</b> <b>rotation</b> length of 80 to 100 years. Over time, this {{will lead to a}} simplified stand structure with a truncated forest age and thus reduce the proportion of coarse woody debris (CWD), such as old living trees and large diameter logs, within the production forest landscape. Course woody debris is regarded as a critical habitat for biodiversity management in forest ecosystems. Fungi, {{as one of the most}} important wood decay agents, are key to understanding and managing biodiversity associated with decaying wood. In Australia, wood-inhabiting fungi are poorly known and the biodiversity associated with CWD has not been well studied. This thesis describes two studies that were undertaken to examine the importance of CWD as habitat for wood-inhabiting fungi in the wet sclerophyll forests of Tasmania. Study one examined the effect of changing tree age on the fungal species richness, fungal community composition and rotten wood associations within the tree. Six living E. obliqua trees in each of three age-classes (69, 105 and > 150 years old) were felled. Each tree was cross-cut at nine standard sampling points and the decay profile was mapped. Fungi were isolated from rotten wood at each sampling point, and from control samples of clear heartwood and sapwood. Samples of each rotten wood type were collected and classified, based on their colour and texture. Wood-inhabiting fungi in Australia are not well known, making the identification of fungal cultures problematic. In study one, cultures of wood-inhabiting fungi were grouped into putative species groups and identified using both morphological techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA. Ninety-one species of wood-inhabiting fungi were isolated from the 18 trees examined in study one. Eight different rotten wood types were identified and studied. The community composition of wood-inhabiting fungi in trees greater than 150 years old (the oldest age-class examined) was very different compared with those found in the younger two age-classes; more than half of all species were only found in these older trees. In addition, trees in the oldest age-class contained greater volumes and proportions of rotten wood habitat. The second study examined the wood-inhabiting fungi that had been isolated in a previous study by Z-Q Yuan (University of Tasmania) from large (> 85 cm) and small (30 - 60 cm) diameter E. obliqua logs in mature, unlogged forests and 20 - 30 year-old logged forests that were regenerating after clearfelling. The previously described morphospecies were tested using PCR-sequencing of the ITS region of ribosomal DNA and a consensus final species groupings was obtained. This study determined that a total of 60 species of wood-decay fungi had been commonly isolated from the 36 logs examined. Significant differences in fungal community structure were found between mature forests and regenerating forests. Some differences in fungal species richness and community composition were also found between logs of different sizes. These studies are among the first to examine wood-inhabiting fungi in mature E. obliqua trees and logs in Tasmania. The ecological information obtained from this research will assist in the development and deployment of strategies for the management of mature living trees and logs in wet eucalypt forests in Tasmania. This research suggests there is a need for forest managers to consider instigating measures that allow for some trees in the production forest landscape to live long enough to develop decayed wood habitat. This will provide important habitat for fungi as both trees and large diameter logs, sustaining an important component of forest biodiversity...|$|E

30|$|The Faustmann formula {{proposes that}} a {{rotation}} period that maximises the soil expectation value (SEV) {{will result in}} a final cutting age that is economically sustainable (Faustmann 1968). The Pressler formula (1860) {{can also be used to}} calculate the optimal rotation period. However, Samuelson (1976) suggested, following a discussion about the validities of the Faustmann and Pressler formula, that the Faustmann formula has better validity than other optimal rotation period formulae. The initial formula for maximising SEV has been modified to include variables that represent environmental characteristics (Hartman 1976). Hyytiäinen et al. (2004) included the optimal rotation simulation formula into their process-based forest growth model. Formulae for the optimal rotation period were originally applied only to even-aged forests but have recently been used to calculate optimal rotation periods for uneven-aged and natural forests (Chang and Gadow 2010). Previous studies have also investigated how economic conditions affect forest profitability; for example, Parajuli and Chang (2012) included timber price in their sensitivity analyses. On the other hand, Halbritter and Deegen (2015) investigated the relationship between <b>silvicultural</b> practices and <b>rotation</b> period by analysing how planting density influences the optimal rotation period. Ultimately, the optimal rotation period is site-specific, and the SEV depends on economic, stand and site conditions, as well as silvicultural practices used. A previous study showed that a few subjective conditions can change the SEV and optimal rotation period when forest management regimes aiming to maximise the SEV are applied (Davis et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study: To {{review and}} {{acknowledge}} {{the value of}} carbon sequestration by forest management in the Mediterranean area. Material and methods: We review the main effects of forest management by comparing the effects of silvicultural systems (even-aged vs. uneven-aged stands, coppice systems, agroforestry systems), <b>silvicultural</b> options (thinning, <b>rotation</b> period, species composition), afforestation, harvesting, fire impact or effects of shrub layer on carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean area. Main results: We illustrate as forest management can clearly improve forest carbon sequestration amounts. We conclude that forest management is {{an effective way to}} maintain and enhance high carbon sequestration rates in order to cope with climate change and provision of ecosystem services. We also think that although much effort has been put into this topic research, there are still certain gaps that must be dealt with to increase our scientific knowledge and in turn transfer this knowledge to forest practitioners in order to achieve sustainable management aimed at mitigating climate change. Research highlights: It is important to underline the importance of forests in the carbon cycle as this role can be enhanced by forest managers through sustainable forest management. The effects of different management options or disturbances can be critical as regards mitigating climate change. Understanding the effects of forest management is even more important in the Mediterranean area, given that the current high climatic variability together with historical human exploitation and disturbance events make this area more vulnerable to the effects of climate chang...|$|R
40|$|Pinus patula is {{the most}} intensively planted conifer in the tropics and subtropics. The {{increased}} proportion of corewood that results when rotation ages of pine plantations are shortened has become a wood quality factor of growing concern worldwide. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop empirically based models for predicting the flexural properties of the wood produced from relatively young P. patula trees. Models were based on the properties of standing trees, and their effectiveness was evaluated at board, tree, and compartment levels. Sample material was obtained from 170 P. patula trees, 16 – 20 years old, established in 17 compartments on the Mpumalanga escarpment of South Africa. Multiple regression models were developed, which managed to explain 68, 60, and 95 % of the variation in the dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) on individual boards, trees, and compartments levels, respectively. At compartment level, 80 % of the variation in the 5 th percentile MOR value could be explained by the model. Sensitivity analyses showed that site index at base age of 10 years, acoustic time of flight, wood density, and ring width were influential variables in the MOE models. The models indicated that tree slenderness during early growth seems to play a major role in determining the dynamic MOE and MOR of lumber. This is in agreement with Euler’s buckling theory and the bending stress theory. The results from this study indicated that the MOEdyn and MOR of lumber can be accurately predicted on especially a compartment level. The predictive models developed can be used as management tools to improve operational decisions around tree breeding, <b>silvicultural</b> practices, and <b>rotation</b> ages.

40|$|Approval of the Clean Development Mechanism, {{provided}} {{for in the}} Kyoto Protocol, enables countries with afforested land to trade in carbon emissions reduction certificates related to carbon dioxide equivalent quantities (CO 2 -e) stored within a certain forest area. Potential CO 2 -e above base line sequestration was determined for two forest sites on commercial eucalyptus plantations in northern Brazil (Bahia). Compensation values for <b>silvicultural</b> regimes involving <b>rotation</b> lengths greater than economically optimal were computed using the Faustmann formula. Mean values obtained were US$ 8. 16 (MgCO 2 -e) -Â  1 and US$ 7. 19 (MgCO 2 -e) -Â  1 for average and high site indexes, respectively. Results show that carbon supply is more cost-efficient in highly productive sites. Annuities of US$ 18. 8 Â Mg C-Â  1 and US$ 35. 1 Â Mg C-Â  1 and yearly payments of US$ 4. 4 Â m-Â  3 and US$ 8. 2 Â m-Â  3 due for each marginal cubic meter produced were computed for high and average sites, respectively. The estimated value of the tonne of carbon defines minimum values {{to be paid to}} forest owners, in order to induce a change in silvicultural management regimes. A reduction of carbon supply could be expected {{as a result of an}} increase in wood prices, although it would not respond in a regular manner. For both sites, price elasticity of supply was found to be inelastic and increased as rotation length moved further away from economically optimal: 0. 24 and 0. 27 for age 11 Â years in average- and high-productivity sites, respectively. This would be due to biomass production potential as a limiting factor; beyond a certain threshold value, an increase in price does not sustain a proportional change in carbon storage supply. The environmental service valuation model proposed might be adequate for assessing potential supply in plantation forestry, from a private landowner perspective, with an economic opportunity cost. The model is not applicable to low commercial value forest plantations. Eucalyptus Cost LEV Carbon Supply...|$|R
