500|$|According to Dannemann, by 3 p.m. {{they had}} left the {{apartment}} to use a bank. They continued on to Kensington Market, where Hendrix signed an autograph for a young boy, purchased a leather jacket, and ordered some shoes. He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had [...] "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car {{so that he could}} get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted. Prior to their arrival at Harvey's, they briefly stopped by the Cumberland.|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Veronique Mucret.

2500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Frames were either written or co-written by DeWyze. He wrote around twenty songs and then {{selected}} thirteen to include on the album. Drew Pearson co-wrote [...] "Silver Lining", [...] "Fight" [...] and [...] "Like I Do" [...] with DeWyze. [...] "Like I Do" [...] {{was inspired by a}} friend of DeWyze's, who went through a similar situation. [...] "Who Would've Known" [...] was written for DeWyze's wife, Jonna Walsh, whom he married in July 2012. The song was played as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle at their wedding, and DeWyze also performed it himself during the reception. Walsh served as the inspiration for the song [...] "Breathing In" [...] as well, which DeWyze said is about how she is the anchor in his life and is able to bring him back to earth. Describing [...] "Don't Be Afraid" [...] as an [...] "internal monologue", DeWyze has called {{it one of the most}} personal songs that he has ever written. Although he generally does not like to release songs about himself and originally did not plan on having this one on the album, he was swayed by his manager, who overheard him working on it in the studio. Acoustic versions of all thirteen songs were recorded and included on the deluxe edition of the album.|$|E

50|$|As it {{was shot}} in Shanghai, there were various usage of Chinese culture.

50|$|Parodies of {{the film}} abound. The 1937 Laurel and Hardy comedy Way Out West parodied the famous hitchhiking scene, with Stan Laurel {{managing}} to stop a stage coach using the same technique.
