5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for <b>sleeping</b> tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a <b>sleeping</b> tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him <b>sleeping</b> normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E
5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African <b>sleeping</b> sickness, smallpox, swine influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that half-a-million Congolese had died from <b>sleeping</b> sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{singled out}} the Broadway Limited for special {{treatment}} and in 1972 completely refurbished its equipment, {{most of which}} was ex-Penn Central, although former Union Pacific Railroad <b>sleeping</b> cars were also used. Amtrak also added a Slumbercoach to the consist. In 1974 Amtrak tried out rebuilt 6-bedroom, 8-roomette ex-Rock Island <b>sleeping</b> cars, but their limited capacity reduced revenue. The Broadway Limited began receiving rebuilt Heritage Fleet cars in 1980, and Amfleet coaches thereafter. 68 cars were rebuilt at a total cost of $9.8 million.|$|E
5|$|At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare <b>sleeping</b> in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, {{dragging}} her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' <b>sleeping</b> in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the prime}} universe, Peter and Fauxlivia are in bed {{together}} when Peter receives {{a call from the}} cleaning lady, who relays the message: that Olivia is trapped in the parallel universe. Peter realizes that he has been <b>sleeping</b> with Olivia's doppelgänger.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, Kulikovsky {{had shrunk}} more than 4inches (10cm) from his peak height of 6ft 2inches (188cm). He distrusted {{conventional}} medicine and tried homeopathy instead. By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty <b>sleeping.</b> At {{the end of}} his life he was <b>sleeping</b> on the sofa in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either <b>sleeping</b> on the couch or taking long walks.|$|E
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still <b>sleeping,</b> or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on <b>sleeping</b> soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|Day-to-day {{life at the}} Glidden House {{was mostly}} {{carried out in the}} home's {{basement}} which contained a full kitchen, dining room, and living room. The upper floors were used for guests and for <b>sleeping</b> quarters. In 1877 Glidden's daughter, Elva, married William H. Bush in the homestead.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a <b>sleeping</b> army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the <b>sleeping</b> knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5|$|Further {{marketing}} of <b>Sleeping</b> Dogs was via cross-promotion on different platforms; players {{who bought the}} game through Steam received an eight item pack for Team Fortress 2, which was later made available for separate purchase, and a Hong Kong-themed Team Fortress 2 level, Kong King. Owners of Just Cause 2 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or PC received automatic access to a <b>Sleeping</b> Dogs character outfit {{in the style of}} Just Cause 2 protagonist Rico Rodriguez. The outfit increases the player's action hijack statistics and increases the range from which the player can perform stunt takeovers of enemy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using <b>sleeping</b> pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses <b>sleeping</b> pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Amtrak {{announced}} {{several possible}} {{changes to the}} Mountaineer, including a later schedule through West Virginia and combined operation west of Cincinnati with both the Riley and an unnamed (and never implemented) WashingtonDenver train. Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its <b>sleeping</b> car. The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a harsh winter damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, minus the <b>sleeping</b> car.|$|E
5|$|In his 1941 novel Mr Lucton's Freedom Halesowen-born novelist Francis Brett Young {{describes}} <b>sleeping</b> {{out on the}} Malvern Hills {{and seeing}} the sunrise over the town.|$|E

5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things <b>sleeping</b> wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her {{underwear}} or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a <b>sleeping</b> garment on or before March 11.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 1987, Ernest's {{body was}} {{discovered}} underneath a <b>sleeping</b> bag dumped {{on the east side}} of Interstate 15, about a mile north of the rest area where he had been killed. He had been stabbed nine times, including in the heart and throat.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Bauer used Ellqvist {{as a model}} less frequently. With {{the birth}} of their son, Bauer started to paint {{pictures}} with children as part of the composition.

5|$|Preliminary {{reports from}} the Pakistan Army told of about 40 {{soldiers}} being present at the two check posts, {{most of whom were}} <b>sleeping</b> or resting when the raid took place.|$|E
5|$|Privacy--providing {{separate}} <b>sleeping</b> {{quarters for}} parents and children, and among children led to larger apartments over time. Similarly, most buildings had {{a limited number of}} apartments adjoining each staircase.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional <b>sleeping</b> environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are <b>sleeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly, some {{amino acids}} {{derivatives}} {{are used in}} pharmaceutical industry. They include 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression, L-DOPA (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for Parkinson's treatment, and eflornithine drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used {{in the treatment of}} <b>sleeping</b> sickness.|$|E
5|$|Sleep hygiene {{strategies}} include {{advice about}} timing {{of sleep and}} food intake in relationship to exercise and <b>sleeping</b> environment. Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation; counselling {{is presented as a}} form of patient education.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sleeping</b> Dogs {{difficult}} and prolonged development began in 2008. The game {{was announced in}} 2009 {{as part of the}} True Crime series but was canceled by Activision Blizzard in 2011, {{as a result of the}} project's delays and budget issues. Six months later, Square Enix bought the publishing rights and renamed the game <b>Sleeping</b> Dogs, without the True Crime license, but considered a spiritual successor. During development, United Front staff visited Hong Kong to conduct field research for the visual environments and sound.|$|E
5|$|Specific sleep hygiene {{recommendations}} {{have changed}} over time. For example, advice to simply avoid <b>sleeping</b> pills was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced, recommendations concerning their use have become more complex.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 film <b>Sleeping</b> {{with the}} Enemy sees the main {{character}} escape from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Cedar Falls, Iowa, on a Greyhound bus.|$|E
