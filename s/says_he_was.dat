He eventually suspended Pusztai, used misconduct procedures to seize his data, banned him from speaking publicly and did not renew his annual contract.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he had not}} {{sought the}} office and was not old enough to serve, Breckinridge was elected to {{represent}} Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780. Legend <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> twice refused his seat because of his age, but his constituents reelected him each time, and he was seated the third time, but official records do not support this. His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{earned his}} Ph.D. in {{government}} affairs from Harvard University in 1979, having written a dissertation on Alexander Hamilton and constitutional theory, under Harvey C. Mansfield. Due to student deferments {{and a high}} draft number, Keyes was not drafted {{to serve in the}} Vietnam War. Keyes and his family were staunch supporters of the war, in which his father served two tours of duty. Keyes was criticized by opponents of the war in Vietnam, but he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> supporting his father and his brothers, who were also fighting in the war.|$|E

Murray <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{too young to understand}} what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car.

5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a shot to the chest.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not mean}} that all mad {{delusions}} are as concrete as this, though some are more concrete. Believing your own body is glass is a more daring denial of reality than believing a tree is a glass lamp {{at the top of}} a pole. But all true delusions have in them this unalterable assertion--that what is not is. The difference between us and the maniac is not about how things look or how things ought to look, but about what they self-evidently are. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> ought to <b>be</b> King; Perkin Warbeck might <b>say</b> that. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> King. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> as wise as Shakespeare; Bernard Shaw might say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Shakespeare. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> divine in the same sense as Christ; Mr. R.J. Campbell would say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Christ. In all cases the difference is a difference about what is there; not a difference touching what should be done about it.|$|R
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E
