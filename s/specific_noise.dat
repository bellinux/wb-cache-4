50|$|Notch filters - Notch filters or band-rejection {{filters are}} {{essential}} when eliminating a <b>specific</b> <b>noise</b> frequency. For example, {{in most cases}} the power lines within a building run at 60 Hz. Sometimes a sensitive circuit will pick up this 60 Hz noise through some unwanted antenna (could be as simple as a wire in the circuit). Running the output through a notch filter at 60 Hz will amplify the desired signal without amplifying the 60 Hz noise. So in a sense the noise will be lost at the output of the filter.|$|E

Turbo codes are used in 3G/4G mobile communications (e.g., in UMTS and LTE) and in (deep space) satellite communications {{as well as other}} applications where designers seek to achieve reliable information transfer over bandwidth- or latency-constrained communication links in the presence of data-corrupting noise. Turbo codes are nowadays competing with LDPC codes, which provide similar performance.|$|E

5000|$|... {{there are}} three levels of {{regulation}} for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad subjective immission control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an objective immission control that uses specific levels of sound {{considered to be a}} noise disturbance. Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation. The concept that a potential violator should have fair warning that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address <b>specific</b> <b>noise</b> problems.

50|$|STFTs {{as well as}} {{standard}} Fourier transforms and other tools are frequently used to analyze music. The spectrogram can, for example, show frequency on the horizontal axis, with the lowest frequencies at left, and the highest at the right. The height of each bar (augmented by color) represents the amplitude of the frequencies within that band. The depth dimension represents time, where each new bar was a separate distinct transform. Audio engineers use this kind of visual to gain information about an audio sample, for example, to locate the frequencies of <b>specific</b> <b>noises</b> (especially when used with greater frequency resolution) or to find frequencies which may {{be more or less}} resonant in the space where the signal was recorded. This information can be used for equalization or tuning other audio effects.|$|R

30|$|A total {{laryngectomy}} is a surgical procedure which consists {{in a complete}} removal of the larynx {{for the treatment of}} a cancer for example. Thus, the patient loses his/her vocal cords that allowed him/her a laryngeal voice. After surgery, some patients may waive any oral communication attempt because of the physical and mental bouleversement caused by the surgical act. Indeed, the anatomical changes deprive temporarily the patient of his/her voice. Only the whispered voice allows communication in a postoperative life. An alternative speaking rehabilitation method allows him/her to get a new voice called esophageal speech (ES) generated without vocal folds. The air from the lungs, original source of all human speech, no longer passes through the cavities of the phonatory apparatus. It is released directly from the stomach through the esophagus. The features of esophageal speech such as the envelope of the waveform and the spectral components differ from the features extracted from natural speech. Furthermore, the esophageal speech is characterized by <b>specific</b> <b>noises</b> and low intelligibility; the fundamental frequency of this voice is less stable than that of laryngeal voice. All these aspects cause a production of a hoarse, creaky and unnatural voice, difficult to understand.|$|R
