25|$|Bayes {{methods are}} more cost {{effective}} than the traditional frequentist take on marketing research and subsequent decision making. The probability can be assessed from a degree of belief before and after accounting for evidence, instead of calculating the probabilities of a certain decision by carrying out {{a large number of}} trials with each one producing an outcome from a set of possible outcomes. The planning and implementation of trials to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> decision impacts in the ‘field’ e.g. observing consumers reaction to a relabeling of a product, is time consuming and costly, a method many firms cannot afford. In place of taking the frequentist route in aiming for a universally acceptable conclusion through iteration, it is sometimes more effective to take advantage of all the information available to the firm to work out the ‘best’ decision at the time, and then subsequently when new knowledge is obtained, revise the posterior distribution to be then used as the prior, thus the inferences continue to logically contribute to one another based on Bayes theorem.|$|E

And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on-the-nose song choices, [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] was just a perfect choice and performance—not just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Chávez's endorsement, Chomsky told The New York Times {{that he would}} be [...] "happy to meet" [...] the Venezuelan President, asserting that he was [...] "quite interested" [...] in what his administration had achieved and thought many of Chávez's views to be [...] "quite constructive". This meeting came about in August 2009, when Chomsky visited the Latin American country. In a press conference to commence the meeting, Chávez made reference to the intellectual's work, remarking [...] "Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival", before comparing Chomsky's thesis with the concept of [...] "Socialism or Barbarism" [...] advocated by German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 20th century. Speaking through an interpreter, Chomsky replied that [...] "I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that's easy. What's harder is to create a better world... and what's so exciting about at last visiting Venezuela is that I can <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> better world is being created." [...] He went on to Venezolana de Televisión, where he commented on the U.S. government's role in orchestrating the 2009 Honduran coup d'état to overthrow leftist President Manuel Zelaya. He also expressed cautious support for the leftist reforms being implemented by Chávez's administration, remarking his opinion that their moves [...] "toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out".|$|E
500|$|Rockstar found a {{match in}} the Red Dead Redemption {{universe}} for their long-standing aim {{to create a}} zombie game. In lieu of making a new intellectual property for such a game, Rockstar instead wanted players to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> zombie outbreak affected a world already familiar to them. The company thought that this would make the zombie trope more interesting. Rockstar also saw similar [...] "cinematic heritage" [...] between the Western and zombie horror genres. The team used the analogy of a 1970s film set to explain their ambitions—that Undead Nightmare in the Red Dead Redemption universe would feel like its characters filming a [...] "serious, revisionist Western" [...] by day and a [...] "somewhat insane horror movie" [...] with the same cast and set by night. Following its experience with Grand Theft Auto IV downloadable content packs, Rockstar wanted its add-on packs to be a separate story with possible overlaps rather than {{a continuation of the}} main story. Rockstar vice president of creative Dan Houser described several reasons for not using the Grand Theft Auto universe for the zombie release: (1) that Red Dead shooting mechanics, including its slow-motion Dead Eye feature, were a better fit for zombie headshots, (2) that zombies were a better fit for the Great Plains landscape, more reminiscent of a 1970s horror film, and (3) that John Marston was a better fit for hunting zombies than the protagonists of Grand Theft Auto games.|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the game}} begun {{after the release of}} Nights into Dreams... in July 1996, after Sonic Team {{received}} a lot of letters from fans asking [...] "who Sonic was". Naka and Naoto Ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to the Sonic character, which was the basis for introducing [...] "Project Sonic" [...] to the public. Until the release of Sonic Jam, the studio themselves had not worked on a Sonic title since Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, in which Naka thought that Sonic Team had a good rest period to [...] "recharge our batteries" [...] and had new ideas regarding a new game. [...] "Sonic World"—Sonic Jams 3D hub world—served as a prototype for the first fully 3D Sonic game—Sonic Adventure—which began development for the Saturn but was moved to its successor, the Dreamcast. In a retrospective interview, Naka stated that the 3D section of Sonic Jam was part of an experiment to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> Sonic the Hedgehog game would work in full 3D. [...] "Sonic World" [...] uses the same engine as Nights; there is speculation that Naka's refusal to share the Nights engine with the Sega Technical Institute (STI) team developing Sonic X-treme—a factor in the latter's cancellation—was motivated by his preference for Sonic Team's own efforts to create an original 3D Sonic title. Naka later expressed [...] "relief" [...] that X-treme was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima reflected that the most difficult part during the development process was gathering game-specific information in [...] "Sonic World", as [...] "there are so many games we have never even heard of... Sega's a big company and before we knew it lots of different game systems had sprung up (including Game Gear, Master System and Pico)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{also claims}} that an {{external}} environment {{is necessary for}} the establishment of the self. Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting all of these general representations into one global representation, we can <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> transcendental self emerges.

[...] In the context of the larger story, it is difficult to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> local river flood could accomplish these purposes.

[...] I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom." [...] Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers.

Hours after President Maduro called on the UBCH (Bolivar and Chavez Battle Units), the communal councils, communes, and colectivos during his speech; attacks on an apartment building by some groups who shot at residents and the National Guard who fired tear gas at the building resulted in two deaths in Los Ruices, including a National Guardsman.

We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour.
