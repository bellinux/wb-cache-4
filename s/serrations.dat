5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no <b>serrations</b> since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started {{developing}} <b>serrations</b> and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel <b>serrations</b> that help it cut through flesh, and the same <b>serrations</b> {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle <b>serrations</b> similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The <b>serrations</b> of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like <b>serrations,</b> but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their <b>serrations.</b> The teeth of D.teutonis lack <b>serrations,</b> but still have sharp edges.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} had {{infectious}} saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the <b>serrations</b> may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth <b>serrations</b> as more like cubes in shape than the <b>serrations</b> on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded. All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it {{being used as a}} method of predation is disputable.|$|E
40|$|Far-field {{noise and}} flow field over a novel curved trailing-edge <b>serration</b> (named as iron-shaped <b>serration)</b> are investigated. Spectra of the {{far-field}} broadband noise, directivity plots and the flow-field over the iron-shaped <b>serration</b> are obtained from numerical computations performed using a compressible Lattice-Boltzmann solver. The new design {{is compared to}} a conventional trailing-edge <b>serration</b> with a triangular geometry. Both <b>serration</b> geometries were retrofitted to a NACA 0018 airfoil at zero degree angle of attack. The iron-shaped geometry is found to reduce far-field broadband noise of approximately 2  dB more than the conventional sawtooth <b>serration</b> for chord-based Strouhal numbers St c < 15. At higher frequencies, the far-field broadband noise for the two <b>serration</b> geometries has comparable intensity. Near-wall velocity distribution and surface pressure fluctuations show that their intensity and spectra are independent on the <b>serration</b> geometry, but {{a function of the}} streamwise location. It is found that the larger noise reduction achieved by the iron-shaped trailing-edge <b>serration</b> is due to the mitigation of the scattered noise at the root. This effect is obtained by mitigating the interaction between {{the two sides of the}} <b>serration,</b> by delaying toward the tip both the outward (i. e., the tendency of the flow to deviate from the centerline to the edge of the <b>serration)</b> and the downward (i. e., the tendency of the flow to merge between the upper and bottom side of the <b>serration)</b> flow motions present at the root of the sawtooth. </p...|$|R

5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin.

However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Direct {{immunofluorescence}} microscopy (DIF) of a skin biopsy specimen is {{the reference}} {{standard for the}} diagnosis of pemphigoid diseases (PD). <b>Serration</b> pattern analysis enables differentiation of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) from other PD using DIF microscopy alone. However, practice gaps {{need to be addressed}} for implication of this technique in daily routine diagnostics. OBJECTIVE: to determine and optimize the technical requirements for <b>serration</b> pattern analysis of DIF microscopy and determine inter-rater conformity of <b>serration</b> pattern analysis. METHODS: we compared <b>serration</b> pattern analysis of routine DIF from Groningen and Lübeck laboratories with four blinded observers. Skin biopsies from 20 patients with EBA and other PD were exchanged and analysed. Various factors of section thickness, transport medium and biopsy processing were evaluated. RESULTS: inter-rater conformity of four observers was 95. 7 %. Recognition of <b>serration</b> patterns was comparable in samples transported in saline and in Michel's medium and with section thicknesses of 4, 6 and 8 μm. LIMITATIONS: sample size and availability of 20 samples retrospectively compared. CONCLUSION: DIF <b>serration</b> pattern analysis is not restricted by variation in laboratory procedures, transport medium, or experience of observers.

5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} <b>serrations</b> and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip.

50|$|Human uses of <b>serration</b> have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other {{serrated}} blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the <b>serration</b> of an animal tooth.

A type of <b>serration</b> is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show <b>serration</b> in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink.

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, H J Sawin proposed that the aetosaur Longosuchus was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to {{a large number of}} skeletons that were likely carcasses. A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks <b>serrations</b> or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and were likely better suited to eating plant material.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack <b>serrations,</b> unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of <b>serrations,</b> the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E

40|$|TOOTH/MIR 160 A regulates {{leaf margin}} {{outgrowth}} in Arabidopsis thaliana Unlike animals, a striking {{aspect of the}} plant development {{is that they have}} evolved a flexible pattern of post embryonic development. This exposes them to the challenges of many biotic and abiotic signals throughout their life. So, plants have to evolve/regulate various mechanisms to modulate their growth and development for accomplishing a successful life cycle in the prevailing environmental conditions. Auxin is involved in the initiation of lateral organs at the meristem and <b>serration</b> development along the leaf margin (Bilsborough et al., 2011, Hay et al., 2006). These two developmental mechanisms share common molecular players. For example, CUC 2 is required for the boundary formation at the SAM and also is shown to be essential for <b>serration</b> formation at the leaf margin. Similarly, tth shows increased leaf <b>serration</b> phenotype as well as defects in the positioning of flowers at the meristem. This demonstrates the functional significance of TTH-regulated ARFs in controlling auxin mediated developmental pathways. Leaves originate as small lumps of undifferentiated cells at the flanks of the shoot apical meristem which undergo several rounds division and expansion to generate the mature leaf with characteristic size, shape and leaf margin. Both, endogenous as well as environmental factors modulate the growth and development of a leaf. This is evident from the plasticity in leaf form, observed during the life time of a single plant, {{as well as from the}} diversity among closely related species living in different habitats. It is well known that pathways controlling leaf form are subjected to the effects of selection and adaptation. Leaf margin is a key feature of the final leaf shape and it contributes to the abundant diversity in leaf form. Leaf margin architecture varies quite significantly from smooth or entire margin to margins with large outgrowths (lobed margins). The evolution and ecological advantages of this diversity is a subject of intense investigation. It also provides a wonderful system to study the mechanistic details of iterative generation of repeated units, which is a common feature in producing many biological shapes. Recent advances in molecular technologies and the availability of genomic resources ushered the identification of new factors involved in leaf margin development. Our current knowledge of this developmental programme is that CUC 2 establishes auxin maxima at the leaf margin by reorienting an auxin efflux carrier PIN 1 which ultimately results in <b>serration</b> outgrowth (Bilsborough et al., 2011, Hay et al., 2006). A few missing links in this pathway are the mechanistic details of CUC 2 function in reorienting PIN 1 and the molecular details of auxin mediated <b>serration</b> outgrowth. Forward genetic screens have been valuable in characterizing a genetic pathway even in the post genomic era. An EMS mutagenesis screen was performed in this context to identify novel factors that can improve our understanding of this intricate mechanism. tooth was identified in the M 2 population based on its increased leaf <b>serration</b> phenotype. Genetic analysis showed that tth phenotype is due to a monogenic recessive mutation. Along with increased leaf <b>serration,</b> tth also shows various developmental defects such as aberrant phyllotaxy, narrower cotyledons and narrower leaves. Positional cloning and sequencing analysis showed a G to A transition at the AT 2 G 39175 locus which codes for MIR 160 A. The mutation is at the 7 th base position of the mature miRNA sequence. Functional characterization of miRNAs by isolating mutations is hampered by their small genomic sizes. Till now, only a few miRNAs have been characterized by mutational analysis in plants (Allen et al., 2007, Baker et al., 2005, Cartolano et al., 2007, Chuck et al., 2007, Knauer et al., 2013, Nag et al., 2009, Nikovics et al., 2006). miR 160 -ARF 10 regulatory module is shown to be required for leaf blade out growth and <b>serration,</b> but not leaf complexity in tomato (Hendelman et al., 2012). miR 160 is coded by 3 loci in Arabidopsis, MIR 160 A, B and C. All three loci encode identical mature miRNA that targets 3 Auxin response factors, ARF 10, 16 and 17. ARFs are the effector molecules of auxin mediated developmental programmes. Genetic analysis showed that enhanced <b>serration</b> outgrowth in tth is due to the up-regulation of its target genes. Here, we have identified a miRNA that negatively regulates <b>serration</b> outgrowth by repressing ARF 10, 16 and 17 whose functional significance in regulating leaf margin development was not known previously. Extensive genetic interaction studies have shown that TTH acts in parallel to SAW-BP and MIR 164 -CUC pathways in regulating leaf margin development. We have also shown that CUC 2 and PIN 1 are absolutely essential for <b>serration</b> development in tth. CUC 2 establishes a pattern required for the expression of ARF 10 at the leaf margin. In the absence of CUC 2, downstream effector molecules such as ARFs can not perform their function. arf 10 - 2 arf 16 - 2 could reduce, but not suppress <b>serration</b> outgrowth in various mutants suggesting their functional redundancy with other ARF family members. CUC 2 establishes auxin maxima at the leaf margin that triggers the degradation of AUX/IAA repressors thereby relieving ARF proteins which mediate <b>serration</b> outgrowth. Whereas, TTH acts at the post transcriptional level for maintaining normal ARF transcript levels Role of SPYINDLY in Arabidopsis leaf margin development SPYNDLY encodes an O-linked N-acetyl glucosamine transferase that acts as a negative regulator of GA response. Consistent with its role in GA response, spy mutants show several GA dependent phenotypes such as early flowering and hyper branched trichomes. spy mutants also show several GA independent phenotypes such as aberrant phyllotaxy and smooth leaf margin. We have studied its role in regulating Arabidopsis leaf <b>serration</b> development. Reporter analysis of ARF 10 ::GUS and CUC 2 ::GUS in spy- 3 revealed that SPY is not involved in establishing <b>serration</b> pattern. The spy- 3 leaves did not show any defects during the early stages of <b>serration</b> development, but the mature leaves display smooth leaf margin indicating that SPY function is required for <b>serration</b> outgrowth. As shown in the present study, TTH regulated ARFs are also involved in <b>serration</b> outgrowth. Analysis of leaf margin phenotype in tth spy- 3 showed that SPY activity is not required for ARF mediated <b>serration</b> outgrowth. Similar genetic interaction studies with SAW-BP pathway mutants showed that leaf margin out growth mediated by meristematic genes is not dependent on SPY function. Genetic interaction studies with MIR 164 -CUC pathway genes showed that SPY is required for <b>serration</b> outgrowth in these mutants. Interestingly, the cuc 2 - 3 mutant is defective at both patterning and outgrowth of <b>serration.</b> The spy- 3 could suppress <b>serration</b> out growth in cuc 2 -D suggesting that CUC 2 mediated <b>serration</b> out growth is dependent on SPY activity. Protein-protein interaction studies between SPY and CUC 2 are in progress to demonstrate whether SPY directly interacts with CUC 2 or CUC 2 derived signal to regulate <b>serration</b> out outgrowth. It is interesting to examine how mutations at SPY locus can abolish <b>serration</b> out growth mediated by CUC 2, but does not affect the <b>serration</b> pattern, even though CUC 2 is reported to be essential for both the patterning and outgrowth of <b>serration...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cascade {{tests of}} {{two-dimensional}} {{fan rotor blade}} rows were performed to investigate the effects of leading edge <b>serration</b> on acoustic and aerodynamic performance. The test configurations covered a range of <b>serration</b> tooth geometries. Tests were performed to investigate effects of inlet air angle and velocity on performance. Aerodynamic performance was determined by flow surveys at the mid-span of the blade exit. Acoustic performance was determined by wake turbulence surveys and sound measurements in the semireverberent exhaust chamber. Measured acoustic and aerodynamic performance was comparable and indicated that a <b>serration</b> length of about six percent blade chord yields minimum noise generation and minimum total pressure losses...|$|R
