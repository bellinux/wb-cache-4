Users of the dataset are free to share, create and adapt under the conditions of attribution and share-alike. The Global SPEI database, SPEIbase, offers long-time, robust information on the drought conditions at the global scale, with a 0. 5 degrees spatial resolution and a monthly time resolution. It has a multi-scale character, providing SPEI time-scales between 1 and 48 months. The Standardized Precipitatin-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) expresses, as a <b>standardized</b> <b>variate</b> (mean zero and unit variance), the deviations of the current climatic balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration potential) {{with respect to the}} long-term balance. The reference period for the calculation, in the SPEIbase, corresponds to the whole study period. Being a <b>standardized</b> <b>variate</b> means that the SPEI condition can be compared across space and time. Calculation of the evapotranspiration potential in SPEIbase is based on the FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith method. Data type: float; units: z-values (standard deviations). No land pixels are assigned a value of 1. 0 x 10 ^ 30. In some rare cases {{it was not possible to}} achieve a good fit to the log-logistic distribution, resulting in a NAN (not a number) value in the database. Dimensions of the dataset: lon = 720; lat = 360; time = 1356. Resolution of the dataset: lon = 0. 5 º; lat = 0. 5 º; time = 1 month.

40|$|Bivariate {{extreme value}} {{distributions}} contain parameters of two types; those {{that define the}} marginal distributions, and parameters defining the dependence between suitably <b>standardized</b> <b>variates.</b> As an alternative to full maximum likelihood based on the joint distribution, we consider a "marginal estimation " method in which the margin and dependence parameters are estimated separately. This method is simpler to implement computationally, but may be inefficient. Asymptotic results allow the inefficiency to be quantified. The concepts are relevant to a large class of families of multivariate distributions, but the detailed analysis is restricted to Gumbel's logistic model with Gumbel or Generalized Extreme Value margins...|$|R

In this paper, in addition to the expression for the power of control chart for ZTBD based on <b>standardized</b> normal <b>variate</b> is obtained, numerical calculations are presented to see the effect of errors on the power curve.

40|$|Measurement {{error is}} the {{difference}} between the true value and the measured value of a quantity that exists in practice and may considerably affect the performance of control charts in some cases. Measurement error variability has uncertainty which can be from several sources. In this paper, we have studied the effect of these sources of variability on the power characteristics of control chart and obtained the values of average run length (ARL) for zero-truncated Poisson distribution (ZTPD). Expression of the power of control chart for variable sample size under <b>standardized</b> normal <b>variate</b> for ZTPD is also derived...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{has been}} pivotal in the {{establishment}} and sustainability of human civilization throughout history. Public road safety and the longevity of water management structures are affected by displaced sands. Public health and water quality are limited by turbidity and contamination from displaced silts and clays. ^ Particle-size distributions of soils are critical determinants of the potential impact and management of sediment. Water-stable aggregates are similar in size to primary particles but differ from them in density, specific surface area, porosity, the presence of encapsulated nutrients or contaminants, and binding agents that may return to reactivity upon elutriation. ^ The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the relative contributions of primary particle-size distribution, organic binding agents, inorganic binding agents, and water-stable aggregates to the aggregate-size distribution of sediment. A mathematical model of aggregation in sediment was developed using empirical data from 36 cropland soils representative of the USA which were treated with a rainfall simulator for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) in 1987 and 1988. Particle-size distribution in situ was compared to eroded aggregate size distribution. Eroded aggregates in this study were compared to chemical binding factors (organic carbon, iron oxides, and clay extensibility) and management properties (relative saturation, bulk density, and gravimetric water content). ^ Four <b>standardized</b> canonical <b>variates</b> provide significant estimates of potential aggregation (PA) based on eroded aggregate size fractions: two for particle-size distribution (PAp), one for chemical binding (PAc), and one for indirect management indices (PAm). Potential aggregation is the sum of particle size, chemical binding, and management contributions of soil properties in situ and was derived using eroded aggregate sizes. The equation to calculate scores for potential aggregation is: PA = (PAp + PAc + PAm). ^ The model provides quantitative estimates of potential aggregation that may affect soil erosion, sediment size and amount, and transport distances. Potential aggregation also provides some information on differences among soils in soil pore space, active surface area, water-stability, and related soil structural stability. Future applications are expected to aid in the design of management systems to maximize content of water-stable aggregates of non-erodible sizes for sustainable land use. ...|$|R
