5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the provincial highway network.|$|E
5|$|The prospectors {{came from}} many nations, {{although}} an estimated majority of 60 to 80 percent were Americans or recent immigrants to America. Most {{had no experience}} in the mining industry, being clerks or salesmen. Mass resignations of staff to join the gold rush became notorious. In Seattle, this included the mayor, twelve policemen, and a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the city's streetcar drivers.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s large-scale, {{centrally}} controlled plants dominated manufacturing. These large {{plants were}} supplemented with many small-scale town and township enterprises, {{which accounted for}} <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> national output of coal, construction materials, and leather products.|$|R
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A small but <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The diagnosis {{is made from}} the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E
5|$|The school enrols an {{estimated}} 4,000 students, {{spread across the}} six levels, with a student-teacher ratio of 13:1. Hwa Chong Institution has produced 54 President's Scholars.

5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} eighteenth century records tell <b>of</b> <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> blacks and mulattoes in Tegucigalpa. But {{at the end of the}} colonial period, slaves were already mainly mulattoes. Between {{the late eighteenth}} and mid-nineteenth century, the British {{introduced}} black slaves from Jamaica, Cayman Island and Belize in Honduras.|$|R
5000|$|Mottramite is {{a member}} of the adelite-descloizite group. [...] Mottramite, which is a copper rich member, forms a series with descloizite, which is a zinc rich member. [...] These two {{minerals}} usually contain <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> both copper and zinc and are seldom pure. Mottramite also forms a series with duftite.|$|R
50|$|Northrup {{was a good}} outfielder {{who played}} <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> his time in all three outfield positions. Northrup's {{versatility}} allowed then-manager Mayo Smith to make him the Tigers' center fielder in the 1968 World Series, as Smith famously moved regular center fielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop to replace the weak-hitting Ray Oyler.|$|R
5|$|Like many Moroccan cities, Marrakesh {{comprises}} an old fortified city {{packed with}} vendors and their stalls (the medina), bordered by modern neighbourhoods, {{the most prominent}} of which is Gueliz. Today {{it is one of the}} busiest cities in Africa and serves as a major economic centre and tourist destination. Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, Mohammed VI, with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. Despite the economic recession, real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh has grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has the largest traditional market (souk) in Morocco, with some 18 souks selling wares ranging from traditional Berber carpets to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population, who primarily sell their products to tourists. Marrakesh is one of North Africa’s largest centres of wildlife trade, despite the illegality of much of this trade. Much of this trade can be found in the medina and adjacent squares. Tortoises are particularly popular for sale as pets but Barbary macaques and snakes can also be seen.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on {{the establishment of the}} governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} sample, Morocco and Ghana had <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> very low eighth-grade {{performing}} students (<b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> students with achievement levels {{too low for}} estimation exceeded 25  %) with South Africa and Botswana having significantly low performing ninth-grade students (<b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> students with achievement levels too low for estimation exceeded 15  % but did not exceed 25  %) (Mullis et al. 2012). Therefore, any differences in achievement when comparing these countries must be interpreted with caution.|$|R
50|$|The {{county has}} a high Italian population, with <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> {{residents}} (over 25%) in several communities, of the West Essex area and northeastern district, mostly in the northern half of the county, being of Italian descent. This includes the communities of Belleville (30.9%), Bloomfield (26.4%), Caldwell (26.3%), Cedar Grove (34.8%), Fairfield (45.8%), Nutley (44.5%), Roseland (38.7%), Verona (34.3%) and West Caldwell (35.2%).|$|R

In an attack on what he terms [...] "leftist unreason," [...] Harris criticises Noam Chomsky among others for, in his view, displaying an illogical willingness to lay the entire blame for such attitudes upon U.S. foreign policy.|$|R
5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of a <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E

The communities of Glendora, La Verne, Claremont, Monrovia, San Marino, Sierra Madre, Pasadena, South Pasadena, and San Dimas have a significant Caucasian population.|$|R
50|$|Corn rootworm larvae {{can destroy}} <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> corn if left untreated. In the United States, current {{estimates}} show that 30000000 acres of corn (out of 80 million grown) are infested with corn rootworm. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that corn rootworms cause $1 billion in lost revenue each year, including $800 million in yield loss and $200 million in cost {{of treatment for}} corn growers.|$|R

A recent survey of caregivers of children, adults and the disabled conducted by the National Family Caregivers Association, found that while 70% {{of the respondents reported}} finding an inner strength they didn’t know they had, 27% reported having more headaches, 24% reported stomach disorders, 41% more back pain, 51% more sleeplessness and 61% reported more depression.|$|R
30|$|As an {{alternative}} pretreatment method, the EA was also tested on NW. The EA pretreatment converts native cellulose I to cellulose III, delignifying the biomass simultaneously (da Costa et al. 2015). Composition analysis of EA pretreated NW {{was carried out}} and {{the results showed that}} the NW still contains <b>significant</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> structural sugars after EA pretreatment (~ 58  %). In particular, the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> glucan content is ~ 41  %, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> mannan content is ~ 8  % and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> xylan content is ~ 5  %; the total lignin content is ~ 31  % (Table  1).|$|R
