To begin with, they advised that the course should be laid so as to pass a short distance east of Astropalaia. This, they said, had long been one of the headquarters of piracy. It had, before the war began, been several times attacked by Turkish or European ships of war, the craft found there burnt, and the coast villages destroyed; but since then it was believed that it had again become the headquarters of pirates from some of the other islands, as its position was a favourable one for attack, lying in the direct lines of traffic between both Constantinople and Greece and the eastern trades with Rhodes, Cyprus, Syria, or Egypt.|$|E

50|$|Pozzolanas such as <b>Santorin</b> earth {{were used}} in the Eastern Mediterranean since 500-400 BC.

Vitruvius speaks of four types of pozzolana: black, white, grey, and red, all of which {{can be found in the}} volcanic areas of Italy, such as Naples. Typically it was very thoroughly mixed two-to-one with lime just prior to mixing with water. The Roman port at Cosa was built of pozzolana-lime concrete that was poured underwater, apparently using a long tube to carefully lay it up without allowing sea water to mix with it. The three piers are still visible today, with the underwater portions in generally excellent condition even after more than 2100 years.|$|E

5000|$|Years later, Sartre stated: [...] "The real drama, {{the drama}} I should {{have liked to}} write, {{was that of the}} {{terrorist}} who, by ambushing Germans, becomes the instrument for the execution of fifty hostages." [...] Noted Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal views this statement as an allusion to a series of events that occurred in occupied Paris in 1941: a German officer was killed at the Métro Barbès and in retaliation the German military forces executed eight prisoners in September and then 98 prisoners in October. However, the German censors would have banned such a play, so Sartre was forced to look for other subjects. He settled on the idea of using the story of the Atridae as a vehicle. De Beauvoir says that the first act was inspired by the town of Emborio, [...] "the village on <b>Santorin</b> which had presented so sinister at atmosphere to us when we first reached it a holiday -- all those blank, shuttered houses under the blazing noonday sun." [...] She also says that she, after reading a book about the Etruscans, informed Sartre about the Etruscans' funeral ceremonies, and he found inspiration in this for the second act.|$|E

The Duke of Naxos, a man of nearly seventy, is, in point of dignity, the Premier Duke of Christendom; but, despite his title, he is duke more in name than in fact; for in all things the Grand Turk and his ministers are practically supreme. Every year, when the Turkish captains arrive, the duke's subjects bring their complaints against him before them, so that he dare not punish his own dependents for their crimes, nor even for their offences against his own person. He dresses and lives like a pauper, without the least pomp or princely expenditure for, though he raises from 9000 to 10,000 ducats a year out of his islands, he has to pay 4000 ducats as tribute to the sultan, and his sole thought is how he can save money with which to bribe the Turkish captains and ministers.

We have performed simulations of the same volume both with and without the effects of radiative cooling, but in all cases neglect the effects of star formation and feedback.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns the}} effect of some ions, contained in seawater, on the hydration of cements containing 7 % MgO, pure or with 30 % pozzolan (<b>Santorin</b> Earth). Pastes prepared from these two cements were cured in five baths containing seawater, deionized water and aq. solutions of SO 42 -, Mg 2 + and Cl- ions respectively for one year. The Mg(OH) 2 produced during the hydration of the above cements was determined by DTA-TG, while the hydration phenomena were studied by XRD. It is concluded {{that the presence of}} Cl- and SO 42 - ions does not affect MgO hydration. Mg 2 + ions increase the Mg(OH) 2 content, mostly by their penetration in the pastes.

40|$|A {{multiple}} {{linear regression}} model was developed for the prediction of the 28 -day compressive strength of Portland Pozzolan Cement (PPC) containing <b>Santorin</b> Earth as an admixture. The independent variables of the model were: (1) the compressive strength {{at the age of}} 2 days, (2) the compressive strength after autoclave hydrothermal treatment at 2. 07 N/mm(2) (300 psi) and 214 degrees C for 3 h, (3) the C 3 S/C 2 S ratio of the clinker, (4) the insoluble residue of the cement, (5) the pozzolanic activity factor and (6) the C(3) A content of the clinker. The evaluation of the proposed model was performed by various statistical tests, all of which were successful. These tests included: multiple correlation, test of the significance of coefficients (t-test), estimation of confidence intervals for coefficients, test for outliers and unusual residuals, test for influential points, conditional sums of squares, R-squared and analysis of variance.

40|$|The present work {{extends the}} {{knowledge}} on the behaviour of high magnesia cements, pure or with pozzolanic additives cured for 8 years in potable water at 18 + 2 °C. For this purpose, clinker containing 10 % MgO was prepared {{in an appropriate}} furnace. The raw materials used were all of industrial origin. Four cements were prepared by cogrinding clinker with gypsum and the following pozzolanic materials: <b>Santorin</b> Earth (S. E.), Fly Ash I (F. A. I.), Fly Ash II (F. A. II) and Fly Ash III (F. A. III), in a proportion of 30 %. The Mg(OH) 2 produced during the hydration of the above cements was determined quantitatively by thermogravimetric method, while the hydration phenomena were studied by X. R. D. It is concluded that when clinker containing ca. 10 % MgO is coground with a good pozzolan, the hydration of MgO reaches a limited value {{at the age of}} ca. 6 years. The percentage of hydrated MgO permits the safe use of these cements, as for the long term unsoundness due to MgO hydration. © 1985...|$|E
