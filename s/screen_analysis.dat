40|$|In {{this paper}} 1 we {{describe}} a robust, learning approach to spoken language understanding. Since interactively spoken and computationally analyzed language often contains many errors, robust connectionist networks {{are used for}} providing a flat <b>screening</b> <b>analysis.</b> A <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> is a shallow flat analysis based on category sequences at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using tree or graph representations a <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> uses category sequences {{in order to support}} robustness and learning. This flat <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> is examined {{in the context of the}} system SCREEN (Symbolic Connectionist Robust EnterprisE for Natural language). Starting with the word hypotheses generated by a speech recognizer, we give an overview of the architecture, and illustrate the flat robust processing at the levels of syntax, semantics, and dialog acts.

50|$|The {{biological}} role of JADE1 has {{not been}} elucidated. Limited number of publications addresses this question using mice models. The most comprehensive study {{which was published in}} 2003, identified mice orthologue of human JADE1, Jade1, and investigated Jade1 expression during mice embryogenesis. Searching for developmentally regulated genes the authors used gene trap <b>screen</b> <b>analysis</b> and identified mouse Jade1 as gene strongly regulated during embryogenesis. Insertion of the vector into the third intron of the Jade1 gene lead to the production of a 47-amino-acid truncated protein. The gene trap insertional mutation resulted in Jade1-beta-galactosidase reporter fusion product and Jade1 null allele. While the homozygotes for the gene trap integration did not produce strong developmental phenotype, the fusion product revealed Jade1 gene spatial-temporal expression in mouse embryonic cells and tissues of developing embryo up to 15.5-d.p.c. In addition the study reports experimental and in silico comparative analysis of Jade1 mRNA transcripts, Jade1 gene structure and analysis of Jade1 protein orthologues from mouse human and zebra fish.Jade1 expression was detected in extraembryonic ectoderm and trophoblast, which are placental components important for vasculogenesis, as well as in sites enriched with multipotent or tissue-specific progenitors, including neural progenitors(2). The dynamics of Jade1 reporter expression in these areas indicates the involvement in the determination and elongation of anterior posterior axis, an important point of the study). The potential role for human JADE1 in the renewal of embryonic stem cell and embryonal carcinoma cell cultures was suggested in another screening study which showed that, in cultured stem cells activation of stem cell transcription factor OCT4 pathway upregulated JADE1 gene expression along with stem cell factors NANOG, PHC1, USP44 and SOX2.Role of JADE1 in epithelial cell proliferation was addressed in a murine model of acute kidney injury and regeneration. Expression patterns and dynamics of HBO1-JADE1S/L were examined in regenerating tubular epithelial cells. Ischemia and reperfusion injury resulted in an initial decrease in JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 protein levels, which returned to the baseline during renal recovery. Expression levels of HBO1 and JADE1S recovered as cell proliferation rate reached maximum, whereas JADE1L recovered after bulk proliferation had diminished. The temporal expression of JADE1 correlated with the acetylation of histone H4 (H4K5 and H4K12) but not that of histone H3 (H4K14), suggesting that the JADE1-HBO1 complex specifically marks H4 during epithelial cell proliferation. The results of the study implicate JADE1-HBO1 complex in acute kidney injury and suggest distinct roles for JADE1 isoforms during epithelial cell recovery.|$|E
40|$|Site-specific seismic slope {{stability}} analyses are required in California by the 1990 California Seismic Hazards Mapping Act for sites located within mapped hazard zones and scheduled for development {{with more than}} four single-family dwellings. A <b>screen</b> <b>analysis</b> is performed to distinguish sites for which only small ground deformations are likely from sites for which larger, more damaging landslide movements could occur. No additional analyses are required for sites that pass the screen, whereas relatively detailed analyses are required for sites that fail the screen. We present a <b>screen</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure {{that is based on}} a calibrated pseudo-static representation of seismic {{slope stability}}. The novel feature of the present screen procedure is that it accounts not only for the effects of ground motion amplitude on slope displacement, but also accounts for duration effects indirectly via the site seismicity. This formulation enables a more site-specific <b>screen</b> <b>analysis</b> than previous formulations that made a priori assumptions of seismicity/duration. This screen procedure has recently been adopted by the Landslide Hazard Implementation Committee for implementation by practicing engineers and engineering geologists in southern California...|$|E

Under the CTBT, a monitoring system of seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasonic and radionuclide sensors operates and {{data from this}} system is analyzed by the International Data Centre (IDC). The IDC provides CTBT signatories basic seismic event parameters and a <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> indicating whether an event exhibits explosion characteristics (for example, shallow depth). An {{important component of the}} <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> is a statistical test of the the null hypothesis H 0 : Explosion Characteristics using empirical measurements of seismic energy (magnitudes).

This paper proposes a hypothesis test (<b>screening</b> <b>analysis)</b> using Ms and mb that expressly accounts for physical correction model inadequacy in the standard error of the test statistic.

The screening is demonstrated with two examples with step by step instructions. The paper recommends that <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> be used in an iterative process of screening and model expansion to arrive at tolerance intervals on model results.

40|$|Possible {{environmental}} effects of marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy development are not well understood, and yet regulatory agencies are required to make decisions in spite of substantial uncertainty about environmental impacts and their long-term effects. An understanding of risk associated with likely interactions between MHK installations and aquatic receptors, including animals, habitats, and ecosystems, can help reduce the level of uncertainty and focus regulatory actions and scientific studies on interactions of most concern. As {{a first step in}} developing the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Environmental Risk Evaluation System (ERES), PNNL scientists conducted a preliminary risk <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> on three initial MHK cases - a tidal project in Puget Sound using Open Hydro turbines, a wave project off the coast of Oregon using Ocean Power Technologies point attenuator buoys, and a riverine current project in the Mississippi River using Free Flow turbines. Through an iterative process, the <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed that top-tier stressors in all three cases were the effects of the dynamic physical presence of the device (e. g., strike), accidents, and effects of the static physical presence of the device (e. g., habitat alteration). Receptor interactions with these stressors at the four highest tiers of risk were dominated by marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and birds (diving and non-diving); only the riverine case (Free Flow) included different receptors in the third tier (fish) and the fourth tier (benthic invertebrates). Although this <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> provides a preliminary analysis of vulnerability of environmental receptors to stressors associated with MHK installations, probability analysis, especially of risk associated with chemical toxicity and accidents such as oil spills or lost gear, will be necessary to further understand high-priority risks. Subject matter expert review of this process and results is required and is planned for the first quarter of FY 11. Once expert review is finalized, the <b>screening</b> <b>analysis</b> phase of ERES will be complete...|$|R
