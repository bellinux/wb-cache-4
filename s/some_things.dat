5|$|The {{movement}} of electric charge {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.|$|E

However, she discreetly {{abandons}} her suspicions when she asks Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith) if she noticed any office romances and Phyllis guesses that Pam meant her and Jim. Jim and Pam bond when she sees Jim's room {{for the first time}} and looks through his high school year book.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in private}} and public performances, Mendelssohn was also renowned for his improvisations. On one {{occasion}} in London, when asked by the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to extemporise, he created a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked 'He has done <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that seem to me impossible, even after I have heard them done.' At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote 'Mendelssohn accompanied like a God'.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the {{territory}} gained its first representative in the Parliament, although at first with limited speaking and voting rights. In 1974 it gained a fully elected, but still advisory House of Assembly. In 1988 it gained {{the trappings of}} self-government with a Legislative Assembly {{with most of the}} powers and responsibilities of an Australian state, although subject to a federal right of veto, similar to the arrangements adopted for the Northern Territory in 1978. The Legislative Assembly legalised <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that were prohibited in other parts of Australia, such as prostitution and X-rated pornography; in 2006, an attempt to allow civil unions for same-sex couples was overruled by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The queue line takes riders {{through a}} large, drawn out upwards helix, {{repeatedly}} passing under, through and over various buildings of abstract architecture, before traversing metal bridges into the elevated station building. Here they are batched into rows and board their ride cars, while various technical graphics are displayed on overhead screens. As the cars dispatch, the screens play an automated video featuring the Lord of Darkness {{in his final}} appearance as he recites the following monologue:For <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> there is no rational explanation. There is no way out. There is no happy ending to the story. Welcome to the unknown; welcome to eternal darkness; welcome...to Oblivion.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops {{due to her}} mobile phone ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him {{that she needs to}} do <b>some</b> <b>things</b> before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, in addition to the other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress.|$|E

A nonentity is <b>some</b> <b>thing</b> {{that is not}} an entity and does not have its own identifying surrogate. An independent entity has its own surrogate. A dependent entity has a surrogate but it belongs to another entity, i.e. the surrogate is a foreign key.|$|R

25|$|Besides these writings, Theophrastus wrote several {{collections}} of problems, {{out of which}} <b>some</b> <b>things</b> at least have passed into the Problems that have come down to us {{under the name of}} Aristotle, and commentaries, partly dialogues, to which probably belonged the Erotikos (Ἐρωτικός), Megacles (Μεγακλῆς), Callisthenes (Καλλισθένης), and Megarikos (Μεγαρικός), and letters, partly books on mathematical sciences and their history.|$|E

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>things</b> {{about the}} future of the Central Waterfront are clear. The 2001 Nisqually {{earthquake}} revealed that the Alaskan Way Viaduct is unsound and the seawall is in very poor condition. Another earthquake could cause liquefaction of the soils, undermining the viaduct and placing massive pressure on the seawall. While there may be much question as to what will happen, there is no doubt that things cannot remain as they are. Elsewhere on the waterfront, the deteriorating Piers 62 and 63 also cannot remain as they are.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} account, however, suggests more mundanely that Peter Niers was {{a master}} of disguise: In a circulated warrant from 1579, based on confessions from his captured underlings, when Niers was thought {{to operate in the}} Schwarzwald area, it is stated that he frequently changed his appearance and costume, sometimes masquerading as a common soldier, at other times as a leper, {{and a number of other}} disguises. The same warrant states, however, that <b>some</b> <b>things</b> stayed constant: He always had a lot of money on him, he carried two loaded pistols in his trousers, and a huge two-handed sword.|$|E

In 1997 the children visit an art gallery, and see a painting by Lewis Bast, the same Lewis from 1867. The painting is of an unknown girl, but the children notice that the girl is Constance.|$|E
