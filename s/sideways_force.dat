25|$|One of the {{perceived}} main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rails and}} {{projectiles}} must be built from strong conductive materials; the rails {{need to survive}} the violence of an accelerating projectile, and heating due to the large currents and friction involved. Some erroneous work {{has suggested that the}} recoil force in railguns can be redirected or eliminated; careful theoretical and experimental analysis reveals that the recoil force acts on the breech closure just as in a chemical firearm. The rails also repel themselves via a <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> caused by the rails being pushed by the magnetic field, just as the projectile is. The rails need to survive this without bending and must be very securely mounted. [...] Currently published material suggests that major advances in material science must be made before rails can be developed that allow railguns to fire more than a few full-power shots before replacement of the rails is required.|$|E
50|$|A {{major source}} of engine wear is the <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> exerted on the piston through the {{connecting}} rod by the crankshaft, which typically wears the cylinder into an oval cross-section rather than circular, {{making it impossible for}} piston rings to correctly seal against the cylinder walls. Geometrically, {{it can be seen that}} longer connecting rods will reduce the amount of this <b>sideways</b> <b>force,</b> and therefore lead to longer engine life. However, for a given engine block, the sum of the length of the connecting rod plus the piston stroke is a fixed number, determined by the fixed distance between the crankshaft axis and the top of the cylinder block where the cylinder head fastens.|$|E
50|$|The {{attacker}} extends their arm {{under the}} opponent's armpit and across their back while turning <b>sideways,</b> <b>forcing</b> the opponent forward and throwing {{him to the}} ground without touching the mawashi (beltless arm throw).|$|R
5000|$|Inverted arches {{are often}} used in {{conjunction}} with retaining walls. The arch provides a foundation for the walls and can resist the <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> upon them. The retaining wall also provides the vertical load needed by the arch.Inverted arch foundation is very strong foundation.|$|R
5000|$|In limbless {{locomotion}}, forward locomotion {{is generated}} by propagating flexural waves {{along the length of}} the animal's body. Forces generated between the animal and surrounding environment lead to a generation of alternating <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> that act to move the animal forward. [...] These forces generate thrust and drag.|$|R
5000|$|In {{tightening}} the trucker's hitch, tension can be effectively increased by repeatedly pulling sideways while preventing {{the tail end}} from slipping through the loop, and then cinching the knot tighter as the <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> is released. This is called [...] "sweating a line".|$|E
5000|$|A charged {{particle}} {{moving in a}} -field experiences a <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> that {{is proportional to the}} strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the Lorentz force, and is given by ...|$|E
50|$|In 2012, a {{research}} group in Japan demonstrated that pyrolytic carbon can respond to laser light or sufficiently powerful natural sunlight by spinning or {{moving in the direction}} of the field gradient. The carbon's magnetic susceptibility changes upon illumination, leading to an unbalanced magnetization of the material and thus a <b>sideways</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{buttress}} is {{an architectural}} structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall. Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings, {{as a means}} of providing support to act against the lateral (<b>sideways)</b> <b>forces</b> arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing.|$|R
5000|$|Keel {{effect is}} also called [...] "Pendulum Effect" [...] because a lower {{center of gravity}} {{increases}} the effect of <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> (above the center of gravity) in producing a rolling moment. This is because the moment arm is longer, not because of gravitational forces. A low center of gravity is like a pendulum (which has a very low center of gravity).|$|R
30|$|In case of plasma, it was {{observed}} that some balancing and unbalancing forces acted upon, like the case of plasma as torus which is very close to outboard wall. At this stage, poloidal field has different radial locations and have variable <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> as well. In this case, one side of torus has higher values than other side and poloidal field has different values at different locations.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{arch supports}} a vertical load downwards on {{the centre of}} the arch and translates this into forces both downwards and outwards {{at the base of the}} arch. In most cases, this <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> is a nuisance and must be resisted by either strong foundations or a further 'bowstring' girder, in the form of a tied-arch bridge.|$|E
50|$|Curve {{resistance}} {{depends on}} various factors, {{the most important}} being the radius and the superelevation of a curve. Since curves are usually banked by superelevation, there will exist some speed at which {{there will be no}} <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> on the train and where therefore curve resistance is minimum. At higher or lower speeds, curve resistance may be a few (or several) times greater.|$|E
50|$|The {{base and}} top plate of Acrow props are quite small, {{so they are}} {{suitable}} for supporting a vertical load but {{are at risk of}} toppling if there is any <b>sideways</b> <b>force.</b> In such cases, props should be strutted or 'laced' with scaffolding poles. A recent improvement to Acrow props was to shape this baseplate with notches, allowing pallet loads of horizontal props to be stacked neatly, rather than randomly piled.|$|E
5000|$|Attachment: {{the third}} and final {{component}} is the mouth attachment - typically using rubber bands - joins the facemask from the mouth-yoke into the patient's mouth. The elastics hook on the patient's braces or other such suitable oral appliance. As the elastics are flexible, up to six elastics may be used to provide various forward and <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> on the patient's teeth and arch, while still allowing the patient to open and close his or her jaw.|$|R
50|$|On smaller engines the {{connecting}} rod links the piston and the crankshaft directly, but this transmits <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> to the piston, since the crankpin (and thus {{the direction the}} force is applied) moves {{from side to side}} with the rotary motion of the crank. These transverse forces are tolerable in a smaller engine; a larger engine's much greater forces would cause an intolerable degree of wear on the piston and cylinder, as well as increasing overall friction in the engine.|$|R
50|$|Structurally, an {{exoskeleton}} chassis is {{midway between}} a ladder chassis and a spaceframe chassis. At its simplest, {{it consists of}} two ladder chassis, one above the other. The classic ladder chassis is stiff against <b>sideways</b> <b>forces,</b> but weak against vertical bending forces. Using paired tubes, separated vertically, makes the chassis much stiffer in this direction. Unlike a spaceframe though, the main forces act as bending loads upon these tubes, rather than the pure tension or compression forces of the true spaceframe.|$|R
50|$|The {{parallel}} turn in alpine {{skiing is}} a method for turning which rolls the ski onto one edge, allowing it to bend into an arc. Thus bent, the ski follows the turn without sliding. It contrasts with earlier techniques such as the stem Christie, which slides the ski outward from the body ("stemming") to generate <b>sideways</b> <b>force.</b> Parallel turns generate much less friction and are more efficient both in maintaining speed and minimizing skier effort.|$|E
50|$|When a {{spinning}} body passes through air {{at right angles}} to its axis of spin, it experiences a <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> in the third dimension. This Magnus effect was first demonstrated on {{a spinning}} cylinder by Gustav Magnus in 1872. If the cylinder axis is aligned spanwise (side to side) then forward movement through the air generates lift. The rotating body {{does not need to be}} a cylinder and many related shapes have been studied.|$|E
50|$|Yaw is {{induced by}} a {{moveable}} rudder-fin. The {{movement of the}} rudder changes the size and orientation of the force the vertical surface produces. Since the force is created at a distance behind the centre of gravity, this <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> causes a yawing moment then a yawing motion. On a large aircraft there may be several independent rudders on the single fin for both safety and to control the inter-linked yaw and roll actions.|$|E
50|$|Inverted arches {{are used}} where <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> must be restrained, and where space is most easily {{available}} beneath a construction. They {{have often been}} applied to railway cuttings, but are perhaps most distinctively used as the base of docks, particularly dry docks and locks that must be supported {{even when they are}} empty of water that could otherwise resist the sidethrust of their walls. Some canal tunnels were built oval in section, such as the Newbold-on-Avon tunnel, where the lower section forms an invert for strength.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a single}} vortex is shed, an {{asymmetrical}} flow pattern forms {{around the body}} and changes the pressure distribution. This means that the alternate shedding of vortices can create periodic lateral (<b>sideways)</b> <b>forces</b> on the body in question, causing it to vibrate. If the vortex shedding frequency {{is similar to the}} natural frequency of a body or structure, it causes resonance. It is this forced vibration that, at the correct frequency, causes suspended telephone or power lines to [...] "sing" [...] and the antenna on a car to vibrate more strongly at certain speeds.|$|R
50|$|Gölsdorf axles {{work in this}} way. Two of {{the five}} axles cannot move {{sideways}} relative to the frame because their axle boxes fix them rigidly to the frame. The other axles, however, are fitted into their bearings and attached to their drives {{in such a way}} that they can be moved sideways during curve running, depending on the <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> acting on them. In addition the connecting and coupling rods, through which the steam pressure and linear forces from the steam pistons are translated into the rotation of the wheels via the crank pins, also have to be able to move sideways.|$|R
50|$|Papercrete {{has also}} been tested for its tensile strength. Fuller notes that a papercrete block is the {{equivalent}} of hundred of pages of paper - almost like a catalog. Papercrete has very good shear strength as a block. Lateral load involves <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> - the wind load on the entire area of an outside wall for example. Because papercrete walls are usually a minimum of twelve inches thick, and usually pinned with rebar, they may be strong laterally.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the flying}} arch, the {{inverted}} arch {{is not used}} to support a load, as for a bridge, but rather to resist sideways, inwards loads. The conventional arch supports a vertical load downwards on {{the centre of the}} arch and translates this into forces both downwards and outwards {{at the base of the}} arch. In most cases, this <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> is a nuisance and must be resisted by either strong foundations or a further 'bowstring' girder, in the form of a tied-arch bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Tilting {{trains are}} meant to help reduce the effects of {{centrifugal}} force on the human body, but they can still cause nausea, a problem that was widely seen on early [...] "active" [...] tilting trains that exactly balanced the outward force. The effect could be felt under maximum speed and tilt, when the combination of tilting outside view and lack of corresponding <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> can be disconcerting to passengers, {{like that of a}} [...] "thrill ride". Researchers have found that if the tilting motion is reduced to compensate for 80% or less of lateral apparent force, then passengers feel more secure. Also, motion sickness on tilting trains can be essentially eliminated by adjusting the timing of when the cars tilt as they enter and leave the curves. Systems typically tilt the cars based on a sensor {{at the front of the}} train, and the slight delay in reacting to this information leads to a short period of <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> while the cars react. It was found that when the cars tilt just at the beginning of the curves instead of while they are making the turns, there was no motion sickness. To provide information about the upcoming curves before the front of the train reaches them, a GPS system is used.|$|E

50|$|The engine has {{crosshead}} bearings so {{that the}} always-vertical piston rod allows a tight seal under the piston. Consequently, the lubrication of the engine is split: the cylinders and the crankcase use different lubricants, each being specialised for and dedicated to its role. The cylinders are lubricated by continual, timed injection of consumable lubricant, formulated to protect the cylinders from wear and to neutralise the acids formed during combustion of the high-sulfur fuels commonly used. The crosshead design reduces <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> on the piston, keeping diametral cylinder liner wear {{in the order of}} only about 0.03 mm per 1000 hours.|$|R
50|$|Hexes are {{the oldest}} form of active protection. They {{consist of a}} hollow {{eccentric}} hexagonal prism with tapered ends, usually threaded with cord or webbing. They are frequently placed as a passive chock, but are more commonly placed in active camming positions. In the standard active placement, a fall causes the hex to twist in its placement exerting <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> on the rock {{in which it is}} placed. They are manufactured by several firms, with a range of sizes varying from about 10mm thick to 100mm wide. Sides may be straight or curved.|$|E
50|$|If the {{aircraft}} heading {{is different from}} {{the aircraft}}'s direction of motion, a <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> is exerted on the wheels. If this force is in front of the center of gravity, the resulting moment rotates the aircraft's heading even further from its direction of motion. This increases the force and the process reinforces itself. To avoid a ground loop, the pilot must respond to any turning tendency quickly, while sufficient control authority is available to counteract it. Once the aircraft rotates beyond this point, there is nothing the pilot can do to stop it from rotating further.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a vehicle}} (motor vehicle or {{railroad}} train) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not banked {{so as to}} exactly counter the centrifugal force with an equal and opposing centripetal force due to the banking, {{then there will be}} a net unbalanced <b>sideways</b> <b>force</b> on the vehicle.This will result in increased rolling resistance. Banking is also known as [...] "superelevation" [...] or [...] "cant" [...] (not to be confused with rail cant of a rail). For railroads, this is called curve resistance but for roads it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to cornering.|$|E

50|$|Most arch bridges are {{constructed}} at right-angles to the obstruction which they cross, {{this being the}} easiest and strongest mode of building. If the obstacle runs {{at an angle to}} the new roadway though, the bridge must either have its span made wider to cross the obstacle diagonally, or else the arch must itself be skewed, so that a narrower arch can cross the obstacle more closely. A skew bridge raises the difficulty that the <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> in the arch are no longer acting at right-angles to their abutments. If the skew is excessive, the force across the face of the abutment may be enough to make the bridge unstable and to slip or collapse sideways.|$|R
5000|$|A coned disc also becomes stiff against axial loads, as the web is {{no longer}} purely {{perpendicular}} to the axis of the wheel. Unlike a flat disc, there is no direction where the whole of a coned disc would be perpendicular (and thus flexible) to it. A drawback of a simple cone is that the wheel now becomes wider, along the axis. The wobbly web effectively [...] "folds" [...] a coned disc wheel into pleats, making it narrower again, but retaining the axial stiffness. This pleated disc is also stiffer against nutating forces. A similar feature, a 'sine wave wall', is sometimes encountered in architecture where a straight wall is made stronger against <b>sideways</b> <b>forces</b> by corrugating it.|$|R
