40|$|Education is a {{critically}} important enterprise to {{the healthcare system}} and is presumed to directly {{affect the quality of}} patient care, systems functions, and institutional efficiency. It can be expensive to develop quality educa-tion programs and also expensive to educate poorly. High costs associated with a failure to educate include the <b>select</b> <b>liabilities</b> associated with fail-ures in practitioner competency, deteriorating health of patients unable to adequately manage self-care activities due to knowledge deficiencies, and poor publicity or civil suits associated with discriminatory practices or pri-vacy violations in part based on underlying knowledge gaps. Traditional modes of formal staff education and inservice programming include classroom lecture, continuing education articles with posttests, and unit-based workshops. For the most part, these learning opportunities are packaged in a one-size-fits-all format with little attention paid to expe-rience, age, preferred learning style, culture, or gender. Learning disabili-ties are rarely, if ever, considered. Staff is assigned or compelled to attend programs deemed as “manda-tory. ” Programs are offered while nurses have colleagues cover their pa-tient assignment, and attendance is often poor. Educators, including CNSs, charged with providing these programs lament the poor participation and the low rate of return on the expensive investment of time while adminis-trators insist on repeated program offerings to increase attendance figures and demonstrate competence to satisfy accrediting and regulatory agen-cies and to reduce liability exposure...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Intermediate Credit Banks {{through local}} Production Credit Associations and other {{financial}} institutions have become significant suppliers of non-real-estate credit to agricultural producers. The increased volume {{has been accompanied by}} fluctuations in the funding volume and costs at which the funds are obtained. The liability management model developed and empirically tested in this study is an operational procedure that may be useful to the banks as an aid in <b>selecting</b> <b>liability</b> structures that minimize the average cost of credit that they provide to PC As and OFIs. The model requires an estimate of monthly expected debt costs for the Farm Credit System securities for a 18 -month future period and quarterly estimates for an additional six quarters. It also requires an estimation of monthly and quarterly debt requirements for the 3 -year future period. With these coefficients, the model generates an efficient frontier of debt portfolios for a 3 -year period. That efficient frontier is structured so that a minimum expected-cost debt portfolio is derived for each level of cost variance. A movement to a lower expected-cost portfolio on the efficient frontier entails a higher level of cost variance. The model can be used to obtain a new efficient frontier when a change in projected expected debt costs (interest rate change) or debt requirements becomes evident. In most situations, the model would be used {{at least once a month}} when a decision to participate in a bond issue is made. The model also can be used to assess the impact of alternative debt policy constraints on cost and risk...|$|R

Mice selected as liable (L) and refractory (R) over ten generations voided significantly more and less Nematospiroides dubius eggs compared with randomly mated (Rd) mice after primary infections with 100 larvae. There was little {{difference between the}} number of parasite eggs voided g- 1 faeces (epg) by individual mice on day 14 compared with day 15 after infection. However there was a significant diurnal variation in the egg values for individual mice but the mean differences observed between the R, Rd and L mice were maintained over a 24 h period. There was a strong correlation between both the total number and the number of female worms, surviving 21 days after infection, and the mean epg 14 and 15 days after infection. Female N. dubius produced more eggs in L mice and fewer eggs in R mice compared with worms in Rd mice. Similarly, worms grew longer in L mice and were shorter in R mice compared with parasites in Rd mice...|$|R

Under the background that the new enterprise income tax law was issued, we discussed the problem how to use tax planning to reduce the tax burden of enterprise and realize the maximization of the total profit for the enterprise. In this article, we studied the tax financing in the stage of enterprise financing from the selection of financing mode and the confirmation of financing channel, and put forward that the enterprise should <b>select</b> the <b>liability</b> financing mode to the largest extent in the critical risk range of equity structure. We studied the tax planning in the stage of investment of enterprise from three aspects including correctly selecting the investment direction, confirming proper enterprise organization form and selecting tax saving investment subject. We studied the tax planning from two aspects such as income and charge deduction. We studied the tax planning in the distribution stage of enterprise management result from first utilizing taxable income to compensate the loss, the loss recovering sequence of domestic investment profit return and the profit distribution strategy in the low tax region.

40|$|In recent years, {{microfinance}} {{institutions have}} expanded into group lending with individual liability, leaving out the joint liability clause {{which was an}} important feature in earlier lending contracts. Recent experimental evidence indicates that group lending may yield benefits, specifically lowering default rates, {{even in the absence}} of joint liability. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model where the public nature of group meetings means that borrowers have incentives to repay a group loan to safeguard their reputation. We show that the introduction of group loans with individual liability will cause sorting between joint liability and individual liability group loans. Specifically, borrowers who attach more importance to their reputation will <b>select</b> into individual <b>liability</b> loans, causing default rates and interest rates to rise for joint liability loans. The introduction of group loans with individual liability can even make joint liability loans infeasible in equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 45 tibial shaft fractures, all {{conservatively}} treated and with union delayed {{for more than}} 16 but less than 32 weeks were entered in a double-blind multi-centre trial. The fractures were <b>selected</b> for their <b>liability</b> to delayed union {{by the presence of}} moderate or severe displacement, angulation or comminution or a compound lesion with moderate or severe injury to skin and soft tissues. Treatment was by plaster immobilisation in all, with active electromagnetic stimulation units in 20 patients and dummy control units in 25 patients for 12 weeks. Radiographs were assessed blindly and independently by a radiologist and an orthopaedic surgeon. Statistical analysis showed the treatment groups to be comparable except in their age distribution, but age was not found to affect the outcome and the effect of treatment was consistent for each age group. The radiologist’s assessment of the active group showed radiological union in five fractures, progress to union in five but no progress to union in 10. In the control group there was union in one fracture and progress towards union in one but no progress in 23. Using Fisher’s exact test, the results were very significantly in favour of the active group (p = 0. 002). The orthopaedic surgeon’s assessment showed union in nine fractures and absence of union in 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{figures on}} <b>selected</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> from {{the flow of}} funds {{accounts}} (FFA) household sector with survey-based estimates from the 1989, 1992, 1995, and 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Previous studies generally did not fully adjust the FFA and SCF measures to place them on a comparable basis. This analysis addresses common misperceptions about the definitions of selected FFA household sector's assets and liabilities and reconciles more fully the FFA and SCF wealth components. The results show that for aggregate assets, aggregate liabilities, and specific wealth components, such as owner-occupied real estate, consumer credit, and home mortgage debt, the FFA and SCF estimates are quite close in 1989 and 1992 but move apart thereafter. Also, when placed on a comparable basis, differences between the FFA and SCF measures of savings deposits and publicly traded corporate shares were reduced from those documented in previous studies but, nevertheless, still remain substantial.
