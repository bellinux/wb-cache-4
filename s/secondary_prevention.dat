40|$|Hypertension is a major, if not {{the most}} important, {{contributor}} to the disease burden and premature death globally which is largely related to cardiovascular disease.

Combining aspirin, cholesterol and blood pressure-lowering agents into a fixed-dose combination pill called the cardiovascular polypill has been proposed as complementary care in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in both the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>preventions</b> of cardiovascular disease.

40|$|In Saskatchewan, stroke is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} as well was the major cause of adult disability. Once a person suffers a stroke or {{transient}} ischemic attack (TIA), they are at high risk for having a secondary (or recurrent) stroke. Despite this knowledge, <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention</b> is often overlooked in the care of stroke/TIA patients. With the vision of decreasing the incidence and impact of stroke in Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Integrated Stroke Strategy (SISS) was recently implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} to begin the development of an evaluation measurement system for the SISS based on the guidelines and measures from the Canadian Stroke Strategy (CSS) specifically pertaining to <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention.</b> This multi-year cross-sectional study is an analysis of de-identified health data derived from linkage of administrative and laboratory data. Select indicators from the CSS Performance Measurement Manual involving medications use for <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention</b> (antihypertensives, antilipidemics, anticoagulants) and intermediate health outcomes (serum LDL cholesterol, INR) are calculated. Regression is used to quantify the association of patient demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and geographic location of care with receipt of guideline-recommended <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention.</b> The target population is Saskatchewan residents who have been hospitalized for a stroke or TIA between April 1, 2001 and March 31, 2008. The results of this study indicated that <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention</b> in Saskatchewan is sub-optimal in the management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. Although there has been some improvement over the time period, a significant number of patients are not taking the recommended medications at discharge from acute care. Similarly, a considerable number of patients are not receiving the appropriate laboratory tests within the year following their stroke event. Through regression analysis it was revealed that a number of correlates (ie. age, income, on medication before the stroke event) were significantly associated with receiving these specific elements of <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention,</b> suggesting potential differences in provision of care. Finally, regional differences in <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention</b> were found for a number of the outcomes, which may indicate differences in care throughout the province. The findings of this study serve as a baseline for evaluation of the impact of the Saskatchewan Integrated Stroke Strategy in the area of <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention.</b> The results make apparent the fact that <b>secondary</b> stroke <b>prevention</b> in Saskatchewan can be improved, and that there is much opportunity for future research in this area...|$|R

The test product was an ethanol extract of red yeast rice, with a monacolin K content of 11.6 mg/day. Key CCSPS results: In the treated group, risk of subsequent heart attacks was reduced by 45%, cardio deaths by 31%, and all-cause deaths by 33%.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review came to {{the result}} that in women {{starting}} hormone replacement therapy less than 10 years after menopause have a lower mortality and lower rate of coronary heart disease compared to placebo or no treatment, without any strong evidence of {{an effect on the}} risk of stroke. Those starting therapy more than 10 years after menopause have little effect on mortality and coronary heart disease, but have an increased risk of stroke. Overall, however, taking the increased risk of venous thromboembolism into account, it {{came to the}} conclusion that has hormone replacement therapy has little if any benefit for primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
40|$|Aspirin {{therapy has}} been shown to be an {{effective}} prevention measure to reduce the risk of new or recurring cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to provide an epidemiological analysis of low-dose aspirin use for primary and <b>secondary</b> CVD <b>prevention</b> from 2012 to 2015. Estimates of self-reported low-dose aspirin use for primary and <b>secondary</b> CVD <b>prevention</b> were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey for the years 2012 – 2015. Temporal changes in the prevalence of aspirin use for primary and <b>secondary</b> CVD <b>prevention</b> were assessed using logistic regression. During 2012 – 2015, 23. 3 % of respondents self-reported as taking aspirin for primary CVD prevention, decreasing from 23. 7 % in 2012 to 21. 8 % in 2015. Also during this period, 8. 4 % self-reported as taking aspirin for <b>secondary</b> CVD <b>prevention,</b> decreasing from 8. 9 % in 2012 to 8. 2 % in 2015. Overall, the prevalence of aspirin use for CVD prevention declined from 32. 6 % in 2012 to 30. 0 % in 2015. This study shows that over 30 % of the adult population self-reports as taking low-dose aspirin for primary or <b>secondary</b> CVD <b>prevention.</b> Despite the decline in this prevalence over the previous four years, aspirin therapy remains a highly-utilized means of preventing CVD...|$|R

25|$|For instance, {{for people}} with known {{atherosclerosis}} diseases, the 2004 updated American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70nbsp&mg/dL, unspecified how much lower. This low level of less than 70nbsp&mg/dL (higher than Tim Russert's value shortly prior to his heart attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed {{in an article in}} the Annals of internal medicine. It should also be noted that statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels.|$|E
25|$|High blood {{pressure}} accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk. Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic {{reduces the risk}} of stroke by ~40%. Lowering {{blood pressure}} has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It is equally important in <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention.</b> Even patients older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy. The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs —therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered. The routine use of beta-blockers following a stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, {{prevention}} {{is an important}} public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In {{people who have had}} a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Oral {{anticoagulants}} such as warfarin {{have been}} the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several {{studies have shown that}} aspirin and antiplatelet drugs are highly effective in <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown. Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but are more expensive. Clopidogrel has less side effects than ticlopidine. Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect. Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.|$|E
2500|$|Combinations of statins, niacin and {{intestinal}} cholesterol absorption-inhibiting supplements (ezetimibe and others, {{and to a}} much {{lesser extent}} fibrates) {{have been the most}} successful in changing common but sub-optimal lipoprotein patterns and group outcomes. In the many <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> and several primary prevention trials, several classes of lipoprotein-expression-altering (less correctly termed [...] "cholesterol-lowering") agents have consistently reduced not only heart attack, stroke and hospitalization but also all-cause mortality rates. The first of the large <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> comparative statin/placebo treatment trials was the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) with over fifteen more studies extending through to the more recent ASTEROID trial published in 2006. The first primary prevention comparative treatment trial was AFCAPS/TexCAPS with multiple later comparative statin/placebo treatment trials including EXCEL, ASCOT and SPARCL. While the statin trials have all been clearly favorable for improved human outcomes, only ASTEROID and SATURN showed evidence of atherosclerotic regression (slight). Both human and animal trials that showed evidence of disease regression used more aggressive combination agent treatment strategies, which nearly always included niacin.|$|E
