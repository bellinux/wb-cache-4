On July 18 the 1994 AMIA bombing, when the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association was destroyed in a terrorist attack, was mentioned when Elías said he would attend the annual protest of the unsolved case's handling. Minor Jewish characters (such as relatives and friends) returned for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year celebration. Its Jewish characters and the number of Argentine and Latin American expatriates in Israel helped Graduados obtain good ratings in Israel.|$|E

[...] Afterwards, the battalion sailed in the first troop convoy to leave Australia on 10 January 1940, embarking upon the transport Orcades.

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{many people}} began leaving the city for the cooler suburbs in the heat of summertime, and as a result October 1 became a second Moving Day, as people {{returning}} to the city would take their belongings out of storage and move into their newly rented homes. The October date {{may be related to the}} English custom of paying land rents on Michaelmas, which falls on September 29. Eventually, the October date began to supplant the traditional May date, so that by 1922 the Van Owners Association reported only a [...] "moderate flurry" [...] of activity on the <b>Spring</b> <b>day.</b> The movers also attempted to get legislation passed to spread out the Fall rush to three dates: the firsts of September, October and November. Over time, the tradition of a specific Moving Day began to fade, with the remnant evident in commercial leases, which still generally run out on May 1 or October 1.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 October 1930 the University of Pretoria Private Act, No. 13 of 1930 {{changed the}} name of the TUC to the University of Pretoria. The TUC {{originally}} established as an English medium institution had evolved into the only fully bilingual university in South Africa and remained as such until the early 1930s. The rapid increase of Afrikaans speaking students brought about an imbalance between the demographics of students and the languages of instruction. By 1931, although 65% of students were Afrikaans speaking, 68% of the classes were conducted in English. In 1932 the University Council addressed the imbalance, deciding that Afrikaans would become the only medium of instruction. An increase in student numbers necessitated the building of new facilities such as the Club Hall and Administration Building (colloquially known as the ship) when the 7th faculty, the Medical Faculty, [...] was established in 1943. This period further saw the establishment of numerous student activities such as the annual <b>Spring</b> <b>Day</b> event and intervarsity. Student publications established include the Trek in 1931, the first Rag Mag in 1936 and the weekly student newspaper, Die Perdeby in 1939. The period of 1948–1982 is characterised by the substantial increase in numbers of an almost exclusively white student body and the concomitant physical growth of the university infrastructure. The nearly doubling of student numbers demanded the physical expansion of the Hatfield campus and new buildings were built in quick succession as the campus grew eastward. In the mid-1960s, the university urgently required additional land and acquired the adjacent property of Christian Brothers' College, Saint Gabriel's. This property now forms the eastern section of the Hatfield campus.|$|E

40|$|The tree-ring cores of Tianshan spruces {{collected}} from nine {{sites in the}} Urumqi River drainage of the middle Tianshan Mountains were used to establish three types of the tree-ring width chronologies over the last 370 years, using the international standard method of dendrochronology. Our study demonstrates that dendrochronology can be better used to reconstruct {{the number of the}} precipitation day than to reconstruct the precipitation amount in middle Tianshan Mountains. It is found that the residual chronology among the three tree-ring width chronologies has the best relationship with number of <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> from May 20 to June 8. The chronologies at Haxionggou B site and Zaierdegou site in the Urumiqi drainage have the highest correlation with the observed number of <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> at Daxigou meteorological station, and are used to reconstruct the <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> over the last 370 years in the drainage. The main significant decreasing trend of the number of the <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> occurred during 1665 - 1717, while the significant increasing trends happened during 1805 - 1841 and 1914 - 1943. The reconstructed series of the number of <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> has quasi-periodic variations of 3. 3, 2. 1, 2. 5, 12. 3 and 32. 0 years with the dominated short periodical changes. The long cycle of 32 years is shown quite clearly in the 10 -year smoothed sequence. The maximum <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> occurred mainly in the 1630 s, 1840 s and 1940 s, while the lowest number of <b>spring</b> precipitation <b>days</b> for the 10 -year average occurred in the 1710 s...|$|R
