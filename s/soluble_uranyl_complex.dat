40|$|Interface coupled dissolution-reprecipitation {{reactions}} (ICDR) are {{a common}} feature of fluid-rock interaction during crustal fluid flow. We tested the hypothesis that ICDR reactions can {{play a key role}} in scavenging minor elements by exploring the fate of U during the experimental sulfidation of hematite to chalcopyrite under hydrothermal conditions (220 – 300 °C). The experiments where U was added, either as solid UO 2 +x(s) or as a <b>soluble</b> <b>uranyl</b> <b>complex,</b> differed from the U-free experiments in that pyrite precipitated initially, before the onset of chalcopyrite precipitation. In addition, in UO 2 +x(s) -bearing experiments, enhanced hematite dissolution led to increased porosity and precipitation of pyrite+magnetite within the hematite core, whereas in uranyl nitrate-bearing experiments, abundant pyrite formed initially, before being replaced by chalcopyrite. Uranium scavenging was mainly associated with the early reaction stage (pyrite precipitation), resulting in a thin U-rich line marking the original hematite grain surface. This “line” consists of nanocrystals of UO 2 +x(s), based on chemical mapping and XANES spectroscopy. This study shows that the presence of minor components can affect the pathway of ICDR reactions. Reactions between U- and Cu-bearing fluids and hematite can explain the Cu-U association prominent in some iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that interface coupled dissolution-reprecipitation reactions (ICDR) {{can play a}} key role in scavenging minor elements has been investigated via exploring the fate of U during the experimental sulfidation of hematite to chalcopyrite and the exsolution of chalcopyrite from bornite digenite solid solution (bdss) under hydrothermal conditions. The results of experiments with two kinds of Uranium (U) sources; either as solid UO₂₊ₓ(s) or as a <b>soluble</b> <b>uranyl</b> <b>complex,</b> differed from the U-free experiments. In the reactions from hematite to chalcopyrite under 220 - 300 °C hydrothermal conditions, pyrite precipitated initially, before the onset of chalcopyrite precipitation. In addition, when UO₂₊ₓ(s) was included in the experiments, enhanced hematite dissolution led to increased porosity and precipitation of pyrite+magnetite within the hematite core. However, in uranyl nitrate bearing experiments, abundant pyrite formed initially, before being replaced by chalcopyrite. Uranium scavenging was mainly associated with the pyrite precipitation, as a result that a thin U-rich layer along the original hematite grain surface precipitated out. In the reactions of chalcopyrite exsolution from bdss during annealing under hydrothermal conditions in a solutions nominally containing Cu(I) and hydrosulfide in a pH₂₅°C [°C subscript] ~ 6 acetate buffer, a similar U-rich rim was observed along the original grain when uranyl nitrate as U-source was included in the reactions. The precipitation of uranium was related to the presences of HS- in buffer. Chemical mapping and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy showed the UO₂₊ₓ(s) was the mainly restricted to the U-rich layer. The two sets of experiments demonstrate that the presence of minor components can affect the pathway of ICDR reactions. Reactions between U- and Cu-bearing fluids and hematite or chalcopyrite can explain the Cu-U association prominent in some iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits. In this study, synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) mapping was used to trace the distribution of uranium in natural samples from different geological contexts (sandstone-hosted U-deposit; IOCG) for investigating the deportment of uranium and its paragenesis in the context of thin-section scale textural complexity. It has been confirmed that the enrichment of U occurs via late dissolution-reprecipitation reactions in the bornite ores of the Moonta and Wallaroo IOCG deposits (South Australia), and that the U distribution in the ores of sandstone-hosted U-deposit is complex. Image analysis also revealed a number of new results for other minor elements, e. g. (i) the distribution of μm-sized Pt-rich grains and evidence for Ti-mobility during the formation of schistosity at the Fifield Pt prospect (New South Wales, Australia); (ii) the presence of Ge contained in organic matter and of Hg minerals associated within quartzite clasts in the Lake Frome U ores (South Australia); and (iii) confirmation of the two-stage Ge-enrichment in the Barrigão deposit, with demonstration of the presence of Ge in solid solution in the early chalcopyrite (Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt).

30|$|Literatures have {{reported}} that at acidic pH range (3.5 – 6), the sorption of U generally increased {{in the presence of}} HA which is due to increase in the negative sorption active sites on HA. However, sorption decreases at higher pH (> 6), probably due to formation of <b>soluble</b> <b>uranyl</b> humate <b>complexes</b> species (Pompe et al. 1999). As pH increases, the increased deprotonation makes the HA more negatively charged. This negative charge creates an electrical field which influences the complexation reaction. HA concentration must be high enough to influence the uranium adsorption onto minerals due to the competition from other anionic ligands especially in the slightly acidic to alkaline pH range.|$|R

Uranium and Th lability and solubility were investigated for two sets of soils. The first set (Field soils) consisted of thirty seven soil samples representing five contrasting local ecosystems; the second dataset (BGSc) included 40 soils sub-sampled from the British Geological Survey (BGS) archive. Field soil pore water samples were taken from soil columns held at close to field capacity to measure U and Th solubility and speciation; the effects of time, temperature and reducing conditions on Th and U speciation were investigated. Soils were extracted with foursingle extractants: CH 3 COONH 4, EDTA, 0. 43 M HNO 3 and TMAH to determine their ability to solubilize labile U and Th. Solubility of Th and U varied with soil characteristics, influenced by pH, DOC, DIC and phosphate concentrations. The Kd values for Th and U varied by 4 and 3 orders of magnitude respectively over the range of soils studied. The formation of <b>soluble</b> <b>uranyl</b> carbonate <b>complexes</b> give rise to a strong positive correlation between U and DIC concentrations in soil solutions.

A range of conditions (pH, CO 2 partial pressure, ionic strength) made it possible to quantify the variations in surface speciation. In the resulting set of spectral data (N = 11) the variance is explained by only two components, which represent two structurally different types of surface complexes: (1) a binary <b>uranyl</b> surface <b>complex</b> with a bidentate coordination to edges of Fe(O,OH) 6 octahedra and (2) a <b>uranyl</b> triscarbonato surface <b>complex</b> where one carbonate ion bridges uranyl to the surface.

The obtained {{results show that the}} complex stability is mainly governed by two factors: (i) the maximization of the polarizability of the coordinating ligand and (ii) the minimization of the steric hindrance effects. Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction between ligands and uranium(vi) was found to be a crucial parameter for the complex stability. These results pave the way to the definition of (quantitative) property/structure relationships for the in silico screening of monoamide ligands with improved extraction efficiency of uranium(vi) in nitrate acidic solution...|$|R
40|$|Fast atom {{bombardment}} {{in organic}} matrices of <b>uranyl</b> <b>complexes</b> of several amino acids (AA) and two dipeptides reveals that (i) the coordination sphere can expand {{in the gas}} phase to give pentakis species [UO 2 (AA) (5) ](+); (ii) complete stepwise dissociation of ligands AA occurs; (iii) ligand fragmentation takes place via initial loss of non-ligated-NH 3 + and CH 3 groups, while the carboxy group is retained until the final stage; (iv) clustering of UO 2 groups can give such species as [(UO 2) (x) (AA) ](+); (v) fragmentation of ligated dipeptides occurs mainly via carbon-(amide) nitrogen cleavage, indicating a role of UO 22 + in steering molecular breakdown to give amide- or carboxy-containing fragments...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{absorption}} and luminescence spectra of the uranyl-doped fluorophosphate glasses 75 NaPO(3) - 24. 5 SrF(2) - 0. 5 UO(2) F(2) and 60 NaPO(3) - 24. 5 SrF(2) - 15 LiF- 0. 5 UO(2) F(2) are discussed. The absorption {{spectrum of the}} uranyl ion in glasses shows less fine structure than the spectra of <b>uranyl</b> <b>complexes</b> in solution. The glass samples exhibit a strong luminescence typical for the uranyl ion, and the luminescence spectrum is well resolved. It {{was found that the}} force constant of the vibrations in the ground state is intermediate between that in fluoride and phosphate glasses. During the glass preparation, reduction of uranyl to tetravalent uranium is often observed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{parameters}} of the near-neighbor surrounding of uranium(VI) sorbed onto silica gel and ferrihydrite surfaces have been determined by U LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. The sorption on silica gel was studied at pH 4 with uranium(VI) concentrations {{in the range of}} 5 × 10 − 2 – 2 × 10 − 5 mol/l. Sorption experiments with ferrihydrite have been performed at pH 5. 8 with uranium(VI) concentrations of 10 − 4 and 10 − 5 mol/l and at pH 7. 8 with 10 − 5 mol/l uranium(VI). The structural parameters for the uranium coordination shells (U-Oax, U-Oeq, and U-Si/Fe) indicate formation of inner-sphere, mononuclear <b>uranyl</b> <b>complexes</b> at the silica gel and ferrihydrite surfaces...|$|R
