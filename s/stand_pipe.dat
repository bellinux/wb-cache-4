50|$|In 1887, Eckington {{was bought}} by George Truesdell and his wife Frances, who {{subdivided}} the property, improved it substantially for habitation, sold lots, and built several houses. Truesdell undertook extensive grading operations to level the landscape of his 87 acre Eckington subdivision. He laid down water and sewer pipes, paved streets in asphalt and concrete, and erected a <b>stand</b> <b>pipe</b> near the old Gales house. A steam pump brought water to the <b>stand</b> <b>pipe,</b> which distributed water throughout the new neighborhood. Truesdell erected five “pretty cottages” which, according to an 1888 newspaper account, were “all fitted up as city houses,” with steam heat and hot and cold running water. Eckington was wired for electricity in 1889, two years before electricity was installed in the White House. In three years Truesdell spent $500,000 improving the subdivision.|$|E

50|$|The well, {{spring or}} spout is located below the {{embankment}} of the footpath {{near to the}} River Irvine footbridge and is accessed by concrete slab steps. The well has a plaque recording its name and basic history as installed in 1994 by the Irvine Development Corporation (IDC). A stone-lined culvert carries the outflow down to the River Irvine. The relatively abundant flow comes directly from the ground without any discernible pipe or culvert. The well water is first collected in a concrete cistern and then piped down to the springs exit. Previously a cast iron <b>stand</b> <b>pipe</b> was located at the site and the water could be collected from this for personal use.|$|E
50|$|When a pipe is {{suddenly}} closed at the outlet (downstream), {{the mass of}} water before the closure is still moving, thereby building up high pressure and a resulting shock wave. In domestic plumbing this is experienced as a loud banging resembling a hammering noise. Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is high enough. Air traps or <b>stand</b> <b>pipes</b> (open at the top) are sometimes added as dampers to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.|$|R

50|$|Water has been, by necessity, an {{important}} aspect {{in the development of}} Mount Tabor. From the beginning, shallow lines existed to provide water to residents. However, they had to be drained for the winter for fear of freezing, thus preventing year-round occupancy.

As the years passed, water from the Tabor wells became affected by vegetable matter, and it was found necessary to employ water from township wells. A contract was entered into with Parsippany-Troy Hills Township, and this is how we get our water today. Now the water tower in St. John's park functions only as a reminder of our past.|$|E
