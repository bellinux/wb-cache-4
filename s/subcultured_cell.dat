40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} {{of the role of}} microRNAs (miRNAs) in exacerbating drug resistance of tumours is recently being highlighted as a crucial research field for future clinical management of drug resistant tumours. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify dys-regulations in expression of individual and/or networks of miRNAs that may have direct effect on neuroblastoma (NB) drug resistance. Methods: Individual subcultures of chemosensitive SH-SY 5 Y and UKF-NB- 3 cells were rendered chemoresistant to doxorubicin (SH-SY 5 Y, UKF-NB- 3) or etoposide (SH-SY 5 Y). In each validated chemoresistance model, the parental and <b>subcultured</b> <b>cell</b> lines were analysed for miRNA expression profiling, using a high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) miRNA profiling platform for a total of 668 miRNAs. Results: A unique expression signature of miRNAs was found to be differentially expressed (higher than 2 -fold change) within all three NB chemoresistance models. Four miRNAs were upregulated in the subcultured chemoresistant cell line. Three miRNAs were found to be downregulated in the chemoresistant cell lines for all models. Conclusions: Based on the initial miRNA findings, this study elucidates the dys-regulation of four miRNAs in three separate NB chemoresistant cell line models, spanning two cell lines (SH-SY 5 Y and UKF-NB- 3) and two chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin and etoposide). These miRNAs may thus be possibly linked to chemoresistance induction in NB. Such miRNAs are good candidates to be novel drug targets for future miRNA based therapies against aggressive tumours that are not responding to conventional chemotherapy...|$|E

Prolonged subcultivation of S. multivorans {{in the absence of}} PCE with pyruvate as an electron donor and fumarate as an electron acceptor resulted in a decrease of PCE dehalogenase (PceA) activity.

40|$|Several cytoskeletal {{changes are}} {{associated}} with aging which includes alterations in muscle structure leading to muscular atrophy, and weakening of the microtubule network which affects cellular secretion and maintenance of cell shape. Weakening of the microtubule network during meiosis in aging oocytes can result in aneuploidy or trisomic zygotes with increasing maternal age. Imbalances of cytoskeletal organization can lead to disease such as Alzheimer's, muscular disorders, and cancer. Because many cytoskeletal diseases are related to age we investigated the effects of aging on microtubule organization in cell cultures of the Drosophila cell model system (Schneider S- 1 and Kc 23 cell lines). This cell model is increasingly being used as an alternative system to mammalian cell cultures. Drosophila cells are amenable to genetic manipulations {{and can be used}} to identify and manipulate genes which are involved in the aging processes. Immunofluorescence, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy were employed for the analysis of microtubule organizing centers (centrosomes) and microtubules at various times after subculturing cells in fresh medium. Our results reveal that centrosomes and the microtubule network becomes significantly affected in aging cells after 5 days of subculture. At 5 - 14 days of subculture, 1 % abnormal out of 3 % mitoses were noted which were clearly distinguishable from freshly <b>subcultured</b> control <b>cells</b> in which 3 % of cells undergo normal mitosis with bipolar configurations. Microtubules are also affected in the midbody during cell division. The midbody in aging cells becomes up to 10 times longer when compared with midbodies in freshly <b>subcultured</b> <b>cells.</b> During interphase, microtubules are often disrupted and disorganized, which may indicate improper function related to transport of cell organelles along microtubules.

40|$|When {{telomerase}} {{is absent}} and/or telomeres become critically short, cells undergo a progressive decline in viability termed senescence. The telomere checkpoint model predicts that cells {{will respond to}} a damaged or critically short telomere by transiently arresting and activating repair of the telomere. We examined the senescence of telomerase-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the cellular level to ask if the loss of telomerase activity triggers a checkpoint response. As telomerase-deficient mutants were serially <b>subcultured,</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a progressive decline in average growth rate {{and an increase in}} the number of cells delayed in the G 2 /M stage of the cell cycle. MEC 3, MEC 1, and DDC 2, genes important for the DNA damage checkpoint response, were required for the cell cycle delay in telomerase-deficient cells. In contrast, TEL 1, RAD 9, and RAD 53, genes also required for the DNA damage checkpoint response, were not required for the G 2 /M delay in telomerase-deficient cells.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} Ca 2 +-repletion following depletion on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the rat aorta. With Ca 2 +-repletion, the cells in primary cultures contracted, as indicated by a decrease in cell area. The process was slow (30 min to maximum effect) and reversible (relaxation completed by 120 min). Contraction during Ca 2 +-repletion was never observed in <b>subcultured</b> <b>cells.</b> The SMCs in primary culture after treatment maintained the ability to grow and to exclude dye, with a normal plating efficiency. There was no treatment-related additional leakage of intracellular enzymes, LDH and CPK, into the medium. Ca 2 +-repletion at first accelerated the 45 Ca uptake by SMCs (1 - 5 min after repletion) and then increased Ca 2 + efflux after about 10 min of Ca 2 +-repletion. We conclude that Ca 2 +-repletion after depletion induces a transient and reversible contraction of vascular SMCs in primary culture, without cell injury and in association with a transient increase in Ca 2 + influx and then efflux. This phenomenon may relate to the decrease in perfusion flow in hearts and kidneys during Ca 2 +-repletion after depletion (Ca 2 +-paradox) ...|$|R

The osteoblast phenotype was confirmed by immunohistochemical testing for osteocalcin and substantiated by positive staining of cells for alkaline phosphatase and the matrix materials collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Bone nodules were stained by the von Kossa method and counted. The numbers of nodules produced from osteogenic cells harvested from different skeletal sites were compared {{with the use of}} a mixed linear model. On average, cortical bone sites yielded significantly greater numbers of nodules than did cancellous bone sites. Between cortical bone sites, there was no significant difference in nodule numbers. Among cancellous sites, the radial cancellous bone yielded significantly more nodules than did the tibial cancellous bone. Among appendicular skeletal sites, tibial metaphyseal bone yielded significantly fewer nodules than did all other long bone sites. This study detected evidence of heterogeneity of equine osteogenic cell populations at various skeletal sites. Further characterization of the dissimilarities is warranted to determine the potential role heterogeneity plays in differential rates of fracture healing between skeletal sites.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that cultured human {{articular}} chondrocytes express high levels of 1. 4 kb prepro-enkephalin mRNA. Chondrocytes store met-enkephalin intracellularly and secrete this neuropeptide in mature {{as well as in}} precursor form. Gene expression is inducible by serum factors. High levels of prepro-enkephalin mRNA are detected in proliferating chondrocytes but not in confluent, contact-inhibited cells. Phorbol myristate acetate and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, but not dexamethasone, increase levels of prepro-enkephalin mRNA. Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) upregulate gene expression, whereas retinoic acid, which inhibits chondrocyte proliferation, suppresses both basal and induced gene expression. Using in situ hybridization it is shown that only 1 - 3 % of primary chondrocytes express prepro-enkephalin mRNA, whereas 52 +/- 12 % of <b>subcultured</b> <b>cells</b> are strongly positive. Analysis of DNA synthesis, by autoradiography of incorporated [3 H]thymidine, shows that these numbers correspond to the percentage of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle. In cultures of primary chondrocytes TGF beta promotes the formation of cartilage nodules and stimulates proliferation of adherent cells. This is associated with high levels of prepro-enkephalin mRNA in proliferating cells but not in contact-inhibited cells in cartilage nodules. In contrast, formation of cartilage nodules, proliferation and the expression of enkephalin are suppressed by interleukin- 1 beta. In summary, expression of prepro-enkephalin in human articular chondrocytes is differentially controlled by cartilage regulatory factors and closely associated with cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|As {{several studies}} {{indirectly}} suggest that inhibiting the intracellular breakdown of cyclic nucleotides may inhibit fibrogenesis, {{this study used}} membrane permeable cyclic nucleotide analogues to examine the role of cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways in the regulation of renal fibroblast function. Fibroblasts were isolated by explant outgrowth culture of rat kidneys post unilateral ureteric obstruction. <b>Subcultured</b> <b>cells</b> were exposed to 10 1, 000 muM of the cyclic nucleotide analogues 8 -bromo-cAMP (8 br-cAMP) and 8 -bromo-cGMP (8 br-cGMP). Functional parameters examined included mitogenesis (thymidine incorporation), collagen synthesis (proline incorporation), myofibroblast differentiation (Western blotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin; alpha-SMA) and expression of CTGF (Northern blotting), a TGF-beta(1) -driven immediate early response gene. Serum-stimulated mitogenesis was decreased 27 +/- 4 % by 100 muM 8 br-cAMP (p < 0. 01), 49 +/- 6 % by 1, 000 μM 8 br-cAMP (p < 0. 001) and 43 +/- 7 % by 1, 000 muM 8 br-cGMP (p < 0. 01). 1, 000 μM 8 br-cAMP and 8 br-cGMP reduced basal collagen synthesis by 80 +/- 5 and 60 +/- 21 % respectively (both p < 0. 05). Maximum dose of 8 br-cAMP but not 8 br-cGMP inhibited basal expression of the differentiation marker alpha-SMA by 43 +/- 33 (p < 0. 05), resulted in a more rounded cell morphology and reduced expression of CTGF by 39 +/- 24 % (p < 0. 05). Measurement of mitochondrial activity confirmed that effects were independent of cell toxicity. In conclusion, cyclic nucleotides inhibit fibrogenesis in vitro. Strategies which elevate intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations may therefore be therapeutically valuable in preventing the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts in progressive renal disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} susceptibilities of Legionella pneumophila isolates grown {{either in}} U 937 human monocytic cells or in Acanthamoeba polyphaga were studied after {{release from the}} host cells without further subculture. Time-survival studies showed that exposure of L. pneumophila cells, gown exclusively in vitro, to 5 micrograms of rifampin per ml resulted in at least 99 % killing after 6 h and no detectable survivors at 24 h. Similar rates of killing were observed for in vitro-grown cells tested by exposure to ciprofloxacin. Conversely, time-survival studies revealed that macrophage-grown and amoeba-grown cells were ca. 1, 000 -fold more resistant to the activities of both drugs. Macrophage-grown cells treated with 5 micrograms of rifampin per ml showed 70 and 62 % survival after 6 and 24 h, respectively. Intracellularly grown legionellae were also highly resistant to erythromycin (8 microgram/ml). After 24 h {{of exposure to the}} drug, there was 70 and 60 % survival for amoeba-grown and macrophage-grown legionellae, respectively, whereas in vitro-grown cells showed a 2 -log 10 reduction in viable count. when intracellularly grown L. pneumophila <b>cells</b> were <b>subcultured</b> in broth for 48 h, they reverted to the phenotype characteristic of in vitro growth. Morphologically, the cells were larger than their intracellularly grown counterparts and resistance characteristics were lost. The susceptibilities of the <b>subcultured</b> <b>cells</b> to all three drugs were similar to those of Legionella cells grown exclusively in vitro. In view of these findings, the successful treatment of Legionnaires disease may be related as much to the resistance phenotype induced by intramacrophage growth as to the ability of the antibiotic to enter phagocytic cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to characterize bone cells grown in two culture media, and to determine the effective concentration of OP- 1 on the growth of osteo- 1 <b>cells.</b> <b>Subcultured</b> rat bone <b>cells</b> (osteo- 1) were grown in alpha-modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (alpha-MEM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and total protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity and the formation of mineralized nodules were evaluated after 7, 14 and 21 days. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of rhOP- 1 for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days and compared with an untreated control. Osteo- 1 cells presented a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposits were observed at 21 days. Cells treated with 10 and 20 ng/mL rhOP- 1 for 24 h showed a significant increase in cell viability when compared to control. Osteo- 1 cells cultured on DMEM demonstrated an osteoblastic phenotype as indicated by high alkaline phosphatase activity and the presence of calcified nodules. The results suggest that low concentrations of OP- 1 may promote an osteogenic effect on osteo- 1 cells...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the regulation of}} collagenase- 3 expression in normal, differentiating rat osteoblasts. Fetal rat calvarial cell cultures showed an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity reaching maximal levels between 7 - 14 days post-confluence, then declining {{with the onset of}} mineralization. Collagenase- 3 mRNA was just detectable after proliferation ceased at day 7, increased up to day 21, and declined at later ages. Postconfluent cells maintained in non-mineralizing medium expressed collagenase- 3 but did not show the developmental increase exhibited by cells switched to mineralization medium. Cells maintained in non-mineralizing medium continued to proliferate; cells in mineralization medium ceased proliferation. In addition, collagenase- 3 mRNA was not detected in <b>subcultured</b> <b>cells</b> allowed to remineralize. These results suggest that enhanced accumulation of collagenase- 3 mRNA is triggered by cessation of proliferation or acquisition of a mineralized extracellular matrix and that other factors may also be required. After initiation of basal expression, parathyroid hormone (PTH) caused a dose-dependent increase in collagenase- 3 mRNA. Both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogue, 8 -bromo-cAMP (8 -Br-cAMP), and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate, increased collagenase- 3 expression, while the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, did not, suggesting that PTH was acting through the protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC pathways. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide caused an increase in basal collagenase- 3 expression but blocked the effect of PTH, suggesting that an inhibitory factor prevents basal expression while an inductive factor is involved with PTH action. In summary, collagenase- 3 is expressed in mineralized osteoblasts and cessation of proliferation and initiation of mineralization are triggers for collagenase- 3 expression. PTH also stimulates expression of the enzyme through both PKA and PKC pathways in the mineralizing osteoblast. Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Prostaglandin production, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and 5 ′-nucleotidase were {{measured}} in porcine aortic endothelial cells in situ (with a multiwell template on an opened aorta), in primary culture and in subcultures. Changes during culture were monitored {{and the effects}} of culture conditions were investigated by growing cells on a biological matrix or on plastic, by adding different sera to the growth medium, and by harvesting cells enzymically or mechanically. Prostacyclin production by endothelium in primary culture is highest immediately after cell isolation and subsequently declines; this pattern is repeated each time the <b>cells</b> are <b>subcultured.</b> The level at which production stabilises is ∼ 200 pgċ 106 cells− 1 ċh− 1. Detaching cells by physical means stimulates production much more than enzymic dispersion; the type of serum or the presence of a biological matrix does not alter prostaglandin production. The relative amount of prostaglandin E produced increases with time, from ∼ 20 % of the prostacyclin production shortly after isolation to > 100 % in <b>subcultured</b> <b>cells.</b> None of the culture conditions that we tested altered this trend. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity decreases during primary culture, but activity can be sustained by including homologous serum (from whole blood or from platelet-free plasma) in the culture medium. The method of harvesting cells, or the presence of a matrix, did not affect enzyme activity. 5 ′-Nucleotidase also declines during culture, with a progressive decrease in both Km and Vmax from template to primary culture to subcultures. None of the variations in culture conditions prevented this change. Ectoadenosine-deaminase activity, not detectable in cultured cells, can be measured in the template. Part of this activity was released by the vascular wall and could be due to plasma diffusing from the interstitial space...|$|R
