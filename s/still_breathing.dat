25|$|When {{the battle}} was ended it became evident what boldness and {{resolution}} had pervaded Catiline's army. For almost every man covered with his body, when life was gone, the position which he had taken when alive {{at the beginning of}} the conflict. A few, indeed, in the centre, whom the praetorian cohort had scattered, lay a little apart from the rest, but the wounds even of these were in front. But Catiline was found far in advance of his men amid a heap of slain foemen, <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> slightly, and showing in his face the indomitable spirit which had animated him when alive.|$|E
25|$|There's {{no way he}} didn't see her, {{since she}} was {{practically}} looking into the cabin. At one stage, he turned around toward the building. The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was <b>still</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gators scored just 63 seconds {{into the}} game with a {{touchdown}} pass from Danny Wuerffel to Ike Hilliard. Wuerffel would have 3 touchdown passes in all, but the day belonged to Jacquez Green. In the 3rd quarter, Green took a punt back for a touchdown. On Kentucky's next possession, they would punt again and Green, who was <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> heavy from his first return, weaved his way for another score. In all, the Gators amassed over 300 return yards from punts and kickoffs. Fred Taylor made his season debut with 45 yards on six attempts.|$|E
60|$|He {{gathered}} {{her in his}} arms; her heart beat; she <b>still</b> <b>breathed,</b> and presently he {{realized that she had}} but swooned.|$|R
60|$|Baxter grew pale, {{thinking}} {{he had gone}} too far. But he soon discovered that Jerry <b>still</b> <b>breathed,</b> and then he felt relieved.|$|R
50|$|Oxygen hood: This {{is a clear}} {{box that}} fits over the baby’s head and {{supplies}} oxygen. This is used for babies who can <b>still</b> <b>breathe</b> but need that extra oxygen.|$|R
25|$|Around 10:30p.m. MST, the {{supervisor}} for the contractor running the site (Combustion Engineering) {{and the chief}} health physicist arrived. They entered the reactor building around 10:45 pm and found two mutilated men soaked with water: one clearly dead (Byrnes), the other moving slightly (McKinley) and moaning. With one entry per person and a 1-minute limit, a team of 5 men with stretchers recovered the operator who was <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> around 10:50; he did not regain consciousness and died of his head injury at about 11 p.m. Even stripped, his body was so contaminated that it was emitting about 500 R/hr. Meanwhile, the third man was discovered about 10:38 p.m., impaled to the ceiling. With all potential survivors now recovered, safety of rescuers took precedence and work was slowed to protect them.|$|E
25|$|In October 1944, Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig), a Jewish–Hungarian {{prisoner}} in the German extermination camp Auschwitz, {{works as a}} Sonderkommando member. Amongst other duties, he must salvage valuables from the clothing of the dead, drag their bodies from the gas chambers and scrub the floors immediately afterwards. He performs these daily tasks with a stoic, impassive expression, seemingly having been numbed by the daily horrors. One day, following the gassing, he comes upon {{the body of a}} boy who is somehow <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> after having been gassed. From a distance, Saul witnesses a Nazi physician methodically suffocate the boy to ensure his death then call for an autopsy. Saul impulsively comes forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Miklós (Sándor Zsótér), who he learns is a fellow prisoner and Hungarian. He is able to convince Miklós to not perform the autopsy as he intends to give the boy a proper Jewish burial, for which he needs a rabbi. He goes to Rabbi Frankel (Jerzy Walczak), who refuses and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.|$|E
25|$|The suspects' {{mobile phones}} and {{personal}} computers contained multiple video {{recordings of the}} murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen {{lying on his back}} in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video. The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.|$|E
50|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} {{with the second}} catalog number of Eulogy, however it was released prior to EUL001 (Bird of Ill Omen's Self, Dare You <b>Still</b> <b>Breathe?),</b> due to production delays on par with it.|$|R
60|$|But then, {{looking at}} him again, she fancied he <b>still</b> <b>breathed,</b> and, hastily {{fetching}} some water from the nearest fountain, she sprinkled it over his face, and, to her great delight, he began to revive.|$|R
6000|$|... "He breathes!" [...] {{she said}} huskily, but hastily. [...] "God be praised, Mordaunt, he <b>still</b> <b>breathes.</b> The blow {{may not be}} as heavy as we at first supposed; let us {{do what we can to}} aid him." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{childhood}} friend of Manning's, speaking about a conversation they had when Manning was 13, said: [...] "he {{told me he}} was gay." [...] The friend also said that Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced. She and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma. Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting {{in the back of the}} car trying to make sure their mother was <b>still</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|E
500|$|Anastasia's {{supposed}} {{escape and}} possible survival {{was one of}} the most popular historical mysteries of the 20th century, provoking many books and films. [...] At least ten women claimed to be her, offering varying stories as to how she had survived. Anna Anderson, the best known Anastasia impostor, first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922. She contended that she had feigned death among the bodies of her family and servants, and was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> and took sympathy upon her. Her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts, where it was officially filed. The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess.|$|E
2500|$|And why, Gasparoli asked, {{does the}} caller seem {{reluctant}} to touch Hedgepeth's body despite repeated pleas from the dispatcher {{to at least}} see if she is <b>still</b> <b>breathing?</b> If Rosario {{was not able to}} bring herself to do so, could she not have asked Rangel to do so? [...] "I have often thought," [...] Gaparoli wrote," [...] if it was , that she didn't call 9-1-1 the moment she first saw [...]" ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{women and}} thralls {{came in and}} drew out the wounded and those who <b>still</b> <b>breathed</b> from among the dead, taking them to the temple. They bore away the body of Ospakar also, but they left the rest.|$|R
5000|$|Bird of Ill Omen's first release, Self, Dare You <b>Still</b> <b>Breathe?</b> was {{recorded}} in 1997. It was a new heavy genre that would later become known as metalcore. The intro to [...] "Sharpshooter" [...] uses elements from the film Trainspotting.|$|R
50|$|Snouts {{returns to}} the surface to Merliah, who has been searching for her necklace. Merliah can <b>still</b> <b>breathe</b> underwater, so she follows Snouts to the trench and frees Kylie from the whirlpool. Kylie is {{grateful}} to Merliah and promises to help her stop Eris.|$|R
2500|$|A {{text message}} was sent out Friday evening September 26 by Jim Condit Jr., the Constitution Party {{candidate}} for Ohio's 8th congressional district {{and a close}} friend who had been traveling with Traficant to help promote Project Freedom USA. The text message stated that [...] "the machines were disconnected at 2:00 p.m. (Friday). He is <b>still</b> <b>breathing.</b> Thousands are praying." [...] On September 27, 2014, Traficant died at a hospice in Poland, Ohio, aged 73. By September 29, Traficant's body had been buried in an undisclosed location after the family had a private funeral, and announced {{that there would be}} no public funeral for him.|$|E
2500|$|Considered {{to be more}} {{emotional}} than the lead single, [...] "Still Breathing" [...] is characterized as a [...] "serious" [...] track. Armstrong intended to make others happy, {{and to make a}} difference, by getting people to recognize themselves in the song. He described the track as [...] "a very heavy song", and further explained, [...] "Sometimes I run away from being too heavy. But sometimes it just comes out that way." [...] While commenting on the chorus, I'm <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> on my own, he added, [...] "at some point, we're all {{going to have to be}} on life support. As time goes on, your thoughts get darker." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{this time}} the cloud base had become lower and no {{helicopter}} could get near but several search teams on foot, with Beattie and Paisley included, converged on {{the location of the}} catastrophic bivouac through snow sometimes waist deep. The bodies of six children and the assistant were dug out, one from a depth of [...] All were dead except the last person to be uncovered, a boy, who was <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> so he was cared for by a doctor from the Braemar MRT on his first serious call-out. At 15:00 a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter arrived, guided by the leader of the RAF Kinloss MRT walking ahead firing flares, and the surviving boy was airlifted to Raigmore Hospital where he and Davidson eventually recovered. Some of the instructors from Glenmore Lodge had been out for twenty hours so in the darkness the deceased had to be left on the hill to be brought down the next day.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. The series begins, then, on {{the west}} side, with the Creation of Man. It is not the {{beginning}} of the story of Genesis; but the simple assertion that God made us, and <b>breathed,</b> and <b>still</b> <b>breathes,</b> into our nostrils the breath of life.|$|R
60|$|He <b>still</b> <b>breathed.</b> The girl {{lifted up}} {{his head and}} covered him with wild kisses. Raphael looked round for water; found a spring and a broken sherd, and bathed the wounded man's temples till {{he opened his eyes}} and showed signs of {{returning}} life.|$|R
60|$|With {{the escape}} of the Arabs the great apes had turned their {{attention}} to their fallen comrades. One was dead, but another and the great white ape <b>still</b> <b>breathed.</b> The hairy monsters gathered about these two, grumbling and muttering after the fashion of their kind.|$|R
2500|$|After the shooting, {{recordings}} of police radio communications during the event were {{released by the}} Snohomish County Police Staff and Auxiliary Services Center after requests for public records. A timeline was also provided by Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux. According to the timeline and recordings, an anonymous 9-1-1 caller, using a cellphone, first alerted police to the shooting. The school resource officer was the first law enforcement officer {{to make contact with}} the victims, arriving at the scene a minute after the first 9-1-1 call was received. He immediately reported that a fire alarm was going off and that there were students and staff evacuating from the building. A dispatcher then informed him about a report of a possible shooting in the cafeteria. The officer responded, [...] "Ocean 12, it's confirmed. We have a shooter. We have five down." [...] He later said, [...] "Shooter is DOA [...] We have got apparently four [...] " [...] Soon afterward, he said, [...] "Ocean 12, I need aid here. I have two that are <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> and alive. Looks like I have three possibly deceased." [...] The first paramedics arrived on the scene ten minutes after the first radio dispatch.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{perpetrators}} returned, both [...] "walking with a swagger" [...] {{to where}} McIlwaine waited downhill from the parked car with Burcombe. McIlwaine {{at that moment}} made an attempt to run away but Brown, Dillon, and Burcombe {{caught up with him}} as he fell to the ground. Brown gave him a severe kicking, mostly in the head. Dillon produced a butcher's knife and cut McIlwaine's throat while Brown shouted encouragement and Burcombe overlooked the scene from about five feet away. Brown and Dillon left McIlwaine <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> on the ground; once they were back inside the car, Brown proposed to drive the car over his head, but Dillon dissuaded him. Brown halted the vehicle, took the knife and walked back over to where McIlwaine was lying on the road making a [...] "wheezing" [...] sound. Brown stabbed McIlwaine repeatedly in the face and chest. When he noticed that McIlwaine appeared to be looking up at him, Brown stabbed him deeply in his left eye; the wound penetrated his brain, killing him. According to Burcombe's later testimony, Brown appeared [...] "crazed" [...] as he handed the knife back to Dillon and said he was [...] "buzzing"; he subsequently went on to recount stabbing McIlwaine in the eye. He threatened to cut Burcombe's throat or kill a member of his family if he told anyone what happened.|$|E
60|$|A {{group of}} disheveled men and women, <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> heavily, were shaking hands all around.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{difficulty}} {{has occurred}} to me," [...] answered Ramiro. He made a sign, whereon Simon seized Elsa's wrists, and Black Meg, slipping behind her, deftly fastened a handkerchief {{over her mouth}} in such fashion that she was gagged, but could <b>still</b> <b>breathe</b> through the nostrils.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} a week Sophy {{fell into}} a long sleep, so quiet and still, that I several times leaned over her to see that she <b>still</b> <b>breathed.</b> This sleep the doctors said was the crisis of her illness, and upon the state in which she woke {{depended}} her life and reason.|$|R
60|$|The lad rambled on, {{his voice}} growing weaker and weaker and finally ceasing. The hand which had clasped Betty's so closely {{loosened}} its hold. His eyes closed. Betty {{thought he was}} dead, but no! he <b>still</b> <b>breathed.</b> Suddenly his eyes opened. The shadow of pain was gone. In its place shone a beautiful radiance.|$|R
60|$|Liza lay <b>still,</b> <b>breathing</b> very quietly, {{her eyes}} closed. The doctor kept {{his fingers on}} her pulse.|$|E
60|$|Solomon, having assured {{himself that}} the party in the {{perambulator}} was <b>still</b> <b>breathing,</b> crossed his legs and lit his pipe.|$|E
6000|$|The sergeant-major {{suddenly}} became {{conscious of the}} nightgown. [...] "I’ve been—for a little walk," [...] he said, <b>still</b> <b>breathing</b> hard. [...] "I felt a bit chilly—so I—put this on." ...|$|E
50|$|Jerome Corbet died in 1598 and {{was buried}} in the family chapel at Moreton Corbet parish church on 30 July. There is no {{memorial}} but an apparently contemporary portrait survives. He is shown dressed in contemporary fashion, with a Latin motto in the top left corner of the painting: Dum spiro spero - While I <b>still</b> <b>breathe,</b> I hope.|$|R
60|$|A hasty {{examination}} {{showed that}} {{only two of}} the attacking party <b>still</b> <b>breathed.</b> None of those who had fallen above survived, so fiercely and deadly had been the blows struck by Hossein and Tim. Charlie himself had cut down one and shot another, before he fell, slashed in many places, just as Hossein bounded through his assailants.|$|R
60|$|With a {{start and}} a great sigh of doubt she {{recognised}} him. Was it a vision? Was he dead? She dragged herself to him upon {{her hands and knees}} and listened for his breathing, if perchance he <b>still</b> <b>breathed</b> and was not a wraith. Then it came, strong and slow, the breath of a man in deep sleep.|$|R
