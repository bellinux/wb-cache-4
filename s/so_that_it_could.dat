5|$|The DCIEM 1983 {{decompression}} {{model is}} a decompression calculation model rather than a physiological model.

5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian forces to the occupation forces that were sent to Germany {{as part of the}} post war settlement <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> begin the repatriation of the AIF early. Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was appointed Director-General of Repatriation and Demobilisation and oversaw the process in Britain, while Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel took charge of the efforts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|However it was {{not until}} the Wujing Zongyao that the exact {{chemical}} formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder: one for an explosive bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for chemical warfare.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, US Congress {{appropriated}} $23,000 {{to rebuild}} the Cape Florida lighthouse and work was completed in 1847. In 1861, Confederate militants sabotaged the lighthouse <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not guide Union sailors during the blockade of Confederate Florida. The lighthouse was repaired and re-lit again in 1866. In 1878 the Cape Florida Light {{was replaced by the}} Fowey Rocks Light, seven miles (11km) southeast of Cape Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to module-specific equipment, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm, a robotic arm which, after the module had docked {{to the core}} module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node. The arriving module's docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be pivoted 90° for docking {{to one of the}} four radial docking ports.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, starting Sunday, 22 June 1941, during World War II. The operation stemmed from Nazi Germany's ideological aims to conquer the western Soviet Union <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be repopulated by Germans, to use Slavs as a slave-labour force for the Axis war-effort, and to seize the oil reserves of the Caucasus and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories.|$|E

5|$|Population and {{commercial}} activity grew rapidly after India gained independence in August 1947. The only link across the Hooghly River, the Howrah Bridge, between Howrah and Kolkata, {{was subject to}} much traffic congestion, with over 85,000 vehicles every day. This necessitated planning for a new bridge across the river <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> connect to the major cities of Mumbai (Bombay), Delhi and Chennai (Madras) through the national highways located close to the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 2/6th Independent Company flew {{in to the}} Markham Valley from Port Moresby in 13 USAAF C-47 Dakotas, {{making a}} {{difficult}} landing on a rough airstrip. Unaware that a much larger Japanese force was also headed for Kaiapit, the company attacked the village on 19 September to secure the area <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be developed into an airfield. The company then held it against a strong counterattack. During two days of fighting the Australians defeated a larger Japanese force while suffering relatively few losses.|$|E
5|$|The Mk VIII {{was also}} {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} another plan known as the Carrier Wing; in this plan flying surfaces, such as wings, would be fitted to the Mk VIII <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be towed by a transport aircraft and then glide into battle in support of airborne forces. The plan was dropped, however, after the prototype crashed after it had taken off.|$|E

5|$|The canal had a lock at Thorne {{and another}} where it joined the River Trent at Keadby.

5|$|The salvage {{party were}} {{suspicious}} of Keseberg's story, {{and found a}} pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> one day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E

5|$|A major {{capital works}} program was also {{undertaken}} to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, {{which has been}} the main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime.|$|E

Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone, allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> fall under the new law.|$|E
