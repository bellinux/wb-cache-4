30|$|Manufacturing {{firms are}} subject to rapid {{technological}} changes and a constant need to innovate more quickly and in more novel ways compared to their competitors. Considering the firm’s capacity, selecting the appropriate innovation activity is important for achieving product innovation. We investigated the effects of technology-exploration, specifically customer involvement, outsourcing R&D, external networking, and inward IP licensing, on product innovation in Korean manufacturing SMEs. Product innovation performance is measured as radical and incremental innovation to gauge the degree of the novelty of product innovation. Our results show that technology exploration is crucial regarding whether a low or {{a higher degree of}} novelty is achieved in product innovation in manufacturing <b>SMEs.</b> <b>Customer</b> involvement has a positive impact on both incremental and radical innovation. Outsourcing R&D has a positive impact on only radical innovation. Other practices have no impact on either incremental or radical innovation.|$|R

40|$|The Competition Committee debated {{retail banking}} in October 2006. Competition {{can improve the}} {{functioning}} of the retail banking sector without harming prudential regulation. The efficient functioning of the sector is important for economic performance. The sector is considered special primarily because of externalities related to potential “contagion” effects stemming from (i) the withdrawal-upondemand characteristic of some bank deposits and (ii) the role banks play in the payment system, and (iii) the fact that banks are important for the funding of consumers and <b>SMEs.</b> <b>Customer</b> mobility and choice is essential to simulate retail-banking competition. An important observation is that the degree of customer mobility is low and the longevity of customer-bank relationships is long. Financial information sharing platforms should therefore be promoted and, where limited by privacy laws, privacy laws should be modified in a way that maintains the goal of protecting privacy while also allowing consumers to receive the benefits of credit ratings. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} key success factor for <b>SME</b> <b>customers</b> of cloud based Business Intelligence products. A deep interview was made with four producers and a questionnaire was carried out among 36 SMEs.
