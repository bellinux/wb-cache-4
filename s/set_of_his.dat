5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E
5|$|It {{was on the}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{first major}} film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called The Return of the Thin White Duke. He was also {{composing}} music on the understanding {{that he was to}} provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.) Director Nicolas Roeg warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.|$|E

25|$|Assembling a {{comprehensive}} Jacques Brel discography is difficult, because his recordings {{have been released}} {{in so many different}} permutations, in different countries and in different formats. Furthermore, releases of Brel's recordings are sometimes known by different titles. This discography is restricted to Brel's original albums, as collected and reissued on 23 September 2003 in the sixteen CD box <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work Boîte à Bonbons, plus the additional album Chansons ou Versions Inédites de Jeunesse, which was released {{for the first time as}} part of this box set. The titles listed here are the titles used in the box set. To mark the 25th anniversary of Brel's death, Barclay Records issued Comme quand on était beau (2003), a 3 volume DVD collection of Brel interviews and live performances as well as the compilation album Infiniment (2004). Both releases include five previously unpublished songs that Brel wrote in 1977: La Cathédrale, L'Amour est mort, Mai 40, Avec Élégance, and Sans Exigences.|$|E

The shock of the day came as former World No. 1, 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open champion, and now 75th-ranked Marat Safin took out ATP No. 3, 2007 Wimbledon semifinalist and reigning Australian Open champion Novak Djoković in straight sets, winning 6–4, 7–6(3), 6–2, after two hours of play. Twenty-first seed Juan Carlos Ferrero also left the tournament, retiring due to a neck injury in the third <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> second round against Halle doubles champion Mischa Zverev, and fifteenth seed and French Open quarterfinalist Fernando González lost a close encounter to Italian Simone Bolelli, on the score of 7–6(8), 7–6(7), 3–6, 7–6(4).|$|E

25|$|A play {{is thus a}} {{path through}} the tree from the root to a {{terminal}} node. At any given non-terminal node belonging to Chance, an outgoing branch is chosen according to the probability distribution. At any rational player's node, the player must choose one of the equivalence classes for the edges, which determines precisely one outgoing edge except (in general) the player doesn't know which one is being followed. (An outside observer knowing every other player's choices up to that point, and the realization of Nature's moves, can determine the edge precisely.) A pure strategy for a player thus consists of a selectionchoosing precisely one class of outgoing edges for every information <b>set</b> (<b>of</b> <b>his).</b> In a game of perfect information, the information sets are singletons. It's less evident how payoffs should be interpreted in games with Chance nodes. It is assumed that each player has a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function defined for every game outcome; this assumption entails that every rational player will evaluate an a priori random outcome by its expected utility.|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, The Big Four {{were the}} top four seeds at a Grand Slam tournament {{for the first time}} since 2014. Nadal was the first to exit in the 4th round, {{suffering}} a second defeat to Gilles Muller who had previously defeated Nadal in 2005's Wimbledon in the 2nd round. Struggling with a hip injury, Murray then followed in the quarter-finals, losing to Sam Querrey, who had beaten Djokovic the previous year. Djokovic retired in the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> quarter-finals match against Tomas Berdych, citing arm injury. Federer, however, advanced to the Wimbledon final without dropping a set and won the Wimbledon title in straight sets against Marin Čilić. Federer's Wimbledon victory was a record-historic 11th Wimbledon final and a record-breaking 8th title win. This meant the Big Four being the ATP top four again.|$|E
