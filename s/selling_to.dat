5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For {{the first few years}} of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is {{tasked with}} winning the Scranton White Pages account. However, the CEO is a woman, and Dwight has trouble <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> women. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E
5|$|Now the Visitation {{allowed for}} an {{inventory}} of what the monasteries possessed, and the visiting commissioners claimed to have uncovered sexual immorality and financial impropriety amongst the monks and nuns, which became the ostensible justification for their suppression. The Church owned between one-fifth and one-third {{of the land in}} all England; Cromwell realised that he could bind the gentry and nobility to Royal Supremacy by <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> them the huge amount of Church lands, and that any reversion to pre-Royal Supremacy would entail upsetting many of the powerful people in the realm. For these various reasons the Dissolution of the Monasteries began in 1536 with the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act, affecting smaller houses—those valued at less than £200 a year. Henry used the revenue to help build coastal defences (see Device Forts) against expected invasion, and all the land was given to the Crown or sold to the aristocracy. Whereas the royal supremacy had raised few eyebrows, the attack on abbeys and priories affected lay people. Mobs attacked those sent to break up monastic buildings. Suppression commissioners were attacked by local people in several places. In Northern England there were a series of uprisings by Roman Catholics against the dissolutions in late 1536 and early 1537.|$|E
50|$|Most states {{follow a}} three-tier {{system in which}} {{producers}} cannot <b>sell</b> directly <b>to</b> retailers, but must instead <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> distributors, who in turn <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> retailers. Exceptions often exist for brewpubs (pubs which brew their own beer) and wineries, which are allowed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> their products directly to consumers.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet attack outraged Americans, {{with some}} {{businesses}} refusing <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> supplies <b>to</b> the Soviet regime. Responding {{to a call}} from a manufacturer who refused <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> the aggressor, the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce compared his objections to [...] "refusing <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> a man because he beats his wife".|$|R
50|$|Buzzinbees's {{distribution}} channel is very specific: it <b>sells</b> <b>to</b> independent software vendors and equipment providers, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> directly <b>to</b> operators.|$|R
25|$|Many brokers do {{not offer}} short <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> small private investors. LEPOs can serve as an equivalent, while {{contracts}} for difference (CFDs) offered by third-party providers are another alternative.|$|E
25|$|Wells and Verne {{both had}} an {{international}} readership and influenced writers in America, especially. Soon a home-grown American science fiction was thriving. European writers found more readers by <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> the American market {{and writing in}} an Americanised style.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s and the Great Depression years, Americans {{began to}} {{support the idea of}} public {{ownership}} of utilities, particularly hydroelectric power facilities. The concept of government-owned generation facilities <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today.|$|E

50|$|Market {{allocation}} or {{market division}} schemes are agreements in which competitors divide markets among themselves. In such schemes, competing firms allocate specific customers or types of customers, products, or territories among themselves. For example, one competitor {{will be allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to,</b> or bid on contracts let by, certain customers or types of customers. In return, {{he or she will}} not <b>sell</b> <b>to,</b> or bid on contracts let by, customers allocated to the other competitors. In other schemes, competitors agree <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> only <b>to</b> customers in certain geographic areas and refuse <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to,</b> or quote intentionally high prices to, customers in geographic areas allocated to conspirator companies.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Airbus became {{increasingly}} interested {{in developing and}} <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> the military aviation market. It embarked on two main fields of development: aerial refuelling with the Airbus A310 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) and the Airbus A330 MRTT, and tactical airlift with the A400M.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war when}} DAKS clothes were {{announced}} to start <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> the public again queues {{of people would}} form down Piccadilly, to which Simpson tailors would measure them in line and present suitable pairs of trousers {{to them when they}} got into the Simpsons of Piccadilly store.|$|E
25|$|The Newlin {{family owned}} the mill until 1817, <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> William Trimble, Jr. Thomas Newlin, {{who died in}} 1811, had {{remarried}} after his wife's death. Disagreements between his two sets of children resulted in a judgment of $11,326.30 against his estate, forcing {{the sale of the}} mill.|$|E
50|$|Retailers {{that operate}} both in brick-and-mortar and {{ecommerce}} must {{decide on a}} daily basis how to allocate inventory to their stores as part of their merchandise planning processes. These decisions are integral for retailers because they directly affect how their customers interact with their merchandise, and therefore, their brand. The decisions that these strategies help make are what <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> where <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it, when <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it, who <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it <b>to,</b> and how much <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b> The various assortment strategies most commonly used by retailers and the benefits of using them are explored below.|$|R
50|$|In certain supply chains, where a {{manufacturer}} <b>sells</b> <b>to</b> a wholesale distributor, and the distributor in turn <b>sells</b> <b>to</b> a reseller, {{the use of}} SRP is used to denote Suggested Reseller Price. In that case, the list price is used to convey manufacturer suggested retail price.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 and 1980, Bill Veeck made overtures to Denver interests. An {{agreement}} was reached <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr., who pledged to keep the club in Chicago. His offer was turned down by the owners. Veeck was forced <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> a different investment group.|$|R
25|$|The central Chinese government, a large {{buyer of}} {{high-tech}} products, in 2009 proposed controversial policies demanding that companies <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> it promote Chinese innovation {{and that the}} products sold are free of foreign intellectual property. The most controversial parts were later withdrawn but local Chinese governments continue to use procurement to encourage indigenous innovation.|$|E
25|$|East Ohio Gas Company (EOG) was {{incorporated}} on September 8, 1898, {{as a marketing}} company for the National Transit Company, the natural gas arm of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. The company launched its business by <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> consumers in northeast Ohio gas produced by another National Transit subsidiary, Hope Natural Gas Company.|$|E
25|$|There are {{typically}} {{two kinds of}} Chinese organizations operating in Africa: firms transforming African resources in which the bosses, managers, and technicians are Chinese, the workers are African, and the customers are Europeans, Americans, and Japanese; and firms <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> African markets in which the bosses and managers are Chinese, the sellers are Chinese, and the customers are African.|$|E
25|$|What {{are now the}} {{traditional}} public retail markets found in Mexico {{were the result of}} efforts to regulate and replace tianguis with more modern forms of commerce. The first regulatory step came in 1580, when grain producers were prohibited from <b>selling</b> directly <b>to</b> the market. Instead, they were required <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> the colonial government, which then stored the grains in large warehouses called pósitos or alhóndigas <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> the general market.|$|R
50|$|Owner Bill Veeck {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> {{the club}} <b>to</b> Ed DeBartolo, but {{the offer was}} turned down by the other owners. Veeck was then forced <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> a different investment group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn.|$|R

25|$|In public statements, Goldman {{claimed that}} it shorted simply to hedge {{and was not}} expecting the CDOs to fail. It also denied that its investors were unaware of Goldman's bets against the {{products}} it was <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> them. There were intricate links between a Goldman Sachs trader, Jonathan M. Egol, synthetic collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O., ABACUS, and asset-backed securities index (ABX).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the United Nations panel, the company responded in January 2015 {{that they were not}} currently <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> Sudan. In a follow-up exchange, HackingTeam asserted that their product was not controlled as a weapon, and so the request was beyond the scope of the panel. There was no need for them to disclose previous sales, which they considered confidential business information.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} accusations and counter-accusations between Russia and Georgia {{regarding}} illegal arms <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> Chechen separatists. Russia alleged that Chechen separatists received weapons through illegal networks going to Chechnya through Georgia and Azerbaijan. On the other hand, Georgia accused Russia of corruption on military bases, poor security infrastructure and low professionalism among Russian troops as {{the reasons behind}} the spread of illegal weapons.|$|E

25|$|In 1863, Smith and Chaffee {{sold their}} mill. They {{purchased}} and developed the Bobtail Mine near Black Hawk; the Gregory Mine in Teller County; and other mines. They held the properties {{for about a}} year before <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> a Rhode Island mining consortium (retaining a small interest). For many years, the Bobtail remained one of the greatest gold producers in Colorado. Late in 1863, Smith's third child, Nellie, was born.|$|E
25|$|Kovel is anti-capitalist and anti-{{globalization}}, seeing globalization {{as a force}} {{driven by}} capitalism – in turn, the rapid economic growth encouraged by globalization causes acute ecological crises. He believes that capitalist firms {{have to continue to}} generate profit through a combination of continually intensifying exploitation and <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> new markets: this means that capitalism must grow indefinitely to exist, which seems impossible on a planet of finite resources.|$|E
25|$|Under a {{sales tax}} system, only {{businesses}} <b>selling</b> <b>to</b> the end-user are required to collect tax and bear the accounting cost of collecting the tax. Under VAT, manufacturers and wholesale companies also incur accounting expenses to handle the additional paperwork required for collecting VAT, increasing overhead costs. Manufacturers and wholesalers {{have a choice of}} retaining less profits overall, or passing on the additional cost to their customers in the form of increased prices.|$|E

50|$|Businesses face {{important}} decisions regarding what <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> when <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> <b>to</b> whom <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> {{and for how}} much. Revenue management uses data-driven tactics and strategy {{to answer these questions}} in order to increase revenue. The discipline of revenue management combines data mining and operations research with strategy, understanding of customer behavior, and partnering with the sales force. Today, the revenue management practitioner must be analytical and detail oriented, yet capable of thinking strategically and managing the relationship with sales.|$|R
