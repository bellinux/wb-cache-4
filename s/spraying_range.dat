A fluorescent tracer {{was added to}} the paint and deposition of the tracer on clothing and uncovered parts of the skin was assessed using video imaging and processing techniques. A container (volume 36 m 3) was sprayed with a colourless laquer (varnish) containing 66. 7 mg/l fluorescent whitening agent. All painters sprayed the outside of the container. Nine painters repeated the painting a second time and five also sprayed the inside of the container. The painters wore white Tyvek ä coveralls, but no gloves. Duration of <b>spraying</b> the outside <b>ranged</b> from 4 to 21 min with a mean of 10 min and the amount of paint <b>sprayed</b> <b>ranged</b> from 3. 0 to 12. 8 l (mean 6. 6 l).

40|$|The {{introduction}} of herbicide-resistant crops and postemergence herbicides {{with a wide}} action spectrum shifted the research focus from how to when crops should be treated. To maximize net return of herbicide applications, the evolution of weed–crop competition over time must be considered and its effects quantified. A model for predicting the yield trend in relation to weed removal time, considering emergence dynamics and density, was tested on data from glyphosate resistant soybean grown in cropping systems in Italy and Argentina. Despite an ample variation of weed emergence dynamics and weed load in the four trials, the model satisfactorily predicted yield loss evolution. The estimated optimum time for weed control (OTWC) varied from about 18 d after soybean emergence in Argentina to 20 to 23 d in Italy, with time windows for <b>spraying</b> <b>ranging</b> from 14 to 28 d. Within these limits a single glyphosate application ensures good weed control at low cost and avoids side effects like the more probable unfavorable weed flora evolution with double applications {{and the presence of}} residues in grains.

40|$|The spray {{performance}} of a fuel injection system applicable for use in main combustion chamber of an oxidizer-rich staged combustion (ORSC) cycles is presented. The experimental data reported here include mean drop size and drop size distribution, spray cone half-angle, and momentum rate (directly related to spray penetration). The maximum entropy formalism, MEF, method to predict drop size distribution is applied and compared to the experimental data. Geometric variables considered include the radius of the injector inlet orifice plate through which oxidizer flows (&) and the exposed length from the fuel inlet to the injector exit plane (L 2). Operating conditions that were varied include the liquid mass flow rate and air mass flow rate. For orifices B and C {{there is a significant}} dependence of D 3 Z on both the air and liquid mass flow rates, as well as on L 2. For the A orifice, the momentum rate of the air flow appears to exceed a threshold value above which a constant D 32 is obtained. Using the MEF method, a semi-analytical process was developed to model the spray distribution using two input parameters (q = 0. 4 and Dso). The momentum rate of the spray {{is directly related to the}} air and liquid mass flow rates. The cone half angle of the <b>spray</b> <b>ranges</b> from 25 to 17 degrees.

40|$|The {{strawberry}} crop shares {{some problems}} resulting from being horticultural crop cultivated on modelled and mulched lands, with narrow planting layouts, which reduce {{the types of}} machines available: hand held equipment (spray guns, spray booms, etc), or “cannon” distribution system. These sprayers produce both qualitative (uniform distribution of pesticide on and within the vegetation, ground losses) and quantitative (volume/ha; timeliness) problems. The aim {{of this paper is}} focused on the results of simulated treatment tests carried out in tunnels on strawberry crops with follow up analysis of the leaf deposits made using colorimetric techniques. Tests were made using the following hand held equipment: spray gun and two nozzle boom, connected with a hose to an hydraulic sprayer; furthermore an air assisted sprayer equipped with tangential cannon was used. Relating to hand held equipment, leaf deposits result from: a) the equipment characteristics and its positioning relative to target; b) operator velocity exchange during the treatment; c) position of the sampled leaves. Relating to cannon sprayers, leaf deposits show low capacity of penetration of the spray inside the vegetation and the need to adjust the length of the tunnel to the <b>spray</b> <b>range.</b> Finally, the ground losses are always higher than the leaf deposits, also in the case of localized treatments (carried out with the spray gun and the boom segment) owing to excess volumes/ha as regards to the effective needs of the cultivation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} turbulent spray jets and flames of acetone where the atomization condition at the jet exit plane can be varied by maintaining a constant mass loading, such that the <b>spray</b> <b>ranges</b> from dilute to moderately dense. The flow configuration is a hybrid of designs by Meares and Masri [1] and Gounder et al. [2] in that a piloted spray jet is generated using a needle that may be translated within a surrounding stream of co-flowing air. The burner geometry allows for a versatile control of the spray inlet conditions without changing the global Weber number or bulk jet Reynolds number, offering isolated control of key variables leading to spray flame stabilization. Time averaged photographs along with microscopy and laser/phase Doppler anemometry of the spray have revealed some initial characteristics of the burner, showing the evolution of droplet velocity fields and droplet sizes {{as a function of}} recession distance for both non- reacting and reacting conditions. Similar to Meares and Masri [1] the global blow-off limit reduces as the fuel injecting needle is brought closer to the burner exit plane. However, this is not only {{due to the lack of}} premixing and increased inhomogeneity, but also due to the lack of atomization and evaporation. This burner, in conjunction with recently published work from the same group [3] will form part of an extensive database for the understanding of the effects of atomization, evaporation, inhomogeneity and turbulent mixing on the stabilization of spray flames. 12 page(s...|$|R

From 2004 to 2007, we evaluated sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as a wetting agent during controlled outdoor cage and flight pen tests in Colorado and small-scale field tests at urban blackbird roosts in Missouri. In the outdoor cage tests (ambient temperature - 5 to 2 ° C), mortality of male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) sprayed with 1, 2, and 5 ml of SLS on the back feathers only, on the breast feathers only, or on both breast and back feathers ranged from 25 % to 100 %. A SLS spray on male red-winged blackbirds at 2 ° C ambient temperature with 1 ml of SLS sprayed on breast feathers and back feathers resulted in 90 % mortality in less than 60 minutes. In a flight pen test (- 12 to - 5 ° C ambient temperature), SLS sprayed at 20 l per 3, 400 l of water with a single ground-based sprinkler-head system over 35 male red-winged blackbirds roosting in cedar trees (Juniperus virginiana) resulted in 53 % mortality. There was no mortality in the control group exposed to the same treatment without the SLS. Small-scale field tests conducted in Missouri at 6 sites with a single ground-based sprinkler-head spray system and at 2 sites with 4 sprinkler-head spray systems resulted in mortality that ranged from 0 to 4, 750 and 4, 500 to 15, 000 blackbirds and starlings, respectively. Spray operations lasted from 28 to 208 minutes. Each spray covered about 200 m 2. At all sites, mortality of blackbirds sprayed with the SLS occurred as soon as 30 minutes post-SLS application. Mortality at two sites where pump problems precluded completing the <b>spray</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0 to 800 birds.

40|$|In this paper, {{we design}} and {{evaluate}} the proposed geographic-based spray-and-relay (GSaR) routing scheme in delay/disruption-tolerant networks. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, GSaR is the first spray-based geographic routing scheme using historical geographic information for making a routing decision. Here, the term spray means that {{only a limited number of}} message copies are allowed for replication in the network. By estimating a movement range of destination via the historical geographic information, GSaR expedites the message being <b>sprayed</b> toward this <b>range,</b> meanwhile prevents that away from and postpones that out of this range. As such, the combination of them intends to fast and efficiently spray the limited number of message copies toward this <b>range</b> and effectively <b>spray</b> them within <b>range,</b> to reduce the delivery delay and increase the delivery ratio. Furthermore, GSaR exploits delegation forwarding to enhance the reliability of the routing decision and handle the local maximum problem, which is considered to be the challenges for applying the geographic routing scheme in sparse networks. We evaluate GSaR under three city scenarios abstracted from real world, with other routing schemes for comparison. Results show that GSaR is reliable for delivering messages before the expiration deadline and efficient for achieving low routing overhead ratio. Further observation indicates that GSaR is also efficient in terms of a low and fair energy consumption over the nodes in the network...|$|R

Apart from aerial spraying, mosquito control is mainly achieved by agricultural sprayers (pickup – ATV or manually mounted mist blowers). As spraying applications may lead to variable performance, a specif-ic research program was designed in order to simultaneously assess spray deposition and biological efficacy. This study {{was a part of}} the overarching project (Life + Integrated Mosqui-to Control Management - LIFE 08 /ENV/F/ 000488). Four mist blowers were tested (Martignani B 748 – Tifone City 300 (ATR- TVI nozzles) – Swingtec Mobilstar – knapsack mist blower with AU 8000 rotary nozzle) as used for larvicide application. 22 tests were conducted including 3 repetitions for each equipment setup. BTi (Bacillius Thuringiensis Israelensis) was applied with an application volume of 8 to 12. 5 L/ha including 1 to 2. 5 L/ha of BTi Vectobac WG® or Aquabac XT® respectively. Each tank mix contained about 1 g/L of Brillant SulfloFlavine (BSF) dye tracer. Deposition values at different distances were calculated after tracer content measurement. 3 Petri dishes (f 8 cm) were used to collect ground deposits and placed around a jar including 25 mosquito larvae (Aedes Aegypty L.) for biological control. Alive lar-vae were counted immediately after application, 24 h and 48 h after application. Average deposition in 3 Petri dishes was compared with alive larvae at different distances and for each kind of equipment. 30 collecting plots placed on a 10 m x 10 m grid leading to 5 lines of 4 plots located at 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 m from the application path. A central line of collectors placed every 5 m was used from 55 to 90 m. Applications were realized downwind as advised by mosquito control operators at 8 km/h for vehicle mounted sprayers and 4 km/h for hand op-erated sprayer. Individual performance of each sprayer (i. e. efficient <b>spray</b> <b>range)</b> was com-pared to others and to manufacturer indications.

40|$|When a {{pesticide}} {{is applied}} {{a proportion of}} the sprayed solution may become a cause of pollution in the surrounding environment, with ecotoxicological implications and phytotoxicity to other crops. In many countries buffer zones along field edges are recommended to shield surface waters, and hedgerows {{can play an important}} role in reducing pesticide risk. This study focuses on droplet drift, with the aim of evaluating the hedgerow efficacy in reducing drift from broadcast air-assisted sprayers and then to construct a simple model for estimating the spray drift level in surrounding fields. Three experiments were conducted in North-East Italy in 2004 and 2005, in winter, summer and autumn to obtain suitable optical porosity values in order to evaluate their effects. Three study situations (no hedgerow, single, double hedgerow) and two sprayer–hedgerow interaction scenarios (sprayer working perpendicular to or parallel with the hedgerow) were considered. Hedgerows were 7 – 8 m in height, while <b>spray</b> release height <b>ranged</b> from 1 to 2 m. The sampling method proved to be effective, with more than 73 % of total amount sprayed being intercepted. Where there was at least one hedgerow, off-site <b>spray</b> reductions <b>ranged</b> from 82. 6 (with optical porosity of 74. 7 %) to 97 % (with optical porosity of 10. 8 %). The presence of a double hedgerow did not produce a higher interception rate. Analysis of the spatial pattern of drift showed that where there is a hedgerow with an optical porosity of 74 – 75 %, the aerial drift caused by common broadcast air-assisted sprayers becomes negligible at a distance of 6 – 7 m. Hedgerows thus proved to be effective in intercepting spray drift leaving cultivated fields. In particular, low optical porosities provided high interception rates, even with very dense canopies, as no spray bypass was recorded. Spray drift profile was then modelled taking into account the effect of wind and optical porosity of a nearby hedgerow. A negative-exponential model is proposed. The model fits the experimental data quite satisfactorily and may be used to estimate spray drift magnitude in relation to wind speed and optical porosity of any hedgerow crossed by a droplets cloud spray drift...|$|R

Hematite mineral in the inorganic fraction of the atmospheric particles was found predominantly {{in the vicinity of the}} iron and steelmaking industries, which most likely originates from raw materials handling and process emissions. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of detoxifying enzymes (glutathione-S-transferases (GST), mixed-function oxidases (MFO), and esterases (EST)) {{and the presence}} of insensitive variants of target proteins (sodium channel and acetylcholinesterase) were examined in individual male and female codling moths. Twenty-nine populations from 11 countries and two laboratory strains were examined. Populations were classified as either unsprayed or <b>sprayed.</b> The <b>ranges</b> of enzyme activities across field populations varied 15 -fold, 485 -fold and fourfold for GST, MFO and EST, respectively. MFO was the only enzyme whose activity differed in 1 binomial classification of orchards based on their spray history. Few differences in enzyme activities were found due to sex among populations; and, in these cases, males had higher GST and lower MFO and EST activities than females. Activities of the three enzymatic systems across all Populations were positively correlated. Populations from Greece, Argentina and Uruguay had significant percentages of moths with elevated GST and MFO activities. The co-occurrence of moths expressing both elevated MFO and low EST activities was found in conventional orchards from the Czech Republic and France. Chile was the only Country where Populations from treated orchards did not include a significant proportion of individuals with enhanced enzyme activity. The kdr mutation was found at significant levels in ten Populations from five countries, including all French and Argentinean populations. The mutation in AChE was only detected in the Spanish Population...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{spray and}} plant architecture model (Dorr et al. 2008) {{was used to}} determine the influence of droplet properties on the distribution of pesticides after spray application. The distribution of the spray was influenced by wind speed, release height, droplet size, <b>spray</b> sheet velocity, <b>range</b> of droplet size generated from a nozzle, liquid density and ∆T. Fan angle, flowrate, amount of active ingredient, surface tension, viscosity and splash parameter (K) did not {{have a significant effect on}} the modelled spray distribution. Increasing the splash parameter (droplets are more likely to splash on impact increased the number of droplets on the plant surface without significantly reducing the total spray volume on the canopy. This indicates that when droplet splash on impact, many of the smaller droplets generated are distributed on other parts of the plant canopy and hence increase coverage...|$|R
40|$|A stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) evaluation was undertaken on HP 9 Ni- 4 Co- 0. 20 C steel {{in support of the}} Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) program. This alloy was tested in plate, bar, and ring forging forms. Several heat treating procedures yielded ultimate tensile strengths ranging from 1, 407 to 1, 489 MPa (204 to 216 ksi). The test environments were high humidity, alternate immersion in 3. 5 -percent NaCl, and 5 -percent salt <b>spray.</b> Stress levels <b>ranged</b> from 25 to 90 percent of the yield strengths. The majority of the tests were conducted for 90 days. Even though the specimens rusted significantly in salt spray and alternate immersion, no failures occurred. Therefore, it can be concluded that this alloy, in the forms and at the strength levels tested, is highly resistant to SCC in salt and high humidity environments...|$|R
40|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) of DDT is used {{to control}} visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India. However, the quality of spraying is severely compromised {{by a lack of}} affordable field assays to monitor target doses of insecticide. Our aim was to develop a simple DDT insecticide quantification kit (IQK) for monitoring DDT levels in an operational setting. DDT quantification was based on the stoichiometric release of chloride from DDT by alkaline hydrolysis and detection of the released ion using Quantab chloride detection strips. The assay was specific for insecticidal p,p`-DDT (LoQ = 0. 082 g/m 2). Bostik discs were effective in post spray wall sampling, extracting 25 - 70 % of active ingredient depending on surface. Residual DDT was sampled from walls in Bihar state in India using Bostik adhesive discs and DDT concentrations (g p,p`-DDT/m 2) were determined using IQK and HPLC (n = 1964 field samples). Analysis of 161 Bostik samples (pooled sample pairs) by IQK and HPLC produced excellent correlation (R 2 = 0. 96; Bland-Altman bias = - 0. 0038). IQK analysis of the remaining field samples matched HPLC data in identifying households that had been under <b>sprayed,</b> in <b>range</b> or over <b>sprayed.</b> A simple dipstick assay has been developed for monitoring DDT spraying that gives comparable results to HPLC. By making laboratory-based analysis of DDT dosing accessible to field operatives, routine monitoring of DDT levels can be promoted in low- and middle- income countries to maximise the effectiveness of IRS...|$|R
40|$|For {{the period}} of the last 20 years, {{cockchafer}} grubs have caused in Europe considerable losses in plant production and forestry. Until recently, pest grubs were controlled with carbamate or organophosphorus insecticides applied into soil. Presently, after environmental regulatory implementation which disallow application of soil-applied insecticides control of adult cockchafers have gained more recognition. The aim of the study carried out during cockchafer swarming in mixed stands with oak (Quercus robur) was to evaluate the efficacy of insecticide treatments using aircraft and ground equipment to control Melolontha melolontha and M. hippocastani with Mospilan 20 SP at a rate 0. 4 kg/ha. In 2007, helicopter sprays at a rate 5 l of working solution/ha were performed in the Forest District Spała (central Poland). In 2001, insecticide treatments at a rate 200 l of working solution/ha were applied with a tractor sprayer in the Forest Districts Spała and Smardzewice (central Poland). Treatment efficacy was evaluated 3 weeks after insecticide application by assessment of defoliation degrees in sprayed and not sprayed trees with the use of LIŚĆ (LEAF) computer software. Regardless the form of treatment application, observed leaf damage on <b>sprayed</b> trees <b>ranged</b> from 0. 2 – 1. 75 %, while leaf damage on not sprayed trees was 86 – 95 %. The results obtained will be used in the registration procedure of Mospilan 20 SP as the insecticide for the protection of oaks against cockchafers. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
40|$|Pyrethrum {{is derived}} from the dried flowers of the plant Tanacetum cinerariifolium. The name given to the active insecticidal {{components}} of the dried flowers is "pyrethrins". Tasmanian pyrethrum production is among the most innovative, high-tech agricultural industries in the world. With an output that nearly quadrupled since 1996, Botanical Resources Australia (BRA) now supplies more then 30 % of the global pyrethrum markets. Developments such as vacuum precision direct seeding allowed dramatic expansion in the total area planted to pyrethrum which is now ~ 3, 000 ha. Using new generation cutter rower the flower is dried, pelletised and extracted. Initially the hexane extracted dark, treacly crude pyrethrum extract was exported to be refined overseas. BRA designed, built and commissioned a refinery in Tasmania during 1999. This environmental friendly process involving carbon dioxide was cutting edge technology. BRA is currently commissioning a new large-scale multi-purpose hexane extraction plant. The unique solvent-propellant properties of liquid carbon dioxide (CO 2) were the basis for the BOC global patent. This patent described Pestigas as a non-flammable, high-pressure (5, 000 kPa) aerosol <b>spray</b> (droplets <b>range</b> 2 - 20 µ) with natural pyrethrins as the quick knockdown, wide spectrum, non-residual and low mammalian toxicity insecticide. The non-flammable, liquid CO 2 solvent-propellant is recycled from by-product industrial processes. The small droplet size range (2 - 20 µ) of the particles formed results in the pyrethrins being suspended for ~ one hour. The Pestigas system treats the total space with low ppm levels of insecticide and the reformulated product is now being developed by Crop & Food Research, NZ for "organic" quarantine treatment of NZ export fruit & vegetables. ...|$|R
