Because mesocrystals {{are made up}} of nanoparticles, the properties of the nanoparticles themselves are, in some cases, passed to the whole mesocrystal structure. This allows for the practical application of mesocrystals because they are [...] "potentially more stable analogues of nanoparticulate materials." [...] High porosity is generally a quality of mesocrystals, this is the property shared with mesoporous materials. Closed, internal pores are good for thermal and dielectric insulation and the open pores then aid in absorption and could be utilized for medical delivery. Alternatively, a mesocrystal could have its pores filled and then it would be similar to a <b>single-crystal</b> <b>material</b> and have some unusual electronic and optical properties. The diversity of the properties of mesocrystals could allow them to be effectively utilized in many applications.|$|E

Ceramics use barium titanate, lead-zirconate-lead-titanate, lead metaniobate, and other materials whose composition is considered proprietary by the company responsible for their development.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the field}} of micromechatronics, microrobotics and {{specially}} microfactories, active materials are used in most cases. They permit high resolution and distributed actuation. In this area, Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys (MSMA) are possible candidates. If a lot of studies deal with MSMA, only few applications use them until now. MSMA are attractive active materials because they have large strain (about 10 %) as the classical shape memory alloys (SMA), but can provide a 100 times shorter time response. The main disadvantages of MSMA based actuators are the brittleness of the <b>single-crystal</b> <b>material,</b> the difficulty to apply the strong magnetic field required to obtain sufficient strain and the nonlinear behaviour. We propose in this paper a novel MSMA based actuator changing the disadvantage of the hysteretic behaviour into an advantage. This device is a push-pull actuator: two pieces o...|$|E
30|$|Material damping can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{fundamental}} damping and internal friction[6]. The former is a set of mechanisms (thermoelastic damping, phonon-phonon interactions, and phonon–electron interactions) that set the ultimate lower limit on damping. These mechanisms have their origin in the electronic, atomic, and molecular structure of materials, and operate even in the idealized limit of perfectly engineered devices (for example, high-quality <b>single-crystal</b> <b>materials</b> with negligible defect density). Internal friction refers to damping caused by the irreversible motion of crystallographic defects (for example, vacancies, divacancies, interstitial atoms, substitutional atoms, surface adatoms, edge dislocations, screw dislocations, grain boundaries, phase boundaries, layer boundaries, and precipitates) [4], and each type of defect can give rise to several mechanisms of dissipation [5].|$|R

Ultrasonic motors also offer arbitrarily largerotation or sliding distances, while piezoelectric actuators are limited by the static strain that may be induced in the piezoelectric element.|$|R
30|$|With {{the method}} of MD simulation, Koh and Lee [18] studied the strain-rate effects on the tensile {{structure}} of platinum nanowire. Meanwhile, they [19] gave the mechanical behaviors of gold and platinum nanowires under different strain rates, which indicated that the displayed crystalline-ordered deformation of the nanowires was governed by {{the formation of a}} main dislocation plane at low strain rate. Ikeda et al. [20] proposed amorphization in nickel nanowire induced by high strain rate. These studies indicate strain-rate effects on the deformation of the single-crystal metallic nanowires. For the <b>single-crystal</b> <b>materials,</b> we noticed that the plastic response in copper could occur rapidly [21, 22]. According to this point, studying the deformation and breaking failure of the copper single-crystal nanowires shall be of vital importance for developing and processing the nanoscale systems based on metallic nanowires. In addition, anisotropies in <b>single-crystal</b> <b>materials</b> will give rise to the dependence of crystallographic orientation. For example, Tsuru and Shibutani [23] showed copper had a much larger anisotropic factor than aluminum in terms of the load-depth relation and stress distribution. Bringa et al. [24] proved single-crystal copper had a marked anisotropic behavior in shock wave propagation. It is known that crystallographic orientation is related with structural anisotropy and symmetric stretching at different strain rates will generate different mechanical shocks, but we do not know which factor will dominate the deformation and the breaking failure mechanism of the nanowires? In order to make the question clear, we focused on the MD simulation investigation of the tensile deformation and breaking failure of the single-crystal copper nanowires under the effects of crystallographic orientation and strain rate.|$|R

However the occurence of parasitic decomposition in the gas phase was pressure dependent and has been virtually eliminated by the use of low pressure.

40|$|The {{problem of}} calculating {{expected}} component life under fatigue loading conditions {{is complicated by}} the fact that component loading histories contain, in many cases, cyclic loads of widely varying amplitudes. In such a case a cumulative damage model is required, in addition to a fatigue damage criterion, or life relationship, in order to compute the expected fatigue life. The traditional cumulative damage model used in design is the linear damage rule. This model, while being simple to use, can yield grossly unconservative results under certain loading conditions. Research at the NASA Lewis Research Center has led to the development of a nonlinear cumulative damage model, named the double damage curve approach (DDCA), that has greatly improved predictive capability. This model, which considers the life (or loading) level dependence of damage evolution, was applied successfully to two polycrystalline materials, 316 stainless steel and Haynes 188.
