The businessmen bought the US dollars from the Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods. This meant that American manufacturers would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same amount of US currency they would have received for selling their goods on the free market, while South Vietnamese importers could get twice as much goods for the same money.

According to a police officer standing near the affected area, the seats hadn't been installed {{in time for the}} fire marshal to inspect them. The NFL scrambled almost until kickoff to find replacement seats. Eventually, 850 fans in four sections were relocated, while 400 fans in two sections were given a refund equivalent to three times the face value of their ticket. The latter set of fans were later offered the chance to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench, but would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> triple refund. Some of these fans were still upset, since they had spent thousands on airfare and hotels. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that when the league decided to relocate the 850 fans, it lost any shot of setting the attendance record.|$|E
