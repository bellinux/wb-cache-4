One signal line has continuously variable phase shifter driven by reversible <b>stepmotor.</b> Each of two transponders on dish is a dipole with mixer crystal between elements.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transport}} of vortices in superconductors with regular arrays of asymmetric pinning wells when applying an alternating electrical current. We show that this system can induce a net rectifying or diode effect for the vortex motion, including collective stepmotor-type dynamics, where many vortices move forward a controlled and exact number of pin-lattice-spacings at each cycle of the AC driving force. This results in a remarkable net DC response with striking sawtooth-type oscillations. This system provides an experimentally realizable <b>stepmotor</b> of quanta and a precise control of the motion of vortices. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transport}} of vortices in superconductors with regular arrays of asymmetric pinning wells when applying an alternating electrical current. The asymmetric traps are modelled by the superposition of two interpenetrating square lattices of weak and strong pinning centers with separation smaller than the lattice constant. We show that this system can induce a net rectifying or diode effect for the vortex motion, including collective step-motor-type dynamics, where many vortices move forward a controlled and exact number of pin-lattice spacings at each cycle of the ac driving force. This system exhibits a remarkable net dc response with striking sawtooth-type oscillations. The net dc voltage response V-dc of the ac-driven vortices versus both the half period P and the amplitude F-L of the "square wave" ac drive has been detailed in the present work. The influence of the equilibrium thermal noise, the shift between the two pinning sublattices, the degree of translational and orientational disorder, {{and the size of}} the simulation system on the V-dc response of the vortex motion at ac drive has also been addressed. Devil staircase and Arnold's tongue structures are revealed. We also analytically derive all the key features of our numerical results. This system provides a very controllable <b>stepmotor</b> for the control of collective motion. Our results apply mutatis mutandis to arrays of Josephson junctions, colloidal systems with optical traps, Wigner crystals, and any system with repelling movable objects that can be pinned by a lattice of traps. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The superconducting radio {{frequency}} photoinjector (SRF photoinjector) with Cs 2 Te cathode {{has been successfully}} operated under the collaboration of HZB, DESY, HZDR, and MBI. [1] In order to improve the gradient of the gun cavity and the beam quality, a new modified SRF gun (SRF-gun 2008) has been designed. The main updates of the new cavity design for the new photoinjector were publisched before. (ID THPPO 022 on the SRF 09 Berlin.) This cavity is being fabricated in Jefferson Lab. In this paper the new ideas of the further parts of the SRF-gun 2008 will be presented. The most important issue is the special design of half-cell and choke filter. The cathode cooler is also slightly changed, which simplifies {{the installation of the}} cathode cooler in the cavity. The next update is the separation of input and output of the liquid nitrogen supply, for the purpose of the stability of the nitrogen pressure as well as the better possibility of temperature measurement. Another key point is the implementation of the superconducting solenoid inside the cryomodule. The position of the solenoid can be accurately adjusted with two <b>stepmotors,</b> which are thermally isolated to the solenoid itself...|$|R
