40|$|Abstract Background Most {{lymphoma}}s {{that involve}} the tonsil are large B cell lymphomas. Large B-cell lymphoma {{is a high}} grade malignancy which progresses rapidly. Tonsillar lymphoma usually presents as either a unilaterally enlarged palatine tonsil or as an ulcerative and fungating lesion over the tonsillar area. <b>Small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (SLL) of the Waldeyer's ring are uncommon. Case presentation We report a 41 -year-old male who presented with a ten-year history of snoring. Physical examination revealed smooth bilateral symmetrically enlarged tonsils without abnormal surface change or cervical lymphadenopathy. Palatal redundancy and a narrowed oropharyngeal airway were also noted. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 66 per hour, and severe obstruction sleep apnea (OSA) was suspected. No B symptoms, sore throat, odynophagia or dysphagia was found. We performed uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) and pathological examination revealed incidental <b>small</b> B-cell <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (SLL). Conclusion It is uncommon for lymphoma to initially present as OSA. SLL is an indolent malignancy and {{is not easy to}} detect in the early stage. We conclude that SLL may be a contributing factor of OSA in the present case. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the usefulness of}} proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p 53 protein expression and transformed lymphocyte count (TLC) as adjunctive tests to differentiate indolent small B-cell lymphoma from large cell lymphoma in fine needle aspiration biopsies. STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates of lymphoproliferative disorders from April 1993 to January 1997 were reviewed. The percentage of TLCs was determined on the Papanicolaou smear. The percentage and intensity of p 53 and PCNA immunocytochemical staining was evaluated on cell block sections. These results were compared and correlated with the final diagnoses based on available morphology, flow cytometry and clinical history. RESULTS: There were 40 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 12 reactive lymph nodes. Adequate cell blocks were available on 16 large cell lymphomas, 7 grade 1 - 2 follicular center cell lymphomas, 6 mucosal associated lymphoid tissue <b>lymphomas,</b> 2 <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and 2 mantle cell lymphomas. Average TLC and p 53 nuclear staining was highest in large cell lymphomas (57 % TLC and 24 % p 53), followed by grades 1 and 2 follicular lymphomas (14 % TLC and 15 % p 53) and lowest in other indolent lymphomas (< 10 % TLC and < 1 % p 53). Average PCNA staining was highest in large cell lymphomas (46 %) and lowest in <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (7 %); however, TLC was the best parameter for differentiating large cell lymphoma from indolent small B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: TLC differentiated large cell lymphoma from indolent small B-cell lymphoma better than either p 53 or PCNA alone or in combination.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of B-cell lymphoma (BCL) is often {{dependent on the}} detection of clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain expression. In some BCLs, the determination of clonality based on Ig light chain restriction may be difficult. The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} utility of flow cytometric analysis of surface Ig heavy chain (HC) expression in lymphoid tissues in distinguishing lymphoid hyperplasias from BCLs, and also differentiating various BCL subtypes. HC expression on B-cells varied among different types of hyperplasias. In follicular hyperplasia, IgM and IgD expression was high in mantle cells while germinal center cells showed poor HC expression. In other hyperplasias, B cell compartments were blurred but generally showed high IgD and IgM expression. Compared to hyperplasias, BCLs varied in IgM expression. <b>Small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> had lower IgM expression than mantle cell lymphomas.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the experience of}} the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG) with the frozen-section immunoperoxidase phenotyping of 162 cases of B-lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The authors used a panel of 13 different markers with varying degrees of specificity for B lymphocytes and B-cell neoplasms. All lymphomas were classified according to the International Working Formulation. Several antibodies, including anti-immunoglobulin, B 1, Leu 12, and Leu 14 were B-cell-specific markers that were generally pan-reactive. Several other monoclonal antibodies, however, were selectively reactive with subpopulations of B-cell lymphomas. Three "selective-B" antigens (BA 1, p 24, CALLA) were found on about half of the B-cell lymphomas tested, while another three (HB 31, transferrin receptor, C 3 d receptor) were found on about two-thirds of the lymphomas tested. Leu 1 reacted with 18 % of the B-cell <b>lymphomas,</b> particularly the <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> When the reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was compared with the histologic classification, two important points became apparent. First, with the large panel of antibodies, there was tremendous phenotypic diversity even among histologically similar tumors. Second, however, not all possible combinations of antibody phenotypes were encountered. That is, clusters of antigenic phenotypes were seen, and these phenotypes correlated to some degree with the histologic diagnosis of the tumor. <b>Small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> and follicular <b>lymphomas</b> tended to be phenotypically distinct, although there was some overlap. Intermediate- and high-grade lymphomas were phenotypically more diverse. The more common phenotypes of lymphomas encountered could not be reconciled with any simple linear scheme of neoplastic B-cell differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is a {{relatively}} rare B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that {{is considered to be}} the tissue equivalent of the much more common entity chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cutaneous manifestations of <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> are infrequent and the literature regarding them sparse. We describe here a case of a patient with a history of <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> who developed perniosis-like features of the digits. Case presentation: An 86 -year old male patient with previously diagnosed <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> developed painful erythematous swelling of the periungual area of his fingers and toes.

It has been suggested that the increased mitotic activity of lymphocytes observed in sarcoidosis, favours their malignant transformation.

40|$|Immunophenotyping by {{flow cytometry}} and frozen-section {{immunoperoxidase}} was compared on 21 consecutive {{lymph node biopsy}} specimens, of which a diagnosis of lymphoma was made for 11 specimens. Samples for flow cytometry were obtained by a fine-needle aspiration technique. Concordance between frozen-section immunoperoxidase and flow cytometry for all routine markers on all specimens ranged from 76 to 100 %. In general, B-cell markers showed poorer concordance than T-cell markers, with kappa and lambda light chains having the poorest concordance, at 76 % each. Flow cytometry was significantly more sensitive (90 versus 30 %; P < 0. 006) and had a significantly higher negative predictive value (100 versus 63 %; P < 0. 006) than frozen-section immunoperoxidase for demonstrating light-chain restriction. There {{was no significant difference}} in the specificities (100 versus 91 %) or positive predictive values (100 % each) between the two methods. Both methods demonstrated characteristic immunophenotypes for intermediate cell <b>lymphomas,</b> <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas. Frozen-section immunoperoxidase and flow cytometry appear to be significantly concordant methods for immunophenotypic analysis of lymph node biopsies.

CD 99 was positive in all T-lymphoblastic lymphomas and in 60 % of B-lymphoblastic lymphomas. Majority of T and NK cell lymphomas were negative for CD 99, except anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). Eight of 15 cases (54 %) of ALCLs reacted with anti CD 99 antibody. Seven of 10 (70 %) ALK positive ALCLs expressed CD 99, whereas only 1 of 5 (20 %) ALK negative ALCLs were positive. Of the mature B-cell lymphomas, 5. 4 % (2 / 37) of diffuse large B cell lymphomas and 11. 1 % (2 / 18) of Burkitt's lymphomas expressed CD 99. In conclusion, CD 99 is infrequently expressed in mature B and T cell lymphomas, except ALK-positive ALCL.

In the affected lymph node, it was observed an effacement of the normal architecture by neoplastic lymphocytes and it was noted the presence of neoplastic invasive epithelial islands.

Cluster analysis of nuclear profile parameters, including nuclear area, circularity factor, and chromatin distribution pattern, distinguished 3 groups. Each group was characterized by the preponderance of certain nuclear profile types, i. e. (a) small, rather regular (roundish) and dark staining (typical <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and immunocytomas); (b) small to intermediate size, rather regular (roundish) and pale staining (small to intermediate size variant); or (c) small to intermediate size, irregular, rather pale staining (diffuse follicular small cleaved cell (centrocytic) lymphomas and, probably, polymorphous immunocytomas). Group 3 was clearly distinct from the rest, but groups 1 and 2 also differed significantly. Every case displayed a mixture of the 13 registered nuclear profile types. Lymphoid cells with similar nuclear profile features occurred in B cell zones of non-neoplastic lymph nodes. Frequency distribution of nuclear profile parameters significantly differed from one lymphoma group to another. However, there were considerable overlaps.

Although this translocation involving the paired homeobox- 5 (PAX 5) gene at chromosome band 9 p 13 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene at 14 q 32 has been described in ∼ 50 % of LPL cases, the actual number of cases studied is quite small. Many of the initial cases associated with t(9; 14) (p 13;q 32) were actually low-grade B-cell lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation other than LPL. Thus, we analyzed a series of low-grade B-cell lymphomas for PAX 5 gene rearrangements. We searched records from the Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center for low-grade B-cell lymphomas, with an emphasis on plasmacytic differentiation, that had available paraffin blocks or frozen tissue. We identified 37 cases, including 13 LPL, 18 marginal zone lymphomas (nodal, extranodal, splenic, and α-heavy chain disease), and 6 <b>small</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> A novel dual-color break-apart bacterial artificial chromosome probe was designed to flank the PAX 5 gene, spanning previously described PAX 5 breakpoints, and samples were analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization.

40|$|The {{plethora of}} classifications for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and {{controversy}} regarding {{the merits of}} the individual classification schemes has led to the articulation of an International Working Formulation for NHL classification by a working group sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. This classification is based on both architectural and cytologic features and has been shown to have clinical relevance, but it is not an immunologic approach. With the use of frozen sections and both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, a comprehensive immunohistologic study was made of 564 biopsy specimens 1) for determination of the utility of the principle of monoclonality in differentiating benign from malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, 2) for definition of the immunohistochemical phenotypes of histologically benign and malignant cellular proliferations, and 3) for evaluation of the immunologic phenotype of 257 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas classified by the International Working Formulation. Two hundred seven "reactive benign" lymphoproliferations demonstrated polyclonal immunostaining. Monoclonal kappa light chain immunostaining was demonstrated in 3 of 4 cases classified as atypical hyperplasia, two of which had coexistent NHL or subsequently developed overt NHL. Frozen tissue sections were found to be essential for demonstration of immunoglobulin and glycoprotein membrane antigens. The results of immunohistochemical studies were readily integrated with the International Formulation.

With a population of 1, 297 NHL cases and 1, 946 controls, we have performed a two-stage case/control association analysis of 446 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the genetic variation in 81 DNA repair genes. We found the most significant association with NHL risk in the ATM locus for rs 227060 (OR = 1. 27, 95 % CI: 1. 13 – 1. 43, p = 6. 7761025), which remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing.

Three of 28 cases (one in the stomach and two in the small intestine) had cytologic features consistent with centrocytoid cell lymphoma of the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue and were large cell lymphomas. Immunophenotypically, 23 cases expressed B-cell markers (82. 1 %) and three cases reacted with T-cell markers. Two cases did not react with either T-cell or B-cell markers. True histiocytic lymphomas were not identified. Gastric lymphomas (nine cases) and colorectal lymphomas (three cases) were of B-lymphocyte origin whereas T-cell lymphomas were noted in the small intestine (two cases) and ileocecal region (one case). Three cases of centrocytoid lymphoma were of B-lymphocyte origin. Histologically B-cell lineage lymphomas were evenly distributed on various histologic subtypes but all T-lineage lymphomas belonged to the large cell type. The two cases with undetermined phenotype were lymphoblastic lymphomas histologically. This study showed that the primary GIT lymphomas, mostly of B-cell lineage, were not cytomorphologically distinctive from the nodal lymphomas. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
