5|$|In 1817, a steam packet service {{started to}} run between Driffield and Hull. Three return trips each week were made, but the journey times were too long, and an {{advertisement}} in 1825 indicated that the engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence. Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in a directory of Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters of oats, 19,396 quarters of barley and 4,555 <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck. A regular carrier also operated between the Leven Canal and Hull once a week.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington {{was curious}} {{about the price of}} {{potatoes}} and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E
5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill. Johnson would carry two <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill. He gave the extra money he earned {{to the family of}} the sick man until he was able to return work.|$|E

5|$|On defense, Virginia Tech's Torrian Gray led all {{defenders}} with 12 total tackles. Second was Nebraska's Mike Minter, who had 11 {{tackles and}} a pass breakup. Two Nebraska players had nine tackles apiece, {{and one of}} those players, Octavious McFarlin, recorded two tackles for loss. Nebraska recorded three <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> Jim Druckenmiller, while the Virginia Tech defense was unable to sack Scott Frost. The Hokies did manage seven tackles for loss, compared to Nebraska's five.|$|E
5|$|Wool {{and hides}} were the major exports {{in the late}} Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the {{earliest}} period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> wool and 36,100 leather hides. The disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341–42 to 1342–43 to 2,450 <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> wool and 17,900 hides. The trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 sacks, but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 sacks. The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling-off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality rough cloths {{seem to have been}} significant.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, Greene was {{the captain}} of the Steelers defense, {{although}} his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was washed up. He was never again able to attain the same success as a pass rusher after his pinched nerve in 1975. Spurred by the rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh's five <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.|$|E

5|$|Charles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, {{at which}} the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be {{returned}} to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours, and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar. They {{were brought to the}} castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> wool. Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Virginia Tech dominated, intercepting {{the ball}} three times, forcing a fumble once, and earning one {{defensive}} touchdown. Two Louisville defenders {{had the best}} individual performances during the game, however. Brandon Johnson and Abe Brown had six tackles apiece, and Brown sacked Marcus Vick once for a loss of ten yards. The sack {{was one of three}} earned by the Louisville offense during the game. Virginia Tech's defense earned two sacks during the game, and the Hokies' leading tackler was Vince Hall, who recorded four and two assists on <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> Louisville's Hunter Cantwell.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major {{thoroughfares}} in Rome able to cope with a high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various <b>Sacks</b> <b>of</b> Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E

5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the lifting of strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half of}} the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day that the French retreated to Valletta, Nelson {{despatched}} the ships Alexander, Culloden, and Colossus from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta, which was technically their territory, the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson, now Lord Nelson, in Vanguard on 24 October. Four days later, Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of Gozo. The French abandoned the island's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3,200 urgently required <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> grain, which were distributed among the Maltese populace. With the French garrison trapped in Valletta, no further actions took place off Malta during the year, both sides settling in for a long siege.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin finds {{electric}} cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising {{that they are}} there designed to attract a plane drop.

He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for Aklan, where property damage equated to ₱51million (US$1million). The Central Visayas region of the Philippines suffered the worst impacts, with a damage cost of ₱345.2million (US$7million), primarily to agriculture. Following the storm's passage, chapters of the Philippine Red Cross assisted in relief efforts in impacted areas. The Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development allocated ₱27.7million (US$600,000) to relief efforts. Food and sheltering were provided to 2,615people in three provinces by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency. Many localized relief agencies donated <b>sacks</b> <b>of</b> rice to impacted residents. The United Nations appealed for US$46million for use in recovery efforts following Utor {{in addition to the}} three Philippine typhoons which preceded it. Overall, the impacts of Utor killed 30people and injured 44in the Philippines. Another eight people were never accounted for. The damage toll wrought by Utor amounted to US$15.8million. Furthermore, 36,542houses were damaged by Utor, of which 9,439were destroyed. Capiz and Aklan were the areas that sustained the most residential damage. People who were evacuated out of hazardous regions in advance of Utor were able to return home beginning on December18, nine days after initial landfall.|$|E
