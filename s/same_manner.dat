5000|$|If {{you could}} see him in his rather Bohemian attire (which was, I suspect, {{carefully}} chosen) you would find him very eccentric.

5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is {{referent}} to economics - the title scheme {{was used for the}} arc the episode fell inside and was pitched by Greg Weisman, story editor and producer for The Spectacular Spider-Man. It also refers to the episode's theme of people competing for glory. Several scenes from the episode were taken directly from the film Spider-Man 3. Spider-Man does a leg-sweep on Sandman in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> as in the film. Flint Marko's transformation into the Sandman was also based executed in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> {{as it was in the}} film's version of his transformation.

5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> as natural science.

5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility.

5000|$|Scalar {{multiplication}} {{is represented}} in the <b>same</b> <b>manners</b> as algebraic multiplication. A scalar beside a vector (either or both {{of which may be}} in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication. The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors. The product of a scalar c with a vector v can be represented in any of the following fashions: ...|$|R

5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946.

5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> as a tree's trunk. The cells {{beneath the}} epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over {{that of a}} woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height {{in order to support}} itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

50|$|Along with Marc's reoccurring {{themes of}} colors, {{he would also}} depict animals in the <b>same</b> <b>manners.</b> Deer were sacred animals to Marc. He usually painted them, like most of his animals, in a very {{peaceful}} manner. His works such as Grazing Horses IV (The Red Horses), The Yellow Cow, and Dog Lying in Snow depict animals in a peaceful setting. Fate of the Animals provides a contrast to his normal depiction of animals, in which he puts his beloved animals in a scene of destruction.|$|R
