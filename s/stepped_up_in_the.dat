25|$|The Colts defense <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, forcing three turnovers. Denver {{took the}} second half kickoff {{and drove to the}} Colts 23-yard line, {{featuring}} a 34-yard reception by Smith. But then Plummer was sacked on third down and Elam's 46-yard field goal attempt was blocked. After the botched field goal, the Colts drove 64 yards and scored with Manning's fifth touchdown pass, a 7-yard toss to Wayne. Three plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts linebacker Rob Morris recovered a fumble from Plummer on the Broncos 20-yard line, setting up a 20-yard field goal from Vanderjagt.

500|$|When {{some days}} passed without any further {{word on the}} matter, {{follow-up}} messages were sent on 6 and 9 March. By 10 March, MacArthur had decided that the Bataan front was not in danger of imminent collapse, and replied {{that he planned to}} depart on 15 March, when the submarine [...] was scheduled to arrive at Corregidor. Radio broadcasts in the United States calling for MacArthur to be placed in charge in Australia had been picked up by MacArthur's headquarters in Corregidor, and it had to be assumed that the Japanese had heard them too. There were ominous signs: Japanese surface patrols had been <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Subic Bay area, and there were reports of Japanese destroyers heading north from the southern Philippines. MacArthur therefore elected not to wait for the Permit, but to leave as soon as possible, by PT boat on the night of 11 March. Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright was left in command on Bataan and Corregidor. [...] "When I get back", MacArthur told him, [...] "if you're still on Bataan, I'll make you a lieutenant general." [...] Wainwright replied: [...] "I'll be on Bataan if I'm still alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The British Army {{conducted}} only symbolic patrols {{along its}} {{sector of the}} inner German border and gradually reduced the tempo of its border operations as the Cold War progressed. By the 1970s it was carrying out only one patrol a month, only rarely using helicopters or ground surveillance radar and erecting no permanent observation posts. The British border zone was divided into two sectors. The first stretched from Lübeck to Lauenburg on the Elbe and the second from Lauenburg to the border with the U.S. Zone– a total distance of about [...] Although patrols were <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, they were carried out primarily for training purposes. Soldiers were issued weapons but not ammunition. Unlike the Americans, the British did not assign specific units to border duty but rotated the task between the divisions of the British Army of the Rhine.|$|E
2500|$|The UVF also {{attacked}} republican paramilitaries {{and political}} activists. These attacks were <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s and early 1990s, {{particularly in the}} east Tyrone and north Armagh areas. The largest death toll was in the 3 March 1991 Cappagh killings, when they killed IRA members John Quinn, Dwayne O'Donnell and Malcolm Nugent, and civilian Thomas Armstrong. Republicans responded to the attacks by assassinating UVF leaders, including John Bingham, William [...] "Frenchie" [...] Marchant, Trevor King as well as Leslie Dallas, whose purported UVF membership was disputed both by his family and the UVF. The UVF also killed senior republicans such as Liam Ryan and Larry Marley. According to Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), the UVF killed 17 active and four former republican paramilitaries. CAIN also states that republicans killed 13 UVF members, {{some of whom are}} suspected to have been set up for assassination by their colleagues.|$|E
2500|$|Diaz {{initially}} {{served only}} one term— after having staunchly stood against Lerdo's re-election policy. Instead {{of running for}} a second term, he handpicked his successor, Manuel González, one of his trustworthy companions. This side-step maneuver, however, {{did not mean that}} Díaz was stepping down from his powerful position. The four-year period that followed was marked by corruption and official incompetence, so that when Díaz <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election of 1884, he was welcomed by his people with open arms. More importantly, very few people remembered his [...] "No re-election" [...] slogan that had defined his previous campaign. During this period the Mexican underground political newspapers spread the new ironic slogan for the Porfirian times, based on the slogan [...] "Sufragio Efectivo, No Reelección" [...] (effective suffrage, no re-election) and changed it to [...] "Sufragio Efectivo No, Reelección" [...] (no effective suffrage, re-election). In any case, Díaz had the constitution amended, first to allow two terms in office, and then to remove all restrictions on re-election.|$|E

2500|$|The Patriots (18–0) {{entered the}} Super Bowl undefeated and were 12 point {{favorites}} going into game weekend. The Giants defeated the Patriots 17–14 in Super Bowl XLII, {{aided by the}} famous [...] "Manning to Tyree" [...] pass. On this famous play, Manning escaped the grip of several Patriots defensive linemen, <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pocket, and heaved the ball {{down the middle of}} the field to a double covered David Tyree. With Rodney Harrison, a Patriots defensive back, all over Tyree, David managed to hold on to the ball by holding it on his helmet until he fell to the ground. This catch set up a Manning to Plaxico Burress touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to put the Giants in the lead. It was the third biggest upset by betting line in Super Bowl history (the Baltimore Colts were favored by 17 over the New York Jets in Super Bowl III, and the St. Louis Rams were favored by 14 over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI). Co-owner John Mara described it as [...] "the greatest victory in the history of this franchise, without question".|$|E
60|$|Miss Amelia Martin was pale, tallish, thin, and two-and-thirty—what ill-natured {{people would}} call plain, and police reports interesting.
