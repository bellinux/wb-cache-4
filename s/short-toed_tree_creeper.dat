40|$|The use {{of space}} by two sibling species of passerines, the Treee creeper, Certhia familiaris and the <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>creeper</b> C. brachydactyla was studied in the Alpes-Maritimes, Southern France. The two species were found differ mainly by their altitudinal distribution, the <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Creeper</b> living at low altitudes, and the Tree creeper {{occuring}} at higher elevations. This replacement took place gradually, and an important area of sympatry was found between 1200 and 1800 m above sea level. ln this altitudinal belt each species had a definite preference for a few tree species (the Tree creeper for Spruce Picea excelsa and Fir Abies alba, and the <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>creeper</b> for Scots pine Pinus silvestris), as weil as for {{a different kind of}} forest (the Tree creeper prefering dense stands, and the <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>creeper</b> more open ones). In Larch Larix decidua forests at middle altitudes, however, the two Tree creepers were found to occur at similar densities and were syntopic. In such Larch woods, a large overlap of foraging sites (substrate, foraging height, and foraging posture) was observed throughout the year. No interspecific territoriality was noticed during the breeding season, and the two species displayed few interspecific reactions to song playback. Interspecific agonistic behaviour was observed at four occasions only. Therefore, these two morphologically very similar species did not show any evidence of competition during their reproductive season in Larch woods. Some spatial segregation did, however, occur in winter, when the Tree creepers joined flocks of tits, in which the two species were seldom seen togethe...|$|E

50|$|Slobber, Reteostium cortepellium, an arboreal, slow-moving, almost sloth-like {{marsupial}} from Australia that {{is totally}} blind (similar to a marsupial mole) and spends nearly all its life hanging upside down from <b>trees</b> and <b>creepers.</b> It subsists entirely on insects that it catches in the flowers of its home creeper by entangling them in long strands of mucus dangling from its mouth. Its large downturned ears and sensory whiskers alert it to an insect's arrival and it tell it when to drop the mucus, which it aims at the flower's scent. As the slobber's hair grows in spiral tufts and is pervaded by a parasitic algae, it is completely camouflaged {{against the background of}} creepers, and when totally motionless can escape the attention of other predators. One creature that the slobber takes pain to avoid is the hiri-hiri. Separate races of this marsupial are found on different species of <b>tree</b> and <b>creeper,</b> each race's hair varying in texture to blend in with the surroundings. A slobber's young are carried protruding motionless from a pouch in their mother's abdomen.|$|R
