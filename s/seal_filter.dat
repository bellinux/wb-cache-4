40|$|Purpose: Over {{the past}} five years the Center for Minimally Invasive Radiation Biodosimetry at Columbia University has {{developed}} the Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Tool (RABiT), a completely automated, ultra-high throughput biodosimetry workstation. This paper describes recent upgrades and reliability testing of the RABiT. Materials and methods: The RABiT analyses fingerstick-derived blood samples to estimate past radiation exposure or to identify individuals exposed above or below a cut-off dose. Through automated robotics, lymphocytes are extracted from fingerstick blood samples into filter-bottomed multi-well plates. Depending on the time since exposure, the RABiT scores either micronuclei or phosphorylation of the histone H 2 AX, in an automated robotic system, using filter-bottomed multi-well plates. Following lymphocyte culturing, fixation and staining, the filter bottoms are removed from the multi-well plates and sealed prior to automated high-speed imaging. Image analysis is performed online using dedicated image processing hardware. Both the <b>sealed</b> <b>filters</b> and the images are archived. Results: We have developed a new robotic system for lymphocyte processing, making use of an upgraded laser power and parallel processing of four capillaries at once. This system has allowed acceleration of lymphocyte isolation, the main bottleneck of the RABiT operation, from 12 to 2 sec/sample. Reliability tests have been performed on all robotic subsystems.

Historically, microhydrodynamics has been around forever. Examples of typical natural systems are the flow of blood in capillaries, of air in liquid lined lung passages, of sap in plants, of water, oil and gas in porous media, of suspended matter in liquids and gases, as well as the motion of microorganisms (bacteria), etc. In man made systems, microhydrodynamics is essential in bearings and lubrication devices, <b>seals,</b> <b>filters,</b> ore separation, etc. From the very beginning, scientist such as Poiseuille, Darcy, Stokes, Oseen and many others have contributed to the theoretical developments that, even today, guide most of the engineering applications. During the last ten years, the intense development of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), due essentially to the continuum miniaturization of electronic devices, has prompted the birth and growth of modern microhydrodynamic with applications in areas as varied as micro heat exchangers, on-line biological analysis, on-line drug monitoring and delivery, cell manipulation, etc. Also, the flow of liquids through very small passages at high and very high velocities, such as in the injectors of Diesel engines and the valves of power steering has developed new challenges for scientists and engineers.

Errors occur because of water losses during the opening of the Cambridge filter pad holder to remove the filter pad as well as during the manual handling of the filter pad, and because the commercially available filter pad holder, which is constructed out of plastic, may adsorb water. This results in inaccurate values for the water content, and erroneous and overestimated values for Nicotine Free Dry Particulate Matter (NFDPM). A modified 44 mm Cambridge filter pad holder and extraction equipment which supports in situ extraction methodology has been developed and tested. The principle of the in situ extraction methodology is to avoid any of the above mentioned water losses by extracting the loaded filter pad while kept in the Cambridge filter pad holder which is hermetically sealed by two caps. This is achieved by flushing the extraction solvent numerous times through the hermetically <b>sealed</b> Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad holder by means of an in situ extractor. The in situ methodology showed a significantly more complete water recovery, resulting in more accurate NFDPM values for high-water content aerosols compared to the standard ISO methodology. The work presented in this publication demonstrates that the in situ extraction methodology applies to a wider range of smoking products and smoking regimens, whereas the standard ISO methodology only applies to a limited range of smoking products and smoking regimens, e. g., conventional cigarettes smoked under ISO smoking regimen. In cases where a comparison of yields between the PMI HTP and conventional cigarettes is required the in situ extraction methodology must be used for the aerosol of the PMI HTP to obtain accurate NFDPM/”tar” values. This would be for example the case if there were a need to print “tar” yields on packs or compare yields to ceilings.

40|$|AbstractSome life {{detection}} instruments {{under development}} for operation on Mars use solvents to extract organic compounds from samples of Martian regolith and rock and {{to transfer the}} extracts to dedicated detectors. However, {{it is possible that}} organic compounds extracted from Martian samples and dissolved in the solvent could adsorb to instrument surfaces, potentially resulting in a failure to detect organic matter that could have been avoided by using more appropriate instrument materials. If successful detection and characterisation is to take place it is therefore essential to understand the interactions between dissolved organic targets and the surfaces of space instrument components. One such life detection instrument is the Life Marker Chip (LMC) being developed for the ExoMars mission, which relies on a novel surfactant-based solvent system and antibody-based detectors. We have tested the ability of a range of materials, including titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, the fluoropolymer Viton™, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), nylon, polypropylene, polyethersulfone and cellulose acetate to adsorb a range of organic standards from the surfactant solution intended to be used by the LMC. Results indicate that aromatic hydrocarbons, specifically anthracene, are more prone to adsorption than straight chain, branched and cyclic aliphatic species. Titanium, aluminium and stainless steel show little adsorption ability and are suitable for larger-area applications. PTFE and Viton™ are suitable for use in small-area applications such as <b>seals</b> and <b>filters.</b> Nylon, polypropylene, polyethersulfone and cellulose acetate show stronger adsorption characteristics and should be avoided in the forms employed here. The ability of some materials to selectively adsorb organic compounds from solvent extracts can lower the sensitivity of life detection instruments. In future, it would be prudent to test all space instrument materials for their ability to adsorb target organic compounds from the solvent systems with which they will be used. This work has application beyond LMC and is relevant to future life detection instruments and their associated cleaning procedures that use solvents. The findings will also be pertinent to planned sample return missions involving caching and can inform the selection of materials used in sample return containers and during the subsequent processing of any returned samples...|$|R

The numerical model of the whole cooling water system consists of 87 pipes, 133 junctions, 6 variable speed driven centrifugal pumps, 59 valves and 3 reservoirs. Some throttle control valves (TCV) are artificially inserted in our numerical model and are set with appropriate loss coefficients values to be equivalent to the equipments that introduce minor losses in the system and don’t exist as physical components in EPANET.

This research used computer simulations and measurements, includes development of protocols and phantoms, and yields quantitative results and physical components. Quasi-monochromatic beams were created using different specially processed, hermetically <b>sealed</b> ultra-thick K-edge <b>filters</b> yielding a maximum mean energy difference of 7 keV; also, different kVp potentials on the x-ray tube were used with higher atomic number filters, yielding a maximum mean energy difference of 11 keV. A cylindrical phantom containing muscle tissue equivalent material, glandular tissue equivalent material, polyethylene, and acrylic was filled with methanol (adipose tissue equivalent) was developed and scanned to investigate dual-energy contrast enhancement of the different materials. The CT scans were acquired using a dual-modality SPECT-CT system for dedicated breast imaging. The weighted dual-energy subtraction method is adapted from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, where a high and low energy CT scan is acquired using two different ultra-thick k-edge filters (or tube potentials) and the data is reconstructed. Region of interest values are obtained from each image, which is then multiplied by a weighted value (k), and the higher energy image is subtracted from the lower energy image to achieve contrast enhancement. The k-values were calculated from the ratio of measured attenuation coefficients for the material to be subtracted. In a projection-noise normalized acquisition scenario, it was found that weighted dual-energy subtraction with quasi-monochromatic beams might not be feasible under the current circumstances due to the especially high noise (poor contrast to noise ratios) and poor contrast. While this was not an optimized scenario, the approach does have promise, indicating that more investigation is needed. Thesi...|$|R

This material has been tested in the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University (TAMU) as a bearing damper in a rotordynamic test rig. The test facility was originally used to support the design of a turboprop engine at TAMU, developing squirrel cage bearing supports and squeeze film dampers for both the gas generator and power turbine rotors. To design the metal mesh damper, static stiffness and dynamic rap test measurements were first made on metal mesh samples in a specially designed non-rotating test fixture. These property tests were performed on samples of various densities and press fits. One sample was also tested in an Instron machine as an ancillary and redundant way to determine the stiffness. Using the stiffness test results and equations derived by a previous investigator, a spreadsheet program was written and used to size metal mesh donuts that have the radial stiffness value required to replace the squirrel cage in the power turbine. The squirrel cage and squeeze-film bearing damper developed for the power turbine rotor was then replaced by a metal mesh donut sized by the computer code. Coast-down tests were conducted through the first critical speed of the power turbine. The results of the metal mesh tests were compared with those obtained from previous testing with the squeeze film damper. The results show that the metal mesh damper has the same damping as the squeeze film at room temperature but does not lose its damping at elevated temperatures up to 210 F?. Experiments were run under several different conditions including balanced rotor hot oil soaked, unbalanced rotor hot oil soaked, balanced dry, and unbalanced dry. Over all, metal mesh dampers appear to be a viable and attractive substitute for squeeze film dampers in gas turbine engines. The advantages shown to date include less variation of damping with temperature, ability to handle large rotor unbalance, and the ability (if required) to operate effectively in an oil free environment...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{we observe}} {{diverging}} processes {{of growth and}} shrinkage in European Cities. Whereas in the 80 ies and 90 ies partially accelerated through {{the crash of the}} socialist system mostly urban growth and suburban development occurred in European Cities, today we find a general decline of population as well as an increase of aged people (as results of the demographic change in Europe and worldwide, Cloet 2003, Lutz 2001). These processes influence land use pattern (state of the environment) and land use changes in urban areas enormously. Land use pattern reflect the current socio-economic development of an urban area and give an idea of how the urban ecosystem is influenced by man. In doing so, for instance, surface <b>sealing</b> reduces the <b>filtering</b> and remediation capacity of soils and the water retention in general as well as minimises habitat quality for wetland species. At the same time, the ecosystem(s) provide so-called ecosystem services, benefits people obtain from ecosystems: water availability, drinking water, remediation and filtering of waste, places to settle, recreation facilities in nature and others. Their quantification enables to bring the change (availability/loss) of ecosystem services into relation with effective costs (economic sphere, Farber 2002, De Groot et al. 2002). The above mentioned population decline and related shrinkage processes will have enormous consequences on the demand and availability of ecosystem services needed to sustain a high and even increasing status of quality of life for European citizens in the next future. Therefore, the predictor variables describing on the one hand shrinkage-related land use changes and on the other its effects are most important {{but at the same time}} it is still a challenge; to extract such predictor variables from a huge catalogue of urban socio-economic and environmental indicators elaborated by many studies for different landscape types and scales; to derive relevant digital and spatially explicit data as model input to calculate the effects of land use (change) and; to validate the model results at the city and the quarter level (scale) as well as to prove the response of the (gained/released) ecosystem service (environmental quality) at the city and at quarter level (closing the circle). Here, the author will give some expressive examples showing the derivation of predictor variables for modelling peri-urban growth and inner city shrinkage as well as its effects on water balance, habitat quality (urban green network) and recreational space. Of major interest is the approach of how to tackle the problem of urban shrinkage in spatially explicit land use (change) modelling (Haase et al. 2004) ...|$|R
