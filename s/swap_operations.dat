50|$|Coupling qubits is {{essential}} for implementing 2-qubit gates. Coupling two qubits may be achieved by connecting them to an intermediate electrical coupling circuit. The circuit might be a fixed element, such as a capacitor, or controllable, such as a DC-SQUID. In the first case, decoupling the qubits (during the time the gate is off) is achieved by tuning the qubits out of resonance one from another, i.e. making the energy gaps between their computational states different. This approach is inherently limited to allow nearest-neighbor coupling only, as a physical electrical circuit is to be lay out in between the connected qubits. Notably, D-Wave Systems' nearest-neighbor coupling achieves a highly connected unit cell of 8 qubits in the Chimera graph configuration. Generally, quantum algorithms require coupling between arbitrary qubits, therefore the connectivity limitation is likely to require multiple <b>swap</b> <b>operations,</b> limiting {{the length of the}} possible quantum computation before the processor decoherence.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mesh {{optimization}} of 2 D and 3 D triangulations is used {{in multiple}} applications extensively. For example, mesh optimization is crucial {{in the context of}} adaptively discretizing geometry, typically representing the geometrical boundary conditions of a numerical simulation, or adaptively discretizing the entire space over which various dependent variables of a numerical simulation must be approximated. Together with operations applied to the vertices the so-called edge or face <b>swap</b> <b>operations</b> are the building block of all optimization approaches. To speed up the optimization or to avoid local minima of the function measuring overall mesh quality these swaps are combined to generalized <b>swap</b> <b>operations</b> with a less local impact on the triangulation.

The DM interaction can lead to a higher mutual information, especially for the ferromagnetic case. The entanglement quality of input states cannot enhance the mutual information of the quantum channel. When the DM interaction is large, the mutual information will be the maximum value 2 for a non-entangled input state, but it is 1 for a maximally entangled input one.

Our scheme is potentially applicable to ion-trap and solid-state quantum technologies. We calculate a lower bound on the noise threshold for our local model using a detailed failure probability analysis. We obtain a threshold of 1. 85 × 10 − 5 for the local setting, where memory error rates are one-tenth of the failure rates of gates, measurement, and preparation steps. For the analogous nonlocal setting, we obtain a noise threshold of 3. 61 × 10 − 5.

40|$|Abstract: In a {{conventional}} binary floating-point number arithmetic system, two’s complement number represen-tation {{is often used}} to perform addition/subtraction in a floating-point adder. Since the significand of an addition operand is usually expressed as a sign-magnitude number representation, the <b>swapping</b> <b>operation</b> of two operands and the carry propagation in the addition will limit the arithmetic speed. In this paper, we introduce a radix-two signed-digit(SD) number arithmetic to the floating-point number arithmetic. Then the <b>swapping</b> <b>operation</b> is not required and the carry propagation becomes free for the inner addition. We present an addition circuit architecture using the SD arithmetic with a normal binary floating-point number representation in both input and output.
