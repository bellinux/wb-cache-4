In this paper, novel {{induction motor}} models are formulated based on stationary, rotor and synchronously rotating reference frames. All these proposed models are compared and analyzed in terms of their diagnostic relevance <b>to</b> <b>stator</b> inter-turn <b>faults.</b> Ability <b>to</b> generate distinct residual signatures is a key for model-based diagnostics. Performance of these models in term of their ability <b>to</b> diagnose a <b>fault</b> is compared and best suited models are suggested based on a discriminatory ability index proposed in this paper. As continuous-time extended Kalman filter (CTEKF) is the most commonly used estimator for state estimation, the same has been considered.

40|$|The {{causes of}} faults of {{induction}} motors are largely categorized into bearing fault, which causes a mechanical <b>fault,</b> and <b>stator</b> <b>fault</b> and rotor fault, which cause an electrical <b>fault.</b> A <b>stator</b> <b>fault</b> among these faults, which causes an electrical <b>fault,</b> occurs due <b>to</b> {{the breakdown of}} insulation, meaning the stator is directly connected with the power supply, and the direct connection is a direct cause of a major accident.

Negative sequence current monitoring {{is one of the}} well-known {{condition monitoring}} applications that capable of identifying <b>stator</b> <b>faults</b> in induction motor as well as producing fast and reliable results using a simple measurement technique. However, the technique is sensitive to asymmetrical sources of negative sequence, not only due <b>to</b> motor <b>faults</b> but also due to the disturbances such as sensor calibration, inherent non-idealities (such as inherent machine asymmetries), external effects (such as load change and supply voltage unbalances). This thesis addresses the limitations in shorted turn fault detection while considering real system disturbances and non-linearities using a dynamic motor model which is also verified by the experimental studies. The thesis provides a comprehensive investigation of various negative sequence contributors such as measurement asymmetry, inherent asymmetry, voltage unbalance, shorted turn faults, eccentricity and broken rotor bar faults under load variations, and presents practical results. To allow accurate shorted turn fault detection, this thesis also provides an effective phasor compensation technique for these disturbances. A new detailed compensation by demonstrating step-by-step disturbance extraction to obtain the real negative sequence current due <b>to</b> shorted turn <b>faults</b> are also presented. It is demonstrated that this technique allows even a single <b>stator</b> shorted turn <b>faults</b> <b>to</b> be detected as well as successfully eliminating the effect of inherent asymmetry and voltage unbalances under motor load variations.

New fault character-istics of Powerformer are analyzed and a novel criterion is put forward. The proposed approach detects the ground fault by an-alyzing the direction, magnitude, and energy of leakage current, which is the difference of zero-sequence current fault component between the neutral and the terminal of Powerformer. The funda-mental component and the third-harmonic component of leakage current are combined to realize 100 % coverage of fault detection for the stator windings of Powerformer.

40|$|A <b>stator</b> turn <b>fault</b> in a safety-critical drive {{application}} must {{be detected}} at its initial stage and imperatively requires an evasive action {{to prevent a}} serious accident caused by an abrupt interruption in the drive s operation. However, this is much challenging for {{the case of an}} interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives {{because of the presence of}} the permanent magnets that cannot be turned off at will. This work tackles the problem of increase the <b>stator</b> turn <b>fault</b> tolerance of IPMSM drives in safety-critical applications. This objective is achieved by an on-line turn fault detection method and a simple turn fault-tolerant operating strategy. In this work, it is shown that a <b>stator</b> turn <b>fault</b> in a current-controlled voltage source inverter-driven machine leads to a reduced fundamental positive sequence component of the voltage references as compared to the machine without a turn fault for a given torque reference and rotating speed. Based on this finding, a voltage reference-based turn fault detection method is proposed. In addition, it is also revealed that an adjustment to the level of the rotating magnetic flux in an appropriate manner can yield a significant reduction in the propagation speed of the fault and possibly prevention of the <b>fault</b> from spreading <b>to</b> the entire winding. This would be accomplished without any hardware modification. Based on this principle, a stator turn fault-tolerant operating strategy for IPMSM drives maintaining drive s availability is proposed.
