Of the 76,920 households in York, 36.0% were married couples living together, 31.3% were one-person households, 8.7% were co-habiting couples and 8.0% were lone parents. The figures for lone parent households were below the national average of 9.5%, and the percentage of married couples was also close to the national average of 36.5%; the proportion of one person households was <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the national average of 30.1%.|$|E
5|$|Eccles is the ninth-most densely {{populated}} ward in Salford, {{and has the}} highest number and proportion of people aged 75and over of all wards in Salford. Levels of crime are below the average for the city. The adult population {{tends to be more}} qualified than the city average, and primary and secondary education results are also <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> average for Salford. Unemployment is below average, with people tending to work longer hours. More residents live in purpose-built and converted flats than do in the city as a whole, with a minority occupying detached houses or bungalows. Between 1994and2004, 367homes were added to the ward, above the average for Salford.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 14.6per cent of Altrincham's {{population}} was middle class, <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the figure for England and Wales, which was 14per cent. By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8per cent compared to 24per cent nationally, while the town's working class population had declined, from 30.3per cent in 1931 (36per cent in England and Wales) to 18.6per cent (26per cent nationwide). The remainder comprised clerical and skilled manual workers. This change in social structure {{was similar to}} that seen across the nation– although biased towards the middle classes– making Altrincham the middle-class town it is today.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} year of {{eligibility}} in , Koufax {{was elected to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame, just weeks after his 36th birthday. His election made him the Hall's youngest member ever elected, five months younger than Lou Gehrig upon his election in 1939, though because the 1972 induction ceremony was nearly eight months after the election, Koufax's age at induction was <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> Gehrig's, making Gehrig the youngest player ever inducted. On June 4 of that same year, Koufax's uniform number 32 was retired alongside those of Dodger greats Roy Campanella (39) and Jackie Robinson (42).|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 percent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 percent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|Once {{north of}} Bermuda, Igor began to undergo an extratropical {{transition}} {{as it turned}} northeastward. Though deep convection was no longer consistently over its center, data from Hurricane Hunters continued to support hurricane intensity. Accelerating along {{the leading edge of}} a trough over the Canadian Maritimes, the storm intensified within a baroclinic zone as it neared Newfoundland. The interaction between these two systems allowed the hurricane to strengthen despite moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures. Around 1500UTC on September21, Igor made landfall near Cape Race, with winds of 85mph (140km/h), <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> several hours earlier. Shortly thereafter, the storm completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone, as it became fully embedded within the baroclinic zone. After turning northwestward between Labrador and Greenland, the remnants of Igor were absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on September23, within the Labrador Sea.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops goodmani is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Triaenops. It is known from three lower jaws {{collected}} in a cave at Anjohibe in 1996, and described as a new species in 2007. The material is at most 10,000 years old. A bat humerus (upper arm bone) from the same site could not be identified as either T.goodmani or the living T.menamena. T.goodmani is identifiable {{as a member of}} Triaenops or the related genus Paratriaenops by a number of features of the teeth, such as the single-cusped, canine-like fourth premolar and the presence of a gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid cusps on the first two molars. T.goodmani is larger than the living species of Triaenops and Paratriaenops on Madagascar, and on the first molar the protoconid cusp is only <b>slightly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the hypoconid, not much higher as in the other species.|$|E
