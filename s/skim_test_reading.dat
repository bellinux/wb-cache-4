40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} the independent and combined effects of {{different levels of}} monetary incentives and a theory-based educational intervention on return for tuberculosis (TB) skin <b>test</b> <b>reading</b> {{in a sample of}} active injection drug and crack cocaine users. Prevalence of TB infection in this sample was also determined. METHODS: Active or recent drug users (n = 1004), recruited via street outreach techniques, were skin tested for TB. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 levels of monetary incentive ($ 5 and $ 10) provided at return for skin <b>test</b> <b>reading,</b> alone or in combination with a brief motivational education session. RESULTS: More than 90 % of those who received $ 10 returned for skin <b>test</b> <b>reading,</b> in comparison with 85 % of those who received $ 5 and 33 % of those who received no monetary incentive. The education session had no impact on return for skin <b>test</b> <b>reading.</b> The prevalence of a positive tuberculin test was 18. 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: Monetary incentives dramatically increase the return rate for TB skin <b>test</b> <b>reading</b> among drug users who are at high risk of TB infection...|$|R

50|$|Reading speed {{requires}} {{a long time}} to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age, regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension <b>test.</b> The <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais ("L'alouette", published in 1967) <b>tested</b> <b>reading</b> aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces).|$|R
