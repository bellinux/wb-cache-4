50|$|This special {{episode was}} aired {{as a prelude}} to Channel 4's Formula One {{coverage}} of the 2016 Bahrain Grand Prix, in which Martin rode his Tyco BMW S1000RR superbike in a series of challenges against former F1 driver David Coulthard in a 2012 Red Bull RB8 F1 racing car, filmed over two days at Silverstone Circuit. The car won, winning three out of four tasks. On both days, the track was dry but cold (air temperatures from 4 to 6.6 C). As well as the challenges, the programme featured both men familiarising themselves with each other's machinery and pit crews, with each attempting a pit <b>stop</b> <b>wheel</b> change, as well as Martin being allowed to assist in a gear box check on the car. Examining race fitness, both undergo grip strength and reaction time/peripheral vision (on a Batak machine) tests. It also covered some of the science behind the results of each challenge. The first challenge was a quarter mile drag race along Hangar Straight. After leading initially, the F1 car overtook the bike with 20 meters to go, and won with a time of 10.29s, 0.3s ahead of the bike The second challenge tested braking - both would enter International Straight side by side at 100 mph, then brake at a given point, the shortest stopping distance winning. The car stopped in a distance of around 45 metres in 3 seconds, 24 metres and one second less than the bike. Into the second day, the third challenge tested their ability to quickly change direction - each would perform a timed run through a 150m long slalom course of cones on Hangar Straight. The bike beat the car, with times of 9.50s and 12.87s respectively. The final challenge was a head to head race, handicapped by tasking the car to complete four laps to the bike's three. The car won, overtaking the bike on the outside with just over half a lap left, finishing 13s ahead of the bike.|$|E
50|$|Their answers {{determined}} a five-digit code {{which will}} <b>stop</b> the <b>wheel</b> from Spinning. The other team member {{will have to}} guess his or her teammate's answers, by rotating the rotary discs to the corresponding numbers to <b>stop</b> the <b>wheel.</b> The first team to guess correctly and <b>stop</b> the <b>wheel</b> would win the Versus and was safe from elimination.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} Burchard {{did was to}} send to Renelde and to <b>stop</b> her <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bonus spin was {{administered}} {{in the same}} way as the original Mexican version. If the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> on the MXN$.05, the bonus was MXN$5,000. If the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> on MXN$1, a new car was awarded. If the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> on MXN$.15, the contestant won MXN$15,000. If the tie involved concurrently with the bonus spin, they'll get another spin-off, but no more money to be won.|$|R

50|$|The cotton mill {{closed in}} 1886, {{and it was}} {{acquired}} by furniture manufacturers. The water <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> being the prime mover in 1923 but drove an electricity generator proving power and light to adjoining houses. Electricity didn't reach the rest of Chipping until 1933. The <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> turning in about 1940, and the top part was cut away to release more space to the mill.|$|R

50|$|When a {{train is}} braking, the low {{adhesion}} manifests as wheel slip where the wheelset is rotating {{at a lower}} velocity (speed) than the forward speed of the train. The most extreme {{example of this is}} where the <b>wheel</b> <b>stops</b> rotating altogether (<b>wheel</b> slide) while the train is still moving and can result in a “wheel flat” caused by the softer wheel steel being abraded away by the harder rail steel.|$|R
2500|$|Bumpy surfaces: If {{the front}} wheel comes off the ground during braking, it will stop completely. [...] Landing on a <b>stopped</b> front <b>wheel</b> with the brakes still applied is likely to cause {{the front wheel}} to skid and may flip the rider over the handlebar.|$|R

50|$|A {{cassette}} adapter {{is shaped}} like a cassette tape. However, instead of having reels of tape inside, it has a transmitting head where the tape is normally read by the reading head. This transmitting head {{is connected to the}} input cord, which connects the head to the audio source. A cassette adapter must also include a mechanism that simulates tape movement. Modern cassette players monitor tape movement to detect when the tape ends. This is done using a rolling wheel that rides against the tape. To simulate tape movement, a system of gears or a drive belt connects the tape player's drive motor (via the take-up spindle) to a wheel inside the adapter. This wheel rides against the detection wheel to simulate tape movement. Because the <b>wheel</b> never <b>stops</b> spinning, the deck never senses an end-of-tape and never tries to reverse the tape. Some adapters contain a one way locking mechanism, to <b>stop</b> the detection <b>wheel</b> if the tape is played in the wrong direction (and thus reading {{the wrong side of the}} head). The <b>stopped</b> <b>wheel</b> then would cause the cassette player to either stop the tape, or reverse the direction if the player supports it.|$|R

50|$|By {{interpreting}} {{the speed and}} force with which the brake pedal is pushed, the system detects if the driver is trying to execute an emergency stop, and if the brake pedal is not fully applied, the system overrides and fully applies the brakes until the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) takes over to <b>stop</b> the <b>wheels</b> locking up.|$|R

2500|$|Atlantis’ main {{landing gear}} wheels touched down at 09:44:23am EST (14:44:23 UTC) on Runway 33, {{followed}} by the nose wheel at 9:44:36am EST (14:44:36 UTC). The shuttle’s <b>wheels</b> <b>stopped</b> at 9:45:05am EST (14:45:05 UTC). This was the 72nd space shuttle landing at Kennedy Space Center. As the shuttle rolled to a halt, Commander Hobaugh announced [...] "Houston, Atlantis, wheels stop". CAPCOM Christopher Ferguson replied the crew, [...] "Roger, <b>wheels</b> <b>stopped,</b> Atlantis, that was a picture-perfect end to a top-fuel mission to the space station. Everybody, welcome back to Earth, especially you, Nicole." ...|$|R

60|$|Realizing that I {{could not}} hope to outdistance the Sagoths {{to the top of}} the canyon I had {{determined}} to risk all in an attempt to check them temporarily, and to this end had unslung my rudely made bow and plucked an arrow from the skin quiver which hung behind my shoulder. As I fitted the shaft with my right hand I <b>stopped</b> and <b>wheeled</b> toward the gorilla-man.|$|R
60|$|Chatterer {{looked at}} it with great suspicion. Could it be {{a new kind of}} trap? But what would a trap be doing there, when he was already a prisoner? He ate all the nuts, all the time {{watching}} this new, queer looking thing. It seemed harmless enough. He went a little nearer. Finally he hopped into it. It moved. Of course that frightened him, and he started to run up. But he didn't go up. No, Sir, he didn't go up. You see, he was in a wire wheel; and as he ran, the wheel went around. Chatterer was terribly frightened, and the faster he tried to run, the faster the wheel went around. Finally he had to stop, because he was out of breath and too tired to run another step. When he <b>stopped,</b> the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wheel is}} divided {{into a number of}} equal {{segments}} separated by spokes or pins. Each segment is associated with a number. The wheel is spun by a dealer, and the winning segment is indicated by a pointer mounted on a flexible piece of rubber or leather, which also rubs against the pins to impart friction and slow the wheel down. Should the player <b>stop</b> the <b>wheel,</b> the segment at the top is the winner.|$|R
5000|$|... some {{method of}} {{physical}} protection is highly desirable {{and this may}} include a derailer or <b>wheel</b> <b>stop.</b> These, when raised, would intentionally derail any unauthorised train attempting to enter the depot, thereby protecting staff and equipment in the depot.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{sometimes}} {{applied to the}} foot-rests on a motorcycle. Nerf bars are typically made from either stainless steel, chrome or powder-coated steel, although there are considerable variations in style and design. For motorcycle tank/engine protection systems on dual sport motorcycles, the term [...] "P.D. Nerf" [...] was invented by Happy Trails Products for the Kawasaki KLR 650. On quad bikes nerf bars are used to help <b>stop</b> the <b>wheels</b> of two machines becoming entangled.|$|R
40|$|Wheel-legged hybrid robots aim at {{combining}} {{the efficiency of}} wheeled robots with the versatility of legged robots: 1 – 3 by adding wheels {{at the end of}} legs, they can act like wheeled robots on simple terrains and adapt their posture to the shape of an uneven ground; they can also <b>stop</b> their <b>wheels</b> and be equivalent to a classic legged robot.

40|$|Spinning {{the target}} wheel under 5 T or 6 T {{magnetic}} field {{at a high}} speed will generate a strong eddy current inside the target wheel. Besides {{of the effect of}} heating and <b>stopping</b> the <b>wheel</b> from spinning, this eddy current will also generate induced magnetic dipole field near the target and will thus distort the OMD field and influence the positron capturing. How big is this influence? We will answer this question by integrating Comsol and PARMELA together in a numerical study...|$|R
50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which <b>stops</b> the <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{disc brake}} is a device for slowing or {{stopping}} {{the rotation of}} a road wheel. A brake disc (or rotor in U.S. English), usually made of cast iron or ceramic, {{is connected to the}} wheel or the axle. To <b>stop</b> the <b>wheel,</b> friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted in a device called a brake caliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|R
5000|$|Each game in {{the series}} offers a small bonus stage after {{completion}} {{of a set of}} levels. In Gals Panic 1, this is merely <b>stopping</b> a <b>wheel</b> from spinning at the correct time to gather a bonus such as an extra life, running the risk from stopping it at the wrong time to incur negatives such as a time penalty or even repeating the same stage again. On other versions, they range from short puzzles to joystick-fiddling and button-mashing [...] "hot" [...] scenes.|$|R
