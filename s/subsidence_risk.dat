40|$|Abstract—The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze risk areas of land <b>subsidence.</b> <b>Risk</b> factors were selected from related research on the problem of land subsidence. There were six factors selected: geological, hydrogeological, number of wells, groundwater used, land use and amount of population. The factors were analyzed by weighting and rating scores from twelve governmental officers from concerned agencies. The total score of each factor was employed to assess risk area of land subsidence by GIS and PCA method. The output in this study is a map of risk area of land subsidence in Nakhon Pathom Province, representative central plain area. In this study, the risk area of land subsidence was classified into 3 levels. Most of the land consisted of areas at a moderate risk of subsidence and these areas were scattered throughout the study area, covering 1, 905. 93 km 2, while a high level to at risk areas was found in parts of the west and south of the study area, covering 251. 02 km 2. The low level of land <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> covered the least area, at only 14 km 2, mainly in the northwestern and eastern parts of the study area.

This model provides new insight into the discussions about the kinematics of the area between the southeastern border of the Upper Rhine Graben and the Tabular Jura east of Basel. A 3 D analysis showed that both thin-skinned and thick-skinned tectonic elements occur in the modeled area and that the Anticline {{and a series of}} narrow graben structures developed simultaneously during an extensional stress-field varying from E-W to SSE-NNW, which lasted from the Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene. In a new approach the faults and horizons of the 3 D {{geological model}} were transferred into discrete elements with distributed hydrogeological properties in order to simulate the 3 D groundwater flow regime within the modeled aquifers. A three-layer approach with a horizontal regularly spaced grid combined with an irregular property distribution of transmissivity in depth permitted the piezometric head of the steady-state model to be automatically calibrated to corresponding measurements using more than 200 piezometers. Groundwater modeling results demonstrated that large-scale industrial pumping affected the groundwater flow field in the Upper Muschelkalk aquifer at distances of up to 2 km to the south.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{producing}} flash flood hazard susceptibility maps (FFHSM) using frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI) models in the Xiqu Gully (XQG) of Beijing, China. First, a total of 85 flash flood hazard locations (n = 85) were surveyed {{in the field and}} plotted using geographic information system (GIS) software. Based on the flash flood hazard locations, a flood hazard inventory map was built. Seventy percent (n = 60) of the flooding hazard locations were randomly selected for building the models. The remaining 30 % (n = 25) of the flooded hazard locations were used for validation. Considering that the XQG used to be a coal mining area, coalmine caves and subsidence caused by coal mining exist in this catchment, as well as many ground fissures. Thus, this study took the <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> level into consideration for FFHSM. The ten conditioning parameters were elevation, slope, curvature, land use, geology, soil texture, <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> area, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), and short-term heavy rain.

Since the early 1800 s, about 3000 underground mines (all but 40 of which are abandoned), have been operated in Illinois to recover coal, minerals, and earth materials. Mine subsidence, the sinking of ground over a collapsed mine, can cause damage to homes and other structures. Maps and tables created with the GIS are used to show the coincidence of underground mines with urban areas and to estimate the number and total value of housing units exposed to <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk.</b> The GIS provides capabilities that solve challenging technical aspects of this project, including compilation of data and the synthesis and presentation of large, diverse data sets.

The pluvial flood event of August 2011 in Shanghai, China is used for model calibration and simulation. Evolving patterns of inundation (area and depth) are assessed over four time periods (1991, 1996, 2001 and 2011) for the downtown area, given local changes in topography and rates of land subsidence of up to 27 mm/yr. The results show that land subsidence can lead to non-linear response of flood characteristics. However, the impact on flood depths is generally minor (< 5 cm) and limited to areas with lowest-lying topographies because of relatively uniform patterns of subsidence and micro-topographic variations at the local scale. Nonetheless, the modelling approach tested here may be applied to other cities where there are more marked rates of subsidence and/or greater heterogeneity in the depressed urban surface.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The paper deals of an applied {{hydrogeology}} {{research for}} the safe yield evaluation of the Settepolesini aquifer (Bondeno, Ferrara) with the main aim to identify new groundwater resources for municipal water supply. The research, based upon a dual approach either of continuous monitoring of Po river lateral recharge processes to the aquifer or of numerical modelling, has been conducted for 3 years (2002 - 2005) and {{had the chance to}} verify the response of the system to peculiar recharge boundary conditions with extreme hydraulic loadings (big flood of the Po river in December 2002, hystorical drought of summer 2003). The paper puts in evidence the complex mechanism of aquifer lateral recharge: pressure transfert is very fast and aquifer susceptibility to recharge signal is affected by season (higher in late winter-spring, lower in autumn); at the same time mass transfert is very low, locally faster in relationship to the occurrence of paleo-channels with higher hydraulic conductivity. Numerical modelling of the system, calibrated against the results of continuous monitoring and with the aim of forecasting groundwater abstraction schemes, has put in evidence that, with an existing lateral recharge of about 600 L/s from the Po river to the I confined aquifer, it is possible to pump, at a sustainable rate, 250 L/s from the same aquifer trough a rather wide-spread well-field; direct water abstraction from Settepolesini lake cannot be higher than a critical threshold between 150 and 200 L/s. Main factors limiting a more severe exploitation are in relation with <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> (to be evaluated with specific investigations) and with the location of hazard centers near to the possible groundwater abstraction points...|$|E

This study explores the key sustainability issues in Indonesian peatlands, the ecosystem services supplied by peatlands, and potential responses to promote more sustainable peatland use. A literature review and spatial analysis were conducted. Based on predominantly government data, we estimate the amount of Indonesian peatlands that has been converted between 2000 and 2014. We quantify increases in oil palm and plantation forest crop production in this period, and we analyse key sustainability issues, i. e. peat fires and smoke-haze, soil <b>subsidence</b> and flood <b>risk,</b> CO 2 emissions, loss of habitat (in protected areas), and social conflicts that influence sustainability of Indonesian peatlands management.

However, as we examine, the uncertainties involved are substantial. Based on our findings, we distil several implications for the management of the peatlands. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of subsidence hazard assessment using geographic information systems (GIS) in an abandoned coal mine area in South Korea. A spatial database was constructed using mine drift maps, topographic maps, geologic maps, borehole data, and subsidence inventory maps representing the locations of past subsidence occurrences. Eight factor layers (drift depth, drift density, distance from nearest drift, distance from nearest railroad, rock mass rating, groundwater depth, slope, and surface runoff accumulation) were extracted from the spatial database to examine the relationships between the factors and past subsidence occurrences (training data set). A frequency ratio (FR) model was used to establish rating classes for each factor, and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was used to establish weightings for the factors. The two models were integrated to combine multiple factor layers into a subsidence hazard map. When the area under the curve technique was used to verify the subsidence hazard map, by comparing the determined hazard rankings with past subsidence occurrences (validation data set), the FR model and FR-AHP integrated model showed 97 percent and 94 percent accuracies, respectively, in predicting subsidence occurrences. Finally, the subsidence hazard map based on the FR model was overlain with exposure intensity and vulnerability maps to generate a priority setting map, representing the relative <b>risk</b> of mine <b>subsidence</b> to buildings.

40|$|The Salento Peninsula (south-eastern Italy) is {{characterized}} by sedimentary rocks. The carbonatic nature of the rocks means they are affected by karst phenomena, forming such features as sinkholes, collapsed dolines and caverns, {{as a result of}} chemical leaching of carbonates by percolating water. The instability of these phenomena often produces land subsidence problems. The importance of these events is increasing due to growing urbanization, numerous quarries affecting both the subsoil and the surface, and an important coastline characterized by cliffs. This paper focuses on geological and geophysical methods for the characterization of soft sedimentary rock, and presents the results of a study carried out in an urban area of Salento. Taking the Q system derived by Barton (2002) as the starting point for the rock mass classification, a new approach and a modification of the Barton method are proposed. The new equation proposed for the classification of sedimentary rock mass (Qsrm) takes account of the permeability of the rock masses, the geometry of the exposed rock face and their types (for example, quarry face, coastal cliff or cavity), the nature of the lithotypes that constitute the exposed sequence, and their structure and texture. This study revises the correlation between Vp and Q derived by Barton (2002), deriving a new empirical equation correlating P-wave velocities and Qsrm values in soft sedimentary rock. We also present a case history in which stratigraphical surveys, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), and seismic surveys were applied to in situ investigations of subsidence phenomena in an urban area to estimate rock mass quality. Our work shows that in the analysis of ground safety it is important to establish the rock mass quality of the subsurface structures; geophysical exploration can thus {{play a key role in}} the assessment of <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the UK, {{household}} buildings insurance generally covers {{loss and}} damage to the insured property {{from a range of}} natural and human perils, including windstorm, flood, subsidence, theft, accidental fire and winter freeze. Consequently, insurers require a reasoned view on the likely scale of losses that they may face to assist in strategic planning, reinsurance structuring, regulatory returns and general risk management. The UK summer 2007 flood events not only provided a clear indication of the scale of potential losses that the industry could face from an individual event, with £ 3 billion in claims, but also identified a need for insurers and reinsurers to better understand how events may correlate in time and space, and how to most effectively use the computational models of extreme events that are commonly applied to reflect these correlations. In addition to the potential for temporal clustering of events such as windstorms and floods, {{there is a possibility that}} seemingly uncorrelated natural perils, such as floods and subsidence, may impact an insurer’s portfolio. Where aggregations of large numbers of new properties are planned, such as in the Thames Gateway, consideration of the potential future risk of aggregate losses due to the combination of perils such as subsidence and flood is increasingly important within the insurance company’s strategic risk management process. Whilst perils such as subsidence and flooding are generally considered independent within risk modelling, the potential for one event to influence the magnitude and likelihood of the other should be taken into account when determining risk level. In addition, the impact of correlated, but distinctive, loss causing events on particular property types may be significant, particularly if a specific property is designed to protect against one peril but is potentially susceptible to another. We suggest that flood events can lead to increased <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> due to the weight of additional water and sediment, or rehydration of sediment under flood water. The latter mechanism may be particularly critical on sites where Holocene sediments are currently protected from flooding and are no longer subsiding. Holocene deposits tend to compress, either under their own weight or under a superimposed load such as made ground, built structures or flood water. If protected dry sediments become flooded in the future, subsidence would be expected to resume. This research project aims to investigate the correlation between flood hazards and subsidence hazards and the effect that these two sources of risk will have on insurance losses in the Thames Gateway. In particular, the research will explore the potential hydrological and geophysical drivers and links between flood and subsidence events within the Thames Gateway, assessing the potential for significant event occurrence within the timescales relevant to insurers. In the first part of the project we have identified flood risk areas within the Thames Gateway development zone which have a high risk of flooding and may be affected by renewed or increased subsidence. This has been achieved through the use of national and local-scale 2 D and 3 D geo-environmental information such as the Geosure dataset (e. g. swell-shrink, collapsible and compressible deposits data layers), PSI data, thickness of superficial and artificial land deposits, and flood potential data etc. In the second stage of the project we will investigate the hydrological and geophysical links between flooding and subsidence events on developed sites; quantify the insurance loss potential in the Thames Gateway from correlated flooding and subsidence events; consider how climate change will affect risk to developments in the Thames Gateway in the context of subsidence and flooding; and develop new ways of communicating and visualise correlated flood and <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> to a range of stakeholders, including the insurance industry, planners, policy makers and the general public...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} model {{for assessing the}} risk of subsidence in abandoned mines is presented. The model {{is based on the}} relationship that exists between the frequency and location of subsidence events and the physical conditions of the ground. These conditions are described by geological, mining, and physical variables. The model suggests the existence of regions in the multi-dimensional space of variables which can be associated with increases, or decreases, in the frequency of subsidence events. Regions associated with an increase in the frequency of subsidence events correspond to regions of higher risks, and vice versa. Risk is assessed by expressing the limits of these high and low risk regions in the space of variables, and by expressing the degree of membership of blocks of land within any of these regions. The theoretical framework for the model is extracted from discriminant analysis. The high and low risk regions are associated with two populations: (1) blocks which according to their ground properties are not likely to develop subsidence, and (2) blocks which are likely to develop <b>subsidence.</b> <b>Risk</b> is quantified by the probabilities of membership of blocks of land into any of these two populations. These membership probabilities are computed using discriminant functions which use geostatistical estimates of the ground's properties and the number of subsidence events registered in each of the blocks. Risk maps are produced by displaying membership probabilities contoured in appropriate levels. The model was applied in two urban areas: Penn Hills, near Pittsburgh, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in northeastern Pennsylvania. At Penn Hills, the risk maps generated were sensitive to the equal-covariance and multi-normality assumptions of the model. The risk map generated under a non-parametric approach resulted in closer agreement and comparable to an independently generated risk map. Both maps succeed in locating recent subsidence events inside medium and high risk zones in seven out of eight cases. In the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area, the risk maps generated under the equal-covariance and the multi-normality assumptions, as well as that generated under the non-parametric approach, reproduce well the present degree of subsidence in the area...|$|E
40|$|Sub-surface {{construction}} {{in urban areas}} generally involves drainage of groundwater, which can induce subsidence in soil deposits. Knowledge of where compressible sediments are located and how thick these are is essential for estimating <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk.</b> A probabilistic method for coupled bedrock-level and soil-layer modeling to detect compressible sediments is presented. The method is applied in an area in central Stockholm, where clay is the compressible sediment layer. First, a bedrock-level model was constructed from three sources of information: (a) geotechnical drillings reaching the bedrock; (b) drillings not reaching the bedrock; and (c) mapped bedrock outcrops. Input data for the probabilistic bedrock-level model was generated by a stepwise Kriging procedure. Second, a three layer soil model was constructed, including the following materials: (a) coarse grained post glacial and filling material below the ground surface; (b) glacial and post-glacial clays; and (c) coarse grained glaciofluvial and glacial till deposits above the bedrock. Layer thicknesses were transformed to proportions of the total soil thickness. Since Kriging requires data to be normally distributed, the proportions were transformed from proportions (P) to standard normal quantiles (z). In each iteration of a Monte-Carlo simulation, a spatial distribution of the bedrock level was simulated together with the transformed values for the soil-layer proportions. From the iterations, the probability density of the clay thickness (compressible sediments) at each grid cell was calculated. The results of the case study map the expected value (mean) and the 95 th percentile of the probability of compressible sediments at specific locations. The resulting model is geologically realistic and validated through a cross-validation procedure {{in order to be}} in good agreement with a reference dataset. The case study showed that the method can efficiently handle large amounts of data and requires little manual adjustment. Moreover, the mapped results can provide useful decision support when planning risk-reducing measures and when communicating with stakeholders. Although this novel method is developed for risk assessment of groundwater drawdown induced subsidence, it is useful for other applications involving spatial soil strata modeling...|$|E
40|$|UK (United Kingdom) {{infrastructure}} {{networks are}} fundamental for maintaining societal and economic wellbeing. With infrastructure assets predominantly {{founded in the}} soil layer (< 1. 5 m below ground level) {{they are subject to}} a range of soil-related geohazards. A literature review identified that geohazards including, clay-related subsidence, sand erosion and soil corrosivity have exerted significant impacts on UK infrastructure to date; often resulting in both long-term degradation and ultimately structural failure of particular assets. Climate change projections suggest that these geohazards, which are themselves driven by antecedent weather conditions, are likely to increase in magnitude and frequency for certain areas of the UK through the 21 st century. Despite this, the incorporation of climate data into geohazard models has seldom been undertaken and never on a national scale for the UK. Furthermore, geohazard risk assessment in UK infrastructure planning policy is fragmented and knowledge is often lacking due to the complexity of modelling chronic hazards in comparison to acute phenomenon such as flooding. With HM Government's recent announcement of £ 50 million planned infrastructure investment and capital projects, the place of climate resilient infrastructure is increasingly pertinent. The aim of this thesis is therefore to establish whether soil-related geohazard assessments have a role in ensuring climate-resilient UK infrastructure. Soil moisture projections were calculated using probabilistic weather variables derived from a high-resolution version of the UKCP 09 (UK Climate Projections 2009) weather generator. These were then incorporated into a geohazard model to predict Great Britain's (GB) subsidence hazard for the future scenarios of 2030 (2020 - 2049) and 2050 (2040 - 2069) as well as the existing climatic baseline (1961 - 1990). Results suggest that GB is likely to be subject to increased clay-related subsidence in future, particularly in the south east of England. This thesis has added to scientific understanding through the creation of a novel, national-scale assessment of clay <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk,</b> with future assessments undertaken to 2050. This has been used to help create a soil- informed maintenance strategy for improving the climate resilience of UK local roads, based on an extended case study utilising road condition data for the county of Lincolnshire, UK. Finally, a methodological framework has been created, providing a range of infrastructure climate adaptation stakeholders with a method for incorporating geohazard assessments, informed by climate change projections, into asset management planning and design of new infrastructure. This research also highlights how infrastructure networks are becoming increasingly interconnected, particularly geographically, and therefore even minor environmental shocks arising from soil-related geohazards can cause significant cascading failures of multiple infrastructure networks. A local infrastructure hotspot analysis methodology and case-study is provided...|$|E
40|$|Land {{subsidence}} {{affecting the}} Ravenna Municipality (Emilia Romagna Region, NE Italy) {{is one of}} the best example on how the exploitation of natural resources can affect the environment and the territory. In fact, the pumping of groundwater and the extraction of gas from both on and off-shore reservoirs, started in the 1950 s, have caused a strong land subsidence affecting most of the Emilia Romagna territory but in particular the Adriatic Sea coastline near Ravenna. In such area the current subsidence rate, even if lower than in the past, can reach the - 2 cm/y. Local Authorities have monitored this phenomenon over the years with different techniques: spirit levelling, GPS surveys and, more recently, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques, confirming the critical situation of land <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk.</b> In this work, we present the comparison between the results obtained with two different DInSAR techniques applied to the study of the land subsidence in the Ravenna territory: the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and the Coherent Pixel Technique (CPT) techniques. The SBAS works on SARscape software and is based on the Berardino et al., 2002 algorithm. This technique relies on the combination of differential interferograms created from stacks of SAR image pairs that have small temporal and perpendicular baselines. Thanks to the application of several interferograms for every single image, it is possible to obtain high spatial coherence, high data density and more effective error reduction. This allows us to obtain mean velocity maps with good data density even over non-urbanized territories. For the CPT we used the SUBsoft processor based on the algorithm implemented by Mora et al., 2003. CPT is able to extract from a stack of differential interferograms the deformation evolution over wide areas during large time spans. The processing scheme is composed of three main steps: a) the generation of the best interferogram set among all the available images of the zone under study; b) the selection of the pixels with reliable phase within the employed interferograms and, c) their phase analysis to calculate, as the main result, their deformation time series within the observation period. For this study, different SAR images have been used: 25 meters ground resolution ERS 1 / 2 (1992 - 2000) and ENVISAT (2003 - 2010), and 3 meters ground resolution TerraSAR-X (2012 - 2014). The results obtained for each stack of images with the two techniques are validated and compared with the C-GPS time series of more than three benchmarks stations. The aim is to test the two InSAR techniques in the monitoring of ground settlements in low urbanized territories. Furthermore, we have investigated the advantages (data accuracy and density) of using SAR images with higher ground resolution...|$|E
40|$|Additional Thesis - This {{thesis is}} part of a project by Deltares {{developing}} a strategy for resilient water management in Xochimilco and fulfillment of the Master degree Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Delft. Xochimilco is protected on a global level by UNESCO and deemed a World Cultural and Environmental Heritage Site, on a national level the site is a protected natural area. Xochimilco is situated in the south of the Federal District of Mexico City (UNESCO, 2006). The area {{is one of the most}} important environmental, historical and cultural symbols of Mexico City. Land subsidence is a big issue in this area, which is caused by groundwater exploitation in combination with highly compressible soils. This research developed a methodology for risk assessment that can be applied in other areas that suffer from land subsidence. The methodology was applied in Xochimilco and quantitatively and spatially assessed the risk of land subsidence caused by groundwater over-exploitation. For the development of the methodology a literature review about land subsidence in Mexico City was conducted. It is concluded that land subsidence has many associated consequences, damage to infrastructure, damage to buildings and permanent flooding were taken into account in the risk assessment. Furthermore, a literature review of current research in the field of land <b>subsidence</b> <b>risk</b> assessment was conducted. In most studies risk is regarded as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, this definition was also used in this research. At the moment the risk assessment research focusses on vulnerability parameters such as GDP and population density. However, such parameters do not focus on the damage that can occur due to land subsidence. Therefore, an analogy with the methodology for flood risk assessment was used in this study, making use of vulnerability curves. Furthermore, the developed methodology makes the distinction between damages caused by absolute and differential land subsidence. The application of the methodology resulted in a risk map of Xochimilco. This risk map reveals a large risk of damage due to land subsidence in the transition area between clayey soil and volcanic deposits. Furthermore, the map shows that a part of cultural heritage site is under threat of permanent flooding and this might even expand into urban area in the upcoming 10 years. It is recommended to prioritise mitigating measures in these areas. Further research could be conducted in assessing the accuracy of the vulnerability curves that were applied, improving the resolution of the hazard maps and applying the methodology in different areas of Mexico City, or even different cities. In the end the methodology provides an approach towards risk assessment focusing on the direct damages involved. The resulting risk map can be used in order to determine the most important areas for preventive and mitigating measures. This study reveals and interesting perspective towards land subsidence. Instead of focusing on the the exact prediction of subsidence, the spotlight is put on the consequences. An important side, easily lost sight of because land subsidence is such a slow onset hazard.
