60|$|These {{wonderful}} words {{ran into}} the country girl's blood like hot scented wine. To be beautiful made some amends for being coarse and uncultured. As <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt abasement before, so <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt the need of being beautiful until now.|$|R
60|$|He put {{her hand}} back on the bed, {{but she was not}} to be checked in that way. She persisted in asking another question.--How came Mr. Kirke to know her? <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen him; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of him in her life.|$|R
60|$|There <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been {{a desire}} within her {{that had not}} been gratified or that had grown delicious and intense through being thwarted; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> suffered, never hoped, never feared.

60|$|Naomi Holland {{looked at}} her with the {{contempt}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> made any pretense of concealing. The girl was bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> loved her; all the mother love in her had been lavished on her son.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> said {{to herself}} at any time that if Sir Lionel did propose she would accept him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{questioned}} herself as to the probability of such an event.

60|$|The {{contrast}} of Heyst's quiet, polished manner gave her special delight and {{filled her with}} admiration. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{seen anything like that}} before.

She was interested by it as a very novel experience, not very intelligible, but distinctly pleasurable.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Pope {{knew the}} wicked little flicker in Marjorie's eye better than Mr. Magnet. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> known {{it from the}} nursery, and yet <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> quite {{mastered}} its meaning. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> yet realized it was Marjorie, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> always regarded it as something Marjorie, some other Marjorie, ought to keep under control. So now she adopted a pacificatory tone.|$|R
60|$|She {{reached out}} her hand to Billy's and sighed with sheer {{repletion}} of content. It seemed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> lived such a wonderful day.

Growing up, she learned her scatting and call-and-response techniques from her father, who would scat and then make her repeat the sounds back to him.|$|E

Her views on political issues and other matters are largely subject to conjecture. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> given a press interview and is otherwise not known to discuss her personal opinions publicly.|$|E
