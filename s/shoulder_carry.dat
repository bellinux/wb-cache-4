60|$|The bald-headed man, {{taking his}} hands out of his {{breeches}} pockets, advanced on this summons, and throwing Miss Sharp's trunk over his <b>shoulder,</b> <b>carried</b> it into the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't aid himself, that is sure," [...] murmured Dave. [...] "Roger, we {{have got}} {{to get him out of}} that--before that water pouring over his <b>shoulder</b> <b>carries</b> him down!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The next picture {{deals with}} the ancient story of Orion. He is blind, and on his <b>shoulder</b> <b>carries</b> Cedalion, who directs the sightless eyes towards the East. The rising Sun heals his infirmity; and there stands Hephaestus on Lemnos, {{watching}} the cure.|$|R
60|$|So Jack {{went forward}} among crowds of admiring tars, who swore by his nut-brown beard, which had amazingly {{lengthened}} and spread during his absence. They divided his laced hat and coat among them; {{and on their}} <b>shoulders,</b> <b>carried</b> him in triumph along the gun-deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which manes, I'm to {{make myself}} ginerally useful; so here goes." [...] And Larry, {{springing}} through the bushes, proceeded to fulfil his duties, by seizing a massive log, which Maxton had just cut, and, heaving it on his powerful <b>shoulder,</b> <b>carried</b> it to the camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "The bald-headed man, {{taking his}} hands out of his breeches' pockets, {{advanced}} on this summons, and throwing Miss Sharp's trunk over his <b>shoulder,</b> <b>carried</b> it into the house." [...] Then Becky is shown into the house, and a dismantled dining-room is described, into which she {{is led by the}} dirty man with the trunk.|$|R
5000|$|Many papers, {{including}} 13 local (non-Armenian) ones, {{reported the}} news of Dkhrouni's assassination. Lebanese reporter Shoukri Sadi wrote, [...] "It {{would be hard for}} me to see another funeral procession like this, which I unfortunately became a witness to. Twenty thousand Armenians, on their <b>shoulders</b> <b>carrying</b> the coffin of a great Armenian activist". His monument is erected at the Armenian national cemetery of Beirut.|$|R
60|$|Either Nathaniel or I {{can take}} this vessel, which the savages call a canoe, on our <b>shoulders,</b> <b>carrying</b> it without difficulty, and {{when the two of}} us are inside, resting upon our knees, for we may not sit in it as in a ship's boat, we can send it along with paddles at a rate so rapid as to cause one to think it moved by magic.|$|R
50|$|While {{one report}} says Milo held his arm outstretched and challengers {{were unable to}} bend his fingers, another anecdote {{recorded}} by Claudius Aelianus (Varia historia, XII, 12) disputes Milo's reputation for enormous strength. Apparently, Milo challenged a peasant named Titormus to a trial of strength. Titormus proclaimed he had little strength, but lifted a boulder to his <b>shoulders,</b> <b>carried</b> it several meters and dropped it. Milo was unable to lift it.|$|R
50|$|On 6 December 2015 while a Russian navy warship {{was passing}} through the Bosphorus which bisects Istanbul a {{serviceman}} was seen brandishing an <b>shoulder</b> <b>carried</b> rocket launcher allegedly at the city center. Turkey has summoned the Russian attache over the incident in strong protest and threatened to close down the strait to all Russian traffic, military and civil which would cripple Russian military logistical supplies to Syria and heavily impact the Russian economy.|$|R
6000|$|Having spoken thus {{much the}} Baital said [...] "O my king! {{of these three}} {{which is the most}} {{delicate}}?" [...] The Raja answered, [...] "She indeed is the most delicate who fainted in consequence of the headache." [...] The Baital hearing this speech, went and hung himself from the very same tree, and the Raja, having gone there and taken him down and fastened him in the bundle and placed him on his <b>shoulder,</b> <b>carried</b> him away.|$|R
50|$|The DCS 100 {{retained}} many of {{the characteristics}} of the prototype, including a separate <b>shoulder</b> <b>carried</b> Digital Storage Unit (DSU) to store and to visualize the images, and to house the batteries. The DSU contained a 200 megabyte hard disk drive that could store up to 156 images without compression, or up to 600 images using a JPEG compatible compression board that was offered later as an optional extra. An external keyboard allowed entry of captions and other image information.|$|R
60|$|Inside the bay {{the seas}} ran gaily, raised the Good Hope upon their foam-flecked <b>shoulders,</b> <b>carried</b> her {{beyond the control}} of the steersman, and in a moment dropped her with a great {{concussion}} on the sand, and began to break over her, half-mast high, and roll her to and fro. Another great wave followed, raised her again, and carried her yet farther in; and then a third succeeded, and left her far inshore of the more dangerous breakers, wedged upon a bank.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{distribution}} of mass throughout a person's body, the magnitude of the reaction force varies between a person's feet and head. At any horizontal cross-section of a person's body (as with any column), the size of the compressive force being resisted by the tissues below the cross-section is equal to the weight of the portion of the body above the cross-section. In the pose adopted in the accompanying illustration, the <b>shoulders</b> <b>carry</b> the weight of the outstretched arms and are subject to a considerable torque.|$|R
50|$|The eastern elk {{was larger}} than its western cousins. A full-grown bull could weigh up to 1000 pounds, stand 50-60 inches tall at the <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>carry</b> a rack of antlers six feet in length.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Route 13 {{enters the}} state from North Carolina on a two-lane {{alignment}} without <b>shoulders,</b> <b>carrying</b> the name Whaleyville Road. It passes through the small communities of Somerton and Whaleyville, intersecting a few non-state level roads along the way. Just south of Suffolk, the route intersects Virginia State Route 32, merging with it as it passes by Suffolk Municipal Airport. Just north of this intersection, US 13 separates from the roadway at a trumpet interchange and upgrades to a freeway as it prepares to bypass {{the city on the}} Southwest Suffolk Bypass. The straight alignment carries the former US 13 as US 13 Business.|$|R
60|$|Then he must set Nada on his <b>shoulders</b> and <b>carry</b> her as once Galazi {{had carried}} another, {{for it was}} death for any except the Wolf-Brethren {{to walk on the}} Ghost Mountain when the wolves were awake.|$|R
5000|$|Andre Tiangco as Fr. George - Father [...] "Linis" [...] (Clean), this {{obsessive-compulsive}} {{priest is}} always seen {{with a towel}} draped on one <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>carrying</b> brooms and mops. He leads the priests in keeping the monastery clean.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the door}} opened and Cherokee entered in the {{conventional}} dress of Saint Nick. A white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes. Over his <b>shoulder</b> he <b>carried</b> a pack.|$|R
50|$|On Massachusetts State Route 3 and I-93 and I-95 in the Boston area, all {{vehicles}} are permitted on shoulders during peak periods only. Similarly, in Virginia on I-66, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>carries</b> general purpose traffic from 5:30-11:00 AM (eastbound) and 2:00-8:00 PM (westbound); however, during this time, the interior general purpose lane {{is open to}} HOV traffic only. I-66 uses extensive traffic signals and signage in order to communicate the active times of service. In the Seattle area, the right shoulder on the US 2 trestle near Everett is opened to all traffic in the eastbound direction during the afternoon peak period. A similar operation is provided on H1 in Honolulu in the morning peak on the right shoulder.|$|R
50|$|The Irish elk stood about 2.1 m tall at the <b>shoulders</b> <b>carrying</b> {{the largest}} antlers of any known cervid (a maximum of 3.65 m from tip to tip and {{weighing}} up to 40 kg). In body size, the Irish Elk tied with the extant moose subspecies of Alaska (Alces alces gigas) {{as the third}} largest known deer, second and first belonging to the Cervalces genus (C. scotti and C.latifrons respectively). The Irish elk is estimated to have attained a total mass of 540 - 600 kg, with large specimens having weighed 700 kg or more, roughly similar to the Alaskan Moose. A significant collection of M. giganteus skeletons {{can be found at}} the Natural History Museum in Dublin.|$|R

60|$|Two {{of the men}} hoisted the bidarka {{on their}} <b>shoulders</b> and <b>carried</b> {{it up to the}} fire. Nam-Bok walked by the side of Opee-Kwan, and the villagers {{followed}} after, save those of the women who lingered a moment to lay caressing fingers on the shawl.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman he}} {{referred}} to was old and feeble and very short sighted. She had a faded shawl over her <b>shoulders</b> and <b>carried</b> a market basket on one arm. She went out nursing among the poor people and was well known throughout the entire neighborhood.|$|R
6000|$|The poorer clans of Arabs twist round their waist, [p.238] {{next to the}} skin, a long plait of greasy leather, {{to support}} the back; and they gird the shirt at the middle merely with a cord, or with a coarse sash. The dagger is stuck in this scarf, and a bandoleer slung over the <b>shoulders</b> <b>carries</b> the cartridge-case, powder-flask, flint and steel, priming-horn, and other necessaries. With the traveller, the waist is an {{elaborate}} affair. Next to the skin is worn the money-pouch, concealed by the Kamis; the latter is girt with a waist shawl, over which is strapped a leathern belt.[FN#27] The latter article should always be well garnished {{with a pair of}} long-barrelled and silver-mounted flint pistols,[FN#28] a large and a small dagger, and an ...|$|R

60|$|January 28.--Continued {{my reading}} with the {{commentary}} of the D. of W.[456] If his broad <b>shoulders</b> cannot <b>carry</b> me through, the devil {{must be in}} the dice.

5000|$|After {{the film}} was over {{we were unable to}} leave our seats. We just nodded at each other and smiled, and began to whisper.

6000|$|The cadets {{rushed out}} and to the lake-shore, and soon several bonfires were blazing merrily. Around these the {{students}} congregated, and sang songs and [...] "cut up" [...] generally.

50|$|In {{the arcade}} game Ghouls'n'Ghosts, Dullahan {{is the first}} end of level boss. He appears as a large statue which sheds its stone skin as the player approaches.

60|$|In short, {{there was}} almost no end to what that bark canoe could hold; yet that Indian, with the stiff black hair, could lift it off the ground, when empty, lay it on his <b>shoulders,</b> and <b>carry</b> it for miles through the forest. The other canoes were much the same as this one.|$|R
