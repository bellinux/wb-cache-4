5|$|Two {{extensive}} espionage {{cases in}} Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, {{and later the}} local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talkoften {{under the influence of}} alcoholto the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that hefrom February 1943 to April 1951had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, who was arrested on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbottens flygbaskår. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, {{the tabloid}} Expressen accused Guillou {{of having been}} active {{as an agent of}} the Soviet spy {{organization}} KGB between 1967 and 1972. Jan Guillou confirmed he had a series of contacts with KGB representatives during this period, he also admits to having received payments from KGB, but maintains that his purpose was to collect information for his journalistic work. The accusation was based on documents released from the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> (Säpo) and interviews with former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky. In a later trial, Expressen denied having accused Guillou of having been a Soviet spy, claiming that this was a false interpretation of its headlines and reporting.|$|E
25|$|After the spy had {{returned}} to Sweden, Guillou in advance placed the article in a major newspaper and with a television news editor. He also contacted the Foreign Department {{in order to prevent}} official denials, and discuss the repercussions of the espionage exposure. The published article was a true 'scoop', and the CIA spy handler was ordered to leave Sweden together with a colleague. The spy himself, avoided prosecution thanks to the article's portrayal of him as a rather heroic journalist, exposing foreign illegal operations to the public. Afterwards, both he and Jan Guillou were interrogated by the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service,</b> but for assumed political reasons, no criminal charges were made. This time, the system worked to the journalist's advantage.|$|E
25|$|A {{parliamentary}} commission, led by Carl Lidbom, {{was subsequently}} appointed {{to look into}} Swedish terror legislation. It concluded on 8 December 1972 that new legislation was indeed needed, cited the increase in terrorism both domestically and abroad. It proposed the need for easing deportation of people suspected of belonging to terrorist groups or partaking in politically motivated violence. A preliminary debate took place in Parliament on 11 December, and a proposal for legislation was presented by the cabinet on 19 January 1973. It was initially limited in duration from 15 April 1973 to 14 April 1974. The main debate in Parliament took place on 6 April, where it was passed with a large majority. The Terrorism Act gave increased rights for {{the police and the}} <b>Swedish</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> to deport foreigners and undercover surveillance of suspects. However, it was met with criticism that it reduced the civil rights of innocent foreigners. The law was permanently prolonged the following year.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to describe and compare how the <b>Swedish</b> <b>security</b> policy is organized and how it has changed since the Cold War ended. To do that, I’m going to try answer the following questions: How is the <b>Swedish</b> <b>security</b> policy organized? What defence resolutions have affected the <b>Swedish</b> <b>security</b> policy after the Cold War ended? How has different political actions made {{its impact on the}} <b>Swedish</b> <b>security</b> policy after the Cold War ended? My theory is to try explain how the <b>Swedish</b> <b>security</b> policy has changed after the Cold War through a realism security perspective called traditional security, which refers to a realistic construct of the states security policy. Furthermore, to explain Sweden’s security policy and its changes, I’m going to use the three defence resolution from 1996, 2000 and 2009. In addition, books and articles will also be used to explain how Sweden’s security policy is conducted and how it was developed after the Cold War ended. The results showed that Sweden’s security policy has gone through some substantially changes.   Words: 11 854   Keywords: Sweden, Security policy, Sweden after the 1990 s, Official, Swedish defense resolutions...|$|R
