5|$|Canavan's {{name was}} already known around Tyrone {{because of his}} {{exploits}} for the Under 21 team, but he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an impact in the Ulster Senior Football Championship in 1994, as Tyrone lost to eventual All-Ireland champions, Down. He was the top scorer in the province, earning him his first All Star, {{at the age of}} 23.|$|E
5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord the {{new leader}} of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if {{he was elected to}} parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Coulson {{was called}} into the England {{national}} C team in September 2010 for a match against Wales, but injury prevented him from making his debut. In February 2012, he received a second call up, being selected in the squad to face Italy in the 2011–13 International Challenge Trophy on 28 February. Coulson <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his England C debut, playing the entire match as he and fellow winger Matty Blair played well on the flanks, the match finishing a 1–1 home draw. He finished his England C career with two caps, earned in 2012.|$|E

5|$|SOE agent Richard Lippett had {{obtained}} employment with the shipping company John Holt & Co (Liverpool), which had business offices on the island. Having {{taken up the}} post he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> preparations for the raid. He became aware that the crew of Duchessa d'Aosta were {{in the habit of}} accepting invitations to parties ashore and had held their own party aboard ship on 6 January 1942. Under the guise of a party-goer Lippett managed to gain information about the readiness of the ship for sea, crew numbers, and the watch arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The first {{identified}} {{tropical storm}} {{of the season}} is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as having formed on June 24, positioned in the western Caribbean Sea; the estimate for this location was based on ship reports, although the information was insufficient to guarantee an accurate position. It initially meandered west-northwestward, though began to turn northwest during {{the latter half of}} following day. Late on June 26, it passed between the Yucatán Peninsula and Cuba, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter. The tropical storm continued to slowly intensify, and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sharp curve towards the northeast on June 28.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of heavy canvas {{was started in}} 1828 by Michael Nairn at a small factory. Influenced by a visit to Bristol, Nairn <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> floorcloth at his new factory at Pathhead in 1847, where his company pioneered the use of ovens to season the floorcloth and reduce production times. When the patent belonging to Frederick Walton expired, Nairn's were able to manufacture linoleum from 1877 onwards. Other factories producing floorcloth and later linoleum were established by former employees of Michael Nairn.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incarceration of the Thapas, a new {{government}} with joint mukhtiyars was formed with Rangnath Paudel {{as the head of}} civil administration, and Dalbarjan Pande and Ranjang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as mukhtiyar and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole mukhtiyar.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2014, the {{low-level}} circulation {{centre of}} Qendresa formed near Kerkennah Islands. As {{the system was}} moving north-northeastwards and combining with an upper-level low from Tunisia early on 7 November, the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye-like feature, thanks to favourable conditions. Qendresa directly hit Malta when it had lost its fronts with a more well-defined eye, with ten-minute sustained winds at 110.9km/h (68.9mph) and the gust at 153.7km/h (95.5mph). The central pressure was presumed to be 978 hPa (28.88 inHg). Interacting with Sicily, the cyclone turned northeastwards and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an anticlockwise loop. On 8 November, Qendresa crossed Syracuse {{in the morning and}} then significantly weakened. Turning southeastwards then moving eastwards, Qendressa moved over Crete, before dissipating over the island on November 11.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

5|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} {{at the end}} of the second lap and the race got underway again with Häkkinen in the lead. The Finn allowed teammate Coulthard to move into the lead and was passed by both Ferrari drivers later on the same lap. At the competition of the third lap, Coulthard led from Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Häkkinen, Wurz, Villeneuve, Irvine, Frentzen, Herbert, Button. Mika Salo, Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher, Marc Gené, Gastón Mazzacane, Verstappen, Alesi and Trulli. Coulthard began to immediately pull clear of Michael Schumacher as he began setting consecutive fastest laps. On lap four, Häkkinen was given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for jumping the start. Zonta moved into ninth position after overtaking Button and Herbert. Button lost a further position to Salo on the same lap. Meanwhile, Verstappen <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up positions when he claimed sixteenth position from Gené. Häkkinen took his penalty on lap five, and re-emerged in 18th. Frentzen went off the track and subsequently made a pit stop for repairs on the same lap. Verstappen overtook Ralf Schumacher to claim 14th position.|$|E
5|$|At Copán ritual offerings were {{deposited}} {{around the}} city's stelae {{until at least}} 1000, which may represent the offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or {{may be due to}} highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin. A small number of sculpted stelae once stood at Cerro Quiac in the Guatemalan Highlands, and are presumed to have been erected by Mam Maya in the 13th or 14th century. At Lamanai in Belize, Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small Postclassic platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century. At La Milpa, also in Belize, at around the time of Spanish contact in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> offerings of Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the Spanish onslaught. A plain stela in Twin Pyramid Group R at Tikal was removed by the local inhabitants some time during the Postclassic; its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location. Some plain stelae were raised at Topoxté in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala in the Postclassic; these were perhaps covered in stucco and painted. This may represent a revival of the katun-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, and reflected ties with the northern Yucatán.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front and then all but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and disinfect the shed and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, The Doctor and La Patrie. As the French authorities began {{to take control of}} the situation, Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often make much of this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.|$|E
