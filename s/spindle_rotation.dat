Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were carried on non-ferrous metals in a vertical milling machine with various <b>spindle</b> <b>rotations,</b> feed rate and depth of penetration.

40|$|SummaryCultured {{adherent}} cells divide on the substratum, {{leading to}} {{formation of the}} cell monolayer. However, how the orientation of this anchorage-dependent cell division is regulated remains unknown. We have previously shown that integrin-dependent adhesion orients the spindle parallel to the substratum, which ensures this anchorage-dependent cell division. Here, we show that phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate (PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3) is essential for this spindle orientation control. In metaphase, PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 is accumulated in the midcortex in an integrin-dependent manner. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol- 3 -OH kinase (PI(3) K) reduces the accumulation of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and induces spindle misorientation. Introduction of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 to these cells restores the midcortical accumulation of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and proper spindle orientation. PI(3) K inhibition causes dynein-dependent <b>spindle</b> <b>rotations</b> along the z-axis, resulting in spindle misorientation. Moreover, dynactin, a dynein-binding partner, is accumulated in the midcortex in a PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 -dependent manner.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the tracking performance of PID, Gain Scheduling and Cascade P/PI controller with the existence of disturbance forces in the form of cutting forces. Cutting force characteristics at different cutting parameters; such as <b>spindle</b> speed <b>rotations</b> is analysed using Fast Fourier Transform. The tracking performance of a classical cascade controller in presence of these cutting forces is compared to the PID controller and gain scheduling PID controller. Robustness of these controllers in compensating different cutting characteristics is compared based on reduction in the amplitudes of cutting force harmonics using Fast Fourier Transform. It is found that the cascade controller performs better than both PID controller and gain scheduling PID controller.

It is part of a multichaperone complex that senses damaged cytoskeletal proteins and orchestrates their seclusion and/or degradation by selective autophagy. Here we describe a novel role for the BAG 3 -HSPB 8 complex in mitosis, a process involving profound changes in cell tension homeostasis. BAG 3 is hyperphosphorylated at mitotic entry and localizes to centrosomal regions. BAG 3 regulates, in an HSPB 8 -dependent manner, the timely congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate by influencing the three-dimensional positioning of the mitotic spindle. Depletion of BAG 3 caused defects in cell rounding at metaphase and dramatic blebbing of the cortex associated with abnormal <b>spindle</b> <b>rotations.</b> Similar defects were observed upon silencing of the autophagic receptor p 62 /SQSTM 1 that contributes to BAG 3 -mediated selective autophagy pathway.

Proper spindle positioning was rescued in BAG 3 -depleted cells upon addition of the lectin concanavalin A, which restores cortex rigidity.

The estimation of simple testing method resulted response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable, that is cutting force which the greatest value gained at level : <b>spindle</b> <b>rotation</b> by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (1. 5 mm), feed motion by level 3 (0. 009 mm/rev) and the specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). By measuring with Taguchi method, the greatest value of cutting force yielded at level: <b>spindle</b> <b>rotation</b> by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6).

Cutting tools with plates 10 х 10 mm out of ВК 8 according to State Standard 19051 - 80 were used for turning. Cutting modes: cutting depth – 0. 8 mm, longitudinal feed – 0. 15 mm/rot., <b>spindle’s</b> <b>rotation</b> frequency during turning – 200 … 360 rot. /min. Lubricating and cooling liquids were not applied. Evaluation of iron workability was produced by determining the linear tool flank wear per unit length of the cutting path. Findings.

It was established that {{with the increase of}} Cr content in the cast iron to 14. 8 % the cutting tool’s wear decreased as a result of formation of carbide eutectic which destroyed the doped ledeburite continuous frame. Further increase of chromium content promoted appearing of chromic carbides with high microhardness which considerably increased the tool’s wear. The conducted research shown that the minimum cutting tool’s wear 0, 18 mkm/m was observed during the machining of cast iron containing: 1. 09 % C, 14. 8 % Cr, 2. 3 % Mn and 1. 2 % Ni; and the maximum wear is 48, 96 mkm/m – when the content was: 3. 91 % C, 11. 43 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni.

40|$|SummaryIn all {{eukaryotic}} cells, correct {{segregation of}} the genetic material during cell division requires proper positioning and alignment of the mitotic spindle {{with respect to the}} cell division plane. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the spindle is aligned by interphase microtubules during early mitosis [1], and by astral microtubules and cell shape during late mitosis [2]. However, the mechanisms that control spindle alignment in mid-mitosis are not known. The lack of such a control could lead to extensive <b>spindle</b> <b>rotation</b> and misalignment, which, in turn, would result in chromosome mis-segregation if spindle elongation were impaired [1]. Here, we show that the association of mitochondria with the spindle poles reduces <b>spindle</b> <b>rotation.</b> In wild-type cells, spindles with associated mitochondria did not rotate as much as free spindles. In a mutant lacking the centrosomin-related protein Mto 1 p, the association between mitochondria and spindles was reduced and the spindles rotated more than those in wild-type cells. We propose that there is a symbiotic relationship between mitochondria and the mitotic spindle, in which close association between the two organelles facilitates the positioning of both: while the spindle helps to segregate mitochondria equally among the nascent daughter cells [3], mitochondria decrease <b>spindle</b> <b>rotation</b> and thus promote spindle alignment...|$|E

They allowed the spinner to slowly lower, or drop, the spindle as it was spinning, thus allowing a greater quantity of yarn to be created before it had to be wound onto the spindle; hence the name [...] "drop spindle," [...] which is now most commonly used for the hand spindle with whorl attached.|$|R
50|$|Cell {{division}} {{orientation is}} of the major importance for tissue architecture, cell fates and morphogenesis. Cells tend to divide along their long axis according of so-called Hertwig rule. The axis of cell division {{is determined by the}} orientation of the spindle apparatus. Cells divide along the line connecting two centrosomes of spindle apparatus. After formation, the <b>spindle</b> apparatus undergoes <b>rotation</b> inside the cell. The astral microtubules, originating from centrosomes reach the cell membrane where they are pulled towards specific cortical clues. In vitro, the distribution of cortical clues set up by the adhesive pattern. In vivo polarity cues are determined by localization of Tricellular junctions localized at cell vertices. The spatial distribution of cortical clues leads to the force field that determine final spingle apparatus orientation and following orientation of cell division.|$|R
