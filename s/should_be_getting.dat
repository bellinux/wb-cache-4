Smash accepts a scholarship to the prestigious TMU. However, Smash punches a white teenager who sexually harasses his sister when they're at the movies.

He later commits to Whitmore University, a smaller historically black college that is more highly regarded for its academics than its athletic programs. The football coach at Whitmore has a strong relationship with Coach Taylor, and had been scouting Smash since he was in middle school.|$|E

[...] Griffin however was disappointed that events from the previous episode were ignored, believing {{it to be a}} mistake to continue emphasising formulaic storytelling rather than a serialized format. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times felt that despite the extra ten minutes, [...] "Bound" [...] was [...] "more like a two-hour episode... being crammed into half the time". He thought the episode's four writers were [...] "all busy", as there were three stories going on at once, and compared Olivia to the similarly characterized Lost character Jack Shephard.

A few scenes were changed prior to filming; in an early draft of the script Elaine sat next to George eavesdropping on Jerry and Ray's conversation. She would wear a floppy hat to look inconspicuous and would complain about it, stating that she looks like one of the Cowsills, a singing group that was active between the 1960s and 1970s. The same scene initially featured George admitting that he spied on Ray a day earlier, showing Ray pictures of him in a bar. Ray would reply that it was his day off and asks why George is not at work, to which George replies that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> back and leaves.

Bee Xiong, a Hmong leader in Philadelphia, stated that by the late 1970s there were up to 5,000 Hmong in Philadelphia but by in 1984 there were 650 Hmong. Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives who were already there. Reverend Edward V. Avery, a Roman Catholic priest quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer, stated that unemployed black youths questioned why Hmong people instead of native-born U.S. citizens received the federal aid, and that contributed to violence against Hmong people. A U.S. Attorney, Edward S.G. Dennis, had begun an investigation by 1984. His office asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine if there was a hate crime. By the same year Xiong opened an employment assistance office to stabilize what was left of the Hmong population. He had used $100,000 in federal grants.|$|E

This was an observational, prospective, cross sectional study. Total 200 subjects and their prescriptions were studied in which 100 subjects were from ENT department of civil hospital, Nashik, India and 100 were from private ENT hospital, Nashik, India. Drug Utilization Form was filled with the help of Prescribed Drugs and Interview of subjects. Study core indicators were studied. DU 90 % was achieved with Amoxicillin, Azithromycin, Sulfamethoxazole + Trimethoprim and Cefixime which were the most prescribed drugs with having percentage of prescribing 52. 5 %, 22. 5 %, 7. 5 %, 6 % respectively. The average number of drugs per prescription was 03. Present study showed that percentage of prescriptions with an antibiotic prescribed was 91. 5 %. Percentage of drugs prescribed from essential drug list was 56. 75 %.
