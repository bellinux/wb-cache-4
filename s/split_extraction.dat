40|$|Abstract 3. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS The {{possibility}} {{of using a}} racetrack microtron equipped with an L-band linac for irradiation processing has been stud-ied. Extraction of both 5 and 10 MeV electron beams is possi-ble and the beam power was calculated {{to be at least}} 50 kW at 10 MeV. A &am <b>split</b> <b>extraction</b> and an achromatic transport system for double-sided irradiation at 10 MeV is also dis-cussed. Table 1 lists the RTM parameters. AW was chosen to 2. 5 MeV giving the possibility to extract both 5 and 10 MeV elec-trons from the accelerator. Generally 10 MeV is the upper limit for irradiation with electrons and 5 MeV is the maxi-mum allowed electron energy for generating photons in in-dustrial applications[21. Table 1. 10 MeV RTM, General Parameters 1, INTRODU~X~N Interest in high current accelerators in the energy range of 5 to 10 MeV for use in industrial irradiation applications has grown in recent years. The beam power at 10 MeV electron energy is normally 20 to 50 kW. At 5 MeV the power equire-ments are generaIly much larger as electrons at this energy often are used for bremsstrahlung generation with low (- 5 %) electrons to photons conversion efficiency. A linear accelera-tor (linac) is most commonly used at 10 MeV. while at 5 MeV the accelerator fpreference so far is high power DC-type. The racetrack microtron (RTM) equipped with a small standing wave linac offers a competitive alternative to the linac in size, &am quality, stability, power conversion effi-ciency and cost.

It is shown that the particular periodic arrangement of nanodisks selects a single resonance from a wide set of ring resonator modes and removes mode <b>splitting.</b> <b>Extraction</b> of the waveguided electromagnetic energy into evanescent plasmonic modes enhances light-analyte interaction and increases device sensitivity to variation of {{refractive index}} up to 176 nm/RIU (about 2 -fold increase compared to the unmodified ring), which is useful for sensor applications.

A short sketch of the model including the relativistic T- and G-matrix and the mapping of the G-matrix onto density dependent vertex functionals in the density dependent relativistic hadron field theory (DDRH) is given. From new spectroscopic data on medium mass hypernuclei we extract the single particle spectrum including spin-orbit <b>splitting.</b> An <b>extraction</b> of the Λω vector- and tensor vertex {{as well as the}} Λσ-vertex shows a strong breaking of SU(3) symmetry. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{language}} processing tasks {{can be reduced}} to breaking the text into segments with prescribed properties. Such tasks include sentence <b>splitting,</b> tokenization, named-entity <b>extraction,</b> and chunking. We present a new model of text segmentation based on ideas from multilabel classification. Using this model, we can naturally represent segmentation problems involving overlapping and non-contiguous segments. We evaluate the model on entity extraction and noun-phrase chunking and show that it is more accurate for overlapping and non-contiguous segments, but it still performs well on simpler data sets for which sequential tagging has been the best method. ...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{positive}} {{results of a}} three-year measurement campaign at the CERN Proton Synchrotron, a study of a possible implementation of the proposed Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) based on beam splitting with stable islands in the transverse phase space was undertaken. A substantial reduction of beam losses, {{with respect to the}} present extraction scheme, could be achieved with the proposed technique when delivering the high-intensity proton beams required for the planned CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso Project. Major modifications to the ring layout are needed, such as a new design of the extraction bumps including also the installation of three additional kickers to create a closed-bump over the five turns used to extract the split beam. The ring aperture was reviewed and improvements are proposed to reduce possible beam losses between beam <b>splitting</b> and <b>extraction.</b> The goal is to implement the proposed changes by beginning of 2008 and to commission the novel extraction during the 2008 PS physics run...|$|R
40|$|Tailored {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} (scCO(2)) extraction of alkyhesorcinols (ARs) from rye bran resulting in pre-purification of ARs already during extraction process. The pre-purification was achieved by <b>splitting</b> the <b>extraction</b> process in 2 steps [...] In both steps, the CO 2 pressure was set at 25 MPa with a flow rate of 10 g/min. The first step was carried out at 70 degrees C. 0. 06 % of ethanolic co-solvent for 2 h, followed by the second step at 45,C using 10 % of ethanolic co-solvent for 4 h, resulting in a pre-purified ARs extract. From the pre-purified scCO(2) extract, chromatographed on C 8 column, were obtained pure ARs homologues of C 17, C 19 and C 21 (68 % of total) eluting separately in a linear gradient of ethanol. Additionally, a rapid method for the isolation of high purified pools of ARs homologues using a disposable solid phase extraction SPE-C 18 column and a step gradient of ethanol was developed.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{provides}} an experimental assessment of temperature dependence of mobility for advanced short-channel strained devices. By accurate <b>split</b> C–V mobility <b>extraction</b> under various temperatures, {{we examine the}} impact of process-induced uniaxial strain on the temperature dependence of mobility and mobility enhancement in nanoscale pMOSFETs. Our study in-dicates that the strain sensitivity of hole mobility becomes less with increasing temperature, and it is consistent with previous mechanical-bending result. Furthermore, the carrier-scattering mechanism for the pMOSFET under uniaxial compressive strain tends to be more phonon limited at a given vertical electric field, which explains the larger drain current sensitivity to temperature present in the compressively strained PFET.

40|$|The beam control {{renovation}} {{project for}} CERN’s PS Booster (PSB) {{was started in}} autumn 2008. Its aim is to equip all four PSB rings with modern digital beam control systems, characterised by fully-PPM parameters and complete remote control. Additionally, all intermediate and input/output signals are to be remotely acquired in a digital way and in full PPM fashion, and displayed via the Oasis application program. The same digital technology concepts have already been successfully applied to the LEIR beam control system, which has acted as a pilot project for the whole PS Complex renovation project. This new technology allows a very flexible performance and can improve the system maintainability by becoming the standard for the PS Complex beam controls. This note details {{the first step in}} the PSB consolidation project, namely the beam control prototype tests carried out on PSB ring 4 in October and November 2008. Both C 02 and C 04 RF system have been successfully controlled; bunch <b>splitting</b> and <b>extraction</b> synchronisation at harmonics h = 1 and h = 2 have also been carried out. This note gives an overview of the system hardware and software capabilities and of the beam results obtained. Finally, some hints on the future work planned for the PSB consolidation project are provided...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, I study {{instances}} of noun phrase conjunction where the conjoined noun phrase is {{subject and the}} referents of the conjuncts are human, of the type ‘John and Mary are having lunch’. More specifically, I study different, possible splits that occur in such structures, which involve the disruption of the phrasal continuity of the conjuncts, resulting in structures roughly equivalent to ‘they are having lunch with Mary’ and ‘John are having lunch with Mary’. I claim that such splits are allowed by the inherent asymmetries of conjunctional structures, and I see them as functionally motivated by a play of prominence of the conjuncts involved. In the paper, I advance a typology of such splits in three subtypes: (i) splits by elision, where the conjuncts form a constituent but their phrasal contiguity is disrupted because the more salient conjunct is elided due to its topicality; (ii) <b>splits</b> by <b>extraction,</b> where the salient conjunct is given even more prominence by being extracted to a topical position thus breaking {{the continuity of the}} conjuncts; and (iii) splits by integration, where the role of the less salient conjunct is upgraded by means of dual or plural agreement on the verb. The constructions equally involve standard coordinative structures of the type ‘Mary and I’ as well as other non-coordinative types such as inclusory conjunction among others...|$|R

Recognition of frontal poses is required as a preprocessing step to face analysis algorithms (e. g. face or facial expression recognition) that can operate only on frontal views. A novel frontal facial pose recognition technique {{that is based}} on discriminant image <b>splitting</b> for feature <b>extraction</b> is presented in this paper. Spatially homogeneous and discriminant regions for each facial class are produced. The classical image splitting technique is used in order to determine those regions. Thus, each facial class is characterized by a unique region pattern which consists of homogeneous and discriminant 2 -D regions. The mean intensities of these regions are used as features for the classification task. The proposed method has been tested on data from the XM 2 VTS facial database with very satisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} Knowledge Discovery has always {{attracted}} many researchers {{and continues to}} be of great relevance to the computer science community in the branch of learning. This thesis aims to contribute to this topic, getting hints from the Ontology and Data Mining environments. We investigate a method for extracting new implicit knowledge directly from an ontology by using an inductive/deductive approach. By giving a sort of Bayesian interpretation to relationships that already exist in an ontology, we are able to return the extracted knowledge in form of Influence Rules. The idea is to <b>split</b> the <b>extraction</b> process in two separate phases by exploiting the ontology peculiarity of keeping metadata (the schema) and data (the instances) separate. The deductive process draws inference from the ontology structure, both concepts and properties, by applying link analysis techniques and producing a sort of implications (rules schemas) in which only the most important concepts are involved. Then an inductive process, realized by a data mining algorithm, explores the ontology instances for enriching the implications and building the final rules. A final rule has a form like where premise and consequence refer to the class names, and values to their datatype properties, while w, the weight, measures the strength of the influence. An example of a final rule is: Manager. hasAge < 45 →^ 0. 80 Project. hasDegreeOfSuccess = good. This can be read as, in 80...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} include automatic recovery and visualization of a 3 D chromosome structure from a sequence of 2 D tomographic reconstruction images taken through the nucleus of a cell. Structure {{is very important for}} biologists as it affects chromosome functions, behavior of the cell and its state. Analysis of chromosome structure is significant in the detection of diseases, identification of chromosomal abnormalities, study of DNA structural conformation, in-depth study of chromosomal surface morphology, observation of in vivo behavior of the chromosomes over time, and in monitoring environmental gene mutations. The methodology incorporates thresholding based on a histogram analysis with a polyline <b>splitting</b> algorithm, contour <b>extraction</b> via active contours, and detection of the 3 D chromosome structure by establishing corresponding regions throughout the slices.

Then pions and kaons are produced which partially decayed into muons and muon neutrinos (CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso, CNGS). The neutrinos traveled further to the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) 730 km away, where the OPERA detector is located. GPS was used to synchronize the clocks and to determine the exact distance. In addition, optical fibers were used for signal transmission at LNGS. The temporal distribution of the proton extractions was statistically compared with approximately 16000 neutrino events. OPERA measured an early neutrinos arrival of approximately 60 nanoseconds, as compared to the expected arrival at the speed of light, thus indicating a neutrino speed faster than that of light. Contrary to the MINOS result, the deviation was 6σ and thus apparently significant.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} long-branch attraction, and in {{particular}} methods suggested to detect and avoid the artifact to date, is reviewed. Methods suggested to avoid LBA-artifacts include excluding long-branch taxa, excluding faster evolving third codon positions, using inference methods less sensitive to LBA such as likelihood, the Aguinaldo et al. approach, sampling more taxa to break up long branches and sampling more characters especially of another kind, and {{the pros and cons}} of these are discussed. Methods suggested to detect LBA are numerous and include methodological disconcordance, RASA, separate partition analyses, parametric simulation, random outgroup sequences, long-branch <b>extraction,</b> <b>split</b> decomposition and spectral analysis. Less than 10 years ago it was doubted if LBA occurred in real datasets. Today, examples are numerous in the literature and it is argued that the development of methods to deal with the problem is warranted. A 16 kbp dataset of placental mammals and a morphological and molecular combined dataset of gall wasps are used to illustrate the particularly common problem of LBA of problematic ingroup taxa to outgroups. The preferred methods of separate partition analysis, methodological disconcordance, and long branch extraction are used to demonstrate detection methods. It is argued that since outgroup taxa almost always represent long branches and are as such a hazard towards misplacing long branched ingroup taxa, phylogenetic analyses should always be run with and without the outgroups included. This will detect whether only the outgroup roots the ingroup or if it simultaneously alters the ingroup topology, in which case previous studies have shown that the latter is most often the worse. Apart from that LBA to outgroups is the majo...|$|R
