25|$|In 1896, {{the wife}} of Nicholas II was {{credited}} {{for the creation of}} another garden (35) on the former parade ground, beneath the windows of the Imperial Family's private apartments. She had found it disconcerting that the public could <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> her windows. The garden was created by landscape architect Georg Kuphaldt, the director of the Riga city gardens and parks. This is only one of two gardens which remain today at the palace.|$|E
500|$|West {{was also}} {{regarded}} for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as [...] "obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win… {{a level of}} intensity so high it could melt lead". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: [...] "He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> space. A loss just ripped his guts out." [...] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a [...] "Jerry West Night", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: [...] "Jerry, you are, {{in every sense of}} the word, truly a champion… If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nostradamus practised scrying; {{he would}} <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> {{a bowl of}} water or a [...] "magic mirror" [...] to see the future {{while he was in}} trance.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes, and Lieut. D'Hubert <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> them incredulously.|$|R
60|$|Lying {{back in the}} {{recesses}} of that old chair, he <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the fire.|$|R
60|$|White-faced and trembling, young Espinosa <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the pitiless {{blue eyes}} that so {{steadily}} regarded him.|$|R
2500|$|The media most {{commonly}} used in scrying are reflective, refractive, translucent, or luminescent surfaces or objects such as crystals, stones, or glass in various shapes such as crystal balls, mirrors, reflective black surfaces such as obsidian, water surfaces, fire, or smoke, {{but there is no}} special limitation on the preferences or prejudices of the scryer; some may <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> pitch dark, clear sky, clouds, shadows, or light patterns against walls, ceilings, or pond beds. Some prefer glowing coals or shimmering mirages. Some simply close their eyes, notionally staring at the insides of their own eyelids, and speak of [...] "eyelid scrying".|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{public was}} outraged on hearing the verdict. [...] The {{following}} {{ran in the}} Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shinbun, a paper that publicly protested the event in print. [...] "No matter how ignorant you may think the Japanese are, to claim that they could <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the face of danger and fail to recognize {{the gravity of the}} situation is absurd. [...] The idea that these people were too stupid to know how to save themselves or even get help from others is a grave fallacy." [...] Donations poured in {{from all over the country}} to support the families of the victims who lost their lives. [...] Entire newspapers covered nothing but stories about the incident for days on end, supported by mournful editorials and articles calling for the removal of the officials in question. [...] Even well-known legal scholars openly accused Captain Drake. [...] Fringe politicians across the land held open meetings in which they publicly condemned Britain's violence and record of violating human rights while they rallied for the return of political power to the Japanese people.|$|E
60|$|But she {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the fire, {{as though she had}} not heard me.|$|E
50|$|When she <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the sun, {{she starts}} crying. The {{pigmentation}} in her irises makes her weak against bright lights.|$|R
60|$|Her husband started, <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> her face, {{drew her}} {{to the front of}} the rock, and pointed with his finger.|$|R
60|$|Holmes sat {{for some}} little time {{twisting}} this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the fire.|$|R
60|$|He looked {{straight}} into his wife’s eyes. The enlarged pupils {{of the woman}} received his <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> their unfathomable depths.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} has spoken to a girl for years. What a lesson this is to us, Jeeves, not to shut {{ourselves}} up in country houses and <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> glass tanks. You can't be the dominant male {{if you do that}} sort of thing. In this life, you can choose between two courses. You can either shut yourself up in a country house and <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> tanks, or you can be a dasher with the sex. You can't do both." ...|$|E
60|$|The man {{appeared}} to listen, but made no reply. Suddenly he started up, and, {{leaning on his}} elbow, looked with an awfully earnest <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> Ned's face.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> vacancy, and I {{wondered}} whether anyone {{could be quite}} so innocent of guile as he looked.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{during which}} Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the {{crackling}} fire.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> that haggard face, {{and through}} the {{half-mask}} of stubbly beard gradually made out the features of her brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} is young, very young, only a girl," [...] replied {{the captain of the}} Minerva, {{continuing}} to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the blackness that hid the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] {{she said}} under her breath. But he stood {{holding on to}} them, trying to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> her eyes which did not waver. Then she said quietly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... (They {{go out on}} {{the porch}} and stand just outside the door [...] waiting for Eileen to notice them; but the girl in bed [...] {{continues}} to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the woods, oblivious to their presence.) ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the two <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> each other's eyes, Harry fascinated, the man filled with wrath and a cruel, sneering humour.|$|R
60|$|BARTHWICK. Want what we've got! [He <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> space.] My dear, {{what are}} you talking about? [With a contortion.] I 'm no alarmist.|$|R
60|$|Dromore {{drew the}} curtain again across the picture, {{and came back}} to the fire. And for a full minute he <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> it.|$|R
60|$|The query was {{addressed}} to her stark naked baby, which broke from a tremendous <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> a benignant laugh, that {{had the effect of}} shutting up its eyes {{at the same time that}} it opened its little mouth.|$|E
60|$|Vigorous puffs, and a {{resolute}} <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the grate, declared {{he had no}} ear {{for this}} appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton's tones, and entered.|$|E
6000|$|... [A March morning, {{verging on}} seven o'clock, throws its cheerless [...] <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the private drawing-room of MARIE LOUISE, animating [...] the gilt {{furniture}} {{to only a}} feeble shine. Two chamberlains of [...] the palace are there in waiting. They look from the windows and [...] yawn.] ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 1973 film American Graffiti, Richard Dreyfuss' {{character}} sings {{along to}} the song while he <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the window of an appliance store.|$|R
60|$|In silence they <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> {{the woods}} while her fingers {{smoothed}} his knuckles. Her eyes were faint with tears, in the magic jade light.|$|R
60|$|We <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> one another's eyes. The area of {{the crater}} had become {{enormously}} vast to our imaginations, the growing thickets already impenetrably dense.|$|R
60|$|Her {{last words}} {{came out of the}} darkness, which wrapped itself solidly about the boat. Yet they {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the blackness in the direction in which the boat had disappeared, listening to the steady click of the oars in the rowlocks until it faded away and ceased.|$|E
6000|$|Vanderbank {{appeared}} for {{a minute}} to leave this appeal unheeded; he continued to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the garden while he smoked and swung the long leg he had thrown over {{the arm of the}} chair. When he at last spoke, however, it was with some emphasis--perhaps even with some vulgarity. [...] "Oh rot!" ...|$|E
60|$|Eliphalet {{had seen}} Mr. Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered. Terror, abject terror, seized him now, {{so that his}} knees smote together. As well <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> the sun as into the Colonel's face. In one stride he {{had a hand in}} the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other {{pointing}} down the path.|$|E
60|$|Alec, fallen <b>into</b> deep thought, <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the fire. Presently {{he took a}} long breath, {{rose from}} his chair, and drew himself to his full height.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, who {{had been}} sitting in anxious silence, each gave a start of dismay and <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> one another's eyes.|$|R
60|$|The King <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> {{the young}} Provost's face, {{and in the}} {{twilight}} of the room {{began to see that}} his face was quite white and his lip shaking.|$|R
