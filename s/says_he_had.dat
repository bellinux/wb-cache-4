5|$|At the school, {{they find}} a secure {{building}} and leave Randall there with a knife. As they leave, Randall pleads to take them back, and then <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone to school with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and knows her father Hershel (Scott Wilson), suggesting he knows the farm's location. Shane prepares to kill Randall, but Rick tackles him. During the fight that follows, Rick is able to defeat Shane, who angrily breaks a window that releases a horde of walkers in the building. Shane takes safety in a school bus while Rick rescues Randall back to their vehicle. After contemplating leaving Shane, Rick returns to help Shane get to safety as well. They regag Randall {{and return to the}} farm. Rick tells Shane that he will need to follow his orders to remain part of the group.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
25|$|Bob Heironimus {{claims to}} have been the figure {{depicted}} in the Patterson film. Heironimus <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not previously publicly discussed his role in the hoax because he hoped to be paid eventually and was afraid of being convicted of fraud had he confessed. After speaking with his lawyer he was told that since he had not been paid for his involvement in the hoax, he could not be held accountable.|$|E

Lawyer Brian McMonagle co-hosted a political fundraiser for former District Attorney Bruce Castor early last year but said it took place months before he joined Cosby's defense team in September. Constand's lawyer now wants McMonagle to detail any ties between his office and Castor, including phone records and documents. She wants Cosby to do the same. At a pretrial hearing on April 15, 2016, a judge ruled that Constand is entitled to any documents shared between Castor and Cosby's attorneys.|$|E
25|$|On her website, Messenger {{chronicles the}} journey {{in the death}} of her son, and why she is an outspoken {{opponent}} of vaccines. She stated that she knew nothing about vaccines and only got them for her son because the doctor recommended it. Her 8-week old son had always been happy and calm, but became extremely upset immediately after his first vaccination shot, the doctor when asked said that this was normal behavior. The next day he was back to normal and she waited for his 4-month visit which included more vaccination shots.

The next day he started having seizures and convulsions.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 {{biography}} of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton's Jackson biography, he wrote, [...] "it {{is hard to}} say which is more disgraced, the hero [...] or the historian. The book contains scarcely a period of good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the admission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others." [...] By 1831, Snelling <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become [...] "the laughing-stock of the nation." [...] Remini says that [...] "the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And it was all so needless." ...|$|E
500|$|Æthelberht died on 24 February 616 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Eadbald, {{who was not}} a Christian—Bede <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been {{converted}} but went back to his pagan faith, although he ultimately did become a Christian king. Eadbald outraged the church by marrying his stepmother, which was contrary to Church law, and by refusing to accept baptism. [...] Sæberht of the East Saxons also died at approximately this time, and he was succeeded by his three sons, none of whom were Christian. A subsequent revolt against Christianity and the expulsion of the missionaries from Kent may have been a reaction to Kentish overlordship after Æthelberht's death as much as a pagan opposition to Christianity.|$|E
500|$|After {{the change}} in musical style, the group decided it needed a new name. Utsler {{suggested}} keeping the [...] "I.C.P." [...] initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct. Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became {{the inspiration for the}} group's new name: Insane Clown Posse. The group decided they would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted hype man. Upon returning home that night, Bruce <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a dream in which [...] "spirits in a traveling carnival appeared to him"—an image that would become the basis for the Dark Carnival mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series.|$|E

His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to become a man when {{his father was}} diagnosed. In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, [...] "He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter." [...] In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, [...] "It happened at probably the worst time anybody could lose your dad. Watching his dad deteriorate over the years was probably the singular thing that formed his personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Verna confesses {{that she}} once sexually {{assaulted}} former professional basketball player Scottie Pippen. When Pete tells Tracy that actress Novella Nelson {{will be his}} [...] "mother", Tracy <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his sights on actress Phylicia Rashad or professional tennis player Serena Williams to be his [...] "mother". When Liz learns that her mother {{could have been an}} astronaut's wife, Margaret explains that it was not that simple as she had just graduated from secretary school and got a job as a secretary at Sterling Cooper. The latter is a fictional advertising agency on the AMC program Mad Men. In addition, actor Jon Hamm, who plays the lead role on Mad Men, has had a recurring role on 30 Rock as a love interest for Tina Fey's character.

500|$|Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and {{her parents}} Maria (Lesley Manville) and Richard (Tim Pigott-Smith) move to the (fictional) {{industrial}} town of Milton, Darkshire, {{in the north of}} England because her father, a clergyman, decides to leave the Church of England and become a Nonconformist. [...] Thanks to his friend, Mr. Bell (Brian Protheroe), he is able to find a house and gains employment as a private tutor. [...] One of his pupils is local mill-owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who gets off to a bad start with Margaret when she witnesses him beating a worker whom he has caught smoking in the mill, thus endangering all the workers. Gradually, Margaret gets used to Thornton, but his mother Hannah (Sinéad Cusack) and sister Fanny (Jo Joyner) disapprove of her, believing her haughty and alien to the customs of the North. In the meantime, Margaret attempts to do charitable work among the working classes, and thus comes into contact with Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle) and his daughter, Bessy (Anna Maxwell Martin), who contracted Pneumoconiosis from exposure to the cotton-fibres in the mills. [...] When Bessy became ill at Hamper's Mill, her father moved her to Marlborough Mills, Thornton's mill, because the working environment is better there. In a meeting with fellow mill owners, Thornton <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a wheel for ventilation installed in all of the rooms of his factory, {{despite the fact that it}} costs a great deal of money. The other industrialists had refused to install a wheel because of the expense.|$|E
