40|$|Accumulation of ammonia, {{measured}} as total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), {{a product of}} protein decomposition in <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>wastes,</b> inhibits the anaerobic digestion process, reducing digester productivity and leading to failure. Struvite precipitation (SP) is an effective means to remove TAN and enhance the buffering of substrates. Different Mg and P sources were evaluated as reactants in SP in acidogenic digester effluents to reduce its TAN levels. In order to measure impact of TAN removal, a standard biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was conducted to measure methane yield from treatments that had the highest TAN reductions. SP results showed 6 of 9 reagent combinations resulted in greater than 70 % TAN removal. The BMP results indicated that SP treatment by adding Mg(OH) 2 and H 3 PO 4 resulted in 57. 6 % nitrogen recovery and 41. 7 % increase in methane yield relative to the substrate without SP.

30|$|Consumption {{of poultry}} {{products}} in Zimbabwe has steadily increased without being impaired by either religious considerations or culinary practices. Poultry production {{has increased in}} recent years by 16 % to 19 %, and this is expected to continue because of the high demand for poultry products (WATTAgNet 2011). In the processing of chickens, a lot of wastes are produced as companies aim to produce a good-quality final product and its intermediates. The centralisation of poultry processing plants has increased the problem of poultry waste management. The volume of waste produced during processing is large enough to develop techniques for processing the waste and presents possibilities for future use (Biely et al. 1972). Waste treatment is costly; therefore, most companies use direct land application to dispose of waste. Stewart (1980) estimated that 73 % of manure and <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>wastes</b> is directly applied on land.

40|$|Different mixture {{ratios of}} solid cattle <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>wastes</b> (SB), manure (M), various crops (VC), and {{municipal}} solid wastes (MSW) were investigated for biogas production. The {{objective was to}} explore possible significant synergistic effects obtained from {{the combination of these}} different substrates. The performance of the process was assessed in thermophilic anaerobic batch co-digestion assays, using a four factor mixture design and methane yield (Y-CH 4) and specific methane production rate (r(scH 4)) as response variables. The highest methane yield, 655 NmL CH 4 /g VS was obtained when equal parts (ww) of SB, M, VC, and MSW were combined, while the combination of SB, M, and MSW resulted in the highest specific methane production rate (43 NmL CH 4 /g VS/d). A mixture design model was fitted to data in order to appraise synergistic and antagonistic interactions. Mixing all four substrates resulted in a 31 % increase of the expected yield which was calculated from the methane potential of the individual fractions, clearly demonstrating a synergistic effect due to more balanced nutrient composition enhancing the anaerobic digestion process. However, no significant antagonistic effects were observed. In order to maximize both response variables simultaneously, a response surface method was employed to establish the optimal combination of substrate mixtures. The statistical results and analysis of the biological process gave a coherent picture of the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Both of these co-substrates are difficult to digest in isolation because of their high nitrogen and lipid concentrations, and are regulated as Category 3 materials under the Animal By-Products Regulations (EC 1069 / 2009). The results showed that at an organic loading rate of 2 kg VS m? 3 day? 1 with the slaughterhouse material making up 20 % of the load on a volatile solids basis the process could operate successfully. As the loading was increased to 4 kg VS m? 3 day? 1 signs of inhibition appeared with both co-substrates, however, and volumetric methane production {{was reduced to a}} point where co-digestion gave no process advantage. The main operational problem encountered was an increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the digestate, particularly propionic acid: this was thought to be a result of ammonia toxicity.

These wastes were sampled from a piggery slaughterhouse located in Kimje, South Korea. Cumulative methane production curves for the wastes were obtained from the anaerobic batch fermentation having different S/I ratios of 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5. BMP and anaerobic biodegradabilities (Ddeg) of the wastes were calculated from cumulative methane production data for the tested conditions. At the lowest S/I ration of 0. 1, BMPs of piggery blood, intestine residue, and digestive tract content were determined to be 0. 799, 0. 848, and 1. 076 Nm 3 kg− 1 -VSadded, respectively, which were above the theoretical methane potentials of 0. 539, 0. 644, and 0. 517 Nm 3 kg− 1 -VSadded for blood, intestine residue, and digestive tract content, respectively. However, BMPs obtained from the higher S/I ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 were within the theoretical range for all three types of waste and were not significantly different for the different S/I ratios tested. Anaerobic biodegradabilities calculated from BMP data showed a similar tendency. These results imply that, for BMP assay in an anaerobic reactor, the S/I ratio of anaerobic reactor should be above 0. 1 and the inoculum should be sufficiently stabilized to avoid further degradation during the assay...|$|R

The content of moisture, protein, fat, fiber, and ash in the feed composed of degreased chicken wastes and PBM was 7. 8, 41. 2, 34, 0. 9, and 4. 4 %, respectively. The fat obtained from chicken wastes was suitable for non-edible consumption. Combining degreased wastes with PBM resulted in protein-rich aquaculture feed. This study showed the economic and health benefits of separating components of the poultry <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>wastes</b> {{and the possibility of}} producing aquaculture feed containing suitable micronutrients from these wastes...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is a {{biochemical process}} that transforms diverse categories of biomass feedstock to renewable energy, {{in the form}} of methane, and contributes to resources conservation and greenhouse gases emission mitigation. Lipid-rich waste and wastewaters have a high energy potential, however efficient methane recovery with conventional anaerobic digestion technology is not easy to achieve because of a wide assortment of operational problems mainly related to the accumulation of long chain fatty acids (LCFA), products of lipids hydrolysis, in the system. The objective of the present dissertation is to test and to evaluate new methodologies and strategies to improve the anaerobic digestion of high-strength lipid waste. In a preliminary approach, the suitability and the attractiveness of high-strength lipid <b>wastes</b> and <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>wastes</b> for biogas production was confirmed, suffice to control the applied organic load. The obtained results reinforced the existing knowledge describing the flotation and wash-out of substrate/biomass and the inhibition phenomena affecting the microbial population, as the main process drawbacks. The results of studies submitting anaerobic reactors to increasing concentrations of lipids/LCFA underlined the importance of the adsorption of LCFA onto the microbial cell membrane as limiting factor, guiding further research to found new technical approaches in order to control the biomass-LCFA adsorption dynamics. The use of inorganic adsorbents to capture LCFA prior to the anaerobic digestion process or the application of sequential low-energy ultrasonic pulses in order to control the adsorption-desorption kinetics were tested with interesting results. However, the effectiveness of these strategies was limited by the proportion of inorganic adsorbent/LCFA and the cumulative damaging effect of ultrasonic treatment over biomass, respectively. Further studies are thus required to optimize the efficiency and the applicability of these strategies. Efficient conversion of complex high-strength lipid waste to methane was proved to be possible in a novel reactor system configuration combining saponification pre-treatment and digested solids recirculation to the anaerobic digestion process, to increase solids retention time. A start-up step consisting on pulse-feeding cycles of the fatty waste prior to the semi-continuous process promoted an adapted microbial community for LCFA mineralization. The feasibility of this system configuration for solid <b>slaughterhouse</b> fatty <b>waste</b> was evidenced at lab scale reactors, reaching organic matter removal efficiencies higher than 90 %. The comparison of this configuration with systems without saponification or without digested solids recirculation confirmed the synergistic effect of both strategies. The use of high throughput sequencing approach (454 -pyrosequencing) to characterize the evolution of the biodiversity and the phylogenetic structure of the microbial community during the operation of the tested configurations concluded that a selection of a defined functional acidogenic population (ß-oxidizers) was induced by substrate pretreatment. Contrary, the solids recirculation resulted in an enrichment of the methanogenic biodiversity, mainly of hydrogenotrophic archaea. Based on the satisfactory results obtained with the strategies studied in the present dissertation, it is expected that lipid-rich waste valorization will be a real alternative to increase renewable energy production through anaerobic digestion process...|$|R
