40|$|Research PaperFisheries {{management}} {{has been carried}} out on the assumption that a fish population is in equilibrium with the fishing effort under the average environmental conditions and hence there must be a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, since the simultaneous {{rise and fall of the}} interdecadal and global <b>scale</b> of <b>sardine</b> populations was pointed out in the early 1980 s, many other similar events of long-term changes in marine populations have been emerging, which is called regime shift. On the other hand, abundant evidence for the regime shift of climate-ocean systems has been obtained recently, which is suggested as the driving force causing the fluctuations in marine organisms. Very recently, it has become clear that even groundfish and tunas often show a tremendous increase in spite of the strong exploitation. These facts strongly show that there are no steady conditions in the oceans and the MSY is nothing but an imaginary criterion. A new paradigm of the fisheries management must be sought on the basis of the regime shift theory...|$|R
40|$|The Iberian sardine (Sardine pilchardus) is a {{good example}} of the typical life {{strategy}} of small pelagic fish species around the world: short life span, fast growth and long spawning season, which in the case of the Iberian stock presents two peaks (in winter and spring). This life strategy makes new year classes ve ry dependent on the right environmental conditions to survive the early life stages. Egg and larval survival relies on the right oceanographic mechanisms, to ensure retention in favourable areas, and availability of food. Dispersal of eggs and larvae serio usly reduces their survival and decreases the chances of a good new year class. Because of this dependency on environmental conditions in early life, there is no relationship between the stock size (measured as SSB) and recruitment. Previous studies have e xplored the relationship between environmental variables, at large and local spatial <b>scales,</b> and <b>sardine</b> recruitment in the Galician and Portuguese sardine fishery but have faced two main analytical challenges: short time series and autocorrelated data. We carry out new analysis using statistical methods designed to cope with these challenges, including Dynamic factor Analysis and mixed modelling, to identify and characterise relationships between sardine populations (recruitment, spawning stock biomass, an d (to extend the time series) fishery landings in the area) and a series of global, regional and local environmental variables...|$|R

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown {{that at least one}} species of fish ~the American shad! in the order clupeiforms ~herrings, shads, and relatives! is able to detect sounds up to 180 kHz. However, it has not been clear whether other members of this order are also able to detect ultrasound. It is now demonstrated, using auditory brainstem response ~ABR!, that at least one additional species, the gulf menhaden ~Brevoortia patronus!, is able to detect ultrasound, while several other species including the bay anchovy ~Anchoa mitchilli!, <b>scaled</b> <b>sardine</b> ~Harengula jaguana!, and Spanish sardine ~Sardinella aurita! only detect sounds to about 4 kHz. ABR is used to confirm ultrasonic hearing in the American shad. The results suggest that ultrasound detection may be limited to one subfamily of clupeiforms, the Alosinae. It is suggested that ultrasound detection involves the utricle of the inner ear and speculate as to why, despite having similar ear structures, only one group may detect ultrasound...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{development}} was examined in larvae of three species of clupeoid fish, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus, Clupeidae), <b>scaled</b> <b>sardine</b> (Harengula jaguana, Clupeidae), and bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli, Engraulidae). Differences in habitats occupied by these species allowed {{the testing of}} hypotheses relating timing of sensory ontogeny to habitat shifts in fish larvae. Migration of menhaden from offshore to estuarine waters coincided with, or was preceded by, auditory bulla inflation, development of rod photoreceptors, onset of retinal summation, improvements in visual acuity, and formation of cephalic lateral-line canals. Examination of developmental patterns in sardine and anchovy larvae, both of which live inshore throughout the larval period, showed {{that some of these}} associations between habitat and sensory morphology were adaptive and some coincidental. Inflation of the auditory bullae occurred earlier in the larval period in anchovy than in menhaden. Specializations for enhanced visual sensitivity occurred earliest in anchovy but were not different between sardine and menhaden. There was no correspondence between habitat and visual acuity or lateral-line development. Thus, ontogeny of auditory bulla inflation and retinal sensitivity may coincide with habitat shifts, at least at the family level, but lateral-line development is more constrained by phylogeny than adapted to ecology...|$|E
40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of evasive behaviours {{was examined}} in Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus, Clupeidae) and bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli, Engraulidae), with supplemental data for <b>scaled</b> <b>sardine</b> (Harengula jaguana, Clupeidae). Predicted relationships between ecology and behavioural ontogeny were tested using the different patterns of inshore vs offshore habitat utilization displayed by these species. In {{two of the}} species, menhaden and anchovy, the roles of vision, mechanoreception, and audition in evasive behaviours were examined ontogenetically and compared to the morphological development of these sensory systems. Anchovy early larvae were more responsive to a predatory stimulus than were menhaden; sardine early larvae were intermediate in responsiveness. By {{the end of the}} larval period most individuals tested in all three species responded. These results matched the pattern predicted by larval habitat. Ontogenetic trends in reactive distance did not match predictions based on habitat for these species but instead appeared to be more dependent upon changes in sensory morphology.

Auditory stimuli were not implicated for either menhaden or anchovy in responding to the stimulus used...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the main spatial patterns and <b>scales</b> of Brazilian <b>sardine</b> (Sardinella brasiliensis) spawning and the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SBB) environmental variability was investigated, using historical egg density data, remotely sensed SST anomalies from AVHRR and Wind velocity data from SSM/I. The spatial variability of egg densities at each cruise was linearly modeled using eigenvector filters as predictors. Environmental data series were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Wavelet decomposition. Results showed that spawning spatial variability was expressed at rougher scales, due to a concentration of the main spawning areas at the central and southern areas of the SBB. A high mesoscale variability was also evidenced by the regression models. The evolution of spatial patterns showed a progressive increase in {{the relative importance of}} mesoscale filters when mean egg densities lowered, which is consistent with the hypothesis of contraction-expansion of the spawning habitat. Areas characterized by lower environmental variability matched the most recurrent spawning grounds which suggests that the Brazilian sardine spawning might benefit more from stable environments.

40|$|Since November, 1919, the California Division of Fish and Game {{has been}} {{gathering}} data {{to contribute to}} the understanding of causes underlying changes in abundance of the sardine,Sardinops caerulea. A knowledge of the relative proportions of the various age groups of fish in the population is an important element in such studies. Prior to 1924, an attempt was made by Thompson and assistants to read the age marks on the scales and otoliths of this species, but results did not prove satisfactory. However, an indirect method of assessing age by tracing dominant size groups through the fishery was continued. During the period 1928 – 1933, a study of otoliths of sardines taken in the California fishery was made by H. C. Godsil, but this also proved unsatisfactory. In March, 1938, Walford and Mosher of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service started examination of the scales and otoliths of sardines, commencing with the young and later including older fish. This study established the validity of the method of reading scales to determine age in the <b>sardine.</b> The <b>scale</b> method was recommended as more advantageous in some respects than the otolith method, particularly after a rather simple method of mounting scales dry and projecting their enlarged images was developed. Starting with the 1941 – 42 season in California a comprehensive program for scale collecting and age reading was undertaken jointly by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Division of Fish and Game. The Fisheries Research Board of Canada, the Washington State Department of Fisheries, and the Fish Commission of Oregon participated in the work by adding the collection of <b>scales</b> from <b>sardines</b> in northern waters. Their collections were included in the age-reading project.

40|$|In this paper, phosphate-based {{compounds}} used in biomedicine were {{extracted from}} bones and <b>scales</b> of European <b>sardines</b> (Sardina pilchardus); {{this is the}} first time that different parts of the same fish are used for the extraction of these kinds of materials. The bones and scales behave very differently with processing, producing different materials when annealed between 600 and 1000 °C. The bones formed a mixture of hydroxyapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2, HAp) and β-tri-calcium phosphate (β-Ca 3 (PO 4) 2, β-TCP), with a higher content of β-TCP obtained with increasing temperature. This bi-phasic material has a high added value, as it is employed as a bioceramic; in fact HAp has good biocompatibility while β-TCP has better resorbability than HAp, despite being less biocompatible. With scales, on the other hand, either a HAp-based material or a chlorine-substitute HAp containing material (chloroapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 Cl 2, ClAp) were produced. HAp-based material was obtained with a simple annealing process; for ClAp, on the other hand, a combined washing–annealing process was used. ClAp is also used in biomedicine, due to its improved resorption, mechanical properties and bioactivity. This is the first time ClAp of marine origin was produced...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Partly {{laminated}} sediments on {{the upper}} continental slope (200 - 600 m) off central Peru contain a diverse assemblage of fish debris, diatoms, {{and the remains of}} a variety of other nektonic, planktic, and benthic organisms. Approximately 97 percent of the fish scales recovered from the best preserved cores come from the anchoveta (79 percent), Peruvian hake (16 percent), and sardine (2 percent). Most of the diatoms belong to the genera Chaetoceros, Skeletonema, Thalassionema, Thalassiosira, Coscinodiscus, and Rhizosolenia. A discontinuous sedimentary record at 11 °S. and 13 °S. shows that the species composition of diatom and fish debris assemblages has changed very little in the past 15, 000 years. However, the relative abundance of diatom species and genera, and to a lesser extent, fish species and genera, has fluctuated throughout the Holocene. These fluctuations may be attributed to changes of primary and secondary productivity in the overlying water column and to subsequent chemical and physical alteration of the depositional environment. An explanation of Holocene upwelling and productivity was developed based on the distribution of fish debris, diatoms, and silicoflagellates in sediments deposited during the Second Neoglacial Period (about 2700 - 1800 yr. B. P.) from core 7706 - 40 at 11 ° 15 'S. Floral and faunal assemblages, variously enriched in <b>sardine</b> and saury <b>scales,</b> diatoms of the species Rhizosolenia shrubsolei, R. bergonii, and Skeletonema costatum, and the silicoflagellate genera Dictyocha and Distephanus, suggest that periods of global atmospheric cooling were accompanied by both enhanced productivity and warmer surface water off the coast of Peru. Abundant <b>sardine</b> <b>scales</b> in sediments deposited during the close of the last ice age (11, 700 - 11, 400 yr. B. P.) and a tropical oceanic assemblage of diatoms (Coscinodiscus nodulifer, Asteromphalus spp., Rhizosolenia bergonii) deposited together with large numbers of Skeletonerna costatum and Rhizosolenia shrubsolei at 11 ° 15 'S. during the 'Little Ice Age' (200 - 500 yr. B. P.) are further evidence supporting the proposed explanation of Holocene upwelling and productivity patterns. Latitudinal compression of atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the South Pacific Ocean and a southward shifting Intertropical Convergence Zone are phenomena frequently attributed to climatic cooling. Intensified oceanic circulation and weakened southeast trade winds directly off Peru that may have resulted from the compressed and shifted circulation belts could have interacted to produce the paradoxical simultaneity of warm surface water and high productivity signals preserved in Peruvian marine sediments during some episodes of global atmospheric cooling. Further testing of this and competing hypotheses depends upon the availability of cores from the northern and southern reaches of the Peruvian continental margin that exhibit greater temporal continuity...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{decline of the}} sardine fishery {{beginning}} in 1946 – 47, California fishermen and processors turned to substitute species. One of these was the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Until 1947, anchovies had been used for bait almost exclusively and the annual catch had seldom exceeded 5, 000 tons. Between 1947 and 1951 these fish were canned in moderate amounts and the landings varied from 5, 000 to 12, 000 tons. In 1952 the tonnage increased to 34, 000 and in 1953 to 49, 000. The {{major part of the}} anchovy canning has been done by the processors at Monterey. In this Central California area anchovies are also used in small quantities for dead bait. Along the Southern California coast for many years there has been a thriving live bait anchovy fishery. This bait is used chiefly by sport fishermen and in more limited amounts by the commercial men. The live bait anchovy catch of Southern California increased from about 2, 000 tons in the early forties to more than 6, 000 tons in 1953. Because of the use of these fish for live bait and because anchovies are an important forage fish for the larger species fished extensively in California waters by both sport and commercial fishermen, much concern has been expressed over the rapid expansion of the anchovy canning industry. Several plans for control of this expanding fishery have been proposed and the California Fish and Game Commission has refused permits to use anchovies for reduction into meal and oil and has established case pack requirements. Continued public pressure for more stringent regulations made evident the need for basic biological information about this species. To supply this need the Department of Fish and Game increased its investigations on the anchovy and the Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation added this species to its program of studies. Only by such methods will a solution to the problems of population dynamics be reached and made applicable to management. Clark and Phillips (1952) published results of the anchovy studies from 1946 through 1951. This introductory work indicated the need for intensive research on certain aspects of the anchovy life history. The most important and difficult was the development of a reliable method for age determination. The responsibility for this fell to the biologists conducting the routine sardine age analysis, two from the California Department of Fish and Game and two from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The program of anchovy sampling was expanded to include all California ports of landing. Since northern anchovy and Pacific <b>sardine</b> <b>scales</b> are similar in type and structure, the anchovy commercial catch sampling and age analysis was conducted {{in a manner similar to}} that adopted for the Pacific sardine and the anchovy age determinations were made as soon as the collections were completed for the season. The usual procedure in conducting a routine age analysis of a newly studied species is to first complete preliminary studies relative to the reliability of the method as applied to that species. For the anchovy these special studies were conducted simultaneously with the collection and analysis of the first two seasons' catch. If the results of these special studies indicated that anchovy scales could not be read with a sufficient degree of reliability then the routine age analysis would be discontinued. This bulletin presents the results of these special studies and the age and length composition of the 1952 – 53 and the 1953 – 54 catch. Here are given the reasons for considering valid the method used to interpret the age from the scales of the anchovy. The errors inherent in the method are pointed out and the reliability that can be placed on the findings is indicated. Given also are the tonnages and numbers of anchovies taken in the canning catch in the 1952 – 53 and 1953 – 54 seasons. No fish older than six years was found. In 1952 – 53 more than half of the catch came from the 1950, 1951 and 1952 year classes, anchovies less than three years old. In 1953 – 54 fish under three years (the 1951, 1952 and 1953 year classes) comprised more than 80 percent of the catch. These data suggest that the anchovy is a relatively short lived fish and that the population is subject to comparatively rapid turnover...|$|R
