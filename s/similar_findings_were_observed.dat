50|$|The {{clinical}} {{utility of}} ctDNA {{for the detection}} of primary disease is in part limited by the sensitivity of current technology; there are low levels of ctDNA present, and driver mutations are unknown. Recently, a team at John Hopkins assessed the ability to detect ctDNA using digital PCR in 640 patients with various types of cancer. ctDNA was detected in only 48% to 73% of cases, suggesting that ctDNA may be a poor method for early cancer detection, since not all patients had detectable levels of ctDNA. <b>Similar</b> <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> by Heitzer et al., who analyzed ctDNA from colorectal patients. Importantly, in a study conducted by Kopreski et al., mutations in KRAS, an oncogene commonly mutated in colorectal cancer, were detected in the colorectal tissue of otherwise clinically healthy individuals. In fact, 58% of individuals with detectable KRAS mutations showed no evidence of neoplasia on colonoscopy, which may be indicative of false positivity. However, because no follow-up studies were pursued within this cohort, it is possible that these represent premalignant lesions. Taken together, these results suggest that the use of ctDNA as a biomarker in the context of cancer screening is limited both by sensitivity and specificity.|$|E

It has been hypothesized that high wind speeds will dilute odor plumes to undetectable levels or create odor plumes that are more difficult for a predator to follow (Conover 2007).

50|$|COX15 {{is one of}} the {{cytochrome}} c oxidase (COX) assembly factors {{identified in}} yeast, playing {{a key role in the}} biosynthetic pathway of mitochondrial heme A, the prosthetic group of cytochrome a and a3.

In humans, <b>similar</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> <b>observed</b> in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation diseases, which, in some cases, show associated mutations in pantothenate kinase 2 gene (PANK 2). Here we present an aged gorilla, 40 years old, suffering {{during the last}} 2 years of life from progressive tetraparesis, nystagmus, and dyskinesia of the arms, hands, and neck, with accompanying abnormal behavior. The postmortem neuropathologic examination revealed, in addition to aging-associated changes in the brain, numerous corpora amylacea in some brain areas, especially the substantia nigra, and large numbers of axonal spheroids {{associated with}} iron accumulation in the internal globus pallidus. Sequencing of the gorilla PANK 2 gene failed to detect any mutation.

Methods and Results The use and importance of GI designations by 103 South Australian wine producers was investigated via an online survey. The inclusion of GIs on labels was valued significantly higher for wines priced above $A 15. 00, compared with lower priced wines. A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> following analysis of the label content of 540 commercially available South Australian wines, with GIs {{more likely to be}} used for key grape cultivars.

40|$|AbstractThe National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has {{facilitated}} unrelated donor {{hematopoietic cell}} transplants {{for more than}} 20 years. In this time period, {{there have been many}} changes in clinical practice, including improvements in HLA typing and supportive care, and changes in the source of stem cells. Availability of banked unrelated donor cord blood (incorporated into the NMDP registry in 2000) as a source of stem cells has become an important option for children with leukemia, offering the advantages of immediate availability for children with high-risk disease, the need for a lesser degree of HLA match, and expanding access for those with infrequent HLA haplotypes. Overall survival (OS) in children with acute leukemia transplanted with unrelated donor bone marrow (BM) is markedly better in more recent years, largely attributable to less treatment-related mortality (TRM). Within this cohort, 2 -year survival was markedly better for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete response (CR 1) (74 %) versus second complete response (CR 2) (62 %) or more advanced disease (33 %). <b>Similar</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> <b>observed</b> with patients with AML, suggesting earlier referral to bone marrow transplant (BMT) is optimal for survival.

The metacercariae were recovered from half-beaked fish, Dermogenus pusillus, collected from Hang Dong District, Chiang Mai Province. A single inoculation of three hundred metacercariae was orally conducted with male rats (n= 15) and mice (n= 15). Uninfected animals {{were used as}} controls (n= 5). At days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28, post-infection (PI), three rats and mice, also one from each control group, were sacrificed for adult worm recovery, and the blood was drawn by heart puncture and prepared for white blood cell and eosinophil counts. The results showed that adult worm recovery gradually decreased after day 21 PI in the rats, whereas, reduction in the mice was found after day 7 PI and the adult worms completely disappeared at day 28 PI. Hematologically, total {{white blood cell counts}} in two kinds of infected hosts were not statistically different from those of controls.

The Transmission Disequilibrium Test was also used in a third family-based dataset that included 89 UK Caucasian families (both parents, a GD sibling and an unaffected sibling). Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplification of genomic DNA and Tth 111 I restriction enzyme digestion. No difference in frequencies of the A 253 polymorphism between GD (21 / 204, 10. 3 %) and controls (34 / 358, 9. 5 %) was found in the UK Caucasians (chi 2 = 0. 093; p = NS). A <b>similar</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in GD (0 / 96, 0 %) and controls (2 / 71, 2. 8 %) in Hong Kong Chinese subjects (chi 2 = 2. 73; p = NS). Results from the 89 UK families showed no deviation from the expected transmission frequency of 0. 5, from parents heterozygous for the A 253 allele to either Graves' or unaffected offspring (Fisher's exact test p = 0. 22) and, therefore, confirmed a lack of evidence of linkage disequilibrium between the A 253 allele and GD...|$|R
