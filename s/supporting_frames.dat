40|$|Mirror shape {{accuracy}} {{as a key}} optical {{performance parameter}} for parabolic trough collectors can be assessed accurately by common measurement systems proving the high quality of state-of-the-art mirror panels. However, measurement results cannot always be compared directly because critical boundary conditions are not yet standardized. This paper quantifies the differences in shape accuracy results between the most common measurement setups for parabolic trough mirror panels and identifies measurement position, mounting mode and <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> employed for the measurement as relevant boundary conditions. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels of RP 3 geometry were performed at DLR’s QUARZ Center Cologne in vertical (mounting points vertically and curved direction horizontally aligned) and horizontal measurement position (mirrors facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), both with and without tightening the mirrors to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with screws. Finite element models were applied to calculate gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of support frame: an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> a laboratory <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> and an ideal <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets. The measurement results demonstrate that the difference in position and mounting mode can lead to relevant deviations of the shape accuracy results higher than {{the uncertainty of the}} employed deflectometric measurement system. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 7 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position was measured. Mirror shape specifications may thus not be applicable in all positions. Concerning the mounting onto different types of modeled <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> (in horizontal position) a variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) was calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> compared to the case when mounted to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets...|$|R
30|$|The materials, methods, {{and designs}} used for {{packaging}} vary widely {{depending on the}} device and application. For example, silicon microcantilevers are loaded into AFMs using clamps, spring-loaded clips, or adhesive gels, but other devices require custom-designed packages for electrical connections, thermal interfaces, microfluidic manifolds, or vacuum packaging to maintain the resonator at low pressure [16]. The dissipation due to all components associated with the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> and package is collectively called boundary damping. There are three main mechanisms of boundary damping: (i) support losses or anchor losses due to the radiation of elastic waves (or stress waves) from the resonator into the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> [20 – 35]; (ii) microsliding at the interfaces between the resonator and <b>supporting</b> <b>frame,</b> and between the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> and package [61]; and (iii) viscoelasticity in the gels and adhesives used to bond the <b>supporting</b> <b>frame</b> to the package [9].

50|$|The {{cucumber}} is a creeping vine that {{roots in}} the ground and grows up trellises or other <b>supporting</b> <b>frames,</b> wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium and will sprawl along the ground if it does not have supports. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits. The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 60 cm long and 10 cm in diameter. Botanically speaking, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. Much like tomato and squash, it is often perceived, prepared and eaten as a vegetable. Cucumber fruits are usually more than 90% water.|$|E
50|$|A {{steam hammer}} may {{have one or}} two <b>supporting</b> <b>frames.</b> The single frame design lets the {{operator}} move around the dies more easily, while the double frame can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock.Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. This may be solved with a counterblow steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and bottom dies together. The upper ram is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings.They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force.Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe.|$|E

Objectives: To evaluate how breastfeeding policies were framed in print and web-based newspapers in Washington State; to identify sources of frames; to examine the balance of media coverage in support or against breastfeeding policy adoption. Methods: Print and web-based newspaper articles published from January 2000 through June 2014 specifically discussing breastfeeding policy were analyzed and coded (n= 131). A sub-sample (n= 46) was double coded. Inter-coder agreement was acceptable (Krippendorff α coefficient 0. 83). Results: The number of articles about breastfeeding policy grew overall between 2000 and 2014 and peaked during periods of specific policy development. Seventy-four articles had a neutral tone, 49 supported breastfeeding policy and four were in opposition. Nine distinct <b>supporting</b> <b>frames</b> were identified and six distinct opposing frames. The most frequent <b>supporting</b> <b>frames</b> were health benefits of breastfeeding and challenges of breastfeeding in public. The most common opposing frame was indecency of breastfeeding in public. Many framed messages did not reference a source of information. Conclusions: There is limited but growing media coverage of breastfeeding policies. For the most part, coverage is supportive {{of the need for}} policies.

40|$|Purpose: Three {{treatment}} couches, henceforth {{referred to}} as the standard, the variable standard and the C-arm couch, each based oil a different supporting frame system, were investigated for their suitability for the delivery of a high number of coplanar beams, (greater than or equal to 5) as may be required for intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatments. Materials and methods: A number of equispaced beam arrangements (five to nine) were examined in combination with two circular target sizes (circle divide 6 and circle divide 10 cm) at different locations within an elliptical body on the investigated couches, resulting in 70 different plans per couch. A rule based advisory system determined possible intersections of the beam paths with the <b>supporting.</b> <b>frames</b> of the respective treatment couch and suggested a Suitable constellation for the <b>supporting</b> <b>frames.</b> In cases of intersection, a beam-couch collision was eliminated by minimal rotation of the beams from the initial equispaced beam arrangement. To investigate the effect of a rotation of the posterior-oblique beams for five, seven and nine initially equispaced beams by an angle of 10 degrees, a prostate plan was generated and compared with equispaced beam arrangement. Results: Initial beam paths intersected with the standard couch in 63 % of the plans, necessitating a rotation of one or two beams. It was necessary to modify the beam angles in 34 % of the cases on the variable standard couch to avoid an intersection of the beams with the couch. All the plans would have been delivered satisfactorily on the C-arm couch without a rotation of beams. Simulation studies showed that the dose distribution for a prostate treatment could be affected significantly, but not detrimentally, by the rotation of the two posterior-oblique beam orientations by an angle of 10 degrees.

Typically, the resonators are attached to relatively large <b>supporting</b> <b>frames</b> to facilitate handling and interconnection, and then packaged by mounting the supporting frame inside test stations, instruments, or customized packages. Illustrative examples include commercial silicon microcantilevers (1 to 10  μm thick and 0.1 to 0.5  mm long) used for atomic force microscopy (AFM), and silicon nitride nanomembranes (30 to 200  nm thick with lateral dimensions ranging from 10  μm to 1  mm) used in optomechanical systems [85, 86]. In both cases, the devices are attached to silicon frames with thickness {{of a few hundred}} microns and lateral dimensions of a few millimeters. The attachment can be monolithic (exemplified by bulk-micromachined silicon resonators) or engendered by the adhesion of thin films to the supporting frame in the case of surface-micromachined devices [16].|$|E

The reconfigurable metamaterial and the supporting structures (e. g., microactuators, anchors, <b>supporting</b> <b>frames,</b> etc.) are fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator wafer using deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). By adjusting the distance between the two ASRRs, the strength of dipole-dipole coupling can be tuned continuously using the micromachined actuators and this enables tailoring of the electromagnetic response. The reconfiguration of unit cells endows the micromachined reconfigurable metamaterials with unique merits such as electromagnetic response under normal incidence and wide tuning of resonant frequency (measured as 31 % and 22 % for transverse electric polarization and transverse magnetic polarization, respectively).

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} measurement parameters and boundary conditions on shape accuracy of parabolic trough concentrator mirrors of RP 3 geometry by means of optical measurements and finite element analyses. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels are performed in common laboratory setups: in vertical and horizontal measurement position, both with and without tightening the mirrors to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with screws. The results serve for validation of finite element models which are applied to calculate the difference in shape accuracy between, firstly, the individual setups and secondly, between mirrors horizontally fixed to differently rigid <b>support</b> <b>frames.</b> The effect of angular deviations of the mounting pads is assessed. Gravity-induced deformation of mirrors mounted to two exemplary collector support structures is determined for the relevant working positions. The transferability of shape accuracy data measured in laboratory to data applying for mirrors mounted to a collector is assessed. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 8 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position is measured. Gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of horizontally oriented <b>support</b> <b>frames</b> is modeled: an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> a laboratory <b>support</b> <b>frame,</b> and an ideal <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets. A variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) is calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> compared to the case when mounted to a <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic brackets. In case of an angular deviation of the mounting pads mirror panels fixed to an ideally rigid <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> show additional local slope deviation in {{the magnitude of the}} angular pad deviation. Due to gravity-induced deformation and slope deviation the shape accuracy of RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to an ideally rigid collector support structure varies up to 1. 0 mrad in SDx and up to 1. 2 mrad in SDx when compared to the ideal shape and the shape in zenith collector angle, respectively. For RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to a collector structure with elastic brackets the values are 1. 6 mrad and 2. 1 mrad. Whereas the models of mirrors mounted to a laboratory <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> allow for a conversion and thus a comparison of results obtained in different setups, the models for the collector support structure need to be refined in order to allow for a conversion from laboratory to collector measurement results. The results demonstrate that measurement position, mounting mode and employed support structure have to be documented in order to obtain reproducible measurement results. They should hence be included as measurement boundary conditions in guidelines for the measurement and assessment of mirror shape accuracy for concentrating solar collectors. The inspection of the angular accuracy of the mounting pads is part of a complete optical mirror assessment. The data of standardized shape accuracy measurement serve for subsequent calculation of intercept factors and annual energy yields {{as well as for the}} evaluation of optimization approaches...|$|R
