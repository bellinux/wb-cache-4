Introduction The origin of large-scale magnetic fields in various astrophysical bodies still remains a challenging problem. These fields can arise, in principle, by turbulent dynamo generation, from a weak seed field (see, e. g., Moffat 1978, Parker 1979).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the protein content of soybean seeds and the consistency of tofu was examined for six Japanese soybean varieties, Enrei, Fukuyutaka, Sachiyutaka, Ayakogane, Hatayutaka and Tachinagaha. The seed protein content was estimated by determining the nitrogen content using the Dumas method. Tofu was prepared from a raw homogenate of water-soaked soybeans by heating and {{by the addition of}} MgCl_ 2 as a coagulant. The tofu consistency was evaluated by measuring the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu curd using a Creep meter. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu increased when the concentrations of MgCl_ 2 in soymilk increased above 0. 20 %. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> reached a maximum value at concentrations of around 0. 40 %, with differences among soybean varieties and cultivation conditions of the soybeans. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0. 87) between the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu and the seed protein content for the six varieties. In contrast, the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu prepared with 0. 25 % MgCl_ 2 did not show a significant correlation (r = 0. 27) with the seed protein content for the six varieties but was significantly correlated (r = 0. 52), when the data of Sachiyutaka were excluded. Fukuyutaka and Ayakogane required a lower MgCl_ 2 concentration for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu than Sachiyutaka, Enrei, Tachinagaha and Hatayntaka, which required a MgCl_ 2 concentration above 0. 40 % for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu. Especially, Sachiyutaka required the highest MgCl_ 2 concentration, 0. 45 % on the average, for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu among the six varieties. Sachiyutaka-tofu showed the lowest <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> on the average at a concentration of 0. 25 % MgCl_ 2, which is the concentration generally used by manufacturers, in spite of its high content in seed protein. In contrast, Fukuyutaka required the lowest MgCl_ 2 concentration, 0. 34 % on the average, for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> and the highest <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of tofu prepared with 0. 25 % MgCl_ 2. That is one of reasons why manufacturers prefer to use Fukuyutaka for producing tofu. Concentration of a coagulant for the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> as well as seed protein content could become criteria for quality evaluation of soybeans for tofu processing. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> (the {{maximum of}} the {{stress-strain}} curve) of neutron star crust {{is important for}} neutron star physics including pulsar glitches, emission of gravitational waves from static mountains, and flares from star quakes. We perform many molecular dynamic simulations of the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> at different coupling parameters (inverse temperatures) and strain rates. We describe our results with the Zhurkov model of strength. We apply this model to estimate the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> for timescales ~ 1 s - 1 year, which are most important for applications, but much longer than can be directly simulated. At these timescales the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> depends strongly on the temperature. For coupling parameter < 200, matter breaks at very small stress, if it is applied for a few years. This viscoelastic creep can limit the lifetime of mountains on neutron stars.

White bean and lentil {{were used in}} mixtures with corn flour {{at a ratio of}} 10 : 90 up to 90 : 10 (corn:legume). Simple power models were used to correlate <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> and corresponding strain with extrusion conditions and material characteristics. The influence of feed rate on the extrudates mechanical properties was incorporated in the mean residence time. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of extrudates decreased with temperature, residence time, and corn to legume ratio, and it increased with feed moisture content. The corresponding strain showed an opposite trend. Screw speed did not affect the extrudate properties. The use of lentil flour led to a product with higher <b>breaking</b> <b>stress.</b> Furthermore, in a previous work, the porosity of these products was modeled and, now, it was found that <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> and porosity of the extrudates could be correlated by an exponential relationship.

The studied species included Glyceria fluitans, Ranunculus penicillatus, Myriophyllum alterniflorum and Fontinalis antipyretica. Habitat assessment shows that these species {{occur in a}} range from low to high flow velocities, respectively. G. fluitans is a semi-aquatic species with stems of a high flexural rigidity and high breaking force and <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> {{that enable them to}} carry their own weight and balance gravity when growing upright in slow flowing rivers. G. fluitans may also grow horizontally often producing emerged terrestrial stems. In contrast, F. antipyretica grows in fierce water flow. Its stems have the highest flexibility, a significantly higher ‘tension’ Young’s modulus, <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> and work of fracture and a lower plastic deformation compared to M. alterniflorum and R. penicillatus. These traits enable F. antipyretica to survive even in swift flowing streams and constrict the growth of M. alterniflorum and R. penicillatus to the river reaches with moderate flow velocities.

40|$|The {{effects of}} scale on the {{estimated}} stresses and safety {{factors in the}} humeri of several bird and bat species were investigated. This was accomplished by estimating the lift distribution across the wings at two extremes of flight, gliding flight and the downstroke in hovering, finding the center of lift on the wings at these two extremes and calculating the applied bending and twisting moments. This information, along with measurements of mechanically important morphological variables, allowed for estimates of bending and shearing stresses in the humeri for both gliding flight and on the downstroke in hovering. The stresses in flapping flight other than hovering should fall somewhere between these two values. It {{was found that the}} stresses in the humeri are not scale-dependent and that the bending stresses are slightly lower than those found in the limbs of terrestrial animals, while the shearing stresses are larger than those in terrestrial limbs. The <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of bird and bat wing bone was also investigated. Both materials were found to have a lower <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> than that of typical long bone material. The ratio between the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of the material and the estimated stresses was defined as the safety factor. Bird humeri have safety factors that are generally greater than those of bat humeri. This is because bat bone has a lower <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> than does bird bone, although the estimated stresses in the wings are similar. The mean safety factor against failure due to bending in gliding flight was 6. 63 for birds and 3. 99 for bats. In hovering, the mean safety factors against failure due to bending were 2. 22 for birds and 1. 41 for bats. The safety factors against failure due to shearing stresses were estimated to be seven time greater than those against failure due to pure bending stresses...|$|R
40|$|Steel in {{the state}} of casting and forging is very brittle. Some times the {{breakage}} of steel in machining or cold bending is caused by its brittleness. Especially such breakage occurs much more frequently in self hardening low alloy steel than in carbon steel. 　Causes of such brittle rupture have generally been considered to be impurities, coarseness of grain size and micro crack in the material, but this consideration is not satisfactory, and can not explain some phenomena. 　The present writer tries fo offer a new considerafion on the causes of such brittle rupture from the view point of metallography, and the new consideration is as follows : -　(1) The principal factor controlling such brittle rupture is the relation between local concentrated stress in the crystal grain boundary and <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of structure component. 　(2) The factors controlling local concentrated stress are the size of crystal grain, the thickness of precipitate, the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of structure compoment and the micro-crack in grain boundary. 　(3) Impurities in grain boundary are an additional factor of such brittle rupture, and not an effective one. 　(4) Steel spcimens annealed at a temperature lower than its critical point are tough. 　Causes of the toughness are considered to be possibility of plastic deformation owing to the softening of matrix, the uniforming of local stress concentration due to the developement of deformation area and the increase of <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> caused by plastic deformation. 　(5) As causes of the toughness of steel specimens annealed at a temperature higher than its critical point can be enumerated the uniforming of stress concentration due to fine crystal grain, plastic deformation owing to the softening of matrix and the inercase of <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> caused by plastic deformation...|$|R

(1) Provided that the rope was strained with gradual aggravation (stressing-velocity : 4. 0 ~ 4. 1 cm/min), in case of short splice, when the rope was tucked at either end, and only once, the used rope was slipped-off at about 30 % <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of the fixed limit : while the tucking of it, once, at the both sides of the end, prevented it from being slipped-off, and in this case, 79 % of the <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of the fixed limit was necessitated to let it be broken.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of aging and aortic stiffness {{on the extent of}} irreversible deformation and <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of the human thoracic aorta. METHODS: From 14 human heart valve donors without aortic disease (mean age 35 years, range 8 - 59 years), 14 intact segments of the thoracic descending aorta were studied within 48 h after cardiac arrest. In an experimental setup, the segments were submitted to increasing hydrostatic pressure loads, both statically and dynamically, while radius and wall thickness were monitored echocardiographically. Pressure-radius curves were constructed. Radius and wall thickness were determined at a pressure of 100 mmHg. Radius at elastin resting length and collagen recruitment pressure (Pcol, mmHg) were derived from the pressure-radius relationship and stress-strain curves were constructed to yield Young's moduli of elastin and collagen. Distensibility (D, mmHg- 1) was determined while loading the segment with a sinusoidal pressure wave of 120 / 50 mmHg at both 0. 5 and 1 Hz. Subsequently increasing static pressure loads of 400, 800, 1200 and 1600 mmHg were applied. After each pressure load, the increase in aortic radius at a pressure of 100 mmHg (Rinc) was determined. The experiment continued until rupture occurred and <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> (sigma <b>break,</b> N m- 2) was calculated, donor age and aortic stiffness were correlated with Rinc and sigma break of the aortic segments. RESULTS: Mean <b>breaking</b> <b>stress</b> of the 14 segments was 2. 7 x 10 (6) N m- 2. Breaking stress was negatively correlated with age (r 2 = 0. 66) and positively with D (r 2 = 0. 44) and with Pcol (r 2 = 0. 18).
