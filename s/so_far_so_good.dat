5|$|<b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! (stylized as <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>so</b> <b>good...</b> so what !) is {{the third}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on January 19, 1988 by Capitol Records. It is the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, {{both of whom were}} fired immediately after its subsequent tour. <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! features music performed at very fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth is an American thrash metal band {{formed by}} guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine—after he {{departed}} from Metallica—along with bassist David Ellefson, guitarist Greg Handevidt, and drummer Dijon Carruthers, in 1983. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a demo that featured new drummer Lee Rausch, who replaced Carruthers. Slayer guitarist Kerry King covered live dates while a permanent replacement was sought. This lineup was short-lived {{and after a}} few shows in 1984, Lee Rausch was replaced by jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson, in addition to the second guitarist Chris Poland. During the Megadeth's 1985 tour promoting their debut, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, Poland left the band and was temporarily replaced by Mike Albert. Poland then rejoined Megadeth in October of the same year, shortly before they began work on Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?. After years of problems stemming from substance abuse, Mustaine fired both Poland and Samuelson before recording the third album <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What!; being replaced by Jeff Young and Chuck Behler, respectively.|$|E
500|$|With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! {{took over}} five months to record. The album was plagued with {{problems}} during production, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: [...] "The production of <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't {{have at the}} time." [...] Mustaine clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the album's mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.|$|E

60|$|<b>So</b> <b>far</b> was <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> This {{idea of a}} model {{wife had}} already become a very {{expensive}} idea, and in winding it up to its natural conclusion poor Graham was willing to spend almost every shilling that he could call his own. But there was still another difficulty in his way. What would Snow père say? Snow père was, he knew, a man with whom dealings would be more difficult than with Albert Fitzallen. And then, seeing that he had already promised to give his remaining possessions to Albert Fitzallen, with what could he bribe Snow père to abandon that natural ambition to have a barrister for his son-in-law? In these days, too, Snow père had derogated even from the position in which Graham had first known him, and had become but little better than a drunken, begging impostor. What a father-in-law to have had! And then Felix Graham thought of Judge Staveley.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{rounds of}} {{knockout}} qualifying {{took place at}} 6:45 p.m., but heavy rain forced the session to be cancelled and the starting lineup was set by first practice times according to the NASCAR rulebook. As a result, Kevin Harvick was awarded the first starting spot for the race. He was joined on the front row by Joey Logano. [...] "We haven’t been in race trim yet," [...] Logano said. [...] "We stayed in qualifying trim all day today and I {{felt like it was}} qualifying during practice. We were really trying to top the charts. We really felt like that was where we would be starting at the end of practice. Obviously this storm is huge and we didn’t have a shot in hell of making qualifying happen.” “It is a lot better than last year when we started 25th," [...] Brad Keselowski - who started third - said. [...] "We will take that and move on. The car has been pretty <b>good</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>so</b> I feel <b>good</b> about that." [...] Ryan Blaney, Travis Kvapil and Michael McDowell failed to qualify for the race.|$|R
500|$|... "Cold Sweat" [...] is a Thin Lizzy cover, {{originally}} {{appearing on}} Thunder and Lightning (1983). Excluding bonus tracks, {{it is the}} first cover song to appear on a Megadeth album since [...] "Anarchy in the UK", a Sex Pistols cover, was included on <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! in 1988. Mustaine said he had been wanting to cover the song since the early 1990s.|$|E
500|$|<b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! was {{released}} in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics. The album featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols' [...] "Anarchy in the U.K."; Mustaine changed the song's lyrics, later {{saying that he had}} simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour, opening for Dio in Europe and then joining Iron Maiden's Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{recording}} of the band's third album, Mustaine fired Poland and Samuelson; they were replaced by Jeff Young and Chuck Behler, respectively. The new lineup debuted on <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! in early 1988. Later that year, Mustaine fired Young and Behler {{and replaced them with}} guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. This lineup recorded Megadeth's fourth album, Rust in Peace, which was released in late 1990. The singles [...] "Holy Wars... The Punishment Due" [...] and [...] "Hangar 18" [...] reached the top 30 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Megadeth's most commercially successful album, Countdown to Extinction (1992), peaked at number2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was the band's first record to be certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Megadeth's biggest hit single is [...] "Symphony of Destruction", which peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and in the top 15 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.|$|E
60|$|How Mr. Blackthorn {{ever came}} to ask her that question, nobody can guess, and Harold {{believes}} {{he does not know}} himself. However, it got an answer two years ago, and Mrs. King gave her consent with all her heart, though she knew Betsey Hardman would talk of picking a husband up out of the gutter, and that my Lady would look severe, and say something of silly girls. Yes--and though the rich widower bailiff had said sundry civil things of Miss Ellen being well brought up and notable--'For,' as Mrs. King wrote to Matilda, 'I had rather see Ellen married to a good religious man than to any one, and I do not know one I can be so sure of as Paul, nor one that is so like a son to me; and if he has no friends belonging to him, that is better than bad friends.' And Ellen herself, from looking on him as a mere boy, as she had done at their first acquaintance, had come to thinking no one ever had been so wise or <b>so</b> clever, <b>far</b> less <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> certainly not <b>so</b> fond of her--so her answer was no great wonder. Then they were to be prudent, and wait for some dependence; and so they did till Mr. Shaw recommended Paul Blackthorn for Hazleford school, where there is a beautiful new house for the master, so that he will have no longer to live in lodgings, and be 'done for,' as the saying is. Harold tells Ellen that he is afraid that without her he won't wash above once in four months; but however that may be, she is convinced that the new school-house will be lost on him, and that in spite of all his fine arithmetic, his fifty pounds will never go <b>so</b> <b>far</b> for one as for two; and so she did not turn a deaf ear to his entreaties that she would not send him alone to Hazleford.|$|R

500|$|Megadeth started {{performing}} the album's songs live before the record was released. During 1987 they toured with other thrash metal bands such as Kreator and Overkill {{at a number}} of European venues. The following year Megadeth appeared with more established heavy metal acts such as Dio and Savatage for some shows in North America. They also headlined a European tour, with support from Testament and Sanctuary. Later in 1988 the group made an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival, but were dropped from the line-up after one show; Megadeth was replaced by Testament. Dave Mustaine explained that the band toured quite often because they were not receiving much media exposure: [...] "We do a lot of shows and sell records by word-of-mouth". Los Angeles Times reported that <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! sold 400,000 copies one month after its release, becoming Megadeth's fastest selling album at that point. The record eventually went platinum and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{entered the}} 1990s {{with the release}} of Waking Up the Neighbours (1991), which {{contained}} [...] "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", the theme song for the film [...] The album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. He also released his first greatest hits compilation, <b>So</b> <b>Far</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good,</b> in 1993. This album topped the charts in nine countries and was certified six-time platinum and five-time platinum by the RIAA and CRIA respectively. His seventh studio album, 18 til I Die, was released in 1996. It sold five million copies worldwide and was certified platinum in the United States. MTV Unplugged, an acoustic live album released in 1997, reached the top ten in four countries while selling two million copies in Europe. Adams' eighth studio album, On a Day Like Today (1998), was certified double-platinum by the CRIA and platinum by the IFPI Platinum Europe Awards. His second compilation album, The Best of Me (1999), sold two million copies in Europe and went three-times platinum in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Adrien Begrand of Popmatters noted [...] "not {{a moment}} is wasted on Endgame" [...] and said [...] "it's all due to Mustaine {{sticking}} to his strengths, {{and with the}} extraordinarily talented Broderick as his new wingman, the record positively scorches with an intensity we haven’t heard since Rust in Peace. With its furious back-and-forth solos, opening instrumental 'Dialectic Chaos' wastes no time in showcasing that dynamic between Mustaine and Broderick, and combined with the pure speed of 'This Day We Fight!', longtime fans will be instantly reminded of the bracing 'Into the Lungs of Hell'/'Set the World Afire' one-two punch that kicks off 1988's great <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What!." [...] Mark Eglinton of The Quietus described the album as [...] "a return to form" [...] for Megadeth. Rock guitarist Slash gave a favorable review to Endgame via Twitter. [...] Also, Q gave the album three stars out of five and said: [...] "Endgame starts with an instrumental before hitting the kind of rhythms that once earned Megadeth the tag 'state-of-the-art speed-metal-band'." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} {{positive feedback}} from music critics {{at the time}} of its release. In a contemporary review, Holger Stratmann from Rock Hard hailed the album as [...] "the new masterpiece of Megadeth" [...] and asserted that the band had created a great follow-up to their highly acclaimed Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? Jim Farber of Rolling Stone also gave the album a favorable review, saying it propelled the group [...] "right at the top of the thrash-rock heap". He concluded his review by saying, [...] "amid today's narcoleptic pop scene, albums like <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> ... So What! offer a disruptive noise that's welcome indeed". Writing for Spin, J. D. Considine felt that the record showed a [...] "genuine maturity" [...] for the band. Robert Christgau reacted toward the album with tepid positivity, [...] and wrote that Megadeth garnered [...] "its modest portions of profit and respect" [...] with their latest studio release. He praised [...] "Anarchy in the U.K.", commenting that Mustaine covers the Sex Pistols [...] "like a champ".|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} critic J. D. Considine of Spin, <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> So What! {{displays}} music performed at [...] "volumes approaching {{the threshold of}} pain". This was the first album where another band member other than Mustaine contributed to writing, with bassist David Ellefson contributing to either lyrics or music on half of the album's songs. The album features fast guitar solos, multiple tempo changes and technical dexterity. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic observed that the album offers the classic [...] "take no prisoners" [...] style which is commonly associated with Megadeth; however, {{he noted that the}} sound does not differ much from the other underground metal bands from that period. Jim Farber of Rolling Stone called Mustaine's vocals [...] "bloodthirsty" [...] and praised the musicianship for keeping rhythmic pace even at the [...] "most anarchic moments". Los Angeles Times journalist Dennis Hunt noted that the music was filled with extensive and [...] "torrid" [...] instrumentals and described Mustaine's singing as a combination of extreme shrieking and screaming. Despite the positive overview, [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] received some negative criticism, partially because it was perceived to lack the rebelliousness of the original version.|$|E
500|$|During {{their world}} tour {{in support of}} <b>So</b> <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good...</b> in February 1988, Mustaine noticed {{problems}} developing with Behler. Six months later, Mustaine fired both Behler and Young. In July 1989, Nick Menza was hired to replace Behler on the drums. After a lengthy {{search for a new}} lead guitarist, Megadeth enlisted Marty Friedman, who officially joined in February 1990. The lineup remained unchanged for almost eight years, until Menza discovered a tumor on his knee, which forced him to leave the tour to undergo surgery. He was replaced by Jimmy DeGrasso, temporarily at first. Following the Ozzfest tour in 1998, however, DeGrasso replaced Menza permanently, after Mustaine claimed that Menza had [...] "lied about having cancer". Following the release of Risk, the band began a new world tour in September 1999. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced that he would be leaving the band, citing [...] "musical differences". Megadeth enlisted guitarist Al Pitrelli as Friedman's replacement in January 2000. In early 2002, Mustaine suffered several injuries, which led him to announce in a press release that Megadeth had disbanded. Following nearly a year of recovery, Mustaine began work on what was to be his first solo album. The new material was recorded with session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmy Lee Sloas, but the project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeth's eight-album back catalog with Capitol Records.|$|E
