5000|$|In 2004, {{the stadium}} {{was hit by}} Hurricane Charley. The damage from the storm caused the {{grandstand}} to be labeled [...] "unsafe". Later in the year, The Board of Lee County Commissioners approved a guaranteed maximum price of $701,697 for Compass Construction {{to tear down the}} old grandstand and build a new one. But instead of rebuilding the historic 5,000 seat grandstand, the city replaced it with a small 700 <b>seat</b> <b>structure.</b> This was {{despite the fact that the}} park was given an official historic marker in 1995. Technically once a grandstand is demolished, the basepark loses all of its historic significance, regardless of whether it is the same field. Only the old girders have been retained as the outline for a new grandstand that opened in 2005. So what stands at Terry Park now bears little resemblance to the Spring training location it once was. While the new grandstand is covered, it is much smaller and made of metal. Many residents feel that it was unfortunate that the county decided not to try to save the classic grandstand. 2006 marked the centennial anniversary of Terry Park - at least the playing field portion of it. The new stadium currently seats about 900 people, as the additional bleachers down the foul lines have been removed. A spring training museum is also being considered for the park.|$|E

According to GB 15083 - 2006 standard, a finite element model of luggage cabin and rear-row seat was developed in LS-DYNA and validated via test results. The model was used in analysis of the safety performance of rear <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> under luggage impact in car frontal crashes, in order to minimize the risk of child occupant injury. A 3 years old child seat was simulated with fixing on the rear seat. Four optimization schemes were designed {{in order to reduce the}} intrusion and acceleration of the rear <b>seat</b> <b>structure,</b> comparing to the original model. The original model was improved via the structure optimization of rear seat, as well as the fixed positions of child seat. A verification model is developed to simulate rear seat impact with combined optimization schemes. The final results from the verification model show that the intrusion and acceleration of rear <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> are all much smaller than original seat model...|$|E

40|$|The NVH {{optimization}} of the BIW and <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> in {{the advanced}} {{phase of the}} design demands too much time and cost. On the other hand, developing a reliable NVH concept model in the earliest stage of the design to improve dynamic behaviour of the structure and avoid conflicting designs might be an effective approach. To this end, a practical method for CAE-NVH concept modelling is developed. The developed model utilizes beam elements with standard and arbitrary cross sections for the main load carrying components (namely beam-like structures) of the BIW and <b>seat</b> <b>structure.</b> Also, major joints are approximated from the detailed CAE model by taking static model reduction method into account. Due to the indisputable effects of some panels (e. g., roof) on the BIW structural dynamics characteristics, shell element with rough meshing are exploited to model these components. The developed concept models are verified by comparing their resonant frequencies and mode shapes with counterpart advanced CAE models in low frequency range. Having been validated by dynamic domain indicators, the developed concept model is used to improve the NVH performance of the automotive. In one case, modes interaction between BIW and <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> is characterized. Then, by examining {{the influence of the}} beams properties (both BIW and seat) in conflicting modes, the problem is managed. Having been separated the identified interacting modes, the amplitude of the vibration on the seat-back is suppressed about 10 db around corresponding frequency. As a result, by taking advantages of the proposed method in similar cases, the CAE-NVH concept model can be successfully used to lead the right first time design...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} interest has evolved concerning seat integrated safety belts in cars, regarding both 3 - and 4 -point belts in various configurations. One safety advantage of seat integrated safety belts {{appears in the}} case of so-called small overlap crashes. One consequence of a small overlap crash can be that the colliding cars strike each other's sides hitting both the A- and B-pillar. Hence, the A- as well as the B-pillar are pushed inwards and backwards. In this case, belt anchor points on the B-pillar may also be pushed backwards and the belt will be stretched over the occupant. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate seat integrated safety belt configurations that may involve a <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> design that intentionally deforms and absorbs energy during a crash. Common 3 -point configurations were used as references. The aim was to investigate how the physical properties influence the interaction of the seat back frame and the safety belt. Numerical simulations were carried out using the explicit LS-DYNA FE-analysis software. A FE-model of a <b>seat</b> <b>structure,</b> floor pan and B-pillar was established. A 50 th percentile Hybrid III FE-dummy model was used as occupant and for studying the biomechanical responses. Different physical properties of the <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> and different belt load limit forces were used as parametric variables. Only frontal crashes were considered. Responses concerning chest deflection, head- and chest displacement, change of pelvis angle, pelvis submarining tendency, lap- and torso belt forces, seat back frame deflection, ride-down efficiency, <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> natural frequency, upper neck loads and neck injury criteria were studied. The results indicate that the belt-webbing distribution between the lap and the torso belts via a slip-ring and in combination with a non-rigid seat back frame increases the ride-down efficiency compared to a system with no belt-webbing distribution. Further, the combined use of different energy absorption mechanisms influences the biomechanical response as well as the structural response of an integrated safety belt configuration. An optimal solution with respect to multiple objectives requires a proper combination of parameters. Beside the optimisation of traditional biomechanical responses, the multiple objectives can be the minimisation of weight and cost as well as optimal control of passenger kinematics. The present study will hopefully create a basis for future research and possibly for the design of seat integrated safety belts. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|The {{noise and}} {{vibration}} of a poor automotive seat aggravate the interior cabin noise and discomfort. The automotive seat structural {{noise and vibration}} {{is caused by the}} transmission of the power train or road vibration into the seat. The characterization of seat structural dynamics behavior in early design phase assists to effectively improve the NVH quality of the seat. The seat nonlinear buzz, squeak, and rattle (BSR) noise are the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH quality of the vehicle. For this purpose, a practical CAE (computer-aided engineering) concept modeling method is introduced and developed for full BIW (body-in-white) and seat separately. Here, the seat concept model is employed to allow designing the <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> modifications as well as examining the effects of the modifications on the rattle noise. Comparisons {{of the results of the}} simulation and experiment validate the developed seat CAE model. Three modifications are proposed to optimize the dynamics of the <b>seat</b> <b>structure</b> to prevent the seat rattle noise. These modifications are designed to shift or decrease the seat torsion resonance and vibration level, respectively. The results verified that by modification the seat structural dynamics, the nonlinear events such as rattle noise and in general BSR noise can be reduced or controlled accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{sustainability}} {{has been}} {{a growing concern for}} many industries and especially for the transportation sector due to it being the second largest energy consumer and largest contributor of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union.
