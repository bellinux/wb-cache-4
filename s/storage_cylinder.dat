5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder.</b> As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E
25|$|Breathing gas is {{supplied}} to the divers {{from the surface}} through the bell umbilical. If this system fails, the bell carries an on-board gas supply which is plumbed into the bell gas panel and can be switched by operating the relevant valves. On-board gas is generally carried externally in several <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> of 50 litres capacity or larger, connected through pressure regulators to the gas panel.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{blending}} is {{the process}} of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the mixture into a <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{may be used}} {{independently}} {{in sequence}} using a portable transfer whip with a pressure gauge and manual bleed valve, to transfill the receiving cylinder until the appropriate fill pressure has been reached, or the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> may be connected to a manifold system and a filling control panel {{with one or more}} filling whips.|$|R

25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{gas panel}} or gas {{manifold}} is the control equipment for supplying the breathing gas to the divers. Primary and reserve gas is supplied {{to the panel}} through shutoff valves from a low-pressure compressor or high-pressure storage cylinders ("bombs", [...] "quads", or [...] "kellys"). The gas pressure may be controlled at the panel by an industrial pressure regulator, or it may already be regulated closer to the source (at the compressor, or at the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> outlet). The supply gas pressure is monitored on a gauge at the panel, and an over-pressure valve is fitted in case the supply pressure is too high. The gas panel may be operated by the diving supervisor if the breathing gas is air or a fixed ratio premix, but if the composition must be controlled or monitored during the dive it is usual for a dedicated gas panel operator, or [...] "gas man" [...] to do this work.|$|E
50|$|Ideally each <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> has an {{independent}} {{connection to the}} filling panel with a contents pressure gauge and supply valve dedicated to that cylinder, and a filling gauge connected to the filling whip, so the operator can see at a glance the next higher <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure compared to the receiving cylinder pressure.|$|E
50|$|Compressors used to fill scuba {{cylinders}} {{have a high}} {{delivery pressure}} and may have a low delivery volume. They are used to fill diving <b>cylinders</b> and <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> or banks of <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders.</b> These compressors may be smaller and less powerful because the volume of gas they deliver is not so critical as it is not directly used by the diver; a lower volume compressor {{can be used to}} fill large <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> during the periods when demand is low. This stored compressed air can be decanted into diving cylinders when needed. Common scuba diving cylinder pressures are 200 bar (2940 psi), 3000 psi (207 bar), 232 bar (3400 psi) and 300 bar (4500 psi).|$|R

50|$|About 95% of the {{depleted}} uranium produced until now is stored as uranium hexafluoride, (D)UF6, in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 US tons) of UF6. In the U.S. alone, 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF6 had accumulated by 1993. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> were located near Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky.The long-term storage of DUF6 presents environmental, health, and safety risks {{because of its}} chemical instability. When UF6 is exposed to moist air, it reacts with {{the water in the}} air and produces UO2F2 (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride), both of which are highly soluble and toxic. <b>Storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.|$|R
5000|$|Open-circuit-demand scuba expels {{exhaled air}} to the environment, and {{requires}} each breath be delivered to the diver on demand by a diving regulator, which reduces the pressure from the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> and supplies it through the demand valve when the diver reduces the pressure in the demand valve during inhalation.|$|E
50|$|As {{it is not}} {{possible}} to decant to a diving cylinder from a <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> that holds gas at a lower pressure than the diving cylinder, the expensive gas in low pressure storage cylinders is not easily consumed and may go to waste when the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> is returned to the supplier. The cascade system may be used with a bank of storage cylinders to economically consume these high cost gases so that the economically maximum gas is used from the bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by first decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder's pressure and then from the next higher-pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximizes the use of low-pressure bank gas and minimizes the use of high-pressure bank gas.|$|E
50|$|Open circuit demand scuba {{exhausts}} {{exhaled air}} to the environment, and requires each breath to be delivered to the diver on demand by a diving regulator, which reduces the pressure from the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> and supplies it through the demand valve when the diver reduces the pressure in the demand valve slightly during inhalation.|$|E
50|$|Cylinders {{may also}} be filled {{directly}} from high-pressure storage systems by decanting, with or without pressure boosting to reach the desired charging pressure.Cascade filling {{may be used for}} efficiency when multiple <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> are available.

A backpropagation Neural Network model is developed to predict composite cylinder failure. The inputs of the neural network model are the laminate thickness, winding angle, and temperatures.

50|$|While {{elevators}} and swivelling propellers provide {{fine control}} of altitude, larger changes of height {{used to be}} controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude.
