5000|$|The LP {{included}} one composition {{by the full}} band excepting Stewart, the instrumental [...] "Fly in the Ointment" [...] (the only composition by the four to make it onto any of their albums, as usually they were relegated to the b-sides of singles - such as the other contemporary instrumental [...] "Skewiff", serving as the b-side to the [...] "Cindy Incidentally" [...] single). Stewart's compositions for the album were written mostly in tandem with Wood and McLagan, although unusually for the band two were written in <b>sole</b> <b>partnership</b> with Lane. The title track by Wood and Lane featured the only solo lead vocal from Wood performed in the studio during the band's existence, recorded at Glyn Johns' suggestion after neither Lane nor Stewart {{were said to be}} satisfied with their own attempts at it. Stewart apparently claimed {{at the time that the}} song was in the wrong key for him, but he would later cover the song on his 1998 album When We Were the New Boys, in tribute to the recently-deceased Lane. Lane himself would perform the song he co-wrote on many occasions during his own post-Faces solo career.|$|E
