40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years a {{persistent}} gap has existed in income and productivity levels between Australia and New Zealand. One possible contributor to the creation of this gap is the different levels of <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> embodied by the workforces of the two countries. This paper analyses the intensity of <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> in different types of employment in the two countries. In order to undertake this analysis, O*NET measures of <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> Australian and New Zealand employment data are used. The paper concludes that although the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> intensities of the labour forces in the two countries are broadly similar, they do exhibit some important differences...|$|R

5|$|People {{have been}} living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were {{originally}} hunter-gatherers. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> were passed down through the generations by word of mouth. Other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{universities}} are complemented {{in the provision}} of Further and Higher Education by 43 Colleges. Colleges offer National Certificates, Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas. These Group Awards, alongside Scottish Vocational Qualifications, aim to ensure Scotland's population has the appropriate <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> to meet workplace needs. In 2014, research reported by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in {{the world in terms of}} tertiary education attainment, with roughly 40% of people in Scotland aged 16–64 educated to NVQ level 4 and above. Based on the original data for EU statistical regions, all four Scottish regions ranked significantly above the European average for completion of tertiary-level education by 25- to 64-year-olds.|$|E
5|$|The Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication {{commissioned}} {{studies in}} 1975 and 1987 {{on the state}} of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis.|$|E

25|$|Diver {{training}} {{can be divided}} into entry level training, which are those <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> considered essential for the diver to dive unsupervised at an acceptably low level of risk by the certifying agency, and further <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> which allow better performance and extend the environmental capacity of the diver. There is a significant variation in entry level training, with some training agencies requiring the bare minimum as specified by RSTC and ISO, and others requiring a greater level of competence with associated assumption of lower risk to the diver and dive buddy. Entry level training may include skills for assisting or rescue of another diver, but this is not always the case. Divers without rescue training are routinely assigned to dive as buddy pairs to follow organizational protocols. This is not generally a contravention of the training agencies' recommendations.|$|E
