40|$|We {{study the}} optimal {{throughput}} that is achievable for uplink and downlink multiuser communication, assuming that spatial linear filtering is {{performed at the}} base station, and each mobile station {{is equipped with a}} <b>single</b> <b>antenna.</b> <b>Channel</b> state information is assumed to be available at the base station. The total transmission power is constrained. Independent precoding/decoding is assumed. The resulting sum rate objective is generally non-convex, thus known algorithms for determinant maximization cannot be applied. In this paper we analyze this nonconvex optimization problem and provide partial solutions. For the low-SNR regime we prove that the sum capacity is achieved by focusing all the energy on the user with the largest 2 -norm of the channel vector. The SNR range for which single user transmission is optimal is characterized. For arbitrary SNR an algorithmic approach is discussed, which exploits some beneficial properties of the sum rate function...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} wireless multihop networks with a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> and omnidirectional <b>antennas.</b> Such networks exhibit some distinctive and interesting properties. The most central {{one is that}} each transmission is a local broadcast, i. e., it can be received by all nodes in the vicinity. It is thus not exclusive between the sender and the intended receiver. This unique environment {{turned out to be}} very challenging for existing communication protocols. Therefore, it has most often been seen—and treated—as a handicap. We look at the same properties from a very different angle: they can in fact often provide the basis for novel and unconventional solution approaches, and many challenges can be tackled by being aware of their consequences, and by making use of them in tailored protocol designs. The medium properties can be used to obtain information and to co-ordinate actions implicitly, i. e., without dedicated information exchange. As our first major contribution, we introduce a congestion control scheme that bridges what was traditionally transport layer functionality and medium access scheduling. Implicit hop-by-hop congestion control does not need to exchange any congestion feedbac...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{multiple}} <b>antenna</b> downlink <b>channel</b> where limited channel {{feedback is}} available to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink <b>channel</b> (<b>single</b> <b>antenna</b> at each receiver), the transmit antenna array {{can be used to}} transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter has very accurate channel knowledge, i. e., if there is high-rate channel feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of non-orthogonal spatial {{multiplexing}} under hard fairness constraints, assuming that the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas {{and each of the}} independent receivers has a <b>single</b> <b>antenna.</b> <b>Channel</b> state information is available at the transmitter. All users are coupled by co-channel interference, thus maintaining individual QoS requirements requires the joint optimization of beamforming and power control. In this paper we study the problem in the absence of noise. The achievable signal-to-interference-ratios (SIR) of all user are limited by the amount of mutual cross-talk. The design question: at which level can the relative SIR levels be balanced under the given channel condition, and what are the optimal beamforming weights? Our approach is analytic. By exploiting the duality between uplink and downlink beamforming, we derive an iterative optimization scheme that is globally convergent and always finds the optimally balanced level. This provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of the given scenario. Hence, the results will prove useful for the design of new beamforming algorithms as well as for new spectrally efficient resource allocation strategies...|$|R
30|$|The complex {{meandering}} river belt {{is composed}} of several <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> belts. A <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> belt consists of multiple point bars. According to the development situation of the oil field, analysis of deeper <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> belt levels, i.e., the identification of point bars within the <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> belt, is necessary.|$|R
30|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to reduce the {{hardware}} cost and design complexity of such systems. One feasible solution is to use a single-RF-channel structure in the antenna array. There are two main kinds of single-RF-channel structures, which use only one receiver channel and therefore are cost effective. The first is the switched antenna array (SAA), in which the connections of the antennas to the <b>single</b> receiving <b>channel</b> are periodically switched to sample the array signals. This structure was proposed in [13], and the corresponding array signal processing method has been discussed in [14 – 16]. However, although the number of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and mixers is reduced, the numbers of low-pass filters and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) still must be proportional to the number of elements [17]. The second type of structure is the time sequence phase weighting (TSPW) antenna array [18, 19], in which the combined phase weighted array signals are sequentially sampled by a <b>single</b> RF-receiving <b>channel.</b> Each <b>antenna</b> element is followed by a 1 -bit digitally controlled 0 / π phase shifter. The weighted array signals are combined to form a single-channel output, and only one ADC is required to sample this output. In previous research, the base-band signal has typically been assumed to be time-invariant. This assumption is acceptable for most communication scenarios in which the sampling cycle is equal to the period of each data symbol [20, 21]. However, when the target has a relative radial velocity, the echo signal will contain a Doppler frequency, which causes the received signal to be time-varying. Therefore, a TSPW array cannot obtain the correct array signals in the case of movement. This is a key problem that must be addressed before the use of TSPW antenna arrays can become widespread.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{detecting}} fetal ECG using abdominal {{signal is}} a commonly used method, but fetal ECG signal {{will be affected}} by maternal ECG. Current FECG extraction algorithms are mainly aiming at multiple channels signal. They often assume there is only one fetus and did not consider multiple births. This paper proposed a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> blind source separation (SCBSS) algorithm based on source number estimation using multi-algorithm fusion to process single abdominal signal. The method decomposed collected <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> signal into multiple intrinsic mode function (IMF) utilizing Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), mapping <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> into multiple channels. Four multiple channel source number estimation (MCSNE) methods (Bootstrap, Hough, AIC and PCA) were weighting fused to estimate accurate source number and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was employed to determine weighted coefficient. According to source number and IMF, nonnegative matrix was constructed and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was employed to separate mixed signals. Experiments used <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> signal mixed by four man-made signals and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> ECG mixed by two to verify the proposed algorithm.

40|$|A radio {{direction}} finding (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a receiver arranged in a combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio direction finding techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios. Although the amount of existing research for <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> DF is considerably less than for multi-channel direction finding, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> direction finding techniques have been previously investigated.
