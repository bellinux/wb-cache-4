5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly <b>simplifies</b> the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also <b>simplifies</b> the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|Each major-thirds tuning repeats its open-notes {{after every}} two strings, {{which results in}} two copies of the three open-strings' notes, each in a {{different}} octave. This repetition again <b>simplifies</b> the learning of chords and improvisation. This advantage is not shared by two popular regular-tunings, all-fourths and all-fifths tuning.|$|E
5|$|For guitars {{with six}} strings, every major-third tuning repeats its three open-notes in two octaves, so {{providing}} many options for fingering chords. By repeating open-string notes and by having uniform intervals between strings, major-thirds tuning <b>simplifies</b> learning by beginners. These features also facilitate advanced guitarists' improvisation, precisely {{the aim of}} jazz guitarist RalphPatt when he began popularizing major-thirds tuning between 1963 and 1964.|$|E

5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he <b>simplifies</b> his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E

5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and <b>simplifies</b> their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note {{in a higher}} octave, because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this {{repetition}} <b>simplifies</b> the learning of chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field <b>simplifies</b> drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Professor A.A. Bühlmann of the Laboratory of Hyperbaric {{medicine}} of the Medical Clinic of the University of Zurich {{developed the}} Swiss tables, more {{often referred to}} as Bühlmann tables, in the early 1960s. The model is Haldanian, with 16 tissue compartments with half-times from 2.65 minutes to 635 minutes, each with linearly varying supersaturation limits depending on the tissue and the ambient pressure, and is based on absolute pressures, which <b>simplifies</b> application to altitude diving.|$|E
5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, <b>simplifies</b> design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look {{is a question of}} fashion rather than function.|$|E
5|$|X-rays are {{generally}} filtered (by use of X-Ray Filters) {{to a single}} wavelength (made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before {{they are allowed to}} strike the crystal. The filtering not only <b>simplifies</b> the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing useful information. Collimation is done either with a collimator (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3 mm) or with large unit cells (over 150 Å).|$|E

5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which <b>simplifies</b> crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and <b>simplifies</b> the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5|$|West further broadened {{his musical}} palette on Graduation by not {{limiting}} {{himself to his}} customary use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from a far more eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, {{for much of the}} third studio album, Kanye West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono's operatic vocal stylings. West altered his vocabulary, he utilized less of the percussive, rhythmic consonants in favor of the more smoother, melodic vowel sounds. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he <b>simplifies</b> some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes.|$|E
