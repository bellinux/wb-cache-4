5|$|Post-war service saw Utah {{again in}} the Atlantic Fleet; during 1921–22, she was {{stationed}} in Europe. Utah was also retained under the Washington Naval Treaty. In 1924–1925, the ship sailed on a goodwill cruise to South America. Following her return to the United States, she was taken into dry dock for significant reconstruction. After she rejoined the active fleet, she {{was assigned to the}} US Scouting Fleet. Late in 1928, she steamed to the South Atlantic, where <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up President-Elect Herbert Hoover, who was returning from an ambassadorial visit to several South American countries.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, De Soto {{stood up}} the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River to the Washington Navy Yard, where <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up letters for the West Indies. Steaming south on 1 January 1866, the warship stopped at Santo Domingo, Port-au-Prince and Havana before {{returning}} to Washington, D.C., on the 28th. She remained there until 19 March when she proceeded down river and into the Bay, reaching Hampton Roads on the 23d. On 10 April the warship was placed {{under the command of}} Captain Charles S.

5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto ordered I-58 northward {{looking for}} {{additional}} ships to attack. <b>She</b> <b>picked</b> up {{reports of the}} atomic bombing of Hiroshima in intercepted radio transmissions on 7 August but Hashimoto continued to hunt for Allied ships south of Bungo Strait. On 9 August she launched two kaitens against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining kaitens and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. I-58 surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the Gyokuon-hōsō signaling the Japanese surrender {{and end of the}} war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew {{of the end of the}} war. After the war, it was confirmed Indianapolis was the only ship I-58 had sunk. It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II. When Hashimoto came home from the war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> it up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her.

5|$|Michigan was {{reactivated}} in 1921 {{for another}} cruise to the Caribbean, departing on 4 April. She returned to Philadelphia on 23 April; shortly thereafter, the ship became {{embroiled in a}} minor scandal. The ship's commanding officer at the time, Clark Daniel Stearns, instituted a series of sailors' committees on 3 May to ease tensions between officers and the crew. The commanders of the Atlantic Fleet and Michigans squadron decided that the committees were a threat to discipline and evidence of Marxist influences. They contacted the Edwin Denby, then the Secretary of the Navy, who relieved Stearns of command. On 28 May, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up another group of midshipmen for another training cruise. This voyage took the ship to Europe, with stops {{in a number of}} ports, including Christiana, Norway, Lisbon, Portugal, and Gibraltar. She returned to Hampton Roads via Guantanamo Bay on 22 August.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers, including scouts for the main fleet, colonial cruisers, and representatives of Italy at major foreign events. Elba observed the Russo-Japanese War, including the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in 1904, where <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up Russian survivors. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 1906. Elba and Liguria were equipped with observation balloons in 19071908. In 1910, Umbria was sold to Haiti and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she quickly sank under the care of her inexperienced crew. The remaining ships, except for Lombardia, took part in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops, bombarded Ottoman ports, and instituted a blockade in the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1941, Admiral Hipper {{embarked}} on her second Atlantic sortie. The Kriegsmarine had initially sought {{to send the}} battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to operate in concert with Admiral Hipper, but Gneisenau suffered storm damage in December that prevented {{the participation of the}} two ships. Repairs were effected quickly, however, and the two battleships broke out into the Atlantic in early February. Admiral Hipper rendezvoused with a tanker off the Azores to top up her fuel tanks. On 11 February, the ship encountered and sank an isolated transport from convoy HG 53, which had been dispersed by U-boat and Luftwaffe attacks. That evening, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up the unescorted convoy SLS 64, which contained nineteen merchant ships. The following morning, Admiral Hipper closed in and sank several of the ships. The British reported only seven ships were lost, totaling , along with damage to two more. The Germans claimed Admiral Hipper had sunk thirteen of the nineteen freighters, while some survivors reported fourteen ships of the convoy were sunk.|$|E

Carter missed a {{practice}} game that her team played against Germany's women's wheelchair basketball team because of an illness <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up during a team training camp at the Australian Institute of Sport that took place a week before the start of the Games. Half of her team had respiratory infections before the start of the Paralympics. She did not attend the opening ceremonies. During group play at the games, she scored 12 points in a 38–26 victory against the Netherlands, which was the most points she had ever scored in an international match. At one point, she made four baskets in a row. Her team made the gold medal game after beating Japan by a score of 45–33. Going into the gold medal game, Carter had missed the previous day's training session, and had an elbow injury. Her team lost the match to Canada before a crowd of 16,389 spectators, with Carter scoring only four points in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Because of Saratogas age and {{the number}} of modern {{carriers}} in service, the Navy decided to modify her into a training carrier. The aft elevator and its machinery were removed, the opening was plated over and the forward elevator was replaced with a larger model. Part of the hangar deck was converted into classrooms. While the ship was still under repair Captain Frank Akers assumed command on 27 April. The post-refit machinery trials on 12 May revealed some problems with one turbine, and an explosion in one 5-inch gun wounded eleven men and wrecked the mount. The full-power trials were completed on 20 May and a new mount was loaded aboard to be installed at Pearl. The ship sailed for NAS Alameda a few days later where <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up 60 aircraft, 1,200 passengers and some trucks for delivery in Pearl. Saratoga arrived on 1 June and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ralph F. Jennings, commander of Carrier Division 11. She resumed carrier qualification training on 3 June until she returned to the dockyard on 10 June for the installation of her replacement five-inch gun mount. Jennings transferred his flag to another carrier from 11 to 30 June. She continued training carrier pilots after the Japanese surrender until 6 September. Over the span of the ship's 17-year career, Saratogas aviators landed on her deck 98,549 times, then the record for the most carrier landings. Saratoga received eight battle stars for her World War II service. After the war, the ship took part in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American servicemen from the European, Pacific, and Asian theaters. She left Hawaii on 9 September with 3,712 Navy officers and enlisted men bound for the United States. In the course of the operation, she returned 29,204 veterans, the highest total for any individual vessel.|$|E
