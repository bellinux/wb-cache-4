50|$|Quince and Fig were {{a series}} of surface shots that {{occurred}} in early August {{at the center of}} Runit. They were the last of the Hardtack tests conducted at the Enewetak Atoll. Quince was detonated at 2:15pm on August 6, 1958. Twelve days later, the Fig device was detonated on August 18, 1958 at 4:00pm. Quince and Fig were UCRL devices with co-sponsorship through the DOD and the AEC, though the main focus of these tests was weapons development. One of the main differences between these two tests was that over 130 tons of soil from the Nevada Test Site had been shipped in and was placed at <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> of the Fig test. The radioactive cloud from the Quince blast rose to 1,500 feet (457 meters). As Runit was to also be the detonation site for Fig, the area had to be decontaminated after the Quince test. Around three to five inches of contaminated topsoil was removed from an area 75 feet by 25 feet upwind of ground zero. An area of 60 square feet at the blast site was scraped to remove the top three inches of soil as well. Even with these precautions, the measured alpha activity was around 20,000 counts per minute (CPM), and the area closest to <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> was roped off to prevent personnel from entering. Upon detonation, the mushroom cloud produced by the Fig device rose to approximately 6,000 feet (1.8 kilometers), with a base of roughly 4,300 feet (1.3 kilometers). 30 minutes post detonation, radiation measurements at the blast site reached over 10,000 R/hr.|$|E

50|$|The Department of Defense (DOD) {{sponsored}} {{a series of}} experiments for Koa: Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.9, 3.2, 3.6, 5.1, 5.3. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.9. and 6.11. Project 1.4, which sought to study land craters post detonation for several shots, took ground survey measurements from <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> out to 2,500 feet (762 meters). Detailed measurements could not be made until {{four days after the}} blast due to radiation levels. Using a boat, the majority of the crater was mapped, though some measurements could not be made until 1959 due to radioactivity levels around the Koa blast site. In Project 1.9, the blast-induced pressure through the soil was measured by burying 43 drums at depths ranging from 0 to 20 feet and around 3,000 feet from the Koa blast site. The early radioactive cloud samples, normally collected post-shot as a part of Project 2.8 using a UCRL rocket sampler, were not collected after the Koa test due to technical difficulties. Fallout at high and low altitudes utilizing B-57D and WB-50 aircraft were measured with no technical problems. Project 3.6, which was conducted only on Koa, tested the effects of the blast on reinforced-concrete slabs buried close to <b>surface</b> <b>zero.</b> One station was located at 1,830 feet (558 meters) from the blast site, and the other was located 3,100 feet (945 meters) away. Project 5.2 was designed to measure the radiation levels using film badges on different areas of the aircraft and on the pilot directly. Koa had the lowest average radiation measurements of the eight shots on this project, with aircraft 827 ranging from 0.01-0.02R and aircraft 831 reporting levels between 0.03-0.19R. Unlike in the Cactus test, all nine film badges from both aircraft were successfully recovered and reported.|$|E
50|$|Barge mounted test detonations was a {{technique}} first used in 1954, and also {{compensated for the}} lack of land at the HP. When testing returned to Bikini atoll the use of barges as the shot point had begun, with one notable advantage, no radioactive <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> areas ware developed. Two large underwater craters were formed in 1954 and these were used as subsequent surface zeros for detonations fired from barges. This allowed the available land area to be used for the placement of measurement instrumentation and reuse of the same burst point without the long delays required for radiological cooling by natural decay or expensive and long decontamination procedures. Reuse of zero points also allowed reuse of instrument locations and recording shelters for several tests saving construction costs and time and Increasing test-scheduling flexibility. In HARDTACK the 26 barge events used only five detonation areas.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the goals}} of this test was to study the {{physical}} characteristics of the crater and the surrounding area pre- and post-detonation associated with Project 1.4. A camera was mounted to a RB-50 aircraft and the resultant crater was mapped using photogrammetry. Measurements were taken from 500 feet (152 meters) down to ground zero for both pre- and post detonation. Survey measurements of the Cactus test could not be made until the resultant radiation amounts had lowered to safer levels. Along with photogrammetric radial measurements, Airblast measurements were also recorded near <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> for Cactus in accordance with Project 1.7. Similar to Project 1.8, Project 1.9 sought to determine transmission of blast pressure through the ground soil. Forty-three drums were buried at varying depths 600 feet (183 meters) from ground zero of the Cactus detonation. Individuals from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division - TRW Space Technologies Laboratory sought to the Shock Spectra Studies of Project 1.12. Measurement gauges were located between 625 and 965 feet (191 to 294 meters) from the blast site. Fallout measurements and samples were taken by aircraft {{in the aftermath of the}} detonation, as part of Project 2.8. These surveys were designed in part to determine the impact of specific radionuclides to overall nuclear fallout. Samples were taken early post-blast using a new rocket sampler, the UCRL, which were then followed by B-57D and WB-50 aircraft. Between four and twenty-four hours post-detonation, the WB-50 collected several samples at 1,000 feet (305 meters) in altitude. Project 3.2 involved structural tests of corrugated steel arches. One of these arches was placed 980 feet (299 meters) away from the Cactus blast site. Eight days after the test, a crew of 13 men were allowed near the <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> in order to extract the arch. The extraction took around twelve hours, and the radioactivity levels reached a maximum at 0.420 R/h during this time. Project 5.2 sought to determine the effects of the blast on two A4D-1 aircraft, both in thermal radiation and pressure. Nine film badges were placed throughout each aircraft in order to measure radiation. The Gamma dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 827 indicated a neutron exposure level of 0.105 rem. There is not information available for the dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 831. Radiation recorded by six of the nine film badges ranged from 0.49-1.74R. Information from the remaining three film badges, located at the Pilot’s right leg, left sleeve, and left vest is not available. The pilot’s exposures were both greater than 3R. Project 5.3 was very similar to 5.2, focusing on the effects of the blast on the structure of two test FJ-4 aircraft. Radiation from film badges on aircraft 467 ranged from 0.52-3.71 R, and 1.23-5.06 R for aircraft number 310. In Project 6.4, the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) investigated the electromagnetic pulses post-detonation, utilizing two instruments, one at Wotho (roughly 240 nautical miles from Enewetak) and one at Kusaie (around 440 nautical miles from Enewetak). Though Cactus is mentioned in Project 6.5, whose goal was to study the radar echoes from the fireball, it is not clear what destroyers were involved if any. Destroyers for the Teak, Fir and Yucca tests are explicitly stated. Project 6.6, the lasts of the projects that involved the Cactus test, sought to measure the physical properties of the stabilized radioactive cloud following the blast.|$|E

50|$|The test {{conditions}} were met on May 16 {{allowing for the}} nuclear device to be detonated. Within a second of detonation, a spray dome was created that reached a height of 840 feet after seven seconds. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled an inverted cone with 45 degree sloped sides. Plumes were seen breaking through the spray dome after six seconds in every direction. The vertical plume continued rising until 12 seconds after the blast while the lateral plumes traveled for 20 seconds before collapsing. The diameter of the spray dome was approximately 3,800 feet at the 20 second mark. The base surge reached a radius of 8,000 feet in the downwind direction after 1.7 seconds. The downwind surge aided by a 15 knot wind reached speeds of 21 knots (24.2 mph). This base surge could be seen {{for three and a}} half minutes and for longer from the air as it continued to move across the ocean. When the spray dome and base surge had dissipated, a foam patch could be seen spreading from the <b>surface</b> <b>zero</b> water to reach over 6,000 feet. The nuclear device had a blast that was calculated to be nine kilotons. All fallout stayed within the predicted fallout area with a maximum of 0.030 R/hr. The target ship at 5,900 yards was directly hit by the shockwave vibrating the entire ship and shaking it violently. The Moran, merchant marine ship moored at 2,346 feet away, was immobilized due to shock damage to its main and auxiliary equipment while also attaining minor hull damage. One hour and ten minutes after detonation, a five-gallon water sample was taken directly above the blast location showing a 5 R/hr.
