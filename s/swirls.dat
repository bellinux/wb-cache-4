The incorporation of a <b>swirl</b> burner with a stirling engine fulfilled its multi-fuel characteristic, since a hot producer gas from a gasification or combustion of any source of fuel can be utilized including biomass. The <b>swirl</b> burner with two heat input channels was designed based on the <b>swirl</b> number, S, which was calculated as 19. 6. The <b>swirl</b> burner was made of 4 mm of mild steel and internally covered with 10 mm of cement.

The flame temperature inside the <b>swirl</b> burner was found to exceed 1000 Â°C and produced the hot temperature up to 770 Â°C. The required hot temperature inside the stainless steel expansion-working cylinder of 550 and 650 Â°C was realized by the <b>swirling</b> effect of the flare inside the burner. Like a <b>swirl</b> combustor, the mathematical equation of the <b>swirl</b> number, S was found to be applicable to the <b>swirl</b> burner with the <b>swirling</b> effect only at the area of an annulus.

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained multiple cloud <b>swirls</b> within a common center. Banding features increased, though southwesterly wind shear {{and the lack}} of a well-defined circulation prevented initial strengthening. Dry air encountered the depression, and as such it developed very slowly; forecasters maintained considerable difficulty in determining a center of circulation. It continued its motion to the west-northwest while tracking around the southern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge to its north. Though convection remained focused near the outer periphery of the system, the overall organized continued to steadily increase, and it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Florence on September 5 while located about 1,120miles (1,800km) east-northeast of Anguilla.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and <b>swirls</b> into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 2008, {{computer}} hurricane models {{forecast the}} development of a broad low pressure area to the southwest of Central America. On May 26, a large trough extended from the southwestern Caribbean Sea across Costa Rica into the eastern Pacific Ocean, forming a broad low pressure area across the region. A scattered area of strong convection developed, partially in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Located within an area of weak steering currents, the disturbance remained nearly stationary, and on May 27 its shower activity increased in organization. Initially the system consisted of several cyclonic <b>swirls,</b> of which the most pronounced one was located about 340miles (550km) west-southwest of San José, Costa Rica. The system gradually became better organized, and with a sufficiently well-developed circulation and convective structure, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression One-E at 0300UTC on May 29, about 105miles (165km) west-northwest of Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud <b>swirls</b> within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water <b>swirls</b> up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
40|$|An {{existing}} {{cold jet}} facility at NASA-Lewis was modified to produce <b>swirling</b> flows with controllable initial tangential velocity distribution. Distinctly different <b>swirl</b> velocity profiles were produced, {{and their effects}} on jet mixing characteristics were measured downstream of an 11. 43 cm diameter convergent nozzle. It was experimentally shown that in the near field of a <b>swirling</b> turbulent jet, the mean velocity field strongly depends on the initial <b>swirl</b> profile. Two extreme tangential velocity distributions were produced. The two jets shared approximately the same initial mass flow rate of 5. 9 kg/s, mass averaged axial Mach number and <b>swirl</b> number. Mean centerline velocity decay characteristics of the solid body rotation jet flow exhibited classical decay features of a <b>swirling</b> jet with S = 0. 48 reported in the literature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to characterise the flow field through the inlet valves, and tumble to <b>swirl</b> {{conversion}} tube of a steady state flow rig using HWA.

The <b>swirl</b> precesses around the central core of the conversion tube at all degrees of <b>swirl.</b> Varying degrees of <b>swirl</b> produced differing axial velocity profiles, and flow reversal occurred in the central core of the conversion tube for the high <b>swirling</b> case.

5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} at 6:18p.m. CST (00:18UTC) near Castleberry High School {{northwest}} of downtown Fort Worth. Initially, the tornado lacked a condensation funnel, and {{could only be}} visually identified as dust <b>swirls</b> near the ground beneath the rotating wall cloud aloft; the tornado maintained this appearance {{for the first five}} minutes of its lifespan, after which a condensation funnel eventually developed. The first signs of damage occurred in the River Oaks area along Texas State Highway 183 where metal roof panels were stripped off of a vacant fast food restaurant. After crossing the highway, the tornado inflicted sporadic F0damage to an older residential area, breaking tree branches and causing some damage to outbuildings; a few chimneys were toppled off of homes. At the time, the tornado's damage path was only a few hundred feet wide. A roof of a home near Roberts Cut Off Road was partially removed, signifying the first instance of F1damage. Several large and rotted trees were uprooted by the tornado's strong winds as it moved through the area. The tornado then passed directly over Castleberry High School, causing significant damage to the school's field house. Tornadic debris—including rooftop air conditioning units, gravel, and other detached construction—was thrown by the tornado at the school's western façade, causing minor damage. Throughout River Oak, three homes sustained major damage while 51others experienced minor damage.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of <b>swirl</b> ratio on knock limits in spark ignition engines. Initially it was attempted to find a correlation between <b>swirl</b> ratio and Knock Limited Spark Advance (KLSA) for a selection of commercially available engines. A comparison of measured <b>swirl</b> ratios and KLSA indicated that no such correlation could be found. This was put down to the fact that other factors such as combustion chamber shape and spark plug location play a more dominant role in affecting knock limits than <b>swirl</b> level. Following from this, a single engine with a relatively poor <b>swirl</b> ratio was selected and the <b>swirl</b> level was altered. A novel method of increasing and decreasing the <b>swirl</b> level, with the same pressure drop in each case was developed, and this development is described. This method made it possible to perform dynamometer tests, measuring the KLSA timing for the cases of low and high <b>swirl,</b> while keeping all other parameters such as pressure, temperature, spark plug location and combustion chamber shape constant. All these factors are known to {{have an effect on the}} occurrence of knock. In this manner it was possible to determine whether <b>swirl</b> alone has any effect on knock limits. It was found that the high <b>swirl</b> case exhibited higher values of knock limited spark advance above the low <b>swirl</b> case although there was no significant change in torque. A comparison of rubber castings of the inlet ports of numerous engines was made, and is presented in a photographic form. This was done in order to assess how inlet port geometry affects <b>swirl</b> ratios. It was found that a helically shaped inlet port produced the greatest <b>swirl</b> ratio, non directed ports have average values and multiple inlet valve ports have very low <b>swirl</b> ratios. Furthermore, a comparison of <b>swirl</b> ratios of an inlet port with and without deposits, demonstrates that deposits have a significant effect on <b>swirl</b> ratios and volumetric efficiency. However, although the volumetric efficiency was reduced, the deposits enhanced the <b>swirl</b> ratios for this particular case. This is contrary to the general belief that deposits reduce <b>swirl...</b>|$|R

25|$|Note {{that the}} two fractal curves {{described}} above show a type of self-similarity that is exact with a repeating unit of detail that is readily visualized.

However, such neatly countable complexity is only {{one example of the}} self-similarity and detail that are present in fractals. The example of the coast line of Britain, for instance, exhibits self-similarity of an approximate pattern with approximate scaling. Overall, fractals show several types and degrees of self-similarity and detail that may not be easily visualized. These include, as examples, strange attractors for which the detail has been described as in essence, smooth portions piling up, the Julia set, which can be seen to be complex <b>swirls</b> upon <b>swirls,</b> and heart rates, which are patterns of rough spikes repeated and scaled in time.

30|$|For the low <b>swirl</b> case, it can {{be assumed}} that the {{geometry}} is only driven by the <b>swirl</b> sensitivities where the modifications have a very small detrimental effect on the pressure loss.
