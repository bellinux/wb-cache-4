5|$|The video follows Ciara as {{she goes}} clubbing. The clip begins with the singer waking up at midnight, in a black, {{reflective}} apartment, as she is dressed in black and proceeds to leave through the building's fire escape. When she arrives outside, {{the windows of the}} building brighten and fade, and the moon, stars, and lamp posts create a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect.</b> White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark staircase and enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. The lights of the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd. Unilux strobes are used to highlight the rain.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes strobe {{lighting}} {{can trigger}} seizures in photosensitive epilepsy. An infamous event {{took place in}} 1997 in Japan when an episode of the Pokémon anime, Dennō Senshi Porygon (commonly translated as Electric Soldier Porygon), featured a scene that depicted a huge explosion using flashing red and blue lights, causing about 685 of the viewing children {{to be sent to}} hospitals. These flashes were extremely bright strobe lights. They involved multiple colors with a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> at about 12 Hz. Although 95% of the 685 just complained of dizziness, some were hospitalized. Organizers later said {{that they did not know}} about the threshold of strobing.|$|E
500|$|Scott Meslow at Vulture.com {{scored the}} episode 4 stars out of 5, saying that [...] "like a good stock portfolio, {{the key to}} a good Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is diversification. The best thing about [...] isn’t any {{individual}} story. It’s how deftly the show juggles so many stories without losing track of any." [...] He felt the character of Maria was [...] "cartoonishly one note ... it’s heartbreaking to watch Yo-Yo stand quietly as her friends unknowingly denounce her", and compared the use of Yo-Yo's powers to [...] "a small-screen version of that great Quicksilver scene from ... it’s still pretty cool". Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B+', feeling the action-heavy episode was a strong follow up to the more dialogue-focused [...] "Meet the New Boss", and praising Martens direction and the episode's fight choreography. He particularly highlighted the fight sequence where an EMP creates a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect.</b> Evan Valentine at Collider.com rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 3 stars out of 5, calling it a solid episode and highlighting the chemistry between the series' cast and the episode's fight sequences and visual effects, which he felt were [...] "a nice and breezy combination of the show’s strengths".|$|E
50|$|The fixture has {{a single}} blade dimmer system, which allows for <b>strobe</b> <b>effects,</b> as well as zoom optics for a 12 to 57 degree beam angle.|$|R
50|$|The {{head was}} closely {{based on that}} of the VL5 Arc, with radial CMY colour mixing and {{mechanical}} shutter dimming fast enough to also provide <b>strobe</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
25|$|Mechanical dimming {{shutters}} used to {{vary the}} intensity of the light output. Mechanical dimmers are usually a specially designed disk or a mechanical shutter. Shutters with high speed stepper motors can be used to create <b>strobe</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As of 2012, most {{implementations}} of LCD backlighting use pulse-width modulation (PWM) to dim the display, {{which makes}} the screen flicker more acutely (this does not mean visibly) than a CRT monitor at 85Hz refresh rate would (this is because the entire screen is strobing on and off rather than a CRT's phosphor sustained dot which continually scans across the display, leaving {{some part of the}} display always lit), causing severe eye-strain for some people. [...] Unfortunately, many of these people don't know that their eye-strain is being caused by the invisible <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> of PWM. This problem is worse on many LED-backlit monitors, because the LEDs switch on and off faster than a CCFL lamp.|$|E
50|$|Viewing {{through a}} single line of holes/slots does not work, since the holes/slots appear to just sweep across the object without a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{effects are}} {{typically}} very minor and will most often subside within seconds once {{exposure to the}} <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> has ceased, though residual nausea and minor disorientation maybe be felt for several minutes.|$|E
50|$|The Wii {{controller}} {{allows the}} player to mimic real bowling by using typical bowling movements. The game environment offers mirrored balls, hot neon lights, and <b>strobe</b> <b>effects.</b> Several mini games are {{available such as}} Obstacles and Pool Bowl.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Modifications=== Originally, {{the ride}} {{featured}} faux-fire and projection effects {{during the final}} encounter with Imhotep, engulfing the ride vehicle in pressurized steam and specialized lighting. The ride now uses <b>strobe</b> <b>effects,</b> with a brief pause before the false wall rises on the loading platform.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle’s stock {{lighting}} {{may also}} be modified to add flashing and <b>strobe</b> <b>effects.</b> This {{can be done by}} adding electronics to the existing lighting system (for instance, to create a wig-wag), or by drilling holes in the reflectors of stock lighting and inserting flashing lights in those holes.|$|R
5000|$|IGN {{mentioned}} that the filtering that the Game Boy Player uses (to relieve <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> on games using a flicker trick to make sprites seem transparent) [...] "muddies" [...] some of the graphics.|$|E
50|$|Together, Grant and Conrad {{produced}} the feature-length film Coming Attractions (1970) with Warhol superstar Frances Francine, the purely abstract film Straight and Narrow (1970), and Four Square. Like Conrad's experimental film The Flicker (1965), Coming Attractions utilized a flicker-like <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> within the narrative.|$|E
5000|$|A young Italian woman {{living in}} France named Alex (Monica Bellucci) is reading An Experiment with Time by John William Dunne in a park, {{surrounded}} by playing children. Beethoven's 7th Symphony is {{heard in the}} background. The camera spins around faster and faster until it blacks out into a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect,</b> accompanied by a pulsing, roaring sound. A rapidly spinning image of a lawn sprinkler resembling the cosmos can be dimly perceived. A title card reads: [...] "Le Temps Detruit Tout" [...] ("Time destroys everything")a phrase uttered in the film's first scene. The film ends.|$|E
50|$|LEDs are {{light-emitting}} diodes which are semiconductor small bulbs {{which can be}} put together. LEDs generally last longer than neon tubes. LED strips are also considerably less fragile than neon tubes. LEDs are used and installed {{in the same manner}} as neon tubes. LED's have multi-color capabilities and can have <b>strobe</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Laundronauts’ {{signature}} look is white-on-white uniforms with white-rimmed sunglasses. Live {{shows are}} bathed in blinding white light, smoke, bubbles, <b>strobe</b> <b>effects,</b> and a pneumatic laundry cannon that fires socks, undergarments, {{and the occasional}} Laundronauts T-shirt into the audience. All the devices used are custom designed by Stephen J, and triggered onstage {{as part of the}} performance.|$|R

5000|$|The warning is {{accompanied}} by the ragtime tune [...] "Raggedy Ann" [...] played on an old gramophone. The film {{then goes on to}} a frame that says [...] "Tony Conrad Presents," [...] and then to a frame that says [...] "The Flicker," [...] at which point it starts. The screen goes white, then after a short while, the screen flickers with a single black frame. This is repeated, at varying rate, again and again until it creates a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect,</b> for which the film is titled. This continues until the film stops abruptly.|$|E
5000|$|Conrad {{continued}} planning The Flicker {{with paper}} diagrams for several months. He wanted {{to arrange the}} frames to create multiple frequencies while balancing {{the number of black}} and white frames. He consulted William S. Burroughs's 1964 article [...] "Points of Distinction Between Sedative and Consciousness-Expanding Drugs" [...] while arranging the patterns. In June 1965, Conrad tested various flicker speeds with his friend Lew Oliver. They found that the <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> was most powerful between 6 and 16 Hz. Oliver suggested using slightly longer durations for black frames, so Conrad used an extra black frame when constructing cycles of odd length.|$|E

50|$|The {{system was}} {{designed}} by Dean Goodhill in 1999. The system uses normal thirty-five millimetre motion picture film, capturing images on three perforations of film per frame. The format can run either at the standard twenty-four frames per second, or at forty-eight frames per second, which reduces <b>strobing</b> <b>effects</b> and increases apparent resolution when combined with a system for reducing film movement in the gate and eliminating scratching.|$|R
50|$|The anime {{concept was}} successful; however, there were {{concerns}} about the marketability of traditional 2D, and the difficulty in animating Ladybug's costume of red with black spots, as it caused some <b>strobing</b> <b>effects.</b> Executive producer Jared Wolfson said that Zag wanted the animation to be cinematic and epic, unique and different, {{and said that they}} are continuing to partner with Toei as it brings in the Asian inspiration and that a 2D version might be a potential product.|$|R
50|$|On December 13, 2011, {{after their}} last Los Angeles stop at Staples Center on their Watch the Throne Tour, Jay-Z {{announced}} that the live performance {{would be used for}} the song's music video. The video, which was produced by Good Company, was released on February 9, 2012 through VEVO and was directed by West himself. The video features the live concert footage treated with <b>strobe</b> <b>effects,</b> kaleidoscopic mirrored images, inserts of jungle cats, and imagery of Paris landmarks (prominently Notre Dame de Paris).|$|R

5000|$|Born {{and raised}} in New Jersey, Rowe {{attributed}} her interest and approach to science education to an early encounter with Albert Einstein. On her middle school's annual visit to Princeton, she encountered the physicist gesturing and moving his hands rapidly, looking at a fountain. He asked Rowe, then in seventh grade, if she could stop the water {{long enough to see}} the shapes of the droplets. He then showed her how to wave her fingers to create a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> and examine the shapes the water made. Rowe and Einstein experimented together for a few minutes to achieve the best effect. As Rowe would tell the story, as he left her he said [...] "Never forget that science is just that kind of exploring and fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|Terror of the Towers. The first {{incarnation}} of this long-running annual scare maze {{was introduced in}} 2002, and was located in the Towers ruins themselves. Many scenes from the original maze are still used. Visitors walked through the long, winding corridors of the Towers, through themed scenes while being pursued by live actors. The finale featured a winding pathway around actors behind fences, who lunged towards visitors, accompanied with heavy <b>strobe</b> <b>effects.</b> For 2003 it was restructured and given the tagline and theme [...] "Bloodfest Banquet".|$|R

25|$|Sonic Research and Planet Waves both {{released}} a true-strobe with {{a bank of}} LEDs arranged in a circle that gives a <b>strobing</b> <b>effect</b> based upon {{the frequency of the}} input note. Both LCD and LED display true strobes do not require mechanical servicing and are much cheaper than the mechanical types. As such, they are a popular option for musicians who want the accuracy of a strobe without the high cost and the maintenance requirements. However, LED strobe displays offer no information about the harmonic structure of a note, unlike LCD types, which do offer four bands of consolidated information.|$|R
50|$|Most {{aftermarket}} {{wheels are}} cast, while {{only a few}} above are forged, such as Donz, Vellano and Weld. Many companies have been formed over the years (some recently) due to the rising demand for larger diameter wheels. The demand for larger wheels were spurred on by the invention of Wheel Spinners. The original U.S. Patented #5,290,094 by American Tru-Spinners licensed several wheel manufacturers and manufactured their own series of spinner wheels that were one-piece integral spinner wheels and some adaptable spinner wheels to where {{the center of the}} wheel continues spinning after the vehicle comes to a stop. American Tru-Spinners also invented another series of wheel spinners that spun backwards while the wheel traveled forwards and some traveled in a stationary position focusing on the wheel manufacturer logo staying level while in motion utilizing specialized bearings. American Tru-Spinners also introduced the use of Holograms in the spinner wheels that gave a lighted <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> without the use of a battery or electric source.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the train}} to Paris, Cliff begins to write his novel, {{reflecting}} on his experiences: [...] "There was a cabaret, {{and there was a}} master of ceremonies ... and there was a city called Berlin, in a country called Germany ... and {{it was the end of}} the world." [...] ("Willkommen" [...] Reprise). In the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee welcomes us (in the 1998 revival, he strips off his overcoat to reveal a concentration camp prisoner's uniform marked with a yellow Star of David and a pink triangle), and the backdrop raises to reveal white space with the ensemble standing within. The cabaret ensemble reprises [...] "Willkommen", but it is now harsh and violent as the Emcee sings, [...] "...à bientôt..." [...] followed by a crescendo drum roll and a cymbal crash. Some productions have the white space then flashing with a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect,</b> implying the Cabaret performers, except for Sally (who is not standing in the white space), will fall victim to Nazi atrocities towards the Jews.|$|E
50|$|The 2012 {{revival of}} the show portrays a {{different}} version of events. The blood is dumped onto Carrie from above, as in the book. She slams the doors shut and turns off the lights, creating a blackout. The lights struggle back on in a <b>strobe</b> <b>effect</b> as Carrie forces everyone else to the ground. The students writhe in desperation as Carrie sets the gym on fire, and telekinetically forces Chris Hargensen to break her own neck. Several try to escape but are pinned to the walls. Carrie then leaves, blowing up the gym as she does so. Sue narrates how Carrie cuts a trail of destruction across town on her way home, as Sue herself follows her. At the White home, Carrie finds Margaret reciting prayers. She takes Carrie {{in her arms and}} sings softly to her before revealing the kitchen knife and stabbing her. Carrie uses her powers to force the knife out of Margaret's hands before stopping her heart. Sue enters, and cradles Carrie as she dies of her wounds.|$|E

25|$|Most {{strobe lights}} on sale {{to the public}} are factory-limited to about 10–12Hz (10–12 flashes per second) in their {{internal}} oscillators, although externally triggered strobe lights will often flash as frequently as possible. Studies {{have shown that the}} majority of people that are susceptible to the <b>strobing</b> <b>effects</b> can have symptoms at 15Hz-70Hz, albeit rare. Other studies have shown epileptic symptoms at the 15Hz rate with over 90 seconds of continuous staring at a strobe light. There have been no known seizures at or below the 8Hz (or 8 flashes per second) level. Many fire alarms in schools, hospitals, stadiums, etc. strobe at a 1Hz rate.|$|R
50|$|This {{made clear}} Suzuki's anarchic {{approach}} to cinema, which coincided nicely with other developments during the 1960s. 1965's Tattooed Life took Yakuza formulas to comic-book extremes, with a deliberate and unreal heightening of melodrama and wildly anti-realistic violence, played for humor or for style (using <b>strobe</b> <b>effects</b> and glass floors {{to break down}} perspective expectations during one notable scene). Beginning with this film, and continuing through Fighting Elegy and Tokyo Drifter (both from 1966) an accelerating move away from narrative, and towards greater spontaneity, enhanced with occasional Brechtian touches, became evident in Suzuki's work, though such elements were used in ways quite different from other filmmakers of the New Wave.|$|R
