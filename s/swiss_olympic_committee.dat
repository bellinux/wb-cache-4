500|$|The Comite Olympique (CO) was {{composed}} of local dignitaries {{and members of the}} <b>Swiss</b> National <b>Olympic</b> <b>Committee</b> (COS).

[...] These committees included housing and maintenance, venue construction, finances, and media and advertising. [...] The local committees worked very closely with the Swiss federal government and the IOC to ensure that the organization of the Games proceeded without hindrance. [...] Since no athletes' village existed from the previous Games, the athletes and officials were housed in hotels around the city. [...] It was very important for the committees to draw upon their experiences from the 1928 Olympics. [...] Their selection of locations for the various events was contingent on the weather conditions as all the events were held outdoors.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, a {{conflict}} broke out between two American ice hockey bodies, the American Hockey Association (AHA) and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). The AAU, which had run amateur hockey in the United States since 1930, was expelled by the IIHF in 1947 when it refused to support a team composed of players from the AHA. The AAU stated that the AHA players were [...] "openly paid salaries"; at the time, the Olympics were strictly for amateur players. The <b>Swiss</b> <b>Olympic</b> Organizing <b>Committee</b> (SOOC) had accepted the AHA's application, but Avery Brundage of the United States <b>Olympic</b> <b>Committee</b> (USOC) threatened to withdraw the entire American team if the AHA participated in the Olympics. The IIHF countered by threatening to withdraw hockey from the Games if the AHA were banned. The IOC suggested that both American teams be banned but the SOOC rejected this proposal. The IOC decided to switch hockey to an unofficial event but relented when a compromise was reached. The AHA team was allowed to compete but would not be considered an official participant or allowed to win a medal. The AHA team finished fourth in the standings. Both Czechoslovakia and Canada won seven games and tied when they played each other. The gold medal winner was determined by goal difference: Canada won the gold because it had an average of 13.8 goals per game compared to Czechoslovakia's average of 4.3. Czechoslovakia's team was quickly improving; it won the 1947 and 1949 World Championships.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the full}} {{table of the}} medal table of the 1948 Winter Olympics, which were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
