25|$|The {{operation}} of the Crown in the Canadian provinces {{is very similar to}} its function in the federal jurisdiction, wherein the role of the Queen is both legal and practical, and the Crown is regarded as a corporation, with the sovereign, vested as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> all powers of state, as the centre of a constitutional construct in which several parts—the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority—share the power of the whole. Unlike with the federal Crown, however, the monarch personally has little direct involvement with the provinces, the exercise of the Royal Prerogative delegated entirely to the lieutenant governors, who are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, though usually in consultation with the relevant provincial premier, and the monarch is informed of the prime minister's decision before the governor general gives the viceroyal sign-manual and affixes the Great Seal of Canada to the commission. The sovereign may still hold audience with the provincial premiers, however.|$|E

500|$|... "Born to Make You Happy" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who praised it {{for being an}} early classic and a proficient single, despite considering the song as entirely unremarkable like other ballads on the album. The song was commercially successful worldwide, peaking at number one in Ireland, and reaching top five positions in Belgium, Europe, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Sweden and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, it also peaked at number one, and is Spears' sixth best-selling single in the country.

500|$|The use of film, {{rather than}} digital, cameras {{added to the}} [...] "old-fashioned" [...] nature of the production. Two main Panavision cameras, a {{high-speed}} Arri 435 camera capable of shooting at 150 frames per second, a Steadicam, and VistaVision cameras for visual effect shots were among the equipment used to bring the book to the big screen. As {{with the use of}} specific colors, the different cameras and shooting setups would help serve the story points. When Bella was with Edward, the camera was moved on a dolly, in a very rigid, straight line to reflect how their relationship was [...] "perfect". When Bella is with Jacob, the Steadicam provided a fluid and organic style; and when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> her schoolmates, a slangy visual language was reflected by a handheld.|$|E
500|$|Film adaptations have {{approached}} Banquo's {{character in a}} variety of ways. Akira Kurosawa's 1957 adaptation Throne of Blood makes the character into Capitan Miki (played by Minoru Chiaki), slain by Macbeth's equivalent (Captain Washizu) when his wife explains that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> child. News of Miki's death does not reach Washizu until after he has seen the ghost in the banquet scene. In Roman Polanski's 1971 adaptation, Banquo is played by acclaimed stage actor Martin Shaw, in a style reminiscent of earlier stage performances. Polanski's version also emphasises Banquo's objection to Macbeth's ascendency by showing him remaining silent as the other thanes around him hail Macbeth as king. in the 1990 telling of Macbeth in a New York Mafia crime family setting, Men of Respect, the character of Banquo is named [...] "Bankie Como" [...] and played by American actor Dennis Farina.|$|E

500|$|In {{the main}} {{levels of the}} game the player uses the usual third-person view of the Silent Hill series. The player has a limited item {{inventory}} which can be managed by leaving unneeded items in a chest in Henry's room. Silent Hill 4 emphasizes combat during gameplay, with a near-absence of complex puzzles in favor of simple item-seeking tasks. Unlike previous games in the series, separate difficulty settings for combat and puzzles are not available, changing the combat difficulty also affects the difficulty of puzzles. In {{the second half of}} the game Henry is accompanied and helped in combat by his neighbor Eileen Galvin; Eileen cannot die while <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> Henry, although as she takes damage she succumbs to possession. The damage Eileen takes in the game determines whether or not she dies during the final boss fight, directly affecting the ending achieved.|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{treatments}} {{of the story}} of Troilus and, especially, Cressida in the period between Chaucer and Shakespeare, it is Robert Henryson's that receives the most attention from modern critics. His poem The Testament of Cresseid is described by the Middle English expert C. David Benson as the [...] "only fifteenth century poem written in Great Britain that begins to rival the moral and artistic complexity of Chaucer's Troilus". [...] In the Testament the title-character is abandoned by Diomedes and then afflicted with leprosy so that she becomes unrecognizable to Troilus. He pities the lepers <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> and is generous to her because she reminds him of the idol of her in his mind, but he remains the virtuous pagan knight and does not achieve the redemption that she does. Even so, following Henryson Troilus was seen as a representation of generosity.|$|E

[...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man."
