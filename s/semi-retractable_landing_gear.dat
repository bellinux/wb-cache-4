50|$|The first {{prototype}} flew in 1934 but {{flight tests}} revealed a lacklustre performance despite {{the use of}} a variable-pitch, three-blade propeller. Nonetheless, a limited production order was placed for a composite variant that combined the two-place configuration of the bomber (although a small number of single-seaters were built in the initial series) with the <b>semi-retractable</b> fighter <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The production variant was powered by a 485 kW (650 hp) Alfa Romeo 125C and although single-seat variants were built, all the Ba.64s were converted to two-place bomber/attack aircraft with a single 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine gun mounted in the rear cockpit. Production of the 42 Ba.64s was complete by 1936.|$|R
50|$|A {{development}} of the earlier Ba.27 fighter (1932), the Ba.64 was designed in 1933 to requirements set out by the Regia Aeronautica for an aircraft able to undertake multiple roles: fighter, bomber and reconnaissance. The aircraft featured an all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wire braced tail unit and fixed tail wheel. The open cockpit was placed well forward on the fuselage {{in line with the}} wing roots to provide an excellent field of vision down as well as forward. The headrest behind the cockpit was extended as a streamlined fairing {{all the way down the}} fuselage upper decking to the tail. Two prototypes powered by a 522 kW (700 hp) Bristol Pegasus were developed, the first as a two-seater bomber with an armament of four 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine guns in the wings and up to 400 kg (882 lb) of bombs in racks under the wings. The second was a single-seater fighter configuration fitted with a <b>semi-retractable</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> that when in its rearward retracted position, provided less drag as well as protection in case of a wheels-up landing.|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, {{the interaction of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometry. The prediction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise is performed using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with the high lift devices.

40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the passive control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model and semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of passive control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds. Using linear quadratic optimal control effect is good. Intorductio...|$|R
