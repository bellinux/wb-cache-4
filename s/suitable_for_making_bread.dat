5000|$|Only since 2000 has {{the wartime}} Irish economy been studied, {{away from the}} grander issues of {{diplomacy}} and warfare. Being still largely dependent on Britain for coal, manufactured goods and fuel oils, supplies of these were reduced {{after the fall of}} France in mid-1940, causing price inflation and a busy black market. It was said that [...] "the poor are like hunted rats looking for bread", as wheat supplies fell, and that the introduction of full rationing was [...] "seriously belated". Typhus reappeared and the government started planning for famine relief in late 1941. John Betjeman, the British press attaché in Dublin, reported [...] "No coal. No petrol. No gas. No electric. No paraffin. Guinness good." [...] In March 1942 the government banned the export of beers, and decided that more wheat should be grown, and less barley. The prospect of a shortage of beer led on to barter deals whereby Britain supplied wheat <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>making</b> <b>bread</b> flour, and coal, and in return Ireland allowed the export of beers. [...] "These supplies were to keep neutral Ireland afloat during World War II and enable the continuance of Irish neutrality".|$|E
40|$|A new sorghum variety {{with low}} levels of tannin has been {{developed}} by researchers of the Serere Agricultural and Animal Production Research Institute in Uganda. Tannin gives a bitter taste to common sorghums but this variety tastes almost sweet. It is good to use as a flour which when mixed with wheat flour is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>making</b> <b>bread.</b> Its sweet taste also makes it a good alternative cereal for animal feeds. The variety is drought resistant and matures in less than four months. If managed properly, harvests can reach 3, 000 kg per hectare. After the next growing season in 2002, the Uganda Seed Project should have enough seeds to distribute nationwide. In the meantime, the Serere Institute can provide limited amounts of seeds to farmers.

Baking quality is determined by rheological properties of wheat flour. The rheological property of wheat flour is essential because it determine other physical characteristics such as dough (baking) volume and sensory attributes.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify and design accurate and objective measures for the assessment of pigment type and concentrations in Australian Standard White wheats. This would facilitate the characterisation of individual flavonoid, phenolic and carotenoid compounds all of which can influence wheat flour colouration and therefore colour of products made from the flour. Flour colouration is influenced by the amount and type of pigments and phenolic compounds within the flour. Other factors that influence flour colour include; the protein content, the milling process, storage conditions and time, bleaching treatments, seasonal growth conditions, moisture content and foreign material. Flour colouration influences end product use. Flour high in flavonoid content may not be <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> white <b>bread</b> <b>making</b> but would be ideal for alkaline noodle production where yellow colouration influence the perception of the noodle quality...|$|R
40|$|Sixty seven {{varieties}} of wheat including mostly hexaploid and durum genotypes grown in Iran were tested <b>for</b> <b>bread</b> <b>making</b> quality attributes and their hectoliter weight, percentage of protein content, grain hardness index, flour water absorption, falling number and SDS-sedimentation volume were determined. High molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits composition of these varieties was also determined using SDS-PAGE. Clustering of the investigated varieties was performed using SDS sedimentation volume as a gluten strength index. Two clusters were obtained each included 2 / 3 sub clusters. First cluster included {{most of the}} varieties (43 entries) with SDS sedimentation volume of 42 - 54 ml. These varieties are considered as moderate quality entries which are <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> flat <b>bread</b> <b>making.</b> Second cluster which included 3 sub clusters included 24 varieties with SDS sedimentation volume of 55 - 70 ml, which could be considered as good quality genotypes and favorable <b>for</b> pan <b>bread</b> <b>making</b> or improvement of gluten strength in poor quality cultivars.

A particular HMW glutenin subunit allele in two cultivars originated from crossing of Iranian landraces was observed, which was determined as 2 / 1 + 10 *, a similar combination reported previously in Afghanistan wheat varieties...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Sorghum (Sorghum {{bicolour}} (L) Moench) and millets are drought resistant cereals (Kent and Evers, 1994) {{that can}} grow {{in areas with}} poor soils and inconsistent rainfall (Dendy, 1995) where other crops fail. They serve as staple food for many people in tropical sub- Saharan Africa and Asia (Klopfenstein and Hoseney, 1995). Traditionally, bread is made from wheat, which is a temperate cereal not able to grow well in these tropical regions. Leavened bread is seldom made from anything other than wheat (Alais and Linden, 1991) and {{this is because of}} the unique visco-elastic property of wheat flour (Hoseney, 1994). Unfortunately in tropical regions such as South Africa wheat is imported at a premium price. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce a wheat-finger millet composite flour which is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>bread</b> <b>making.</b> Finger millet grain (FMV 6) was milled with a laboratory hammer mill fitted with a 0. 8 mm screen. The following wheat-finger millet composite doughs were made using standard <b>bread</b> <b>making</b> methods, 0 : 100 (Control); 90 : 10; 80 : 20; 70 : 30, respectively. Selected quality attributes of the composite dough and the bread thereof were analysed using standard methods. The formulation with 10 % finger millet showed better results than other formulations. One formulation (80 : 20) was selected for improvement which included mixing ingredients at elevated temperatures (50 °C and 93 °C) and addition of 0. 002 % of a lipase enzyme, lipopan F; 0. 3 % vital wheat gluten and a combination of 0. 002 % lipopan F and 0. 3 % gluten. All formulations (including the basic formulation) contained Fungamyl Super MA (enzyme combination which contained fungal a-amylase and a xylanase). As the mixing temperatures were elevated, loaf volume decreased but when the industrial baking enzymes were introduced there was an improvement in peak time, dough stability and loaf volume. Image analysis showed that there was an improvement in crumb structure and bubble size distribution after the application of enzyme lipopan F. The crumb colour was lighter and softer when a combination of enzyme lipopan F and vital wheat gluten was applied. The bread made from formulation 80 : 20 with addition of a combination of enzyme lipopan F and vital wheat gluten (WFM 2 GL) was more acceptable than other formulations except the control bread. The bread had a high score in taste, crust appearance and mouth feel. The results suggest that there is a potential for producing a composite bread by substituting wheat flour with finger millet flour (up to 20 %); mixing at 25 °C with application of a combination of a lipase and vital wheat gluten. However, more work is needed to improve the quality of the bread to a greater extent...|$|R
