The purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of post-secondary accounting programs in preparing individuals for a public accounting <b>auditing</b> career. <b>Audit</b> <b>seniors</b> and <b>audit</b> managers were surveyed to utilize their experience in supervising first- and fifth-year auditors. The eight knowledge areas included in the study were auditing, business environment, business operations, decision techniques, ethics, financial accounting, managerial accounting, and tax. The eight skills included in the study were accounting and auditing evaluation, business, computer, ethical reasoning, interpersonal, learning, oral communication, and written communication. A questionnaire was developed to obtain the perceptions of respondents concerning the relative importance of the knowledge areas and skills, the relative importance of knowledge areas compared with skills, and the preparation level of first- and fifth-year auditors in each of the knowledge areas and skills. Questionnaires were distributed to 144 <b>audit</b> <b>seniors</b> and 137 <b>audit</b> managers employed by a big-six CPA firm. The <b>audit</b> <b>seniors</b> and <b>audit</b> managers were assigned to one of the ten offices selected for distribution to minimize possible regional biases. Useable responses were received from 89 <b>audit</b> <b>seniors</b> (61. 8 %) and 62 (45. 3 %) audit managers. A specific importance hierarchy for the knowledge areas and skills was not determinable; however, importance groupings were discernable. Three knowledge areas (auditing, managerial accounting, and ethics) and three skills (interpersonal, written communication, and ethical reasoning) were perceived to have the same relative importance for a successful first- and fifth-year of an auditing career. Overall, it was found that possession of the professional knowledge base and professional skill repertoire were equally important for a successful auditing career. Three knowledge areas were perceived to be adequately developed in both first- and fifth-year auditors, while five (six) skills were perceived to be adequately developed in first-year (fifth-year) auditors. The conclusions of the study were: (1) specific knowledge areas and skills are not equally important for a successful public accounting auditing career, (2) programs preparing individuals for an auditing career primarily need improvement in developing the business environment and business operations knowledge areas, and (3) auditors have a better developed skills repertoire than professional knowledge base...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{current study}} has been {{designed}} and implemented {{with the goal of}} examining organizational characteristics using a heuristic model that helps distinguish auditors in terms of the acceptance of dysfunctional behaviors. This conceptual model is consisted of parameters including locus of control, acceptance of dysfunctional behavior, mandatory rotation, organizational commitment and auditor performance. Data were collected using Smith's standardized questionnaire, which was validated through the use of the factor analysis as well as the viewpoints of experts. The research was a descriptive correlational study whose data were analyzed using the structural equation model. The statistical population included all <b>audit</b> executives (<b>senior</b> auditors, <b>audit</b> supervisors and <b>senior</b> <b>audit</b> supervisors) with the audit firms of the official auditors associations of Tehran and Shiraz (including private audit firms as well as the Audit Organization). The sampling method was the simple random sampling which covered 620 auditors. Some 250 questionnaires were distributed finally. The collected date were primarily calculated with the SPSS software and analyzed by the confirmatory factor analysis to verify proper parameters and omit poor parameters.

30|$|Auditing {{experience}} and professionalization positively influenced professional skepticism, which, {{in addition to}} an auditor’s knowledge and skillset, can improve professional judgment. Experienced baby boomers are rapidly nearing retirement age, and their accumulated wisdom and expertise could soon be inaccessible. Shrivastava and Purang (2011) indicated that feedback was effective {{in the presence of a}} strong link between performance improvement and valued outcomes. Brown and Duguid (2000) found that the loss of professional autonomy associated with structured audit approaches increased the turnover rate among <b>senior</b> <b>audit</b> staff members and, by extension, resulted in the loss of knowledge possessed by exiting personnel. Leaders should create an open culture that is conducive to mentoring, where people learn from one another through a wide variety of formal and informal relationships at an enterprise level. Thus, everyone can reap the benefits of mentoring. Specifically, mentoring others or sharing knowledge can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of audit procedures.|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to understand factors influencing Malaysian auditors' ethical behavior, i. e., code of ethical conduct, {{people at the}} office or those at homes. The relationship between demographic traits of respondents and their perceptions on peers' unethical behavior are studied as the integrity of auditors will affect investors' perception of financial statements. Three hundred and ninety six questionnaires were distributed to Certified Public Accountants whose membership information indicated auditing specialties. The findings revealed that those with a major responsibility (i. e., <b>Senior</b> <b>Audit</b> Assistants) behave more ethically than those with a lesser duty-bound answerability (i. e., audit assistants). The survey revealed that audit assistants are repeatedly engaged in unethical behavior compared to senior managers who rarely engaged in such behavior.
