This fuel hose {{was one of four}} fuel hoses that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of the hose assembly. When installed, this fuel hose would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the fuel injection pumps. Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the fuel injection pumps. The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more fuel injection pumps and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders.

40|$|The CREV System {{provides}} a radiologically controlled environment {{from which the}} unit can be safely operated following a Design Basis Accident (DBA). The control room emergency zone served by the CREV System consists of the main control room and the Train B Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment room. The <b>safety</b> <b>related</b> <b>function</b> of the CREV System consists of a single high efficiency air filtration train for emergency treatment of outside supply air. The filter train consists of an electric heater, a prefilter, a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, an activated charcoal adsorber section, a second HEPA filter, two 100 % capacity booster fans in parallel, the Train B air handling unit (excluding the refrigeration condensing unit), and the associated ductwork and dampers. The electric heater is used to limit the relative humidity of the air entering the filter train. Prefilters and HEPA filters remove particulate matter, which may be radioactive. The charcoal adsorbers provide a holdup period for gaseous iodine, allowing time for decay. The CREV System is a standby system, parts of which also operate during normal unit operations to maintain the control room emergency zone environment. Upon receipt of a reactor building ventilation system high-high radiation alarm (indicative of conditions {{that could result in}} radiation exposure to control room emergency zone personnel), operator action is required within 40 minutes to switch to the isolation/pressurization mode of operation and close the kitchen and locker room exhaust fan dampers to minimize infiltration of contaminated air into the control room emergency zone.

40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} {{are a common}} choice for many use cases, ranging from medical devices to automotive and airborne applications. Despite their widespread application, lithium ion batteries still remain an expensive, yet sensitive component within these systems. In {{order to maintain the}} operability of the battery system over its designated service life an appropriate battery management system (BMS) is required. The development of such a BMS is a challenging task, as various technological, environmental and application-specific aspects have to be considered. Especially safe and reliable operation of the battery system is an important and critical issue in this context. Besides these safety critical aspects, the BMS also includes extensive non <b>safety</b> <b>related</b> components and <b>functions.</b> Therefore, in order to fulfill safety-critical requirements, it is mandatory to keep the respective hardware and software components isolated. Redundancy, partitioning and the implementation of diagnostic functions at several software layers and different hardware partitions are the mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of the system. For performance and economical reasons, these techniques have to be tailored to the application. Based on a real-time operation system, a flexible and extensible strategy for a software framework with minimal code size, lean interfaces and few dependencies is introduced.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{successful}} implementations of intelligent systems (ISs) to perform nonsafety related operations increases, so the desire has grown to assess the possibility for use of ISs to support <b>safety</b> <b>related</b> <b>functions.</b> This interest has been recognised by the nuclear industry who wish to determine if ISs can be successfully and reliably used for performing condition monitoring of critical data. Therefore, {{in order to test}} the applicability of ISs in the nuclear domain, it is necessary to create a structured development methodology that explains why and how development decisions have been made. At the top level of this IS development methodology, it has consequently been necessary to develop a generic IS selection methodology which can be applied to any relevant problem. This paper has presented a methodology, to aid a decision maker in choosing an appropriate intelligent system as the solution to a given problem. This methodology provides a formal framework for justification of the decisions made and provides the facility for traceability and subsequent justification of these decisions. This is therefore useful for nuclear power software applications where it is desirable to make well-planned and justifiable decisions when the IS is to be used in safety-related application...|$|E
40|$|Context. The {{share and}} {{importance}} of software within automotive vehicles is growing steadily. Most functionalities in modern vehicles, especially <b>safety</b> <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> like advanced emergency braking, are controlled by software. A complex and common phenomenon in today’s automotive vehicles is the distribution of such software functions across several Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and consequently across several ECU system software modules. As a result, integration testing of these distributed software functions {{has been found to}} be a challenge. The automotive industry neither has infinite resources, nor has the time to carry out exhaustive testing of these functions. On the other hand, the traditional approach of implementing an ad-hoc selection of test scenarios based on the tester’s experience, can lead to test gaps and test redundancies. Hence, there is a pressing need within the automotive industry for a feasible and effective verification strategy for testing distributed software functions. Objectives. Firstly, to identify the current approach used to test the distributed automotive embedded software functions in literature and in a case company. Secondly, propose and validate a feasible and effective verification strategy for testing the distributed software functions that would help improve test coverage while reducing test redundan- cies and test gaps. Methods. To accomplish the objectives, a case study was conducted at Scania CV AB, Södertälje, Sweden. One of the data collection methods was through conducting interviews of different employees involved in the software testing activities. Based on the research objectives, an interview questionnaire with open-ended and close-ended questions has been used. Apart from interviews, data from relevant ar- tifacts in databases and archived documents has been used to achieve data triangulation. Moreover, to further strengthen the validity of the results obtained, adequate literature support has been presented throughout. Towards the end, a verification strategy has been proposed and validated using existing historical data at Scania. Conclusions. The proposed verification strategy to test distributed automotive embedded software functions has given promising results by providing means to identify test gaps and test redundancies. It helps establish an effective and feasible approach to capture function test coverage information that helps enhance the effectiveness of integration testing of the distributed software functions. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the design of an autonomous ferry to transport people between Ravnkloa and Fosenkaia in Trondheim. It will also be considered whether or not it will be a better solution than a bridge. The operational area of the ferry is limited to the 100 metres stretch between the two docks. The ferry should not require any personnel on board to operate, but it is assumed that a supervisor can oversee the operations from a land base. The surrounding elements of the system was outlined for easy adaptation, but not designed to full detail due to time limitations. The autonomous system itself was not considered directly as it is outside the team members area of expertise. The work in this thesis follows the System Based Ship Design (SBSD) methodology, combined with the Risk Based Ship Design (RBSD) method. In order to apply both methods simultaneously, they were slightly adapted to fit the design study. A bigger emphasis has been put on the functional analysis in the SBSD approach. This makes it easier to determine a good solution for the design. The design study initiates with the mission statement, and sets the main functional requirements for the design based on this. Both relevant generic- and safety related functional requirements were set according to the main functions. The <b>safety</b> <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> were determined by performing a formal safety assessment. To reveal all possible solutions to the functional requirements, a brainstorming session was performed. The alternatives were continuously evaluated against relevant framework conditions and the least relevant ones excluded, thus limiting the final solution throughout the design process. The required area and volume on board, determined using model- and life size test, determined the initial main dimensions. The final design was evaluated on technical performance, economy and safety performance. Stability- strength- and resistance calculations were used to verify the design, in addition to determining the life cycle costs (LCC). The result of this study is the design of an autonomous ferry with electrical power supply and a ramp used for mooring and entrance. The ferry is 9 m long with a beam of 4 m. The design draught of the vessel is 0. 515 m. The ferry can transport up to 12 passengers, including three wheelchairs, and 30 kg luggage per person. There is also room for twelve bicycles on board. The building material is aluminium. The ferry superstructure is semi - open with two broad pillars supporting the roof. The ferry will dock at piers separated from other docks in the area. An information poster is located at the dock to inform passengers on relevant safety issues. The registration gates lock of the docking area to the people on the dock. Entry to the dock is done using a gangway. The design ensures that the passenger comfort is sufficiently good. The ferry is able to transport all types of pedestrians, and is thus able to substitute a bridge. The weakness of the ferry option is that passengers may need to wait a few minutes to use the ferry. The ferry's life cycle costs were estimated at approximately NOK 2. 4 million over 15 years. This is significantly lower than the price tag for the bridge, estimated at NOK 42 million. Thus, the the ferry is considered a good alternative. All functional requirements set to the design are considered fulfilled to a reasonable degree. The methods applied for the design have weaknesses. Flaws in the RBSD methodology include a lack of accurate statistical information, the fact that the method is based on analysis of existing vessels, and that it is dependent on predetermined risk acceptance criteria. Flaws in the SBSD methodology include non existing statistical information on small and/or autonomous vessels. Required space for all systems was therefore set using existing equipment. Another flaw is that functional requirements may not cover all actual requirements for the vessel. For instance, bollards and ropes are required on board in case towing is necessary, but is not covered by any functional requirements. The iterative nature of the design process indicate several relevant tasks for the further project work. It will be relevant to consider all aspects set by regulations. New aspects for consideration include design of land based dock systems and determination of access restrictions, required safety level, disclaimer of liability and technical requirements for autonomous vessels. Several aspects on board the vessel are also relevant. This includes heating cables in the ferry roof and main deck, verification of plate thickness, hull adaptation for welding and design of bicycle racks. The operational plan for the battery systems should be determined for the ferry operation to run as smoothly as possible. Finally, the damage stability for the vessel should be verified...|$|E

40|$|The PWR Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) is {{designed}} to provide both <b>safety</b> and non-safety <b>related</b> <b>functions.</b> During normal plant operation it is used to control reactor coolant chemistry, and letdown and charging flow. In many plants, the charging pumps also provide high pressure injection, emergency boration, and RCP seal injection in emergency situations. This study examines the design, materials, maintenance, operation and actual degradation experiences of the system and main sub-components to assess the potential for age degradation. A detailed review of the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System (NPRDS) and Licensee Event Report (LER) databases for the 1988 [...] 1991 time period, together with a review of industry and NRC experience and research, indicate that age-related degradations and failures have occurred.
