5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France.

The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs.

In 1911, Pflueger joined the San Francisco Architectural Club (SFAC), an organization that helped budding architects receive training in the informal Atelier Method where older experts taught the practical side of architecture including waterproofing, lighting and structural concerns to students who had no hope or wish to study Beaux-Arts in an established school abroad. Pflueger became thoroughly involved with SFAC's collegial activities and was chosen director in 1914.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an {{increasing}} number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch had over the Church of England. This {{led to the formation of}} independent churches and <b>schools</b> <b>by</b> what are known as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance, but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670.|$|E
