40|$|Background: Colorectal {{cancer is}} the third most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer and the second leading {{cause of cancer death}} in Arizona. Given that by the year 2030 Arizona {{is expected to be the}} second most populated state in the U. S., it is imperative to evaluate whether this state has the colorectal screening capacity to accommodate the growing population. Methods: 338 members of the American College of Gastroenterology were invited to participate. Information for the total number of colonoscopies and <b>sigmoidoscopies</b> performed during an average week was ascertained by analyzing 105 surveys. We estimated the current and potential volume of screening procedures. Results: Physicians reported performing 8, 717 endoscopic procedures weekly (7, 990 colonoscopies and 727 <b>sigmoidoscopies).</b> They reported being able to increase their capacity by an additional 3, 183 (36. 5 %) procedures a week (2, 347 colonoscopies and 836 flexible <b>sigmoidoscopies).</b> Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Arizona has the ability to significantly expand its endoscopic capacity...|$|R
50|$|According to the {{guidelines}} {{established by the}} American Cancer Society, individuals who reach the age of 50 should perform an occult blood test yearly. Colon polyps as they grow can sometimes cause bleeding within the intestine, which can be detected {{with the help of}} this test. Also, persons in their 50s are recommended to have flexible <b>sigmoidoscopies</b> performed once in 3 to 5 years to detect any abnormal growth which could be an adenomatous polyp. If adenomatous polyps are detected during this procedure, it is most likely that the patient will have to undergo a colonoscopy. Medical societies recommend colonoscopies every ten years starting at age 50 as a necessary screening practice for colon cancer. The screening provides an accurate image of the intestine and also allows the removal of the polyp, if found. Once an adenomatous polyp is identified during colonoscopy, there are several methods of removal including using a snare or a heating device. Colonoscopies are preferred over <b>sigmoidoscopies</b> because they allow the examination of the entire colon; a very important aspect, considering {{that more than half of}} the colonic polyps occur in the upper colon, which is not reached during <b>sigmoidoscopies.</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: There {{have been}} several studies to date {{establishing}} the efficacy of nurse endoscopists in colorectal screening. However, no such study has ever been conducted in Hawaii. Utilizing the large sample size of our study, we hope to further support endoscopy by nurses as both a safe and cost-effective means of screening for colon cancer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study {{of the results of}} more than 5, 000 flexible <b>sigmoidoscopies</b> done by nurse endoscopists in the colorectal screening clinic at Kaiser Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii, between November 1995 and February 2001. These results were separated into normal, non-neoplastic polyps, adenomas, and cancer. RESULTS: The rate of detection of polyps was 13. 3 % (non-neoplastic and adenomas). Colon cancer was detected in 15 patients (. 3 % detection rate), of which 8 were carcinoma in situ, 3 were Dukes A, 2 were Dukes B 1 /B 2, and 2 were Dukes C 2. Clinically significant lesions (i. e. carcinoma, large adenomas, or atypical adenomas) were found in 1. 8 % of all patients. There were 8 carcinoids, 1 lipoma, 2 condylomas, and 3 leiomyomas detected. For patients who underwent colonoscopy, no other significant lesions were found in the areas examined by nurse endoscopists. There were no complications, i. e. perforation, bleeding, infection, and death, in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: The results of our study emphasize the importance of being screened for colorectal cancer. Nurse endoscopists can safely and effectively perform screening flexible <b>sigmoidoscopies.</b> By training more nurse endoscopists, we can increase the rate of colorectal screening in a cost-effective manner...|$|R

40|$|Microscopic colitis (MC) is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} colon distinct from Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis that can cause chronic diarrhea as well as cramping and bloating. Although it was first described 30 years ago, awareness of this entity {{as a cause of}} diarrhea has only become more widespread recently. Up to 20 % of adults with chronic diarrhea who have an endoscopically normal colonoscopy may have MC. Endoscopic and radiological examinations are usually normal, but histology reveals increased lymphocytes in the colonic mucosa, which typically cause watery nonbloody diarrhea. Treatment is initially supportive but can include corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy for resistant cases. Since surgeons perform a large number of colonoscopies and <b>sigmoidoscopies</b> to assess diarrhea, {{it is important to be}} aware of this disease and to look for it with mucosal biopsy in appropriate patients...|$|R
25|$|Endoscopic evaluation, via {{colonoscopy}} or flexible <b>sigmoidoscopy,</b> is {{the procedure}} of choice if the diagnosis remains unclear. Ischemic colitis has a distinctive endoscopic appearance; endoscopy can also facilitate alternate diagnoses such as infection or inflammatory bowel disease.

25|$|Colonoscopy {{is similar}} to sigmoidoscopy—the {{difference}} being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. A colonoscopy allows {{an examination of the}} entire colon (1200–1500mm in length). A <b>sigmoidoscopy</b> allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the defect in the APC gene, and whether it is the full or {{attenuated}} form, familial polyposis may manifest as polyps in colon or in the duodenal tract, or in any combination of these. Therefore, an absence of polyps in, for example, the rectum, may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps. It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract. Colonoscopy is preferred over <b>sigmoidoscopy</b> for this, as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE Multiple cancer {{screening}} tests have been advocated {{for the general}} population; however, clinicians and patients are not always well-informed of screening burdens. We sought to determine the cumulative risk of a false-positive screening result and the resulting risk of a diagnostic procedure for an individual participating in a multimodal {{cancer screening}} program. METHODS Data were analyzed from the intervention arm of the ongoing Pros-tate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, a randomized controlled trial {{to determine the effects}} of prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening on disease-specifi c mortality. The 68, 436 participants, aged 55 to 74 years, were randomized to screening or usual care. Women received serial serum tests to detect cancer antigen 125 (CA- 125), transvaginal sonograms, pos-teroanterior-view chest radiographs, and fl exible <b>sigmoidoscopies.</b> Men received serial chest radiographs, fl exible <b>sigmoidoscopies,</b> digital rectal examinations, and serum prostate-specifi c antigen tests. Fourteen screening examinations for each sex were possible during the 3 -year screening period. RESULTS After 14 tests, the cumulative risk of having at least 1 false-positive screening test is 60. 4 % (95 % CI, 59. 8 %- 61. 0 %) for men, and 48. 8 % (95 % CI, 48. 1 %- 49. 4 %) for women. The cumulative risk after 14 tests of undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure prompted by a false-positive test is 28. 5 % (CI, 27. 8 %- 29. 3 %) for men and 22. 1 % (95 % CI, 21. 4 %- 22. 7 %) for women. CONCLUSIONS For an individual in a multimodal cancer screening trial, the risk of a false-positive fi nding is about 50 % or greater by the 14 th test.

25|$|Bowel {{cancer may be}} {{diagnosed}} by obtaining {{a sample of the}} colon during a <b>sigmoidoscopy</b> or colonoscopy.
