50|$|On 2 October 2007, the United Kingdom and Singapore {{signed an}} {{agreement}} that allowed unlimited <b>seventh</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> from 30 March 2008, along with a full exchange of other freedoms of the air.|$|R
50|$|The {{unofficial}} <b>seventh</b> <b>freedom</b> is {{a variation}} of the fifth freedom. It is the right to carry passengers or cargo between two foreign countries without any continuing service to one's own country.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> {{the nature of the}} rights to human dignity, to life, and not to be discriminated against, or the right to a fair trial, does not permit them to be waived: “Unlike the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> these rights cannot be exercised negatively.” The <b>right</b> to <b>freedom</b> of expression, for example, can be exercised by keeping quiet, but the right to dignity cannot be exercised by being abused. One cannot therefore assume that the right is exercised when it is waived (as one can, subject to the above considerations, with the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights).</b>|$|R
50|$|Beyond rights {{allow the}} {{carriage}} of traffic between (and sometimes within) {{countries that are}} foreign to the airlines that operate them. Today, the most controversial of these are fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Less controversial but still restricted at times, though relatively more common are sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{demonstrates}} that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress – a syndrome whose common focus {{has not been}} properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as ‘human development’, arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people’s subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys {{demonstrates that}} the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> effective...|$|R
