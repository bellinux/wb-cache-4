5|$|Water {{supply and}} <b>sanitation</b> in Zimbabwe {{is defined by}} many small scale {{successful}} programs but also by {{a general lack of}} improved water and <b>sanitation</b> systems for the majority of Zimbabwe. According to the World Health Organization in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had access to improved, i.e. clean, drinking-water sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had access to improved <b>sanitation</b> facilities. Access to improved water supply and <b>sanitation</b> is distinctly less in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for water supply and <b>sanitation</b> (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. A certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and <b>sanitation.</b> They mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply and <b>sanitation</b> for other purposes.|$|E
5|$|Between 1990 and 2001, {{the average}} tariff {{for water and}} <b>sanitation</b> in Colombia {{increased}} from US$0.32/m3 to US$0.81/m3, equivalent to an increase of 153%. In 2006, the average monthly bill for residential customers was about US$6.80 for water supply and US$4.60 for <b>sanitation</b> services.|$|E
5|$|These {{problems}} were diminished but not eliminated under the mayoral administration of Marc Ravalomanana, who prioritized <b>sanitation,</b> security and public administration. He obtained funds from international donors to establish garbage collection and disposal systems, restore dilapidated infrastructure such as roads and marketplaces, and replanted public gardens. To improve <b>sanitation</b> in the city, he constructed public latrines in densely populated and highly frequented areas.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} <b>sanitation</b> in Colombia has been {{improved}} {{in many ways}} over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to improved <b>sanitation</b> increased from 67% to 82%, but access to improved water source's increased only slightly from 89% to 94%. In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and <b>sanitation</b> services remains inadequate. For example, only 73% of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality and in 2006 only 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent any kind of treatment.|$|E
5|$|A public {{commitment}} from Ministers setting a timetable {{to provide access}} to <b>sanitation</b> for all inmates at the earliest practical date, not later than February 1996.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{improved}} <b>sanitation</b> is also universal, either through sewers or on-site <b>sanitation.</b> All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, {{well below the}} national effluent standard of 20mg/l.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the {{university}} won the 2011 Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher & Further Education, for its {{research into the}} fields of safe water and <b>sanitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Regulation is the {{responsibility}} of two separate institutions at the national level, the Potable Water and Basic <b>Sanitation</b> Regulation Commission (CRA) and the Superintendency of Residential Public Services (SSPD), a multi-sector regulatory agency.|$|E
5|$|Since 1994 Colombia has pioneered many {{innovative}} {{approaches for}} basic service provision {{in general and}} for water supply and <b>sanitation</b> in particular.|$|E
5|$|Some of Colombia's larger {{cities are}} home to well-performing public utilities, some of them {{providing}} multiple services, others being specialized in water and <b>sanitation</b> only. The Empresas Públicas de Medellín or Public Companies of Medellín, is a municipally owned multi-sector utility in charge of water supply, <b>sanitation,</b> solid waste management, electricity generation and distribution {{as well as local}} telecommunications in Medellín and its surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|Under the National Urban <b>Sanitation</b> Policy, Tiruchirappalli {{was ranked}} sixth in India and first in Tamil Nadu {{on the basis}} of <b>sanitation</b> for the year 2009–10. In January 2010, Tiruchirappalli became the first city in India where open {{defecation}} was prevented in all its slums. In a 2016 survey conducted by the Ministry of Urban Development, {{as a part of the}} Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign, Tiruchirappalli was ranked third in the list of cleanest cities in India.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} <b>sanitation</b> in Turkey is characterised by {{achievements}} and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate <b>sanitation</b> has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate <b>sanitation</b> in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
5|$|Banagher lies in {{the local}} council area of Offaly County Council. Local {{authorities}} have responsibility for such matters as planning, local roads, <b>sanitation,</b> and libraries. The Council is an elected body of 21 members with councillors elected from four electoral areas in the county. Banagher {{lies in the}} Birr electoral area, which can return 5 members to the council.|$|E
5|$|Banshbaria Union {{has been}} {{declared}} as 100% sanitized, as all households in the union adopted sanitary latrines, while the upazila has only 16% <b>sanitation</b> coverage. A survey published in 2006 by the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project found that of the 18,843 tube wells surveyed, 24.7% {{were found to be}} contaminated. Visible signs of arsenic poisoning were found in 47 people.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, the District's {{population}} had grown 75% {{from the previous}} census to nearly 132,000 residents. Despite the city's growth, Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic <b>sanitation.</b> Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider such a proposal.|$|E
5|$|Continuity of supply. The average {{duration}} of daily water service {{has increased from}} 15.36hours in 1993 to 19.82hours in 2003 at the national level. In the four biggest cities of the country, service is continuous. Nevertheless, rationing of water and interrupted <b>sanitation</b> are ordinary incidents in small towns and rural areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to issues of}} service coverage, Colombia’s water and <b>sanitation</b> sector faces issues of service quality. However, service quality has improved considerably over the last fifteen years. The biggest cities tend to offer better service quality than smaller towns and rural areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{some smaller}} towns and peri-urban areas, there are {{examples}} of successful provision of water supply and <b>sanitation</b> services by community organizations and regional companies, which in some cases set an example in terms of community empowerment, transparency and accountability.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, a huge {{building}} project centred around Coronation Square (named for the 1953 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II) {{with hundreds of}} council houses built to satisfy post-war demand. The residents {{of many of these}} had moved from houses in central and east Reading that fell short of <b>sanitation</b> requirements of the Public Health Act 1875, were compulsorily purchased and later demolished.|$|E
5|$|James Farmer Jr., {{and other}} {{civil rights leaders}} also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more {{forceful}} response. The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the <b>sanitation</b> workers.|$|E

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in Jordan {{is around}} 74.6 years. The {{leading cause of}} death is cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancer. Childhood immunization rates have increased steadily over the past 15 years; by 2002 immunisations and vaccines reached more than 95% of children under five. Water and <b>sanitation,</b> available to only 10% of the population in 1950, now reach 98% of Jordanians.|$|E
5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and <b>sanitation</b> were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and <b>sanitation</b> facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Recently, the {{government}} of Álvaro Uribe has initiated a number of complementary policies to accelerate increases in access to water and <b>sanitation</b> services, such as the strengthening of the roles of departments in the governance of the sector, a program for marginal urban neighborhoods {{and an increase in}} investments for wastewater treatment.|$|E
5|$|Right {{to health}} is {{inclusive}} right extending {{not only to}} timely and appropriate health care {{but also to the}} underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate <b>sanitation,</b> an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Service {{provision}} {{is the responsibility}} of 1,500 water and <b>sanitation</b> service providers in urban areas and probably more than 12,000 communal organizations providing services in rural and peri-urban areas. While most urban service providers are public, in 2004 there were 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies in the country.|$|E
5|$|Since New York City's {{consolidation}} in 1898, Manhattan {{has been}} {{governed by the}} New York City Charter, which has provided for a strong mayor–council system since its revision in 1989.

5|$|The Water and <b>Sanitation</b> Agency (WASA), is a {{subsidiary}} of Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), established 23 April 1978 under the Development of Cities Act 1976. 2015 estimates indicate that WASA provides about 72% of the city's sewerage services and about 60% of their water services. The existing production capacity of WASA is , almost {{all of which is}} drawn from wells located in the old beds of the Chenab River. From the wells, water is pumped to a terminal reservoir located on Sargodha Road. Water is normally supplied for a total of about 8 hours per day to the majority of the city. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided financial and hardware equipment to help improve the water and <b>sanitation</b> conditions in the city.|$|E
