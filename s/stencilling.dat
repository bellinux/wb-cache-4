The thought of what her own best bedroom would be like delighted her fancy. It was a lovely room, for Béla's house was larger by far than his sister's, the rooms were wider and more lofty, and the windows had large, clear panes of glass in them. She would have two beautiful bedsteads in the room, and the bedspreads would be piled up to the ceiling with down pillows and duvets covered in scarlet twill; she would have two beautiful spreads of crochet-work, a washstand with marble top, and white crockery, and there would be a <b>stencilling</b> of rose garlands on the colour-washed walls.|$|E

Ann Veronica watched her face, vaguely sympathizing with her, vaguely disliking her physical insufficiency and her convulsive movements, and the fine eyebrows were knit with a faint perplexity. Essentially the talk was a mixture of fragments of sentences heard, of passages read, or arguments indicated rather than stated, and all of it was served in a sauce of strange enthusiasm, thin yet intense. Ann Veronica had had some training at the Tredgold College in disentangling threads from confused statements, and she had a curious persuasion that in all this fluent muddle there was something--something real, something that signified. But {{it was very hard to}} follow. She did not understand the note of hostility to men that ran through it all, the bitter vindictiveness that lit Miss Miniver's cheeks and eyes, the sense of some at last insupportable wrong slowly accumulated.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the developments of nanostencils for improved micro and nano patterning using <b>stencil</b> lithography (SL).

The useful life time of the <b>stencil</b> is significantly extended at least one order of magnitude and improved patterning resolution is achieved.

40|$|Purpose – Wafer-level <b>stencil</b> {{printing}} of a type- 6 Pb-free SAC solder paste was statistically evaluated at 200 and 150 [*]μm pitch using three different <b>stencil</b> manufacturing technologies: laser cutting, DC electroforming and micro-engineered electroforming. This investigation looks at <b>stencil</b> differences in printability, pitch resolution, maximum achievable bump height, print co-planarity, paste release efficiency, and cleaning frequency. The paper aims {{to discuss these}} issues. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the authors present a statistical evaluation {{of the impact of}} <b>stencil</b> technology on type- 6 tin-silver-copper paste printing. The authors concentrate on performances at 200 and 150 [*]μm pitch of full array patterns. Key evaluated criteria include achievable reflowed bump heights, deposit co-planarity, paste release efficiency, and frequency of <b>stencil</b> cleaning. Box plots were used to graphically view print performance over a range of aperture sizes for the three <b>stencil</b> types. Findings – Fabrication technologies significantly affect print performance where the micro-engineered electroformed <b>stencil</b> produced the highest bump deposits and the lowest bump height deviation. Second in performance was the conventional electroformed, followed by the laser-cut <b>stencil.</b> Comparisons between the first and fifth consecutive print demonstrated no need for <b>stencil</b> cleaning in the case for the micro-engineered <b>stencil</b> for all but the smallest spacings between apertures. High paste transfer efficiencies, i. e. above 85 per cent, were achieved with the micro-engineered <b>stencil</b> using low aperture area ratios of 0. 5. Originality/value – <b>Stencil</b> technology influences the maximum reflowed solder bump heights achievable, and bump co-planarity. To date, no statistical analysis comparing the impact of <b>stencil</b> technology for wafer-level bumping has been carried out for pitches of 200 [*]μm and below. This paper gives new insight into how <b>stencil</b> technology impacts the print performance for fine pitch <b>stencil</b> printing. The volume of data collected for this investigation enabled detailed insight into the limitations of the printing process and as a result for suitable design guidelines to be developed. The finding also shows that the accepted industry guidelines on <b>stencil</b> design developed by the surface mount industry can be broken if the correct <b>stencil</b> technology is selected, thereby increasing the potential application areas of <b>stencil</b> printing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} "stencil width" on surface ocean geostrophic velocity and vorticity estimated from differentiating gridded satellite altimeter sea surface height products. In oceanographic applications, {{the value of the}} first derivative at a central grid point is generally obtained by differencing the sea surface heights at adjacent grid points. This is called a "three-point <b>stencil</b> centered difference". Here the <b>stencil</b> width is increased from three to five, seven, and nine points, using well-known formulae from the numerical analysis literature. The discrepancies between velocities computed with successive <b>stencils</b> decreases with increasing <b>stencil</b> width, suggesting that wide <b>stencil</b> results are more reliable. Significant speed-dependent biases (up to 10 - 20 %) are found between results computed from three-point <b>stencils</b> versus those computed from wider <b>stencils.</b> The geostrophic velocity, and the variance of geostrophic velocity, are underestimated with thin <b>stencils.</b> Similar results are seen in geostrophic velocities computed from high-resolution model output. In contrast to the case when three-point <b>stencils</b> are used, wider <b>stencils</b> yield estimates of the anisotropy of velocity variance that are insensitive to the differences in grid spacing between two widely used altimeter products. Three-point <b>stencils</b> yield incorrect anisotropies on the 1 / 4 ° anisotropic AVISO grid; we recommend the use of 7 -point <b>stencils.</b> Despite the demonstrated inadequacies of the three-point <b>stencils,</b> the conclusions of earlier studies based on them, that the zonally averaged midlatitude eddy kinetic energy field is nearly isotropic, are found to pertain also with wider <b>stencils.</b> Finally, the paper also {{examines the}} strengths and limitations of applying noise-suppressing differentiators, versus classic centered differences, to altimeter data...|$|R
