5|$|The {{problems}} associated with Phipps' lack of professional training as an historian become clear by the third volume. Despite his reading of newly published works, Phipps' idea of what constituted new material included the publications of memoirs and journals of the participants, not the extensive <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> and array of historiographical material in the periodic literature written by professional historians seeking to understand the French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Consequently, Phipps' perceptions of the French revolution remained rooted in the outdated theories of Archibald Alison, Adolphe Thiers, and others, while ignoring {{some of the new}} theories of Albert Sorel, François Victor Alphonse Aulard and Albert Mathiez. His military background emerged clearly in his hostility to the meddling of the French government in the affairs of soldiers.|$|E

25|$|A {{dissection}} {{is called}} simplicial if the triangles meet only along common edges. Some authors restrict {{their attention to}} simplicial dissections, especially in the <b>secondary</b> <b>literature,</b> since they are easier to work with. For example, the usual statement of Sperner's lemma applies only to simplicial dissections. Often simplicial dissections are called triangulations, although the vertices of the triangles are not restricted to the vertices or edges of the polygon. Simplicial equidissections are therefore also called equal-area triangulations.|$|E
25|$|Ajita Kesakambali is {{credited}} as {{the forerunner of}} the Charvakas, while Brihaspati is usually {{referred to as the}} founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy.

25|$|Rama is {{especially}} important to Vaishnavism. He is the central figure of the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, a text historically popular in the South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. His ancient legends have attracted bhasya (commentaries) and extensive <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> and inspired performance arts. Two such texts, for example, are the Adhyatma Ramayana – a spiritual and theological treatise considered foundational by Ramanandi monasteries, and the Ramcharitmanas – a popular treatise that inspires thousands of Ramlila festival performances during autumn every year in India.|$|E
25|$|The {{tenets of}} the Charvaka atheistic doctrines {{can be traced to}} the {{relatively}} later composed layers of the Rigveda, while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature.

Its theories and development has been compiled from historic <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> such as those found in the shastras (such as the Arthashastra), sutras and the epics (the Mahabharata and Ramayana) of Hinduism as well as from the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and Jain literature.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Sassanid period royal {{inscriptions}} often consisted of Parthian, Middle Persian and Greek. However, {{the last time}} Parthian was used for a royal inscription came {{during the reign of}} Narseh, son of Shapur I. It is likely therefore that soon after this, the Sassanids made the decision to impose Persian as the sole official language within Iran, and forbade the use of written Parthian. This had important consequences for Zoroastrianism, given that all <b>secondary</b> <b>literature,</b> including the Zand, were then recorded only in Middle Persian, having a profound impact in orienting Zoroastrianism towards the influence of the Pars region, the homeland of the Sassanids.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Bertrand Russell {{published}} a critical study of Leibniz's metaphysics. Shortly thereafter, Louis Couturat {{published a}}n important study of Leibniz, and edited {{a volume of}} Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century analytical and linguistic philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as Bernhard Riemann). For example, Leibniz's phrase salva veritate, meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in Willard Quine's writings. Nevertheless, the <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This {{is especially true of}} English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to Leroy Loemker (1904–1985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973).|$|E
25|$|The first scholar to give Peirce his {{considered}} professional {{attention was}} Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, {{the editor of}} an anthology of Peirce's writings titled Chance, Love, and Logic (1923) {{and the author of}} the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings. John Dewey studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins and, from 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry is much influenced by Peirce. The publication of the first six volumes of Collected Papers (1931–35), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds, did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its Transactions, an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism).|$|E

It is claimed that ‘[t]he essence of governance is its focus on governing mechanisms which do not rest on recourse to the authority and sanctions of government’).

500|$|The Digambara scholar Kundakunda, in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the {{doctrine}} of syādvāda and saptibhaṅgī in Pravacanasāra and [...] Pancastikayasāra. Kundakunda also used nayas to discuss {{the essence of the}} self in Samayasāra. Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE. In contrast, the earliest available <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on anekantavada to the late 1st millennium CE.|$|E
500|$|Megasthenes, a Greek ethnographer and an {{ambassador}} of Seleucus I {{to the court}} of Chandragupta Maurya towards the end of 4thcentury BCE, made reference to Herakles in his famous work Indica. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> by later Greeks such as Arrian, Diodorus, and Strabo. According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to Edwin Bryant, a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, [...] "there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the Yadu dynasty to which Krishna belonged". The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of Jamuna. Later, when Alexander the Great launched his campaign in the northwest Indian subcontinent, his associates recalled that the soldiers of Porus were carrying an image of Herakles.|$|E
500|$|Marie Jenkins Schwartz praised King's use {{of primary}} sources, {{passion for the}} topic, and photographs, but lamented the {{original}} release's lack of child psychological perspective and exactitude of parental involvement in their children's enslavement. She also criticized its [...] "abrupt" [...] postwar ending. James Marten also found the section rushed in The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society. Jane Turner Censer pointed to Brenda Stevenson's connection between slaves' brutal treatment and their force used on children as missing from the volume. As for its originality, she also said the book held [...] "few surprises for historians of slavery". Joshua D. Rothman noted {{the same in the}} Journal of the Early Republic. Franklin, writing for History of Education Quarterly, preferred the sections on the unique realities facing these children, such as their relation to puberty and courting, and was not as interested in comparisons between slave children and adults. He bemoaned the original release's organization for only occasionally discussing these practices, and suggested organization by social practices instead of by activity to reduce redundancy. [...] Censer and Marten also complained of this repetition. In The New York Times, Douglas A. Sylva thought the book suffered from weak style and structure, with good research lost in vague topic sentences and conclusions. Franklin additionally noted insufficient citation of relevant <b>secondary</b> <b>literature</b> and recommended a harsher edit, while Loren Schweninger upheld the book's citation quality and accounted for all [...] "important secondary source" [...] on slavery in the back matter.|$|E
