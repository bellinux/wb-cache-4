500|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by Josh Aker, who had written the music for previous Chair games. The soundtrack was intended by Aker to be [...] "intense" [...] during combat, but to vary between [...] "serene" [...] and [...] "otherworldly" [...] outside battle. It {{is a mixture of}} live and <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> performances. Cello and nyckelharpa were the primary instruments used. Aker wanted to have [...] "avant-garde performances" [...] for the recordings. The soundtrack was sold as a digital album, Infinity Blade: Original Soundtrack, through several online music retailers. Chair began to develop the game's first update before the initial game was released. They intended only to add new monsters and features, but added the ability to purchase gold due to customer requests. Chair did not rebalance the game to incentivize in-app purchases. Work on The Deathless Kings update began immediately afterwards. Chair felt that releasing several large, free updates to the game would increase their overall user base and result in more total sales due to word of mouth.|$|E

50|$|A <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> is the {{opposite}} of the retronym natural instrument. Although the word “synthetic” in the phrase <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> might seem to imply that synthetic instruments are synthesizers: that they only do synthesis; this is incorrect. The instrument itself is being synthesized; nothing is implied about what the instrument does. A <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> might indeed be a synthesizer, but it could just as easily be an analyzer, or some hybrid of the two.|$|E
5000|$|The {{essential}} {{point is}} this: <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments</b> are synthesized. The whole {{is greater than}} the sum of the parts. To use Buckminster Fuller's word, <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments</b> are synergistic instruments.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>synthetic</b> <b>{{instrument}}</b> is {{a subset of the}} virtual instrument concept. A <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> is a kind of virtual instrument that is purely software defined. A <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> performs a specific synthesis, analysis, or measurement function on completely generic, measurement agnostic hardware. Virtual instruments can still have measurement specific hardware, and tend to emphasize modular hardware approaches that facilitate this specificity. Hardware supporting synthetic instruments is by definition not specific to the measurement, nor is it necessarily (or usually) modular.|$|E
50|$|A <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> {{is a term}} in {{metrology}} (test {{and measurement}} science). A <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Instrument</b> is software that runs on a Synthetic Measurement System to perform a specific , analysis, or measurement function. A Synthetic Measurement System (SMS) is a common, general purpose, physical hardware platform that is intended to perform many kinds of synthesis, analysis, or measurement functions using Synthetic Instruments.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{one way to}} tell if {{you have}} a true <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> is to examine the {{hardware}} design alone and {{to try to figure out}} what sort of instrument it might be. If all you can determine are basic category facts, like the fact that it can be categorized as a stimulus or response instrument, but not anything about what it's particularly designed to create or measure - if the measurement specificity is all hidden in software - then you likely have a true <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E

50|$|A similar term {{commonly}} used in test and measurement, Virtual instrumentation, is a superset of synthetic instrumentation. All <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments</b> are virtual instruments; however, the two terms are different when virtual instrument software mirrors and augments non-generic instrument hardware, providing a soft front panel, or managing the data flow to and from a natural instrument. In this case, the PC and accompanying software is supplementing the analysis and presentation capabilities of the natural instrument.|$|R
50|$|More than 40 {{years of}} {{activity}} has provided Rush {{with the opportunity}} for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{and this has been}} a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band's heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the later}} Hammond organ, the Telharmonium used tonewheels to {{generate}} musical sounds as electrical signals by additive synthesis. It {{is considered to}} be the first <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> due to its ability to generate sounds electromechanically because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic {{instruments}} are implemented on generic hardware, i.e., generic {{meaning that the}} underlying hardware is not explicitly designed to perform the particular measurement. This {{is probably the most}} salient characteristic of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument.</b> Measurement specificity is encapsulated totally in software. The hardware does not define the measurement.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic {{instruments}} in test and measurement are conceptually {{related to the}} software synthesizer in audio or music. A musical instrument synthesizer synthesizes the sound of specific instruments from generichardware. Of course, {{a significant difference in}} these concepts is that musical instrument synthesizers typically onlygenerate musical sound, whereas a <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> in test and measurement may be equally likely to generate or to measure some signal or parameter.|$|E

40|$|The MIDI {{standard}} {{does not}} specify how MIDI key velocity {{is to be}} interpreted. Of course, individual <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments</b> respond differently, but {{one would expect that}} on average, instruments will respond about the same. This study aims to determine empirically how hardware and software MIDI synthesizers translate velocity to peak RMS amplitude. Analysis shows synthesizers roughly follow an x-squared rather than exponential mapping. Given a desired dynamic range (from velocity 1 to 127), a square-law mapping from velocity to RMS is uniquely determined, making dynamic range a convenient way to summarize behavior. Surprisingly, computed values of dynamic range for commercial synthesizers vary by more than 60 dB...|$|R

50|$|Polyphonic: A {{polyphonic}} {{ring tone}} can consist of several notes at a time. The first polyphonic ring tones used sequenced recording {{methods such as}} MIDI. Such recordings specify what <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> should play a note at a given time, and the actual instrument sound is dependent upon the playback device. Later, synthesized instruments could be included along with the composition data, which allowed for more varied sounds beyond the built-in sound bank of each phone.|$|E
50|$|At the {{software}} level, portability of measurement description {{is the key}} attribute that distinguishes a <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> from the more commonly found instrumentation software—software that is limited to hardware scripting and data flow processing. Not all measurement related software systems inherently provide for the abstract, portable synthesis of measurements. Even if they do have such provisions, they may not typically be applied that way by users, especially if the system encourages non-abstracted access to hardware. Application software packages such as Measure Foundry and LabVIEW are typically used with explicit structural links to the natural measurements made by specific hardware and therefore usually are not synthesizing measurements from an abstract description. On the other hand, should a software system be used to synthesize measurement functions as descriptive behavioral constructs, rather than hardware referenced structural data flow descriptions, this is true measurement synthesis. An analogy here is the distinction between a non portable structuraldescription and an abstract behavioral description of digital logic {{that we see in}} HDL systems like Verilog.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The rapid {{development}} {{within the field}} of measurement methods and techniques and software design that has taken place over the last years offers new possibilities for designers of measurement systems through the use of virtual instruments as building blocks. The concept of virtual instrumentation is developed within the interchangeable virtual instrument foundation. A closely related term is “synthetic instruments”, which is often used for essentially the same concept, but it is even more software oriented. Synthetic instruments as a research field are in an initial stage and a quick search on “Synthetic instruments” in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) explorer match close to 30 documents. IEEE explorer is a database that provides full-text access to IEEE transactions, journals, magazines and conference proceedings, and all current IEEE Standards. This Master Thesis is a theoretical work extracted from study material, IEEE documents and web-resources referenced. The work gives the reader an overview of the Synthetic Instruments and their functionality with respect to hardware and software. The papers were analyzed based upon the various trends in the research, development and productizing phases. For this approach; kernel architecture of an ideal <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> has been introduced as a prototype around which current technologies and applications can be addressed. The major areas of focus in the architecture are the data conversion and signal conditioning; the knowledge of its working under current implemented technologies has been highlighted and discussed in regards to the software and hardware trends. The defense industry holds the major influence. The work was aimed towards giving a state-of-the art introduction to <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> technology; also in order to provide the work an introductory nature, only one hardware & software example has been discussed...|$|E

Living comfortably at an intermediate level of abstraction between wave forms and music transcriptions, these musical gestures are used to control the behavior of an audio processing module. The resulting scheme qualifies as an audio effects processing system as it essentially transforms an audio stream into another. 1 Introduction Audio effects are used extensively not only by producers and mastering engineers but also by musicians, who often consider effects to be critical extensions to their instruments. If a complex combination of compressors, distortions, noise gates, delays, phase modulators, pitch shifters and other modules leads to a deep metamorphosis of the audio input then the resulting system may qualify as a sound-controlled <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument.</b> A direct functio [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this book}} {{is to examine the}} Swedish income tax {{treatment}} of derivatives, to ascertain the extent to which this treatment provides tax arbitrage opportunities, and to present possible solution that may prevent existing arbitrage opportunities. This study establishes that {{there are two types of}} financial instruments that constitute the greatest challenges regarding tax arbitrage opportunities in the Swedish income tax system: hybrid financial <b>instruments</b> and <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments.</b> These instruments challenge the Swedish income tax system because their legal form is not always in accordance with their economic substance. Accordingly, to prevent tax arbitrage opportunities related to derivatives and other financial instruments in the long run, it is necessary to draft relevant income tax provisions in a way that better mirrors the economic substance of these instruments. As a benchmark for such provisions, the international accounting standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is presented and evaluated. The topic and findings are of interest to academics and are highly relevant to practitioners and government officials in the area of income taxation. Although the focus is the Swedish income tax system, the material in this book has application to other countries as well...|$|R
