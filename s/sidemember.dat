40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania Ferruform AB in Lulea, a subsidiary owned by Scania. One {{of the core}} ideas in the production system in both these companies is to constantly work on minimizing waste in the work flow. The <b>Sidemember</b> have lately been surrounded {{by a lot of}} deviations considering transportation and handling. In order to achieve their goals, the desire has been to minimize the deviations that occur on this product the <b>Sidemember.</b> The purpose for this master thesis was to analyze what happens during handling and transportation of the <b>sidemember</b> to ultimately ensure a better quality of the process to Scania’s productionunits. This is done by defining the root causes for the deviations, investigate what kind of packaging is necessary for better quality, creating methods for how the products are packaged and create methods for how the products should be handled. The methods used in this study have been focused on; observation, interviews, data collection, tests, programming, and analysis with the 8 -step model, etc. Data and information where obtained primarily through internal data. The theory that the thesis rests on are primarly transportation logistics combined with other master thesies and reports in the same field of research. The work has been focused on analyzing and defining the problem areas based on deviations and identified sub-problems with root cause areas. In order to analyze deviations and identify problems and root causes, an information analysis has been conducted. Internal deviation databases such as Equality (statistical tools) have been used along with statistics that has been manufactured from the production unit Scania Zwolle. A lot of work has been spent understanding the process and all the steps where the deviations occur. Early in the thesis, it was discovered that reliable statistics were missing to complete the goal that was originally aimed to solve. The goals and deliveries then changed to; create a better standard to collect statistics at both Ferruform and Scania’s production units, with the purpose {{to make it easier to}} investigate each deviation and find the root cause of them. The condition for transporting intact members is a very complex matter, which have a lot of different factors that interacts with each other, therefore reliable statistics are needed to solve the root causes. The results of the thesis are; a new standard for how to measure and record statistics (implemented before the thesis were finished), a statistical analysis program based on visual basic/excel, a policy / plan for areas that need to be revised in order to address deviations in the future, and defined reasons for the deviations. Finally, the results can be used to create a better overall solution for the sidemembers. Ferruform should further more focus on resolving the simpler problems which include; standards, recording deviations more efficient both in Ferruform and at Scanias other productionunits, and also reviewing the packaging material surrounding the pile. The long term goal should be to investigate if the current way of using the pile and yokes are an optimal solution to use when transporting piles in a trailer. How different transport routes affect the deviations on the beams are also a problem that needs adressing (different routes have different external environments that affect the <b>Sidemember).</b> Furthermore Ferruform and Scania should work more closely in cross-functional groups that all are affected with the deviations of the <b>Sidemember.</b> Today these groups are missing and this needs to be addressed, information between operators and management also needs to get through to solve the overall problem with the deviations.

40|$|Abstract. The use of metamodels as surrogates of {{time-consuming}} functions has widely spread {{within the}} academia and the industry. In this paper, two metamodels are considered for crashworthiness design of an automotive body structure, namely Kriging and support vector regression. Variants {{of these two}} metamodels associated with various kernel or auto-correlation functions are first compared on analytical functions. The conclusions of this benchmark analysis are then considered to select the most appropriate ones for application on the so-called <b>sidemember</b> subsystem. This is a subsystem of an automotive front end under frontal impact. The outputs to emulate are highly non-linear and noisy. The SVR and Kriging models are shown to produce roughly {{the same level of}} accuracy for prediction when considered with isotropic kernels or auto-correlation functions, with a slight advantage to Kriging. Besides, the anisotropy in the auto-correlation functions clearly improves the Kriging surrogates. Some outputs of the crash simulation were however hard to surrogate...|$|E

50|$|Rarest {{and most}} {{collectable}} of all DS variants, a convertible was offered from 1958 until 1973. The Cabriolet d'Usine (factory convertible) were built by French carrossier Henri Chapron, for the Citroën dealer network. It was an expensive car, so only 1,365 were sold. These DS convertibles used a special frame which was reinforced on the <b>sidemembers</b> and rear suspension swingarm bearing box, similar to, but not {{identical to the}} Break (Station Wagon) frame.|$|R
50|$|A new {{designed}} chassis {{with straight}} box section <b>sidemembers</b> having six tubular cross-members is particularly stiff so the {{independent front suspension}} can work properly. Steering is carried out by worm and nut. Automatic chassis lubrication {{is controlled by the}} clutch pedal. The car is fitted with a Smiths hydraulic jacking system. The independent front suspension to Alviss own design is by transverse leaf springs. The semi-elliptic rear springs are underslung. Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers control the springing. A fully floating rear axle is fitted. Wire wheels with bolt-on hubs are supplied fitted with extra low-pressure tyres. Four-wheel, self-energising Girling brakes have large diameter drums which are ribbed for cooling.|$|R
2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when monocoque construction was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the window pillars relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding all-round visibility, while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the pleating and reinforcement of the roof panel. The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} flat steel <b>sidemembers.</b> Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|R
