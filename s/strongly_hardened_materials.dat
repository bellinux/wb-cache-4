40|$|Abstract This paper {{addresses}} quasi-static {{loading of}} the shear compression specimen (SCS), {{that has been}} especially developed to investigate the shear response of materials at various strain rates. Previous work [4, 5] addressed bi-linear <b>hardening</b> <b>materials,</b> whereas the present work concerns parabolic <b>hardening</b> <b>materials.</b> The investigation is done numerically using three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element simulations. The analyses show that the averaged von Mises stress (ŝeq) and strain (êeq) on a mid-section of the gauge reflect accurately the prescribed parabolic hardening model. A method for finding the parabolic hardening coefficients and reducing the measured load, P, and displacement, d, into equivalent stress ŝeq and strain êeq is introduced and tested. A very good agreement is observed, thus confirming {{the potential of the}} tech-nique for large strain testing of parabolic <b>hardening</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Expressions are {{developed}} for the residual thermal stresses in a solid sphere cast from a chemically <b>hardening</b> thermosetting <b>material</b> in a rigid spherical mold. The description of the heat generation rate and temperature variation is derived from a first-order chemical reaction. Solidification is described by the continuous transformation of the material from an inviscid liquidlike state into an elastic solid, with intermediate properties determined by the degree of chemical reaction. Residual stress components are obtained as functions of {{the parameters of the}} hardening process and the properties of the <b>hardening</b> <b>material.</b> Variation of the residual stresses with a nondimensionalized reaction rate parameter and the relative compressibility of the <b>hardened</b> <b>material</b> is discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{material}} compressibility on {{the stress and}} strain fields for a mode-I crack propagating steadily in a power-law <b>hardening</b> <b>material</b> is investigated under plane strain conditions. The plastic deformation of materials {{is characterized by the}} J 2 flow theory within the framework of isotropic hardening and infinitesimal displacement gradient. The asymptotic solutions developed by the present authors [Zhu, X. K., Hwang K. C., 2002. Dynamic crack-tip field for tensile cracks propagating in power-law <b>hardening</b> <b>materials.</b> International Journal of Fracture 115, 323 – 342] for incompressible <b>hardening</b> <b>materials</b> are extended in this work to the compressible <b>hardening</b> <b>materials.</b> The results show that all stresses, strains, and particle velocities in the asymptotic fields are fully continuous and bounded without elastic unloading near the dynamic crack tip. The stress field contains two free parameters σeq 0 and s 330 that cannot be determined in the asymptotic analysis, and can be determined from the full-field solutions. For the given values of σeq 0 and s 330, all field quantities around the crack tip are determined through numerical integration, and then the effects of the hardening exponent n, the Poisson ratio ν, and the crack growth speed M on the asymptotic fields are studied. The approximate behaviors of the proposed solutions are discussed in the limit of ν→ 0. 5 or n→∞...|$|R

In {{order to maintain}} better approximation, it adopts testing data of typical stress path, testing data of uniaxial tension and torsion test. Applying multidimensional incremental theory under general loading law, {{on the base of}} certain loading function of stress space and loading function of strain space, this essay drives heat-elasto-plastic constitutive relation of heated isotropic <b>hardening</b> <b>material</b> under the condition of elasto-plastic decoupling.

40|$|The {{effects of}} strain {{hardening}} on the mechanical behavior of 316 L stainless steel were {{studied in the}} paper. The original and different strain <b>hardening</b> <b>materials</b> were compared to investigate the mechanical behavior. The results demonstrate that the yield strengths increase with the magnitude of strain hardening significantly, but the ultimate strengths of the original and different strain <b>hardening</b> <b>materials</b> are closed. In addition, the plastic parameters of 316 L stainless steel including fracture elongation and fracture surface shrinkage decrease with the magnitude of strain hardening. Finally, the Ramberg-Osgood equation is used to predict the stress-strain curves after strain hardening, and {{the results indicate that}} the predicted values agree with the experimental values...|$|R

The hardening methods which iron plating and composite iron plating have application in engine cylinder repair are put forward. The relative speed and pressure between piston ring and cylinder wall are determined as main wear factors of engine cylinder. And wear resistance of <b>hardening</b> <b>material</b> is chosen as assessment index. At the high load, the relative wear resistance of engine cylinder hardened by composite iron plating is {{twice as high as}} high phosphors cast iron. By comprehensive contrast of the wear resistance of <b>hardening</b> <b>materials,</b> relative wear resistance of composite iron plating is better than common engine cylinder material, and can fit for the cylinder hardening of high load engine...|$|R

50|$|The handles of {{the knives}} are {{typically}} {{made of wood}} but can also be fashioned of antler, or another <b>hardened</b> <b>material.</b> The handles often became highly embellished and {{take the form of}} humans or animals, or are incised and inlaid and are fashioned into high works of art.|$|R
50|$|Cold {{work also}} serves to <b>harden</b> the <b>material's</b> surface. This makes cracks {{less likely to}} form at the surface and {{provides}} resistance to abrasion. When a metal undergoes strain hardening its yield strength increases but its ductility decreases. Strain hardening actually increases the number of dislocations in the crystal lattice of the material. When a material has {{a great number of}} dislocations, plastic deformation is hindered, and the material will continue to behave in an elastic way well beyond the elastic yield stress of the non-strain <b>hardened</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R

Hard turning {{has its advantage}} on processing flexibility, cycle time and tool cost reduction. Also this process obtains high efficiency in processing and precise surface roughness through application of the CBN tools. In hard turning process with CBN tool, surface integrity is the important factor for considering the design of machine part and component under high stress and load conditions.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{the science of}} {{concrete}} behavior has made much progress and many useful results are now incorporated in technical codes such as those governing mix design, quality of mix and post pouring verification. The stage of Very Early Age (VEA) concrete begins with pouring and ends with hardening. Behavior at this stage influences safety and durability of structures. Concrete is a cast-in-place <b>hardening</b> <b>material.</b> Other <b>hardening</b> <b>materials,</b> such as epoxy mortars have recently raised interest. Techniques used for concrete can potentially be applied to these new composite materials. The overall objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} methodology for predicting mechanical properties and for separating important phenomenon in <b>hardening</b> <b>materials,</b> such as commercial concrete and mortar, to be ultimately applied in real time and in situ. A literature survey has shown a lack of knowledge in the areas of measurement techniques at VEA, prediction of compressive strength, separation of the autogenous deformation and values for the thermal expansion coefficient. This lack of knowledge is especially clear for cement-based <b>materials</b> <b>hardening</b> at varying temperatures. Few VEA data are available and few tools are capable of monitoring VEA parameters. A new device has been constructed to monitor deformations and help identify phenomenological contributions to the total deformation. The design of this device takes into account aspects such as usability in the field and reliability in practice. More than 80 embedded fiber optic sensors and 100 specimens were used for development and testing. Several special sensors have been designed and tested so that their features are adapted to the characteristics of the <b>hardening</b> <b>material</b> at VEA. An important part of this work has been the development of procedures where VEA data are interpreted and reduced {{in order to determine the}} parameters that describe the evolution of the degree of reaction, as well as mechanical properties, and allow for the decoupling of values for the total deformation into parts that are related to different physical phenomena. Concluding, this methodology allows accurate prediction of the compressive strength evolution in term of degree of reaction using VEA data carried out within the first 72 hours of the <b>hardening</b> <b>material</b> life. The methodology also leads to straightforward determination of values for the thermal expansion coefficient and the separation of values for autogenous and drying deformation. Furthermore, pilot testing on epoxy mortar demonstrates that the methodology is not limited to cement-based materials Finally, the results of this thesis have the potential to make further contributions to scientific research and to strategies for quality control and safety during construction...|$|R
40|$|A stress {{resultant}} constitutive law in rate form {{is constructed}} for power-law <b>hardening</b> <b>materials.</b> The change of plate thickness is {{considered in the}} constitutive law. The elastic-plastic behavior of a plate element based on the stress resultant constitutive law under uniaxial combined tension and bending is determined under {{a limited number of}} nonproportional and unloading paths. The results based on the stress resultant constitutive law and the through-the-thickness integration method are compared within the context of both the small-strain and finite deformation approaches. The results indicate that the selection of the normalized equivalent stress resultant and the corresponding work-conjugate normalized equivalent generalized strain is appropriate for describing the hardening behavior in the stress resultant space. However, the hardening rule in a power law form must be modified for low <b>hardening</b> <b>materials</b> at large plastic deformation when finite deformation effects are considered...|$|R

Unlike thin films, surface <b>hardened</b> <b>materials</b> may cover several tenths of millimetres in depth. The effectiveness of such treatments is studied by analysing the hardness-depth profile. In this paper, the authors describe a method to evaluate the hardness profile with depth based on the estimation of the contribution of deeper zones of the <b>hardened</b> <b>material</b> to the hardness of the surface through the practice of a series of indentations on the surface with increasing loads. This model allows estimating the hardness of virtual layers through a step by step calculation process at increasing depths under the surface of the material.

The major results of this study are the following: (1) It is possible to substitute a portion (10 wt%) of an aluminous cement by calcium carbonate, while improving the mechanical properties of the <b>hardened</b> <b>material.</b> This is achieved with a mass percentage of the carboxylic acid between 1 and 5 %, relative to the dry mass, which acts as a good dispersant and leads therefore to densification of the <b>hardened</b> <b>material.</b> (2) When the mix consists of 50 wt% of aluminous cement and 50 wt% of calcium carbonate, the mechanical properties of the cured material are low and this happens whatever the percentage of added dispersant is...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a variational formulation {{for the analysis}} of plastic collapse conditions for a class of <b>hardening</b> <b>materials</b> that accounts for some non-associated flow laws such as the modified Cam-clay model of soils. In this framework, classical statical and kinematical principles of limit analysis do not hold. The variational principle is formulated for the general class of materials whose flow equations are derived from a kind of generalized potentials named bipotentials by de Saxcé. The plastic collapse phenomenon for <b>hardening</b> <b>materials</b> is considered first and formulated as a system of equations. In particular, the case of the usual modified Cam-clay model is analyzed. The paper follows with the proposal of a minimization principle whose solution is then related to the solution of the plastic collapse problem. We demonstrate the use of this minimum principle in a simple example of triaxial compression of a modified Cam-clay material. Finally, we discuss the particular form of the proposed variational formulation for the case of associated plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Present {{concerns}} {{about global warming}} due to the greenhouse emissions in the atmosphere have pushed the cement industry to research alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Geopolymer binder may constitute a possible breakthrough {{in the development of}} sustainable materials: understanding the effectiveness and the influences of superplasticizers on geopolymer systems is one of the essential requirements for its large-scale implementation.

This deformation mode has similarities with the deformation {{that takes place}} in incremental sheet forming (ISF) and may—at least partly—explain the high strains that are observed there.
