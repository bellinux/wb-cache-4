Uncertainties in aerosol properties, aerosol behavior within gas bubbles, and bubble behavior in plumes affect predictions of decontamination by steam <b>suppression</b> <b>pools.</b> Uncertainties in the boundary and initial conditions that are dictated by the progression of severe reactor accidents and that will affect predictions of decontamination by steam <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> are discussed. Ten parameters that characterize boundary and initial condition uncertainties, nine parameters that characterize aerosol property and behavior uncertainties, and eleven parameters that characterize uncertainties {{in the behavior of}} bubbles in steam <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> are identified. Ranges for the values of these parameters and subjective probability distributions for parametric values within the ranges are defined. These uncertain parameters are used in Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses to develop uncertainty distributions for the decontamination that can be achieved by steam <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> and the size distribution of aerosols that do emerge from such pools. A simplified model of decontamination by steam <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> is developed by correlating features of the uncertainty distributions for total decontamination factor, DF(total), mean size of emerging aerosol particles, d{sub p}, and the standard deviation of the emerging aerosol size distribution, {sigma}, with pool depth, H. Correlations of the median values of the uncertainty distributions are suggested as the best estimate of decontamination by <b>suppression</b> <b>pools.</b> Correlations of the 10 percentile and 90 percentile values of the uncertainty distributions characterize the uncertainty in the best estimates. 295 refs., 121 figs., 113 tabs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} study of <b>suppression</b> of <b>pool</b> fires in enclosed spaces using water mist. The main objective of the present study is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the <b>suppression</b> of <b>pool</b> fires using water mists. Experiments were conducted in a large compartment with n-heptane pool fires of different heat release rates. The temperature variations in the compartment were measured using K-type thermocouples fixed at two locations. A multi gas analyzer was used to measure gas concentrations. The test results indicate that the water mist suppresses the diffusion flame in an enclosed space mainly through evaporating cooling and oxygen displacement by water vapors, resulting in inefficient combustion. The fire suppression time decreases with a decrease in droplet diameter. It is much easier to suppress a larger fire due to faster rates of evaporation of water droplets and therefore, the total mist requirement decreases with an increase in the fire size. The results of this study can find application in the design of water mist based fire fighting systems for indoor fires...|$|R

2500|$|While {{admitting that}} the <b>suppression</b> <b>pool</b> {{at the bottom}} of the {{containment}} vessel had been damaged in the explosion, causing a drop of pressure there, Japanese nuclear authorities emphasized that the containment had not been breached as a result of the explosion and contained no obvious holes. In a news conference on 15 March the director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, said that there was a [...] "possibility of core damage" [...] at Unit 2 of less than 5%. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) stated 33% of the fuel rods were damaged, in news reports the morning of 16 March. On 30 March, NISA reiterated concerns about a possible Unit 2 breach at either the <b>suppression</b> <b>pool,</b> or the reactor vessel. NHK World reported the NISA's concerns as [...] "air may be leaking", very probably through [...] "weakened valves, pipes and openings under the reactors where the control rods are inserted", but that [...] "there is no indication of large cracks or holes in the reactor vessels".|$|E
2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure <b>Suppression</b> <b>Pools</b> ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|R
2500|$|The molten {{reactor core}} {{accumulated}} in room 305/2, until {{it reached the}} edges of the steam relief valves; then it migrated downward to the Steam Distribution Corridor. It also broke or burned through into room 304/3. The corium flowed from the reactor in three streams. Stream 1 was composed of brown lava and molten steel; steel formed a layer {{on the floor of the}} Steam Distribution Corridor, on the Level +6, with brown corium on its top. From this area, brown corium flowed through the Steam Distribution Channels into the Pressure <b>Suppression</b> <b>Pools</b> on the Level +3 and Level 0, forming porous and slag-like formations there. Stream 2 was composed of black lava, and entered the other side of the Steam Distribution Corridor. Stream 3, also composed of black lavas, flowed to other areas under the reactor. The well-known [...] "Elephant's Foot" [...] structure is composed of two metric tons of black lava, forming a multilayered structure similar to tree bark. It is said to be melted 2 meters deep into the concrete. The material is dangerously radioactive and hard and strong, and using remote controlled systems was not possible due to high radiation interfering with electronics.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of the fission product control systems and structures are reviewed to (a) {{provide a basis for}} developing the mathematical model for design basis loss-of-coolant accident dose computations, (b) verify that the values of certain key parameters are within pre-established limits, (c) confirm the applicability of important modeling assumptions, and (d) verify the functional capability of ventilation systems used to control fission product releases. The parameters which must be established for use in the calculation of the radio-logical consequences of accidents in Chapter 15, and the systems whose functions must be reviewed are outlined below. Many of these areas are the responsibility of other branches and are reviewed by the AEB to provide a general knowledge of the containment systems and their operation following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). The following areas are reviewed: 1. Primary Containment Design Primary containment characteristics of (1) the containment isolation times and methods, (2) leak rates prior to and following containment isolation if venting, vacuum relief or purging of the containment is permitted (by technical specification) during operation, (3) total and mixing volumes to be assumed from the recirculation characteristics given in safety analysis reports, and (4) the efficiencies of the ESF filters used for post-accident ventilation.

2500|$|On 25 March 2011, {{officials}} announced the reactor vessel might be breached and leaking radioactive material. High radiation levels from contaminated water prevented work. Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) reiterated concerns about a Unit 3 breach on 30 March.

2500|$|In a BWR, the {{containment}} strategy {{is a bit}} different. [...] A BWR's containment consists of a drywell where the reactor and associated cooling equipment is located and a wetwell. [...] The drywell is much smaller than a PWR containment and plays a larger role. During the theoretical leakage design basis accident the reactor coolant flashes to steam in the drywell, pressurizing it rapidly. [...] Vent pipes or tubes from the drywell direct the steam below the water level maintained in the wetwell (also known as a torus or <b>suppression</b> <b>pool),</b> condensing the steam, limiting the pressure ultimately reached. [...] Both the drywell and the wetwell are enclosed by a secondary containment building, maintained at a slight sub-atmospheric or negative pressure during normal operation and refueling operations. The containment designs are referred to by the names Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III. The Mark I is the oldest, distinguished by a drywell containment which resembles an inverted lightbulb above the wetwell which is a steel torus containing water. The Mark II was used with late BWR-4 and BWR-5 reactors. It is called an [...] "over-under" [...] configuration with the drywell forming a truncated cone on a concrete slab. Below is a cylindrical suppression chamber made of concrete rather than just sheet metal. Both use a lightweight steel or concrete [...] "secondary containment" [...] over the top floor which is kept at a slight negative pressure so that air can be filtered. The top level is a large open space with an overhead crane suspended between the two long walls for moving heavy fuel caskets from the ground floor, and removing / replacing hardware from the reactor and reactor well. The reactor well can be flooded and is straddled by pools separated by gates on either side for storing reactor hardware normally placed above the fuel rods, and for fuel storage. A refueling platform has a specialized telescoping mast for lifting and lowering fuel rod assemblies with precision through the [...] "cattle chute" [...] to the reactor core area.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on level}} 2 {{analyses}} in IPE (Individual Plant Examination) submittals accident progression, perspectives {{were obtained for}} all containment types. These perspectives consisted of insights on containment failure modes, releases therein, and factors responsible for the results. To illustrate the types of perspectives acquired on severe accident progresssion, insights obtained for (BWR) Mark I containments are discussed here. Mark I containments have high strength but small volumes and rely on pressure <b>suppression</b> <b>pools</b> to condense steam released from the reactor coolant system during an accident. Accidents causing structural failure of the drywell shortly after the core debris melts through the reactor vessel {{were found to be}} dominant contributors to risk. Importance of individual containment failure mechanisms depends on plant features and in some cases on modeling assumptions; however the following mechanisms were found important: drywell shell melt-through caused by direct contact with core debris and drywell failure caused by rapid pressure/temperature pulses at time of vessel melt-through. Drywell failure caused by gradual pressure/temperature buildup due to gases and steam released during core/concrete interactions is important in some IPEs. In other IPEs vent was an important contributor. However, accidents that bypass containment (eg interfacing systems LOCA) or involve containment isolation failure were not important contributors to the CDF in any of the IPEs for Mark I plants. These accidents are also not important to risk (even though they can involve large fission product release) because their frequencies of occurrence are so much lower than frequencies of early structural failure caused by other accidents that dominate the CDF...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{combustion}} {{may represent}} a threat to containment integrity in a VVER- 440 / 213 plant owing to the combination of high pressure and high temperature. A study {{has been carried out}} using the GASFLOW 2. 1 three-dimensional CFD code to evaluate the hydrogen distribution in the containment during a beyond design basis accident. The VVER- 440 / 213 containment input model consists of two 3 D blocks connected via one-dimensional (1 D) ducts. One 3 D block contains the reactor building and the accident localization tower with the <b>suppression</b> <b>pools.</b> Another 3 D block models the air traps. 1 D ducts represent the check valves connecting the accident localization tower with the air traps. The VVER pressure suppression system, called ''bubbler condenser,'' was modeled as a distributed heat sink with water thermodynamic properties. This model accounts for the energy balance. However, it is not currently possible to model dynamic phenomena associated with the water pools (e. g., vent clearing, level change). The GASFLOW 2. 1 calculation gave detailed results for the spatial distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and gas concentrations. The range and trend of the parameters are reasonable and valuable. There are particularly interesting circulation patterns around the steam generators, in the bubbler tower and other primary system compartments. In case of the bubbler tower, concentration and temperature contour plots show an inhomogeneous distribution along the height and width, changing during the accident. Hydrogen concentrations also vary within primary system compartments displaying lower as well as higher (up to 13 - 20 % and higher) values in some nodes. Prediction of such concentration distributions was not previously possible with lumped parameter codes. GASFLOW 2. 1 calculations were compared with CONTAIN 1. 2 (lumped parameter code) results. Apart from the qualitatively similar trends, there are, for the time being, quantitative differences between the results concerning, for example, pressure histories, or the total amount of steam available in the containment. The results confirm the importance of detailed modeling of the containment, {{as well as of the}} bubbler condenser and sump water pools. The study showed that modeling of hydrogen distribution in the VVER- 440 / 213 containment was possible using the GASFLOW 2. 1 code with reasonable results and remarkable physical insights...|$|R

In the baseline configuration, {{which is based on}} an installed system, suppressant is injected through four nozzles at a rate fast enough to suppress all simulated pool fires. Variations that reduce the mass of the suppression system (reducing the impact of the suppression system on meeting mission needs) are considered, including a reduction in the rate of suppressant injection, a reduction in the mass of suppressant and a {{reduction in the number of}} nozzles. In general, these variations should work to reduce the effectiveness of the suppression system, but the CFD results point out certain changes that have negligible impact, at least for the range of phenomena considered here. The results are compared with measurements where available. Comparisons with suppressant measurements are reasonable. A series of twenty-three fire suppression tests were conducted to check the predictions. The pre-test predictions were generally successful in identifying the range of successful suppression tests. In two separate cases, each where one nozzle of the suppression system was capped, the simulation results did indicate a failure to suppress for a condition where the tests indicated successful suppression. When the test-suppressant discharge rate was reduced by roughly 25 %, the tests were in agreement with the predictions. That is, the simulations predict a failure to suppress slightly before observed in these cases...|$|R

Expression of PLZF had a dramatic growth-suppressive effect accompanied by accumulation of cells in the G 0 /G 1 compartment of the cell cycle and an increased incidence of apoptosis. PLZF-expressing pools also secreted a growth-inhibitory factor, which could explain the severe growth <b>suppression</b> of PLZF-expressing <b>pools</b> that occurred {{despite the fact that}} only half of the cells expressed high levels of PLZF.
