Politicians often use these externalities as a reason for public (lump sum) <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> cultural institutions.

It is not necessarily the amount of the subsidy which is important for the internalization - the major aspect lies in switching <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> the producer to <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> the consumer (voucher). With consumer subsidies the museum has a greater incentive to produce more efficiently. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{the use of}} <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> the System of Direct Payment in Hilly and Mountainous Areas in the Hokkaido paddy field region, Japan. We calculated the “individual farm support ratio” from 2000 to 2004 in the Sorachi region of Hokkaido. The “individual farm support ratio” shows how much <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> community activities in this system was spent for income support of farm households. We aimed {{to determine whether the}} <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> community activities of this system were mainly used for income support of farm households (the “individual farm support ratio” was more than 50 %), or whether they were mainly used for communities (the ratio was less than 50 %). Our result suggested that the “individual farm support ratio” was substantially more than 50 %. Therefore, we concluded that the <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> community activities of this system were mainly used for income support of farm households...|$|R
