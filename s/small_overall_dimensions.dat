40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent efforts}} {{to evaluate the}} potential for the formation of a metal matrix nanocomposite (MMNC) by processing two commercial bulk metals of aluminum and magnesium alloy through high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature. After significant evolutions in microstructures, successful fabrication of an Al-Mg hybrid system was demonstrated by observing unique microstructures consisting of a multi-layered structure and MMNC. Moreover, the evolution of small-scale mechanical properties was examined through the novel technique of nanoindentation and the improvement in plasticity was estimated by calculating the strain rate sensitivity of the Al-Mg hybrid system after HPT. The present paper demonstrates that, in addition to conventional tensile testing, the nanoindentation technique is exceptionally promising for ultrafine-grained materials processed by HPT, where the samples may have <b>small</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions</b> and include heterogeneity in the microstructure...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-fingered gripper}} with flexure hinges {{actuated}} by {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) wires was designed and prototyped. The aim of the work was the manipulation of small, almost cylindrical objects, e. g. test tubes, by a device having <b>small</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions.</b> A parametric study of four different, but similar, fingers was conducted {{with the aim of}} obtaining a solution with a good amplification ratio and a gripping force almost constant during closure. The use of flexure hinges simplifies the design, but limits the finger range of motion. Moreover, it was possible to find a configuration with sufficient work space. Once the finger geometry was defined, the whole hand was then designed with the aim of producing a compact hand contained in a cylindrical volume (d 65 x h 65 mm), and the first prototype was built. Preliminary tests demonstrated its good dimensioning and the success of some technological solutions. The experimental transmission ratio was almost the same as the theoretical one.

40|$|Advances in {{the field}} of micro/nano-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) now offer unique {{opportunities}} in the design of small and ultrasensitive analytical methods. MEMs/NEMs have demonstrated their unique advantages when they are combined with chemistry and biology, including fast, real-time responses. In addition, MEMs and NEMS are small enough to be integrated into other devices. One of the most promising MEMs is microcantilevers, which have been proven to be an outstanding transducer for chemical and biological sensors. This review summarizes the receptors and immobilization approaches reported for nanomechanical sensors and interpret the mechanism and dynamic relationship of recognition induced nanomechanical motions. Since the three pioneer papers [1 - 3] published in 1994, the micro/nanocantilever sensor technology had boomed and become a promising sensor technology. Microcantilever sensors have several advantages over many other sensor technologies, including faster response time, lower cost of fabrication, the possibility of sensor arrays with <b>small</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions,</b> the ability to explore microenvironments, and improved portability for field applications.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} towards integrated dual-beam optical trapping achieved using planar lightwave circuit (PLC) technology. Three fabrication technologies sol-gel, photolithography and reactive ion etching were combined to fabricate a Laser Trapping Microchip (LTM) allowing one-dimensional manipulation of transparent micrometer-size spherical objects. Detailed steps of the LTM development are described, beginning with a theoretical approach and numerical simulations through the design and synthesis of a suitable photopatternable sol-gel material, culminating in the fabrication process and experimental confirmation of the trapping properties of the device. The proof of concept of this unique device was achieved by demonstrating its optical trapping abilities using micrometer size polystyrene beads with diameters in the range between 4 pm and 10 pm and the refractive index of 1 59. The LTM device possesses many advantages over currently existing dual-beam laser trapping systems such as <b>small</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions</b> (~ 15 x 30 x 0 5 mm), low power optical power consumption (< 15 mW), improved stability of the optical trap due to precise alignment of the optical paths and a relatively easy fabrication process.

40|$|Leadless, near chip scale {{packages}} (LNCSP) {{like the}} quad flat pack no lead (QFN) are {{the fastest growing}} package types in the electronics industry today. Early LNCSPs were fairly straightforward components with <b>small</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions,</b> a single outer row of leads and small lead counts. However, there is currently a proliferation of advanced LNCSP package styles that have started to approach BGA packages {{in terms of both}} size and number of connections. Some of the newer packages have 3 or more rows, pitches as fine as. 35 mm, lead counts exceeding 200, and dimensions exceeding 12 mm X 12 mm. While the advantages of these packages are well documented, concerns arise with both reliability and manufacturability in Pb-free environments. So, acceptance of these packages in long-life, severe-environment, high-reliability applications is somewhat limited. One of the most common drivers for reliability failures is the inappropriate adoption of new technologies like LNCSP. Since robust manufacturing and qualifications standards always lag behind implementation, users must carefully select and validate these components for suitability in their use environments and customer applications. Soldering, flexure, and cleanliness issues have driven many failures seen in production and in the field. All of these areas must be addressed early in the selection and validation processes. In this paper, we will review and discuss LNCSP related reliability concerns and challenges, and propose Physics-of- Failure (PoF) based approaches to allow the successful introduction and failure analysis of LNCSP components in electronics products...|$|E

Findings:While in normal scanning mode some features were well above the laser spot diameter, strut thicknesses below the laser spot diameter were achieved when using the outline scan function for PA material.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} a theoretical underpinning on creation of ultrasonic vibration concentrators based on annular elastic elements with non-circular (ellipse-like) eccentric shape of internal contour. Shape of internal contour in polar coordinates {{is described by}} Fourier series relative to angular coordinate that consists of a constant term and first and second harmonics. An effect of geometric parameters of the concentrator on amplification factor and natural vibration frequencies has been investigated {{with the help of}} a finite element method. The paper reveals the possibility to control an amplification factor of annular concentrators while varying eccentricity of internal contour and mean value of cross-section thickness. The amplification factor satisfies a condition K < N, where N is thickness ratio of amplifier input and output sections, and it is decreasing with increase of vibration mode order. The similar condition has been satisfied for conical bar concentrator with the difference that in the case of bar concentrators an amplification is ensured due to variation of diameter and N will represent ratio of diameters. It has been proved that modification of internal contour shape makes it possible to carry out a wide-band tuning of natural frequencies of concentrator vibrations without alteration of its overall dimensions and substantial change of amplification factor, which is important for frequency matching of the concentrator and ultrasonic vibratory system. Advantages of the proposed concentrators include simplicity of design and manufacturing, <b>small</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions,</b> possibility for natural frequency tuning by means of static load variation. The developed concentrators can find their application in ultrasonic devices and instruments for technological and medical purposes. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years gas {{combustion}} technology has undergone important innovations especially in residential heating appliances. In particular, requirements on low emissions together with load modulation has led to the use of premixed combustion technologies besides traditional diffusive flames. Constant demand for <b>smaller</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions</b> and cost optimization has led to design combustion chambers with higher combustion intensity and this has led to premixed surface burners, then to radiant burners, and then to metallic mat burners in particular. With the metallic mat combustion flame front stabilizes above a metallic mat and at specific power loads is located inside. It differs from porous matrix combustion where combustion takes place inside a solid. If the initial calculations show that the convection heat exchange is not enough to establish the designed combustion intensity, the use of radiant burners becomes decisive. The radiative contribution of the mat is naturally predominant in the power range when flame develops within the mat itself. Apart from the radiative contribution, the metallic mat has others functions: it increases the operating margin with regards to flame lift-off and flashback that can happen with the variation in excess air and gas type like the light-back limit gas (as defined in EN 676). Metallic mat combustion is widely used in residential heating (at least in Europe) especially in those applica-tions where condensation is sought. It is also used in process applications like bread ovens, paint ovens and where a radiant load is required. In the following, metallic mat combustion technology will be described with special reference to metallic mat production technology and material selection.

Directly analyzing the entanglement [or the primitive path (PP) ] network of the system via the Z-code, we quantified several important topological measures: (a) the PP contour length Lpp, (b) the number of entanglements Zes per chain, (c) the end-to-end length of an entanglement strand des, (d) the number of carbon atoms per entanglement strand Nes, and (e) the probability distribution for each of these quantities.
