25|$|The French fleet soon appeared, but Ribault faltered. Had he landed, {{success was}} possible; a way was open for retreat by {{land and water}} to his fort on the St. Johns. However, he chose to stand off. Menéndez, a more practiced seaman, <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an advantage; he had scanned the sky for weather signs, and knew that a norther was coming. The French fleet would be swept before it and perhaps be wrecked, or {{escaping}} that, be driven so far that days would elapse before Ribault could make an attack.|$|E
25|$|Canrobert {{had been}} {{informed}} of the Russian attack at about 07:30, and had immediately ridden off to join Raglan. Bosquet, having been aroused {{by the sound of}} the cannon, had ordered the 2nd Brigade of the French 1st Division (under General Vinoy) to march towards Balaclava in support of the British. Additionally, the 1st Brigade under General Espinasse began to move, along with the divisional artillery and the Chasseurs d'Afrique. The French 3rd Division was put on alert, and the horse artillery of the reserve harnessed. Raglan had at first thought the Russian advance a feint, possibly designed to occupy him whilst the enemy stormed out of Sevastopol to attack his army overlooking the heights above the city; but now he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been wrong. With the first four redoubts on the Causeway Heights either captured or out of action, all that protected Balaclava were Lucan's Cavalry Division, together with the 550 men of the 93 Highlanders, Barker's W Battery, 100 invalids under Colonel Daveney, and some Ottomans, reinforced by their countrymen from the redoubts who had rallied and formed up alongside them. It was only now that Raglan ordered the British 1st Division under the Duke of Cambridge, and Cathcart's 4th Division, to move into the plain. The 1st Division got away promptly, but when Raglan's staff officer informed Cathcart that the Russians were marching on Balaclava, he at first refused to comply, complaining that his men had only just finished their shift in the trenches before Sevastopol. In the end he did move, but the delay brought his division down 40 minutes after the Duke's. It would take a least two hours to march an infantry division down from the heights overlooking Sevastopol into the plain of Balaclava. The Russians appeared to have the intentions and the means to capture the British base in a much shorter time.|$|E
500|$|The other {{important}} introduction were the mountains. One of Desgrange's staffers, Alphonse Steinès, took Desgrange {{for a trip}} over the Col Bayard at [...] and the Ballon d'Alsace at , that had an average gradient of 5.2% with 10% at some places, to convince Desgrange to use these climbs in the route. Desgrange accepted it, saying that Steinès would take the blame if the mountains would be too hard to climb. In the two previous editions, the highest point was the Col de la République at [...] In 1905, Desgrange chose to overlook this, and focused instead on {{the introduction of the}} Ballon d'Alsace, because he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> missed the opportunity for publicity previously.|$|E

2500|$|I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was {{as large as a}} medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|Trepp {{was born}} on March 4, 1913, in Mainz, Germany. He studied {{philosophy}} and philology at the University of Frankfurt and the University of Berlin and in 1935 received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg. He was ordained by the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in 1936. Trepp recalled having conducted his first seder in 1936 in Oldenburg, {{when he was a}} newly ordained rabbi in Nazi Germany, leading the 15 synagogues in the district. He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a dual role in working [...] "to keep the Jewish community from breaking down, {{while at the same time}} give many fellow believers the possibility to emigrate". As Jews were forbidden to attend public schools, Trepp asked the local Nazi officials if he could form a school in a synagogue in Oldenburg to educate Jewish children together with Aryan students, and was given approval for his plan, along with funding for school supplies and desks, as well as rent for the space that was being used as a school.|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Wen died in 604—a {{death that}} {{traditional}} historians generally believe was a murder ordered by Yang Guang, although they admit {{a lack of}} direct evidence—and Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. [...] In 605, he created Crown Princess Xiao empress. [...] He soon {{turned away from the}} virtuous living style he engaged in to please his parents, and he lived luxuriously, {{with tens of thousands of}} women filling his palaces. [...] He still maintained respect for Empress Xiao, and he made many of her relatives, including her older brother Xiao Cong the Duke of Liang (Western Liang's final emperor) officials in his government. [...] However, Yang Zhao, who became crown prince, died in 606, and Yang Jian lost Emperor Yang's favor in 608 over his use of witchcraft against Yang Zhao's sons. [...] Empress Xiao often accompanied Emperor Yang on his tours around the empire, and she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost his virtues. [...] She wrote a circumspect poem to try to get Emperor Yang to change his ways, but he either did not realize that was her intent, or simply ignored the poem.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} an idolater once asked Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai about the Red Cow, likening its {{procedures}} to witchcraft. Rabban Johanan asked the idolater {{what he had}} seen done for a man possessed by a demon of madness. The idolater explained how in such a case, they would bring roots, make them smoke under the madman, sprinkle water on the man, and the demon would flee. Rabban Johanan told him that the Red Cow dealt similarly with the spirit of uncleanness, as [...] says: [...] "And also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land." [...] Rabban Johanan told him that when they sprinkled the water of purification on the unclean, the spirit of uncleanness fled. But when the idolater had gone, Rabban Johanan's disciples told Rabban Johanan that they <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> put off the idolater with a mere makeshift, and asked him what explanation Rabban Johanan would give them. Rabban Johanan told his disciples that the dead did not defile nor the water purify; God had merely laid down a statute, issued a decree, and commanded that we not transgress the decree, as [...] says: [...] "This is the statute of the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well and gazed upon his reflection in the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose and kissed the nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the Just thought that people made the nazirite vow in a fit of temper, and since they vowed in a fit of temper they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation and his mouth and heart were in agreement.|$|E
