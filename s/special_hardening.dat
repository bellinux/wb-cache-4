50|$|The felt hammers of {{the piano}} tend to harden over time, as the felt becomes {{compressed}} by repeated impact. They also form grooves at the points of contact with the strings. Harder hammers produce a brighter tone quality, which may ultimately become harsh and undesirable. Piano technicians can soften hammers using special tools called voicing needles. They also sometimes use <b>special</b> <b>hardening</b> agents when the hammers are too soft (though this practice is controversial among some technicians). In either case, an important goal is uniform tone quality across the piano, since the hammers are not used with equal frequency and therefore tend to wear unevenly. How much and how forcefully the piano is played {{is a factor in}} how often a piano is voiced, as are the piano's setting and the preferences of its players.|$|E

We should point out that the supply chain of IoT devices may be compromised by attackers.

Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using <b>special</b> <b>hardened</b> high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through.

Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|R

40|$|Each optical {{component}} of the interferometric gravitational wave detector VIRGO is suspended from a cascade of mechanical filters designed to suppress the transmission of seismic vibrations. Each mechanical filter supports {{the weight of the}} filters below it by means of a set of steel cantilever blade springs. The stress from the load acting on the blades was found to induce a drooping of the blade tips of several microns per day due to a series of microscopic yielding events (micro-creep). This process induces a mechanical displacement shot-noise on the optical component which can dominate the small displacements produced by gravitational waves. The use of a <b>special</b> precipitation <b>hardened</b> steel (Maraging C 250), instead of common spring steel, allows the construction of blades that show an acceptable stability under stress.

40|$|A {{railway turnout}} {{is a special}} {{construction}} allowing a ride of a railway vehicle in a given direction. A part of each turnout is a frog (alternatively - crossing), it allows to cross rails and a definitive tracks separation of two different directions. The most suitable material for a production of extremely stressed railway turnouts frogs is austenitic highly alloyed manganese steel - Hadfield steel. This steel, with chemical composition of carbon (1, 2 %), mangan (12 %), silicon (0, 45 %) and austenitic structure, is able to harden its working surface (i. e. to increase its surface hardness) under a sufficient pressure and shock loading because of railway wheels shocks during the train passage through the turnout.

5000|$|Vacuum molding (V-process) is a {{variation}} of the sand casting process for most ferrous and non-ferrous metals, in which unbonded sand is held in the flask with a vacuum. The pattern is specially vented so that a vacuum can be pulled through it. A heat-softened thin sheet (0.003 to 0.008 in) of plastic film is draped over the pattern and a vacuum is drawn (...) [...] A special vacuum forming flask is placed over the plastic pattern and is filled with a free-flowing sand. The sand is vibrated to compact the sand and a sprue and pouring cup are formed in the cope. Another sheet of plastic is placed {{over the top of the}} sand in the flask and a vacuum is drawn through the <b>special</b> flask; this <b>hardens</b> and strengthens the unbonded sand. The vacuum is then released on the pattern and the cope is removed. The drag is made in the same way (without the sprue and pouring cup). Any cores are set in place and the mold is closed. The molten metal is poured while the cope and drag are still under a vacuum, because the plastic vaporizes but the vacuum keeps the shape of the sand while the metal solidifies. When the metal has solidified, the vacuum is turned off and the sand runs out freely, releasing the casting.|$|R
40|$|Micro fillers are {{important}} components in concrete mix in modern concrete technology. It improves workability of concrete mix, allows to achieve cement {{economy and to}} provide <b>special</b> performance of <b>hardened</b> concrete characteristics. The most effective micro fillers have pozzolanic action. Natural pozzolanic admixtures are not available in the most of countries (for example, in Latvia), but commercial products (such as silica fume) are quite expensive. Possibilities for use of local industrial by-products are discussed in this study. One revised direction is recycled bore silicate glass powder obtained from fluorescent lamp utilization. Based on practical experiments it is proved that roughly ground glass powder affects as passive micro-filler, but additionally ground one demonstrates properties of active micro filler which performs long-term hardening effect. Up to 20 % of cement may be replaced by specially prepared glass material, providing the same mechanical strength of concrete and improving durability factor. Other revised direction is concrete sawing waste remaining in pre cast concrete plants. Sawing sludge paste contains 70 % water and 30 % dust concrete particles. Experimental results indicate {{that it is possible}} to find the optimum dosage of sludge, which ensures the required performance characteristics of concrete. The results of research help to select the most effective way to utilize concrete sawing waste, with due account of economical and ecological aspects. Questions of energetic effectiveness of concrete containing recycled micro fillers are discussed, taking into account cement partial replacing by waste material and environmental benefit based on waste rational application. It is proved that recycled micro fillers may be regarded as an instrument for reducing cement content and minimizing carbon dioxide emission. ...|$|R
