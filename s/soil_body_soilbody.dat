The analytical contents include the displacement and acceleration of supporting slope, {{as well as the}} time history responses of the axial forces of anchors. In the establishment of finite element model, the interaction between <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> and supporting structure is considered. The elastic-plastic M-C model with nonlinear static and dynamic behavior is used to simulate the <b>soil</b> <b>body,</b> and the dual linear strengthen model is adopted to simulate the supporting structure, then the interaction between <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> and supporting structure is simulated with contact element. The results show that the composite soil nailing slope supporting structure has better seismic performance than the general soil nailing slope supporting structure. The maximum horizontal displacement of the latter occurs at the slope top, but that of the former occurs at the slope upper. Especially after the imposition of the prestress, the slope displacement under earthquake reduces significantly, and the axial forces of anchors under earthquake enlarge significantly. Moreover, the axial forces of anchors reach maximum values near the slipping surface. The displacement and the acceleration of slope increase along the slope height. The conclusions obtained provide basis for the seismic design of permanent supporting slope and reference for similar projects...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Soils are 3 -dimensional {{bodies that}} make up natural landscapes. In {{addition}} to the morphological properties used to characterize <b>soils,</b> <b>soil</b> <b>bodies</b> also have the properties of size and shape. Soil maps are made {{in an effort to}} provide information on the spatial distribution of different kinds of soils. Soil mappers draw to scale, as accurately as possible, the sizes and shapes of the different kinds of <b>soil</b> <b>bodies</b> they observe in the landscape. Beyond that, however, very little quantitative information relative to size and shape is provided to soil map users. Quantitative shape characterization presents several opportunities to learn about soil genesis and soil interpretations for land use. Intriguing questions include "Why does a <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> have the particular shape it has?", "Does each map unit possess an intrinsic shape or range of shapes?", "Do existing map unit interpretations apply equally to delineations of different size and shape?", "How can shape data for individual delineations be aggregated into an overall description of soil patterns in different geographic areas?", "What effects do soil patterns have on land use?". None of these questions can be answered without first having an appropriate technique for characterizing the shapes of individual delineations. The objective of this research, therefore, was to examine several possible shape indexes and isolate those few which had the greatest utility for characterizing shape. These few were then used to examine shape distributions within a few selected map units and compare shapes between map units. Data were collected by digitizing 452 delineations sampled from 13 different kinds of <b>soil</b> <b>bodies</b> identified in the soil survey of Benton County. For each delineation, 43 potential indexes were calculated. These included primary measurements, such as area and perimeter, and figure attribute ratios such as Horton's form ratio, Miller's circularity index, Schumm's elongation ratio, and Fridland's coefficient of dissection. A convex hull was circumscribed around each delineation, and the same primary measurements and attribute ratios were calculated for the convex hull. Additional indexes were calculated by comparing values determined for a delineation and corresponding values for it's convex hull. One additional technique used was to fit each polygon and convex hull with a 22 -sided vertex lag polygon. Calculation of distances between vertices of this polygon leads to the derivation of a vertex lag index of shape. Variations on the vertex lag theme provided several additional indexes. Correlation analysis showed that the set of 43 indexes was highly intercorrelated. In order to reduce this set to a smaller set of minimally correlated indexes, the entire data set was subjected to a factor analysis. The result was a set of three dominant factors, which together accounted for 86. 1...|$|R

40|$|Two {{anomalous}} phenomena {{were observed}} in a small catchment: 1) In some situations, the water supplied by rain caused a pronounced decrease in the soil water content. 2) In these periods, the soil water movement could be explained only by assuming an irregularly oscillating outflow of soil water into lower horizons. In these situations a large volume of water flows through the soil; therefore on the hydrological scale, this phenomenon forms {{a great part of}} the outflow from a watershed. These phenomena are described in the frame of the instability driven flow theory and explained as consequences of the porous <b>soil</b> <b>body's</b> capacity to become conductive {{as a result of a}} very little change of its moisture. Therefore the soil profile can attenuate or amplify the rainfall pulses during their transformation to the outflow below the soil profile. If the soil water content is lower than the threshold value, the rainfall pulses can be suppressed down to zero. If the soil profile contains more water, the soil does not attenuate the rainfall pulses, it can even amplify them by adding the released soil water. This is the mechanism of rapid growth of rising hydrograph limb during a storm event.
