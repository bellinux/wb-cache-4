25|$|Rorke, who is {{six feet}} four inches, {{has a very}} short run which {{produces}} tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action is subject to criticism. His delivery, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>most,</b> was unusual, and it was {{amazing to me that}} a bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease at the moment of delivery, with a tremendous drag, and it means he delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.|$|E

[...] "Linda and I would get high and Heather would <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> amazing things...I'd think, 'This is André Breton at six years old!'" [...] He adds that he found Linda's relationship with Heather a [...] "very charming aspect of her life with this wonderful child." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Strauss and Howe, the Third Turning is an Unraveling. The mood of {{this era}} {{they say is}} in many ways the {{opposite}} of a High: Institutions are weak and distrusted, while individualism is strong and flourishing. [...] The authors say Highs come after Crises, when society wants to coalesce and build and avoid the death and destruction of the previous crisis. Unravelings come after Awakenings, when society wants to atomize and enjoy. They <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recent Unraveling in the US began in the 1980s and includes the Long Boom and Culture War.|$|E

He was an intellectual phenomenon." [...] Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called {{him one of the}} three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A. J. P. Taylor says, [...] "More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three archeological {{excavations}} {{have been}} conducted at the site, beginning in the 1950s. [...] Experts <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> extensive cultural resources at the site are archeological, both for the 18th and 19th-century settlements, and the earlier Quapaw villages. Due {{to changes in the}} river and navigation measures, the water level has risen closer to the height of the bluffs, which used to be well above the river. The site is now considered low lying. Erosion and construction on the river have resulted in the remains of three of the historic forts being under water in the river channel.|$|E
2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] I like the idea of storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder that we used to get, to people who are just into shoot-em-up action films." [...] Gilliam and McKeown based the character of Tony on former British prime minister Tony Blair, who [...] "would <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> insane things and probably he'd believe them himself".|$|E

"Then {{there is}} the fear that the natives, who are, I must <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> restless {{sleepers}} I ever saw, may in their wanderings up to look at us find that we have gone, before we are fairly beyond reach of pursuit; for one of their great canoes will travel at least two feet to our one.|$|E
60|$|The {{transition}} wasn't {{very clear}} to Benham. His mind had been preoccupied by {{the problem of how}} to open his own large project. Meanwhile Prothero got, as it were, the conversational bit between his teeth and bolted.

60|$|Bells were jangling on the tug as {{it started}} to the rescue. I stole a look up at Captain West. He had walked to the port side of the poop, where, hands in pockets, he was glancing, now for'ard at the {{struggling}} man, now aft at the tug. He gave no orders, betrayed no excitement, and appeared, I may well <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> casual of spectators.|$|E
60|$|Unless one have {{antiquarian}} tastes, {{there is}} little in Elizabethan prose to reward the reader. Strange to <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> tedious {{part of it was}} written by literary men in {{what was supposed to be}} a very fine style; while the small part that still attracts us (such as Bacon's Essays or Hakluyt's Voyages) was mostly written by practical men with no thought for literary effect.|$|E

5000|$|Indeed, {{there is}} much of Trollope in Gotobed's questioning, quarrelsome, and often tactless character.

"I {{think the}} {{explanation}} is," [...] replied the Minor Poet, [...] "that as regards, let us <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> natural business of our life, marriage, our natural instincts alone are brought into play. Marriage--clothe the naked fact in what flowers of rhetoric we will- -has {{to do with}} the purely animal part of our being.

60|$|It was tacitly {{understood}} in the port that John Nieven was a fierce misogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he meant to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> crushing thing he could think of.
