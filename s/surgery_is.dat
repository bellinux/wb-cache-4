5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} used {{first-line}} when pneumothorax occurs {{in people with}} AIDS, usually due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage. Bilateral pneumothorax (pneumothorax on both sides) is relatively common in people with pneumocystis pneumonia, and <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> often required.|$|E
5|$|During the operation, Dr. Nick {{realizes that}} he does not know what to do. Lisa, who is {{watching}} the operation in the amphitheater, uses her knowledge of cardiology to guide Dr. Nick. The <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> successful, and Homer makes a full recovery.|$|E
30|$|An {{emergency}} <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{raised in}} 15 cases and delayed <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> indicated in 3 patients.|$|R
50|$|Cardiac <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{revolutionized}} in the 1948 as open-heart <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> introduced for {{the first}} time since 1925.|$|R
50|$|Location in the 2510 Medical Office Building on the {{hospital}} Campus. The Types of surgeries done at the center are scheduled case NO Emergency <b>surgeries</b> <b>are</b> done in the Center. Emergency <b>surgeries</b> <b>are</b> done at the Main Hospital. Outpatient <b>Surgeries</b> <b>are</b> also done in the main hospital.|$|R
5|$|In {{cases where}} <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> not indicated, palliative {{chemotherapy}} is an option; higher-dose chemotherapy {{is associated with}} longer survival. Palliative chemotherapy, particularly using capecitabine and gemcitabine, is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Lungs can be {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} diseases. Pulmonology is the medical speciality that deals with diseases involving the respiratory tract, and cardiothoracic <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> the surgical field that deals with surgery of the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Neutering or spaying, which {{involves}} removing {{some of the}} reproductive organs, is often carried out {{as a method of}} birth control in household pets. Many animal shelters require these procedures as part of adoption agreements. In large animals the <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> known as castration.|$|E
30|$|Second-stage <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} in the maxilla after 6  months and in the mandible after 3  months. Implant placement and second-stage <b>surgery</b> <b>were</b> performed by a single periodontist (R.M.).|$|R
25|$|Drugs used {{after and}} in {{addition}} to <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> called neoadjuvant therapy. Aspirin may reduce mortality from breast cancer.|$|R
30|$|There was no {{clinical}} or radiographic {{difference between}} the dental implants which stage 2 <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> performed 3  months later and those which stage 2 <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> performed after 4  months of healing.|$|R
5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. <b>Surgery</b> <b>is</b> most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{radiotherapy}} {{are likely to be}} offered to most people, whether or not <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should {{be in the hands of}} a multidisciplinary team including specialists in several aspects of oncology, and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.|$|E
50|$|Many criticized Ren, {{stating that}} the <b>surgery</b> would <b>be</b> impossible. However, Ren remains hopeful that the <b>surgery</b> will <b>be</b> a success, and is {{continuing}} to acquire resources needed to have the <b>surgery</b> <b>be</b> performed.|$|R
40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} vascular <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> {{a high-risk}} population with widespread atherosclerosis, an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and often multiple co-morbidities. Postoperative cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarct (MI), are common. Statins are the medical {{treatment of choice}} to reduce high cholesterol levels. Evidence is accumulating that patients taking statins {{at the time of}} <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> protected against a range of perioperative complications, but the specific benefits for patients undergoing noncardiac vascular <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> not clear...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>surgeries</b> <b>are</b> elective.|$|R
5|$|Coronary artery bypass <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> {{one such}} operation. In this operation, {{one or more}} arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An {{incision}} is {{made over}} the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each {{referred to as a}} flap are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E
50|$|For {{patients}} with strabismus, risks of complications such as diplopia and/or increased strabismus angle {{need to be}} evaluated carefully. In case both refractive surgery and strabismus <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> to be performed, {{it is recommended that}} the refractive <b>surgery</b> <b>be</b> done first.|$|R
25|$|Cataract <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{known to}} the {{physician}} Sushruta (6th century BCE). Traditional cataract <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract {{out of the field}} of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that it should only be used when necessary. The removal of cataract by <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> also introduced into China from India.|$|R
50|$|<b>Surgery</b> <b>was</b> being {{performed}} by 1870.|$|R
5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{exploration}} may {{be necessary}} to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some patients. <b>Surgery</b> <b>is</b> also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{articular}} cartilage's {{capacity for}} repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E
50|$|Robotic surgery, {{computer-assisted}} surgery, and robotically-assisted <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> {{terms for}} technological developments that use robotic systems {{to aid in}} surgical procedures. Robotically-assisted <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> developed to overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally-invasive surgical procedures and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.|$|R
50|$|Complications after {{cataract}} <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> relatively uncommon.|$|R
30|$|The {{pre-operative}} discrepancy {{was recorded}} {{along with the}} mean duration of follow-up and the discrepancy remaining at final follow-up. The site and time taken to perform each <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> recorded, as was the duration of hospital stay. Minor and major complications of each <b>surgery</b> <b>were</b> documented.|$|R
5|$|The problem {{develops}} in puppyhood although often subclinically, {{and there may}} be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. <b>Surgery</b> <b>is</b> recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities {{have been reported in}} the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. <b>Surgery</b> <b>is</b> only used in exceptional cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
40|$|Patients with cardiac disease {{presenting}} for noncardiac <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> {{at increased}} risk of intraoperative complications such as myocardial infarction (MI); cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary insufficiency, and death. It is well established {{that the number of}} patients with cardiac disease presenting for anaesthesia and <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> on the increase...|$|R
40|$|The {{sites of}} ectopic pregnancies {{in women who}} {{underwent}} various types of reconstructive tubal <b>surgery</b> <b>were</b> analysed and compared to the controls. Overall, ectopic pregnancies subsequent to all types of tubal <b>surgeries</b> <b>were</b> more often implanted proximally compared to the control population. Key words: ectopic pregnancy/tubal surger...|$|R
50|$|Word {{came that}} Numminen's heart <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> successful. Completed on September 20, 2007, at the Cleveland Clinic, the <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} {{to repair a}} faulty valve. Numminen was {{able to return to}} action for the final game of the Sabres' 2007-08 season on April 5, 2008.|$|R
