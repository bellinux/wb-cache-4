25|$|Saturation {{temperature}} means boiling point. The {{saturation temperature}} is the temperature for a corresponding <b>saturation</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at which a}} liquid boils into its vapor phase.

25|$|As long as {{this process}} is gradual, the tissue gas loading in the diver will reduce by {{diffusion}} and perfusion until it eventually re-stabilises at the current <b>saturation</b> <b>pressure.</b> The problem arises when the pressure is reduced more quickly than the gas can be removed by this mechanism, {{and the level of}} supersaturation rises sufficiently to become unstable. At this point, bubbles may form and grow in the tissues, and may cause damage either by distending the tissue locally, or blocking small blood vessels, shutting off blood supply to the downstream side, and resulting in hypoxia of those tissues.|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{techniques}} that can be used that differ in terms of whether they fundamentally probe the equilibrium and the temperature range over which they can be applied. The series of homologous, straight-chain dicarboxylic acids have received much attention over the past decade given their atmospheric relevance, commercial availability, and low <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressures,</b> thus making them ideal test compounds. Uncertainties in the solid-state <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressures</b> obtained from individual methodologies are typically on the order of 50 - 100 %, but the differences between <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressures</b> obtained with different methods are approximately 1 - 4 orders of magnitude, with the spread tending to increase as the <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> decreases. Some of the dicarboxylic acids can exist with multiple solid-state structures that have distinct <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressures.</b> Furthermore, the samples on which measurements are performed may actually exist as amorphous subcooled liquids rather than solid crystalline compounds, again with consequences for the measured <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressures,</b> since the subcooled liquid phase will have a higher <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> than the crystalline solid phase. Compounds with equilibrium vapor pressures in this range will exhibit the greatest sensitivities in terms of their gas to particle partitioning to uncertainties in their <b>saturation</b> vapor <b>pressures,</b> with consequent impacts on the ability of explicit and semiexplicit chemical models to simulate secondary organic aerosol formation...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{determine}} the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its <b>saturation</b> <b>pressure.</b> [...] The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula (BET), which gives the specific surface area of the sample. [...] At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample. [...] In mercury porosimetry, the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force. [...] The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. [...] The sample can be solid particles or pores. [...] The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. [...] The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. [...] Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores. The high porosity and surface area of silica aerogels allow them to be used in a variety of environmental filtration applications.|$|E
