5000|$|The bottom board, (Swiss {{board or}} {{occasionally}} beam) {{was not present}} in the early machines, acts as weft in both {{the ground and the}} pattern. This contains the finer threads. If the pattern is complex spools must be used but a beam can be used where the pattern is fairly even. The threads go through a tensioning spring and through holes in the middle guide bar (<b>Swiss</b> <b>bar,</b> fine spool bar).|$|E
5000|$|The {{school has}} no campus and issues degrees based on life {{experiences}} and optional online learning courses. Although the director/founder {{is not a}} member of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Bar</b> or Italian Bar, he introduces himself as an attorney, using the Italian [...] "avv." [...] title. The school issues Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral degrees. Despite being based in Switzerland, the school has Italian landlines and the personnel only speak Italian because the degrees are offered mostly to Italians, as unaccredited universities are illegal in Italy.|$|E

5000|$|Toblerone ( [...] ; German: [...] ) is a <b>Swiss</b> {{chocolate}} <b>bar</b> brand {{owned by}} US confectionery company Mondelēz International, Inc., formerly Kraft Foods, which acquired the product from former owner Jacobs Suchard in 1990. It {{is produced in}} Bern and in early 2000 was being produced in the United States by Ferrara Pan candy company in Bellwood, Illinois. Toblerone {{is well known for}} its distinctive triangular prism shape.|$|R
5000|$|People {{who suffer}} from {{shoulder}} injuries can use a specialised barbell such as the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Bar</b> or Football Bar {{that allows them to}} press with their hands in a position that places less stress on the shoulder. Another variation is the Hex Press in which two dumbbells are squeezed against each other, with the palms facing inwards. This puts the strain of the exercise on the triceps and inner chest rather than the shoulders. The Floor Press is another variation that puts less strain on the lifter's shoulders, due to the shorter range of motion.|$|E

50|$|Simmons {{claims that}} he {{developed}} and invented Special barbell exercises {{that are used to}} target weaknesses in the competition lifts. Upper- and lower-body special exercises are rotated frequently (at least every 3 weeks) on the principle that training the same special exercise for too long will be counterproductive. The training system emphasizes the variety of special exercises. Different lifts can be performed, for example the good-morning instead of the squat. Competition lifts can be altered by increasing or decreasing the range of motion, e.g., squatting to a low or high box, performing partial range-of-motion bench presses, using wooden boards to shorten the stroke, or deadlifting from blocks or pins in a power cage. The conventional barbell can be replaced with specialty bars such as a cambered bar, safety squat bar, or <b>Swiss</b> <b>bar.</b> 'Accommodating' resistance, via equipment such as chains and bands, is also used.|$|E
50|$|Richardson's lithophone {{initially}} featured 61 tuned {{and shaped}} hornfels rocks. It was later enhanced with steel <b>bars,</b> <b>Swiss</b> bells {{and various other}} percussions, and survives to this day, being {{on display at the}} Keswick Museum and Art Gallery.|$|R
50|$|Its attractions {{throughout}} the year include German and <b>Swiss</b> cuisine restaurants, <b>bars,</b> and a cable car. There are many pousadas (inns) and chalets. Also, in order to cater to {{the large number of}} visitors, several bars, lounges, discos and clubs open during the winter months.|$|R
50|$|This is {{typically}} illustrated in two ways. In a valuation paradigm, people {{will tend to}} pay more to retain something they own than to obtain something they do not own—even {{when there is no}} cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a <b>Swiss</b> chocolate <b>bar</b> were generally unwilling to trade it for a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling to trade it for the chocolate bar.|$|R
50|$|Commemorating {{the event}} are a {{bas-relief}} of the Battle of Marignano by Pierre Bontemps, which decorates Francis I's tomb at Saint-Denis; {{a painting by}} Antoine Caron for Fontainebleau (now at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa); and the most famous musical composition of Clément Janequin, the chanson La guerre. The <b>Swiss</b> hero Hans <b>Bär</b> appears in a fresco on the tower of the Basel City Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Customers order their pita {{based on}} the main {{ingredient}} (offerings include Philly cheesesteak, falafel and chicken souvlaki, {{with the exception of}} their [...] "garden pita") and then the customer specifies the other ingredients they would like to be added from selection of cheeses, (offerings include feta, cheddar, and <b>Swiss),</b> a salad <b>bar</b> (offerings include alfalfa sprouts, jalapeño, and pineapple), and a selection of sauces and spreads (including tzatziki, Caesar salad dressing, and honey mustard).|$|R
5000|$|Giger applied his biomechanical {{style to}} {{interior}} design. One [...] "Giger Bar" [...] appeared in Tokyo, but {{the realization of}} his designs was a great disappointment to him, since the Japanese organization behind the venture did not wait for his final designs, and instead used Giger's rough preliminary sketches. For that reason Giger disowned the Tokyo bar. The two Giger Bars in his native Switzerland, in Gruyères and Chur, were built under Giger's close supervision and they accurately reflect his original concepts. At The Limelight in Manhattan, Giger's artwork was licensed to decorate the VIP room, the uppermost chapel of the landmarked church, {{but it was never}} intended to be a permanent installation and bore no similarity to the bars in Switzerland. The arrangement was terminated after two years when the Limelight closed. As of 2009 only the two authentic <b>Swiss</b> Giger <b>Bars</b> remain.|$|R
