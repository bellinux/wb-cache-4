When the piston {{reached the top of}} the cylinder, the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder.|$|E

2500|$|Barring gear (or [...] "turning gear") is the {{mechanism}} provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft {{at a very}} low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is [...] "tripped" [...] (i.e., the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, {{there is a tendency}} for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in {{the top half of the}} casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches.|$|E
2500|$|An {{auxiliary}} {{oil system}} pump {{is used to}} supply oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator.

50|$|<b>Inlet</b> <b>steam</b> was {{supplied}} {{to the top}} of the piston rod trunk through distinctive domed caps. If the engine was intended for a fixed cutoff, the <b>inlet</b> <b>steam</b> was controlled solely by the valve and trunk. Where variable cutoff was to be used, this was achieved very simply by a rotating collar with angled ports that overlapped the ports in the trunk and so controlled their timing.|$|R
50|$|Most {{nuclear power}} plants {{do not have an}} economizer. However, the Combustion Engineering System 80+ nuclear plant design and its {{evolutionary}} successors, (e.g. Korea Electric Power Corporation's APR-1400) incorporate an integral feedwater economizer. This economizer preheats the steam generator feedwater at the <b>steam</b> generator <b>inlet</b> using the lowest-temperature primary coolant.|$|R
50|$|The {{constant}} c {{also depends}} on the cylinder dimensions and the time at which the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valves are open; if the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valves are closed immediately after obtaining full cylinder pressure the piston force {{can be expected to}} have dropped to less than half the initial force. giving a low c value.

40|$|A high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is under development by the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Its design emphasizes electrical power production which may potentially be coupled with process heat for hydrogen production and other industrial applications. NGNP {{is considering a}} helical-coil steam generator for the primary heat transport loop heat exchanger based on its increased heat transfer and compactness {{when compared to other}} steam generators. The safety and reliability of the helical-coil steam generator is currently under evaluation as part of the development of NGNP. Transients, such as loss of coolant accidents (LOCA), are of interest in evaluating the safety of steam generators. In this study, a complete <b>steam</b> generator <b>inlet</b> pipe break (double ended pipe break) LOCA was simulated by an exponential loss of primary side pressure. For this analysis, a model of the helical-coil steam generator was developed using RELAP 5 - 3 D, an INL in-house systems analysis code. The steam generator model behaved normally during the transient simulating the complete <b>steam</b> generator <b>inlet</b> pipe break LOCA. Further analysis is required to comprehensively evaluate the safety and reliability of the helical-coil steam generator design in the NGNP setting...|$|R
50|$|The {{centrifugal}} governor, {{which had}} first {{been used by}} Watt to maintain constant speed, worked by throttling the <b>inlet</b> <b>steam,</b> which lowered the pressure, resulting {{in a loss of}} efficiency on the high (above atmospheric) pressure engines. Later control methods reduced or eliminated this pressure loss.|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of an oxidizing agent, such as O 2 {{in the case of}} oxy-reforming and steam in the case of bi-reforming, significantly reduces the deactivation compared to dry-reforming. <b>Steam</b> in the <b>inlet</b> (i.e., in bi-reforming) appears to oxidize carbon or its precursors, with no measurable deactivation over a 24 -h period.|$|R
50|$|To use the {{cylinders}} as pumps necessitates complete {{reversal of the}} normal gas flow. Atmospheric air is drawn through the steam exhaust and compressed air ejected through the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet.</b> A separate chimney is provided, usually behind the main chimney, to exhaust the compressed air without increasing flow through the smokebox (which would cause increased draught of the fire).|$|E
5000|$|Electricity is {{produced}} using a MAN Diesel & Turbo MARC-R high-pressure steam turbine. The MARC-R is an interim heating turbine with two casings constructed {{out of a}} MARC-2 backpressure turbine and a MARC-6 condenser turbine, the MARC-R forms part of the MARC, short for Modular Arrangement Concept. The MARC-2 turbine operates in the 4-10 MW power range and accepts up to , [...] max <b>steam</b> <b>inlet.</b> The MARC-6 turbine operates in the15-40 MW power range and accepts up to , [...] max <b>steam</b> <b>inlet.</b> The back pressure turbine discharges the steam into a pressurized piping system {{to be used for}} process heating elsewhere or as the supply to other turbines.

The condenser turbine has is discharge connected to a surface condenser to extend the range of pressure drop through the turbine to extract more power. The discharge pressure is a vacuum.The MARC-R group at full load efficiency is 37%.|$|E
50|$|The B X {{steam engines}} of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn) were express train {{locomotives}} in Bavaria. The vehicles had an inside locomotive frame, the cylinders lay behind the carrying axle and the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> pipes ran {{in front of}} the boiler. Twelve locomotives were delivered with compound engines; two with simple, two-cylinder engines. The latter were converted to compound working in 1896 however.|$|E

30|$|For smaller mass {{flows of}} {{generated}} steam, the cycle with a BPT features the highest efficiency. This type of solution might, however, entail higher investment expenditures due to very high {{parameters of the}} <b>inlet</b> <b>steam</b> (reheated steam).

50|$|A typical {{generator}} produces around 10,000 lb/hour {{at around}} 120 psi, using <b>inlet</b> <b>steam</b> supplied at 600 psi. They are constructed as a cylindrical steel pressure vessel, either horizontal or vertical, containing {{a series of}} heating coils. There is a strong resemblance {{to the design of}} evaporators, although steam generators can be rather simpler as they use treated feedwater, rather than scale-producing seawater.|$|R
50|$|It was {{usual for}} {{expansion}} valves to be fitted {{only to the}} HP (high-pressure) cylinder. Steam supplied to the following LP (low-pressure) cylinder has already been supplied to the engine, so there is little benefit to conserving it. Any early cut-off of the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> to a LP cylinder may also represent throttling the exhaust of the preceding HP cylinder, {{and a reduction in}} the efficiency of that cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pressurized}} <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valve and {{low-pressure steam}} exhaust valves are opened. Pressurized steam from the boiler enters the top {{part of the}} cylinder above the piston, pushing it down, and the steam below the piston is drawn into the condenser, creating a vacuum below the piston. The pressure difference between the steam at boiler pressure above the piston and the vacuum below it drives the piston down.|$|E
50|$|Cataracts {{were also}} used as an {{over-speed}} safety device for direct-acting water pumps. A seesaw or 'differential' lever was placed between the pump's piston rod and a cataract adjusted for the pump's normal working speed. If the pump suddenly accelerated, owing to the pump bursting or similar, the piston would overtake the cataract and {{the action of the}} differential lever would then close the pump's <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valve and stop the pump, limiting possible damage.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} point to note {{here is that}} the <b>inlet</b> <b>steam</b> velocities to each stage of moving blades are essentially equal. It is because the velocity corresponds to the lowering of the pressure. Since, in a pressure compounded steam turbine only a part of the steam is expanded in each nozzle, the steam velocity is lower than of the previous case. It can be explained mathematically from the following formula i.e.|$|R
5000|$|Giuseppe Belluzzo of Italy {{designed}} {{a number of}} experimental turbine locomotives. [...] None were ever tested on main lines. His first was a small locomotive with four wheels, each fitted with its own small turbine. Reverse movement was accomplished by feeding steam into the turbines via a backwards-facing <b>inlet.</b> <b>Steam</b> turbines are designed to rotate in only one direction, making this method very inefficient. No one else appears to have attempted it.|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of the steam-water two-phase injector is presented. This model offers a method of estimating critical conditions of steam {{at the site of}} the motive nozzle throat, based on the local sound velocity in that area. Fluid thermal properties were based on a real fluid approach, where the CoolProp database was used. A different method was adopted to formulate governing equations for all passages of the injector based on the principles of the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The pressure profiles of the injector at different <b>inlet</b> <b>steam</b> pressure and <b>inlet</b> water pressure were used to validate the proposed model; they agreed well, with a maximum relative rate of error within 9. 5 ％. Based on the validated model, the influence of different area ratios and coefficients of the diverse sections on the performance of an injector used in district heating was investigated. The main <b>inlet</b> parameters - <b>steam</b> pressure and water pressure - were within the range of 0. 20 ‒ 0. 60 MPa and 0. 14 ‒ 0. 49 MPa. The exergy destruction rate for every steam-water injector component was also computed. The results illustrated that the injector discharge pressure increases with the throat area ratio of the motive nozzle and mixing chamber. The isentropic efficiency coefficients of the converging section and diverging section of motive nozzle affects the entrainment ratio and compression ratio differently. The main irreversibility occurs in steam nozzle (41. 34 %) and mixing chamber (57. 95 %). The exergy efficiency of the injector decreases with the increase of mass entrainment ratio. It also increases in coordination with the increase of <b>inlet</b> <b>steam</b> pressures, and decreases with the increase of inlet water pressures...|$|R

50|$|In {{steam engines}} and {{internal}} combustion engines, valves {{are required to}} allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle. These are worked by cams, eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the D slide valve but this has been largely superseded by Piston valve or Poppet valve designs. In steam engines {{the point in the}} piston cycle at which the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valve closes is called the cutoff and this can often be controlled to adjust the torque supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an oscillating cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The {{main steam}} {{cylinders}} {{were also used}} as brakes on the rack section. During descents, the 32 Tonner would be put into reverse with the steam regulator closed and a three-way valve in the exhaust pipe under the smokebox would be closed when brake power was required.

The air would enter the cylinders though the exhaust ports and therefore reversed operations in the cylinders. Used air would be exhausted through the <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> ports back into the steam pipe, from where it was led {{to the rear of}} the engine by a 1+1/2 in branch pipe.

50|$|Designed {{and built}} by the English Electric Co., four steam turbine units of high pressure, {{intermediate}} pressure and double-flow low pressure turbine cylinders were coupled to 250 MW generators. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled <b>steam</b> <b>inlet</b> valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000 RPM. The turbine over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine shaft, set to throw-out at a predetermined RPM and shutting the HP cylinder inlet steam valves. Exhaust flow from the HP turbine cylinders passed to the boiler for reheating (with some having been bled off to feed heaters), returned to the IP cylinder (with some bled off to LP feed heaters) and exhausted from the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house.
