5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E

(2) What are the different processes that contribute to the overall dephasing rate? (3) Are the approximations made in describing dephasing in <b>solids</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquids</b> reasonable ?

40|$|AbstractSeparation of <b>solids</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquids</b> {{from water}} is an actual {{problem in the}} water waste, chemical, oil, and food {{processing}} industries. The purpose of water treatment facilities is to purify water which contains minimal amounts of <b>solids</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquids</b> <b>and</b> {{at the same time}} this technology should allow to process large amounts of water and be energy-efficient. That is why a new type of counter flow decanter centrifuge was constructed and appropriate experiments on prototype production were carried out to optimize machining parameters.

25|$|Cold field {{electron}} emission (CFE) {{is the name}} given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter Fermi level.

Many <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the usage}} of {{dedicated}} pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650°C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.|$|E
25|$|The Weizsäcker {{model was}} {{modified}} in 1948 by Dutch theoretical physicist Dirk Ter Haar, in that regular eddies were discarded {{and replaced by}} random turbulence which {{would lead to a}} very thick nebula where gravitational instability would not occur. He concluded the planets must have formed by accretion and explained the compositional difference (<b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> planets) as due to the temperature difference between the inner and outer regions, the former being hotter and the latter being cooler, so only refractories (non-volatiles) condensed in the inner region. A major difficulty is that in this supposition turbulent dissipation takes place in a time scale of only about a millennium which does not give enough time for planets to form.|$|E

As a research centre Waltham Abbey was responsible for military propellant and high explosives and expanded into the increasingly significant field of rocket propellants, <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> {{and a range of}} specialised applications, e.g. 'snifters' for altering space vehicles direction when in flight, cartridges for firing aircraft ejector seats, engine and generator starter cartridges - these applications have been called 'a measured strong shove'.

As previously observed in <b>solids</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquids</b> metals, to a good approximation, in the absence of phase transitions, plots of the logarithms of the reduced pressure function, of the reduced sound velocity, and of the reduced bulk modulus, are all linear functions of 1 - X over the entire experimental pressure range.

25|$|Distinct phases {{may also}} exist {{within a given}} state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> states. Phases may also be {{differentiated}} based on solubility as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low solubility (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is {{the maximum amount of}} a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form alloys, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.|$|E
25|$|Normal flatus {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> intra-lumenal contents.|$|E
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquid.</b> Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E
