30|$|Wandering liver is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a rare development, resulting from a <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> in the hepatic suspensory apparatus, in which the liver is free to displace along the transverse axis around the inferior vena cava. Both congenital and—more commonly—acquired forms of wandering liver have been described [1]. This anomaly is thought to arise {{in conjunction with a}} persistent ventral mesentery, which may incite a volvulus of the stomach and bowel [2]. In this report, we describe the first known presentation of a wandering liver and intestinal malrotation in an adult resulting in acute midgut volvulus.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of second-trimester ultrasound markers on the incidence of Down syndrome among pregnant women of advanced maternal age. This was a retrospective cohort study on 889 singleton pregnancies between the 14 th and 30 th weeks, with maternal age ≥ 35 years, which would undergo genetic amniocentesis. The second-trimester ultrasound assessed the following markers: increased nuchal fold thickness, cardiac hyperechogenic focus, mild ventriculomegaly, choroid plexus cysts, uni- or bilateral renal pyelectasis, intestinal hyperechogenicity, single umbilical artery, short femur and humerus length, hand/foot alterations, structural fetal malformation, and congenital heart disease. To investigate differences between the groups with and without markers, nonparametric tests consisting of the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were used. Moreover, odds ratios with their respective 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Out of the 889 pregnant women, 131 (17. 3 %) presented markers and 758 (82. 7 %) did not present markers on the second-trimester ultrasound. Increased nuchal fold (P< 0. 001) and <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> (P< 0. 001) were the markers most associated with Down syndrome. The presence of one marker increased the relative risk 10. 5 -fold, while the presence of two or more markers increased the risk 13. 5 -fold. The presence of markers on the second-trimester ultrasound, especially thickened nuchal fold and <b>structural</b> <b>malformation,</b> increased the risk of Down syndrome among pregnant women with advanced maternal age...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCongenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) is a {{relatively}} common congenital deformity, affecting about 1 to 3 per thousand live births, generally idiopathic but sometimes associating different conditions: chromosomal anomalies, neuromuscular or urological diseases. Nowadays, the diagnosis is made prenatally, by having a detailed fetal ultrasound scan. The standard care of this condition is a non-surgical treatment according to Ponseti method; it can be initiated soon after birth and consist in manipulation of the foot and application of plaster casts, once a week, for about 4 to 6 weeks, followed by Achilles tendon tenotomy and a final cast for 3 weeks; after that, the corrected position must be maintained by applying a brace (boots connected by a bar) the child must wear inconstantly during the day, but until 4 - 5 years of age. The major benefit of prenatal diagnose {{is related to the}} family counseling, as long as having a baby with this kind of <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> will generate a spectrum of emotions to the parents and relatives; having the opportunity to prenatally present the baby's condition to the parents and discuss a treatment which is highly effective and non-invasive is very important in terms of increasing parental confidence and gaining their cooperation; those aspects are important both for psychologically reasons, preparing the family to have a baby with a visible <b>structural</b> <b>malformation,</b> but also to accept an excellent but demanding treatment, and obtaining active involvement of the family in the children's treatment: getting them prepared for seeing the baby's leg/legs in plaster casts, several visits to the clinic, limitation in the family life during the treatment and more important transferring them the responsibility of the home treatment (the compliance to the bracing protocol {{in order to maintain the}} correction) ...|$|E

40|$|It is now axiomatic in {{experimental}} teratology that embryos are maximally {{susceptible to the}} induction of <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> {{in the period of}} early organogenesis (Beck & Lloyd, 1965; Wilson, 1965). It is, perhaps, less widely appreciated that in mammals this susceptible period coincides with a time, after implantation but before the establishment of an embryonic circulation, when the importance of embryotrophic nutrition is at its height. Many teratogens therefore do their damage before there is a functional chorioallantoic placenta. This may be a partial answer to those who consider that the variations in placentation between mammals invalidate any extrapolation to the human of teratogenic data obtained in lower animals. The present report describes experiments from which we conclude that at least one teratogen acts by perverting embryotrophic nutrition, and suggests that the general mechanism involved in this one case, although possibly not its details, may be more widely applicable.

40|$|The {{surgical}} {{repair of}} complex congenital heart defects frequently requires additional tissue in various forms, such as patches, conduits, and valves. These devices often require replacement over a patient’s lifetime because of degeneration, calcification, {{or lack of}} growth.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{predictors of}} spontaneous fetal death and preterm delivery in twin pregnancies with one fetus {{affected by a}} major <b>structural</b> <b>malformation.</b> Study design: Retrospective study (1999 - 2012) conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital involving 51 twin pregnancies (dichorionic = 31, monochorionic diamniotic = 15, monochorionic monoamniotic = 4, not established = 1) with a major fetal abnormality, enrolled before 26 weeks and managed expectantly. Primary outcomes: spontaneous fetal death, and/or delivery before 32 weeks. Prediction was examined with stepwise logistic regression analysis, and independent variables included: maternal age, gestational age at diagnosis, chorionicity, fetal gender, number and type of fetal abnormalities. Significance level was set at 0. 15. Results: Fetal abnormalities were diagnosed at a mean gestation of 21. 5 3. 7 weeks: cardiac abnormalities were observed in 31. 4 % of abnormal fetuses, abdominal wall defects in 29. 4 %, central nervous system 21. 5 %, spine 17. 6 %, effusions 17. 6 %, noncardiac thoracic abnormalities 15. 7 %, genital and urinary system 13. 7 %, limbs and soft tissue 3. 9 %, intestinal 1. 9 % and facial defects 1. 9 %. Fetal death occurred in 15 (29. 4 %) abnormal fetuses and was significantly correlated {{with the number of}} fetal malformations (p = 0. 02, OR = 2. 54, 95 % CI = 1. 14 - 5. 62), presence of effusion/hydrops (p = 0. 06, OR = 4. 7, 95 % CI = 0. 95 - 24) and monochorionic placenta (p = 0. 11, OR= 2. 8, 95 % CI = 0. 78 - 9. 8). Normal co-twin fetal death occurred in four cases (7. 8 %) and was related to monochorionic pregnancies (p = 0. 14, OR = 5. 8, 95 % CI = 0. 56 - 61). Delivery before 32 weeks was observed in 14 (27. 5 %) pregnancies and was related to presence of effusion/ hydrops (p = 0. 04, OR = 5. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 07 - 28).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the perinatal results for neonates with {{congenital diaphragmatic hernia}} diagnosed prenatally. METHOD: We reviewed data from 38 cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia diagnosed prenatally from January 1995 to December 2003 in the Fetal Medicine Unit of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, São Paulo University Medical School. The main data analyzed were gestational age at diagnosis, fetal karyotyping, side of diaphragmatic defect, presence of associated <b>structural</b> <b>malformations,</b> hepatic herniation, and severe mediastinal shift. Perinatal outcomes were obtained by reviewing hospital documents or by directly calling the patients' immediate relatives. RESULTS: Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (range, 16 - 37 weeks). Thirty (79 %) cases had a left diaphragmatic defect and 8 (21 %) had a right lesion. Associated <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> were observed in 21 (55 %) cases, in which 12 fetuses had a normal karyotype and 9 had chromosomal abnormalities. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia was confirmed in 17 (45 %) cases. The overall perinatal mortality rate was 92 %. Rates of fetal deaths, early neonatal deaths, late neonatal deaths, and survival were 42 %, 50 %, 0 %, and 8 %, respectively, in cases with associated <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> but normal karyotyping; 56 %, 44 %, 0 %, and 0 % for cases with chromosomal abnormalities; and, 0 %, 76 %, 12 %, and 12 % in cases with isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The neonatal mortality rate was 89 % in cases with isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia. CONCLUSION: Perinatal mortality was very high in prenatally diagnosed cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Earlier perinatal deaths {{are associated with the}} presence of other structural defects or chromosomal abnormalities. In cases of isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia, mortality is related to the presence of herniated liver, right-sided lesion, and major mediastinal shift...|$|R

Background Human <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> (anomalies, or birth defects) have a broad and complex range of manifestations and severities. The description of these findings can be challenging because the variation of the features is continuous and only some of them can be objectively assessed (that is, measured). Additionally, different specialties (embryologists, developmental biologists, surgeons, clinical geneticists, and so on) have developed descriptors for these findings that are based either on mechanistic, etiologic, or management considerations, and are thus laden with meaning, which can be invalidated by changing knowledge. Some terms have disparate definitions even within a specialty. Finally, a number of terms previously in common clinical use were disparaging (mongoloid slant, arachnodactyly, devil ear, and so on) and needed to be replaced with more neutral terms. The need to develop such a set of terms is driven by the ever-increasing throughput of biological methods, which are outstripping the ability of clinical analyses to properly phenotype patients for both research and clinical care.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{observed}} a complex atlas (C 1) dysmorphism {{in a human}} medieval skeleton dug up from the sixth to the seventh century necropolis located in the north-eastern Italy. We analyzed such a dysmorphism {{in the light of}} pertinent literature and discussed the functional and clinical implications related to this type of C 1 <b>structural</b> <b>malformation.</b> METHODS: Macroscopical and CT-SCAN examinations of the atlas were carried out. RESULTS: Bone findings consisted of partial aplasia of the posterior arch of the C 1 accompanied by a bilateral arcuate foramen. In addition, the spinous processes of C 7 and T 1 were found to be bifid. CONCLUSIONS: Although such abnormalities are supposed to be clinically inconspicuous, yet they may become challenging or even dangerous in the context of trauma. They may even complicate specific diagnostic or surgical procedures. In addition, they may cause a great number of symptoms, ranging from headache and neck pain to loss of postural muscle tone and consciousness, due to the close and complex relationship of bone structures with nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and ligaments.

40|$|International audienceHoloprosencephaly (HPE) is {{the most}} common <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> of the {{developing}} forebrain in humans and is typically characterized by different degrees of hemispheric separation that are often accompanied by similarly variable degrees of craniofacial and midline anomalies. HPE {{is a classic example of}} a complex genetic trait with "pseudo"-autosomal dominant transmission showing incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical suspicion of HPE is typically based upon compatible craniofacial findings, the presence of developmental delay or seizures, or specific endocrinological abnormalities, and is then followed up by confirmation with brain imaging. Once a clinical diagnosis is made, a thorough genetic evaluation is necessary. This usually includes analysis of chromosomes by high-resolution karyotyping, clinical assessment to rule-out well recognized syndromes that are associated with HPE (e. g., Pallister-Hall syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and others), and molecular studies of the most common HPE associated genes (e. g., SHH, ZIC 2 and SIX 3). In this review, we provide current step-by-step recommendations that are medically indicated for the genetic evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed HPE.

Employing a variety of approaches epidemiology can develop or test hypotheses concerning possible causes or through surveillance provide data useful for a variety of purposes. Drawing heavily upon our experiences at the Center for Disease Control, this paper reviews some concepts and uses of epidemiology in studies of human teratogenesis. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of disease among populations. It is the study of the causes and manifestations of disease and of their associations. This paper focuses on the use of epidemiology to study human <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> and their environmental determinants. Epidemiologic studies of malformations may be classified as descriptive or analytic. In descriptive studies, malformation cases are characterized according to frequency, race, sex, or other variables related to their occurrence; in analytic studies their associations with possible environmental determinants are defined and tested. Another part of the epidemiology of malformations is surveillance, the routine collection, analysis, and reporting of data. Some concepts should be kept in mind when considering epidemiologic studies of malformations and teratogenesis. First, <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> are only one of several pregnancy outcomes influenced by environmental determinants.

To determine a minimum prevalence of deletions within chromosome band 22 q 11 in infants in the general population.  METHODS—Chromosome analysis was performed on samples from infants born in the former UK Northern Health Region in 1994 and 1995 who either had significant heart disease or who were suspected to have a chromosome band 22 q 11 deletion following referral to the Northern Genetics Service. Significant heart disease was defined as major <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> or cases where invasive investigation or intervention was required in infancy.  RESULTS—Chromosome band 22 q 11 deletions were identified in nine infants in a population of 69 129 livebirths, giving a minimum prevalence of 13 per 100 000 (95 % confidence interval 4. 5 to 21. 5). Six cases had significant heart disease, one of whom died before diagnosis.

40|$|Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is {{the most}} common <b>structural</b> <b>malformation</b> of the {{developing}} forebrain. At birth, nearly 50 % of children with HPE have cytogenetic anomalies. Approximately 20 % of infants with normal chromosomes have sequence mutations in one of the four main HPE genes (SHH, ZIC 2, SIX 3, and TGIF). The other non‐syndromic forms of HPE may be due to environmental factors or mutations in other genes, or potentially due to submicroscopic deletions of HPE genes. We used two complementary assays to test for HPE associated submicroscopic deletions. Firstly, we developed a multicolour fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) assay using probes for the four major HPE genes and for two candidate genes (DISP 1 and FOXA 2). We analysed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from 103 patients who had CNS findings of HPE, normal karyotypes, and no point mutations, and found seven microdeletions. We subsequently applied quantitative PCR to 424 HPE DNA samples, including the 103 samples studied by FISH: 339 with CNS findings of HPE, and 85 with normal CNS and characteristic HPE facial findings. Microdeletions for either SHH, ZIC 2, SIX 3, or TGIF were found in 16 of the 339 severe HPE cases (that is, with CNS findings; 4. 7 %). In contrast, no microdeletion was found in the 85 patients at the mildest end of the HPE spectrum. Based on our data, microdeletion testing should be considered as part of an evaluation of holoprosencephaly, especially in severe HPE cases...|$|E

METHOD: The patients underwent neuroimaging investigation, psychological assessment using the Weschler Intelligence Scales, and specific speech-language evaluation. The following tests were used for the assessment of vocabulary, phonology, syntax, pragmatics, reading and writing: Thematical Pictures of Yavas, ABFW-Child Language Test, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and other specific protocols. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed perisylvian polymicrogyria in all of the subjects, with varied locations and extensions. Speech-language assessment indicated significant oral and written language deficits in all of the subjects. CONCLUSION: The obtained data indicate that language impairment can co-exist with reading deficits in members of the same family. Neuroimaging findings reveal cortical alterations that are associated to specific language impairments within the spectrum of the Perisylvian Syndrome. Another important aspect evidenced by this study is the similarities in the language profiles of siblings and mother, suggesting that a variety of linguistic manifestations exist within the spectrum of the syndrome. Perisylvian polymicrogyria {{can be one of the}} neurobiological malformations involved in the manifestation of these deficits...|$|E
40|$|Objective Hypotonia is {{a common}} {{clinical}} entity well recognized in pediatric age group, which demands experienced clinical assessment and an extensive array of investigations to establish the underlying disease process. Neuroimaging comes as great help in diagnosing the disease process in rare cases of central hypotonia due to <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> of brain and metabolic disorders and should always be included as an important investigation {{in the assessment of}} a floppy child. In this article, we discuss the MRI features of eight cases of central and two cases of combined hypotonia and the importance of neuroimaging in understanding the underlying disease in a hypotonic child...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) is the disease of <b>structural</b> <b>malformations</b> in the kidney and/or urinary tract containing vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). These anomalies can cause pediatric chronic kidney disease. However, {{the pathogenesis of}} CAKUT is not well understood, because identifying the genetic architecture of CAKUT is difficult due to the phenotypic heterogeneity and multifactorial genetic penetrance. We describe the current genetic basis and mechanisms of CAKUT including VUR via approaching the steps and signaling pathways of kidney developmental processes. We also focus on the newly developed strategies and challenges to fully address {{the role of the}} associated genes in the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|R
30|$|The {{vertebral}} column and spinal cord develop early in gestation in a fine-tuned, sequential manner [1]. Any disruption of this normal {{sequence of events}} can lead to variations in the structural anatomy of the spine and spinal cord [2]. <b>Structural</b> <b>malformations</b> of the spine are often simple and may either go undetected or be discovered fortuitously. Occasionally, these may be complex with serious structural or neurological implications [2, 3]. These may occur sporadically, in isolation or as an accompaniment to multiorgan developmental malformations [4]. When symptomatic, these abnormalities can predispose the affected individual to biomechanical instability, spinal canal narrowing and myelopathy and can even be life-threatening. Developmental defects of cardiovascular, neurological, urinary and reproductive systems may be associated [5].|$|R
