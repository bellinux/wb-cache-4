5|$|Despite {{being set}} in Yorkshire, the {{majority}} of location filming was moved to Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway station {{and the surrounding area}} in North Yorkshire were used. The location shooting of the film began on 18 August 1986, at St. Mary's church in Radnage. Filming was periodically hindered by inclement weather – the perfect <b>summer</b> <b>in</b> which the book was set was not forthcoming, and scenes were filmed during breaks in heavy rain. Interiors were shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{months were}} spent {{scouting}} locations, including Ireland, China and Argentina, before New Zealand, Prague, Slovenia and Poland were chosen. Whereas the previous film was predominantly shot in New Zealand {{with a few}} months of filming in Central Europe, Adamson decided New Zealand lacked enough sound stages to accommodate the larger scale of the film. The decision to film most of the picture in Europe also allowed the ability to shoot during <b>summer</b> <b>in</b> both continents, although the weather turned out to be so erratic during filming that Adamson joked he had been lied to.|$|E

Harvey compiled 197 runs at 19.70 in five Tests with two half centuries. It was by far his most unproductive <b>summer</b> <b>in</b> England, with 976 runs at 31.48.

5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil.

5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty.
