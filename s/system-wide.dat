5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was completed}} in 1923, construction having been started {{under the auspices of}} the Great Northern Railway (GNR). It was built as an A1, initially carrying the GNR number 1472, because the LNER had not yet decided on a <b>system-wide</b> numbering scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} {{count in}} 2016 for {{the station was}} 19,257,879, making it the 12th busiest station <b>system-wide,</b> and the busiest station outside of Manhattan. This amounted {{to an average of}} 60,259	passengers per weekday.|$|E
5|$|In July {{an attempt}} by Representative (and future Vice President) Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to impose a one-year {{moratorium}} on the proposed <b>system-wide</b> cuts failed 214-197. In the end the Senate approved a smaller cutback, citing a 24% spike in Amtrak ridership after an oil shock during the summer, but the North Coast Hiawatha remained on the chopping block. In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single <b>system-wide</b> setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Swift's Blue Line runs at a headway of 12 {{minutes from}} 6:00a.m. to 7:00pm on weekdays, {{its highest level}} of service with five buses per hour per direction. Weekday service begins with a headway of 20 minutes from 5:00a.m. to 6:00am, and ends with the same {{frequency}} during the evening from 7:00p.m. to 10:00pm. During Saturdays, buses run every 20 minutes from 6:00a.m. to 10:00pm. Sunday service, which was suspended from 2010 until 2015, runs from 7:00a.m. to 8:20pm every 20 minutes. The Blue Line initially ran at a 10-minute headway, and had evening service end at midnight, until a major <b>system-wide</b> service reduction in February 2012 reduced its weekday headway to the current 12 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} {{extensions}} of the Piccadilly line to Uxbridge, Hounslow and Cockfosters followed in 1933. On the Metropolitan Railway, Ashfield and Pick instigated a rationalisation of services. The barely used and loss-making Brill and Verney Junction branches beyond Aylesbury were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of government-backed loans to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Ashfield and Pick to promote <b>system-wide</b> improvements under the New Works Programme for 1935–1940, including {{the transfer of the}} Metropolitan line's Stanmore services to the Bakerloo line in 1939, the Northern line's Northern Heights project and extension of the Central line to Ongar and Denham.|$|E
5|$|With the {{majority}} of London's transport operations now {{under the control of}} a single organisation, Pick was able to commence the next round of improvements. On the Metropolitan Railway (renamed the Metropolitan line), Pick and Ashfield began to rationalise services. The barely used and loss-making Brill and Verney Junction branches beyond Aylesbury were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of government-backed loans to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Pick to promote <b>system-wide</b> improvements under the New Works Programme for 1935–1940, including the transfer of the Metropolitan line's Stanmore services to the Bakerloo line in 1939, the Northern line's Northern Heights project and extension of the Central line to Ongar in Essex and Denham in Buckinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's {{departure}} from the company for soft drinks producer PepsiCo in 1980, the company began to see a <b>system-wide</b> decline in sales. Pillsbury {{executive vice president of}} restaurant operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an advertising plan emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before it fast food ads only made allusions to the competition without ever mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, their ad agency at the time J. Walter Thompson. The child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms. Despite the controversy, the ad plan, dubbed the Burger Wars, boosted same store sales. Brinker continued working for the company in this capacity until 1982 when he was promoted to president of Pillsbury's food service division, which included the company's other chains beyond Burger King. Brinker left the company in 1984 to take the helm at Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, <b>system-wide</b> cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E

25|$|AirPlay Mirroring is added, {{which allows}} {{wireless}} mirroring of a Mac's screen to an Apple TV. <b>System-wide</b> integration of AirPlay audio transmission is added. There are many new features for Chinese users, including support for Baidu {{as an option}} for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets. Dictation, new in Mountain Lion, is a <b>system-wide</b> voice input mechanism that requires a broadband Internet connection. Facebook gained full integration following an update in late 2012. Some of the features include single-sign on and integration in Notification Center, Contacts and Share Sheets. Gatekeeper, also new to Mountain Lion, is an anti-malware feature based on digital signatures and the Mac App Store.|$|E

25|$|Tim Hortons franchises spread {{rapidly and}} {{eventually}} overtook McDonald's as Canada's largest food service operator. The company opened {{twice as many}} Canadian outlets as McDonald's by 2005, and <b>system-wide</b> sales also surpassed those of McDonald's Canadian operations as of 2002. The chain accounted for 22.6% of all fast food industry revenues in Canada in 2005.|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{the library}} used the Computerized Information Network for Cincinnati and Hamilton County (CINCH) as a <b>system-wide</b> library catalog which {{connected}} each branch through computer terminals. Users at home accessed the database via TELNET. In 2005, {{the system was}} replaced with an integrated library system (ILS) purchased from library automation vendor Sirsi, now SirsiDynix.|$|E
25|$|For {{six days}} in September 1997, a BART strike caused a <b>system-wide</b> shutdown. This {{resulted}} in a four-year contract offering a 7% raise, and a one-time payment of $3,000 to all employees {{in lieu of a}} raise the first year. Such one-time payments are becoming more common as a way to prevent the effects of compounding on wages and salaries.|$|E
25|$|In Windows Vista, Internet Explorer {{by default}} runs {{in what is}} called Protected Mode, where the {{privileges}} of the browser itself are severely restricted—it cannot make any <b>system-wide</b> changes. One can optionally turn this mode off {{but this is not}} recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.|$|E
25|$|A spyware program rarely {{operates}} {{alone on}} a computer; an affected machine usually has multiple infections. Users frequently notice unwanted behavior and degradation of system performance. A spyware infestation can create significant unwanted CPU activity, disk usage, and network traffic. Stability issues, such as applications freezing, failure to boot, and <b>system-wide</b> crashes are also common. Spyware, which interferes with networking software commonly causes difficulty connecting to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Cron {{is driven}} by a crontab (cron table) file, a {{configuration}} file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. Users can have their own individual crontab files and often there is a <b>system-wide</b> crontab file (usually in /etc or a subdirectory of /etc) that only system administrators can edit.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} local adaptations, since 1945 the <b>system-wide</b> sports mascot is the ram (borrego salvaje), {{traditionally}} embodied in a male bighorn sheep. A somewhat popular urban legend {{states that the}} mascot was chosen by the American football team {{on its way to}} a match, after spotting a male sheep on the road. According to the official sources, however, the mascot was chosen during an official contest held by students in the mid-1940s.|$|E
25|$|As an {{antibody}} technique, immunohistochemistry (IHC) {{allows for}} validating protein presence. It, and immunocytochemistry, allow for surveying the localization of proteases on a tissue or cellular scale respectively. It also can evaluate for the localization of cleavage products using monoclonal antibodies raised against neo-epitopes of cleavage sites produced by protease processing. Unfortunately, {{in addition to}} providing little functional information, IHC is also non-quantitative, making it an unappealing option for describing degradomics on <b>system-wide</b> scales.|$|E
25|$|Tuition did {{not rise}} for the 2009–10 {{academic}} {{year at the}} University of Arkansas, {{thanks in part to}} a $1million donation from the Athletics Department. The average tuition nationally rose 6.6%. On April 16, 2010, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees announced <b>system-wide</b> tuition increases of 3%–6.9% to combat decreases in state funding and increased enrollments. The University of Arkansas flagship campus experienced a 4.8% increase in tuition and fees for the 2010–11 academic year.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} size in 1968 was 19,000 items, mostly {{books and}} magazine. This increased to over 63,000 items in 1992, and included {{a much more}} diverse range of media, from children's puzzles to archives, {{as well as the}} provision of stock from other branches, and access to <b>system-wide</b> databases. By 2003 Birkenhead's stock had risen to 67,500. Shortly afterwards, the library was temporarily relocated to the Leisure Centre where there was only room to house 40-50% of the collection.|$|E
25|$|There are thirty-one campuses of the Institute {{distributed}} in twenty-five Mexican cities. Each campus is relatively independent but shares a national academic curriculum (see Academics). The flagship campus {{is located in}} Monterrey, where the national, <b>system-wide</b> rectorate is located. Most of them deliver both high school and undergraduate education, some offer postgraduate programs and only five (Cumbres, Eugenio Garza Sada, Eugenio Garza Lagüera, Santa Catarina and Valle Alto) deliver high school courses exclusively. Nevertheless, curricular and extension courses and seminars are usually available at most facilities.|$|E
25|$|The UNDG {{is one of}} {{the three}} pillars of the UN system Chief Executives Board (CEB), which furthers {{coordination}} and cooperation {{on a wide range of}} substantive and management issues facing UN system organizations. The CEB brings the executive heads of UN organizations together on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General. Within the CEB structure, the High-Level Committee on Management works on <b>system-wide</b> administrative and management issues, the High-Level Committee on Programmes considers global policy issues, while the United Nations Development Group deals with operational activities for development with a focus on country-level work.|$|E
