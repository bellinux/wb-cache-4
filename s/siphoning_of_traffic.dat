40|$|In this paper, the {{relations}} among T-invariants, repetitive vectors and siphons are investigated and new methods for computing repetitive vectors and siphons are suggested based on them. The transition-added net of a net is defined and a relation is shown that there always exists a T-invariant of the transition-added net corresponding to a repetitive vector {{of the original}} net, and vice versa. Based on this relation, an algorithm that can compute a set of repetitive vectors of a net is presented. It is proved that any repetitive vector of a net can be expressed as a linear combination of these repetitive vectors with nonnegative rational coefficients. Next, this paper presents a new method for generating siphons based on repetitive vectors. The transition-split net of a net is defined. It can be proved that all <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> a net are <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> the associated transition-split net, and vice versa. Any <b>siphon</b> <b>of</b> the transition-split net is exactly {{the support of a}} repetitive vector of its dual net, and vice versa. Therefore, computing siphons can be converted into computing repetitive vectors. Finally this paper presents an algorithm that can generate a set <b>of</b> <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> a net. These siphons contain all minimal siphons and any <b>siphon</b> <b>of</b> the net can be expressed as a union of them. These algorithms, which like FM algorithm computing T-invariants, can be carried out through the linear transformation of the incidence matrix...|$|R

This article presents asymbolic approach to the computation <b>of</b> minimal <b>siphons</b> in Petri nets by using binary decision diagrams(BDD). The <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> a Petri net can be found via a set of logic conditions. The logic conditions are symbolicallymodeled by using Boolean algebras. The operations of Boolean algebras are implemented by BDD thatare capable of representing large sets <b>of</b> <b>siphons</b> with small shared data structures. The proposed methodfirst uses BDD to compute all <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> a Petri net and then a binary relation is designed to extract allminimal siphons. Finally, by using a number of examples, the efficiency of the proposed method is verifiedthrough different-sized problems...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{importance}} <b>of</b> the <b>siphons</b> for infaunal bivalves, {{only a few}} studies have examined their tissues using histology techniques or scanning electron microscopy. In the present study, the <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> Tellina lineata Turton, 1819 and Macoma biota Arruda & Domaneschi, 2005 were investigated. The siphon walls are composed by a series of muscle sheets of longitudinal ("L"), circular ("C") and radial ("R") fibers, with a clear pattern common to both species: there is a main median longitudinal layer (Lm), and two peripheral circular layers, one inner (Ci) and one outer (Co), near the epithelia. A median circular layer (Cm) separates an internal (Lmi) from an outer (Lmo) median longitudinal layer. Further, the Co is split by a thin outer longitudinal layer (Lo), forming Coi and Coo layers, the former being obliquely oriented. Thin radial fibers (R) delimit clear packages of Lmi and Lmo fibers. In each siphon, there are six longitudinal nerve cords, running within the Lmi layer, adjacent to the Cm. The inhalant and exhalant <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> M. biota are very similar in structure, but the Lmo <b>of</b> the exhalant <b>siphon</b> is almost twice as thick as its Lmi, while in the inhalant siphon these layers have similar thicknesses; the Coi is very thick, especially in the exhalant siphon. The inhalant <b>siphon</b> <b>of</b> T. lineata is very similar to that of M. biota, differing only with respect to the thickness of the Coi, which in the former species is not as well developed as in the latter. The Lmo <b>of</b> the exhalant <b>siphon</b> <b>of</b> T. lineata {{is by far the most}} developed layer, with the Lmi represented only by uniseriate small cells; in the vicinities of the nerve cords, the Cm is split in two layers. The epithelia <b>of</b> both <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> M. biota and T. lineata bear ciliated receptors, which were difficult to observe as they were frequently covered with mucus. It was possible to observe that cilia are present in both species, differing in length and in the number per receptor between the inhalant and exhalant siphons, and between the species. Detailed comparisons among the <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> M. biota and T. lineata and other bivalve species are very difficult, because of at least two reasons. First, each investigator has used different methods to prepare and observe the siphons through histological sections; and second, different nomenclatural schemes are used to describe the musculature <b>of</b> the <b>siphons,</b> causing confusion when the same layers are compared among different species. In order to unify the nomenclature of tissue layers <b>of</b> the bivalve <b>siphons,</b> we now propose a scheme to name these layers based on topological homology...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two types}} of ECMO: veno-{{arterial}} (VA) and veno-venous (VV) [8]. VA ECMO refers to <b>siphoning</b> <b>of</b> deoxygenated blood from a vein with return of oxygenated blood into an arterial vessel. VV ECMO refers to <b>siphoning</b> <b>of</b> deoxygenated blood from a venous vessel and return of oxygenated blood to a systemic venous vessel or the right atrium. The catheters used in ECMO for blood exchange are referred to as ‘cannulas’, a term used in this context to avoid confusion with other vascular catheters. ECMO cannulas may assume variable configurations on radiographs and CTs. Familiarity with differing positions and access sites is important when interpreting images. Additionally, a multitude of complications may arise intrinsic to either ECMO or cannula placement.|$|R

40|$|Halimeda Lamouroux {{constitutes}} a genus of calcified and segmented green seaweeds within the Bryopsidales. Molecular phylogenetic assessments have uncovered five principal monophyletic lineages within the genus. In {{the present study}} we define these lineages morphologically. We gathered morphological data from specimens used in the molecular analyses {{as well as from}} collections having a similar morphology and originating from the same geographical region. Starting from the lineages and their morphological synapomorphies, we define and illustrate five natural sections within Halimeda. All or most medullary siphons traversing the nodes between segments fuse into a single unit in specimens of lineage 1 (section Rhipsalis), and segments at the thallus base fuse with one another. Medullary <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> specimens in lineage 2 (section Micronesicae) traverse the node without fusing. Medullary <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> specimens in lineage 3 (section Halimeda) divide frequently below the nodes and become entangled among one another. The segments of specimens in this lineage possess a continuous uncorticated band along the distal perimeter instead of three or more pits as encountered in segments of specimens in all other lineages. Members of lineage 4 (section Pseudo-opuntia) possess club-shaped subperipheral utricles in their cortical region. Medullary <b>siphons</b> <b>of</b> specimens in lineage 5 (section Opuntia) fuse over only a short distance at the nodes and retain their identity. Apart from these synapomorphies, the lineages can be delimited further by a characteristic combination of symplesiomorphies and homoplasies.
