5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} opening in the body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or <b>scalpel</b> or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E
5|$|Informant Michael Marks awakens in a {{room with}} a spike-filled mask locked to his neck. A {{videotape}} informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key, which has been surgically implanted and sealed behind it. He sets off the timer and finds the <b>scalpel,</b> but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.|$|E

50|$|Scalpels: Could be made {{of either}} steel or bronze. Ancient <b>scalpels</b> had almost the same form and {{function}} as those of today. The most usual type of <b>scalpels</b> were the longer, steel <b>scalpels.</b> These {{could be used to}} make a variety of incisions, but they seem to be particularly suited for deep or long cuts. Smaller, bronze <b>scalpels,</b> referred to as bellied <b>scalpels,</b> were also used frequently since the shape allowed delicate and precise cuts to be made.|$|R
50|$|However, CDC studies {{shows that}} up to 87% of active medical devices are not activated. Safety <b>scalpels</b> are active devices and {{therefore}} the risk of not activating is still significant. There is a study that indicated there were actually four times more injuries with safety <b>scalpels</b> than reusable <b>scalpels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as an injured Heiter hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller {{begins to feel}} ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the <b>scalpel</b> pulled from his leg during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends {{with the sounds of}} her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house.|$|E
5|$|Harold is escorted {{back to the}} {{psychiatric}} center where he is tormented by Nurse Innes (Nancy Fish). Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, {{was responsible for the}} murders. When Innes attacks Scully with a <b>scalpel,</b> Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. While summarizing the case with Mulder, Scully explains that Innes had been taking Harold's unused medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. Scully hypothesizes that Innes committed the murders in order to destroy the love Harold felt towards the young women. Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. Scully, however, suspects that Harold died from what Innes took away from him. Scully admits to Mulder that she saw the ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting {{in the back seat of}} her car.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the <b>scalpel</b> incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E

50|$|The {{medical field}} has some use for erbium-doped laser {{crystals}} for the laser <b>scalpels</b> {{that are used}} in laser surgery. Europium, neodymium, and other rare-earth elements are used to dope glasses for lasers. Holmium-doped and neodymium yttrium aluminium garnets (YAGs) are used as the active laser medium in some laser <b>scalpels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a <b>scalpel</b> opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a <b>scalpel</b> or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
5|$|In {{trying to}} find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's <b>scalpel</b> having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a state of shock.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} a {{preliminary}} study of vibrational cutting of soft tissue with micro-serrated surgical <b>scalpels</b> with curved blades. Although surgical <b>scalpels</b> are being widely used, the influence of edge geometry and blade motions during cutting remain largely unexplored. This paper is aimed at exploring the possibility of improving the cutting performance of these medical devices through laser micro-machining of serrations on their curved cutting edges, of vibratory cutting motions and their combination. Experimental studies on biological and phantom tissue {{will be presented to}} demonstrate the impact of micro-texturing and vibrational motion on the cutting efficiency of surgical <b>scalpels.</b> This preliminary study is intended as a basis for the future investigation of the observed responses to enhance cutting efficiency in surgical procedures...|$|R
