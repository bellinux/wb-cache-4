25|$|SEM is not {{a camera}} and the {{detector}} is not continuously image-forming like a CCD array or film. Unlike in an optical system, the resolution is not limited by the diffraction limit, fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends {{on the size of}} the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam.</b> The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with transmission electron microscope (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1nbsp&nm and 20nbsp&nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (<30 kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4nbsp&nm using a secondary electron detector.|$|E

Despite the objections of Dr. Rosenberg to pushing the analysis equipment beyond its design capacities, Cross and Green are assigned to assist setting up the experiment for Gordon Freeman. When Freeman inserts the specimen into the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam,</b> however, it triggers a [...] "resonance cascade", causing massive damage to the facility and teleporting alien creatures into the base. Keller and Rosenberg agree that Black Mesa cannot {{deal with the situation}} on its own, and so decide to call for military assistance. Cross and Green escort Rosenberg to the surface, where he sends a distress signal to the military. However, the military are ordered not only to contain the situation, but to silence the base by killing its employees. Rosenberg elects to stay behind to meet with the military on arrival and Cross and Green return to Keller.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLaser {{cladding}} using a <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> {{is quite}} a similar process than laser cladding using static optics (e. g. lens or mirror optics). The main difference comes from the manipulation of the laser beam. In laser cladding with scanning optics the laser beam is manipulated with a scanner so that the laser's area of influence can be shaped numerically. This increases cladding process flexibility. Scanning optics enable laser beam modification considerably versatile way than normal static optics can. This is due to possibility of numerical adjustment of scanning amplitude, laser power and scanning frequency. By modifying these parameters clad beads geometry can by modified quite freely. However <b>scanned</b> laser <b>beam</b> in surface modification process creates some restricting factors to the process. Mainly limitations for the process parameter values come from the dual characteristics of the energy input. This paper treats usability of scanning optics in laser cladding process in general level. In this paper is discussed how <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> {{can be used to}} increase the flexibility but also maters that limit the usage of <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> in cladding process.

2500|$|A TEM can be {{modified}} into a {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) by the addition of a system that rasters the beam across the sample to form the image, combined with suitable detectors. Scanning coils are used to deflect the beam, such as by an electrostatic shift of the beam, where the beam is then collected using a current detector such as a Faraday cup, which acts as a direct electron counter. By correlating the electron count to the position of the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> (known as the [...] "probe"), the transmitted component of the beam may be measured. The non-transmitted components may be obtained either by beam tilting or by the use of annular dark field detectors.|$|E
50|$|The first fully {{functional}} low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> tube, the CPS Emitron, {{was invented}} and {{demonstrated by the}} EMI team {{under the supervision of}} Isaac Shoenberg. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for television transmitting systems where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special grids, a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away. The velocity and energy of the electrons in the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> tube was obtained. The EMI team kept working on these devices, and Lubszynski discovered in 1936 that a clear image could be produced if the trajectory of the low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> was nearly perpendicular (orthogonal) to the charge storage plate in a neighborhood of it. The resulting device was dubbed the cathode potential stabilized Emitron, or CPS Emitron. The industrial production and commercialization of the CPS Emitron had to wait {{until the end of the}} second world war.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} iconoscope {{was very}} noisy {{due to the}} secondary electrons released from the photoelectric mosaic of the charge storage plate when the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> swept it across. An obvious solution was to scan the mosaic with an electron beam, which velocity and energy were so low in a neighborhood of the plate, that no secondary electrons were emitted at all. That is, an image is projected onto the photoelectric mosaic of a charge storage plate, so that positive charges are produced and stored there due to photo-emission and capacitance, respectively. These stored charges are then [...] "gently" [...] discharged by a low-velocity electron <b>scanning</b> <b>beam,</b> preventing the emission of secondary electrons. Not all the electrons in the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> may be absorbed in the mosaic, because the stored positive charges are proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The remaining electrons are then deflected back into the anode, captured by a special grid, or deflected back into an electron multiplier.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scanned</b> <b>beam</b> {{proton therapy}} is a {{promising}} cancer treatment modality which {{is becoming more}} widely available with {{the increasing number of}} proton radiotherapy centers. <b>Scanned</b> proton <b>beams</b> can produce complex 3 D dose distributions, presenting a challenge for adequate quality assurance testing. Because each <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> dose measurement requires the delivery of the entire field, multiple measurements can be time consuming. These quality assurance challenges limit the number of patients who can be treated with this modality. The overall objective of this project is to increase the safety and availability of complex proton therapy treatments by developing a fast volumetric scintillation detector. Volumetric scintillation dosimetry is a new technique with the potential to provide fast, high-resolution measurements of <b>scanned</b> proton <b>beams.</b> Initial studies using scintillation dosimetry for IMPT quality assurance have shown promise, despite quenching effects caused by the nonlinear response of the scintillator to low-energy protons. All previous studies have used a single camera to image a tank of scintillator. However, to obtain real-time 3 D information, at least two cameras are required. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a dual-camera volumetric scintillation dosimetry system and test its capabilities for quality assurance of <b>scanned</b> proton <b>beams.</b> A prototype detector was built, consisting of a tank of LS imaged by two orthogonally-positioned CCD cameras. The optical response of the system was evaluated, and correction methods were developed for optical artifacts. Quenching correction methods were developed to preserve the linearity of dose measurement in the Bragg peak. The new detector was used to measure the range, lateral profile, and lateral position of <b>scanned</b> proton <b>beams</b> of multiple energies and lateral locations. A high level of accuracy was obtained with the range and lateral profile measurements. The lateral position measurements were precise but suffered from systematic errors related to uncertainties in the day-to-day setup of the detector. The new detector design shows the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of quality assurance measurements for <b>scanned</b> proton <b>beam</b> delivery systems. It provides the novel capability of measuring the proton beam range, lateral profile, and lateral position simultaneously and rapidly with high resolution. These capabilities will facilitate increased patient safety and an improved capacity to detect beam delivery errors...|$|R
