5000|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} cheese. Cheesemaking may have originated from nomadic herdsmen who stored milk in vessels made from the sheep's and goats' stomachs. Because their stomach linings contains a mix of lactic acid, wild bacteria as milk contaminants and rennet, the milk would ferment and coagulate. Cheese, like other dairy products, “seems to bear the hallmark of pastoral nomads of Central Asia, who used animal stomach bags and untanned leather pouches as containers. Since the lining of the calf’s stomach contains the enzyme (rennin) that produces the curdling agent, rennet, milk kept in a calf’s stomach bag would turn to cheese more or less of its own accord.” [...] A product reminiscent of yogurt would have been produced, which, through gentle agitation and the separation of curds from whey would have resulted in the production of cheese; the cheese being essentially a concentration of the major milk protein, casein, and milk fat. The whey proteins, other minor milk proteins, and the lactose are all removed in the cheese whey. Another theory is offered by David Asher, who wrote that the origins actually lie within the “sloppy <b>milk</b> <b>bucket</b> in later European culture, it having gone unwashed and containing all of the necessary bacteria to facilitate the ecology of cheese.” ...|$|R

In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel sp. harbouring in a neonatal unit in Tanzania. Seventeen Gram-negative enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disk diffusion testing, and the presence of the gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour on a 291 -kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35 %.

50|$|Inside {{the barn}} {{there are four}} rings. The {{innermost}} is also the smallest and is used for ventilation. This ventilation is necessary to help draw the moisture {{up and out of}} the hay which prevents mold from growing and the hay from eventually spontaneously combusting. The next ring out is where the hay was stored. It was tossed in from an upper level. That balcony was accessible by ox-drawn wagon via a ramp outdoors. Because the barn was round the wagons could enter, unload the hay and then exit the barn without ever having to back up. The third ring out was where the Shaker brothers would walk to distribute the hay in the second ring to the cows standing in the outermost, fourth ring. The barn could hold up to 70 cows at a time. They would go to the barn twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening to be milked. Inside the barn they were put into wooden stanchions. Standing there, the cows could eat while the brothers milked them. The floor of the outermost ring is split level, with the inner part raised up 3 in. This was so that the <b>milk</b> <b>buckets</b> were not on the same level as the manure which was unsanitary. In addition to separating the milk from manure, the Shakers developed a way of both efficiently removing the manure from the complex but using it for compost.

From days 4 to 84 of age restricted suckling calves were allowed to suckle their dams up to 15 minutes post <b>milking.</b> <b>Bucket</b> reared calves were fed a total of 236 kg whole milk and received concentrate supplementation after day 56.

RS calves exhibited no losses and only 3 illnesses, whereas three BR calves died and nine developed illnesses. Up to 84 days of age RS calves had a highly significant faster average daily gain (ADG) than BR calves (620 g vrs. 390 g) and a significant larger heart-girth. RS and BR calves had an estimated adjusted daily metabolisable energy (ME) intake from milk of 18. 9 ME and 12. 6 ME and from the whole ration of 18. 9 ME and 14. 3 ME, respectively. Intake of milk fat, milk protein, Ca and P were highly significant higher in RS calves. Total protein intake from the whole ration was higher in BR calves.

Diseño Metodológico: Se realizó un estudio descriptivo, con una muestra representativa y al azar, constituido por 100 muestras de leche industrializada y 200 de leche de balde, sembradas en medios de Agar Sangre y Mac Conkey. Las muestras de balde se recogieron en dos horarios: el primero {{posterior}} al ordeño y el segundo al medio día durante su entrega en la ciudad de Cuenca, para determinar el cre - cimiento bacteriano entre este lapso de tiempo. Se realizó una encuesta en la ciudad de Cuenca para saber si hay relación entre el nivel educativo de las personas y el tipo de leche que consumen. El análisis de los resultados se realizó en un ordenador mediante el software SPSS 15 y Excel. Resultados: En los diferentes medios de cultivo el nivel de contaminación llego de un 66 % al 70 %, co - rrespondiendo casi en su totalidad a las muestras de las leches de balde. Los resultados positivos en la mañana fueron de un 68 - 82 % y en la tarde a casi un 100 % con más de 100000 UFC, observándose un aumento sustancial en los niveles de contaminación.

Such changes in secretions from non-mastitic regressive mammary glands raise doubts about the present knowledge, definition, and diagnosis of so-called non-specific or aseptic mastitis. Determinations of fluctuating lacteal concentrations of lactose, galactose, mannose and glucose suggest that the secretory epithelium altered its metabolism and integrity {{in response to the}} intramammary perturbation by following a certain pattern of regressive adjustments which: (i) were apparently triggered during the initial 24 h of perturbation by disturbed Na-K-ATPase activities, followed by a cascade of changes in ion regulation, carbohydrate metabolism and increased formation of lactic acid as a metabolic end-product; (ii) advanced in a stepwise fashion during 0 - 24, 24 - 72 and 72 - 168 h of perturbation from recognition response to alarm reactions and manifestation of regression respectively; (iii) showed that markedly decreased carbohydrate levels preceded major increases of the SCC, BSA and NAG values; (iv) indicated that after 72 h of milk stasis leucocytic infiltrations sharply increased the SCC to more than 500 000 per ml and accelerated the manifestation of regression.

The refractometer has advantages over other methods of estimating IgG concentration in that the Brix refractometer is inexpensive, readily available, less fragile, and less sensitive to variation in colostral temperature, season of the year and other factors. Samples of first-milking MC were collected from 7 dairy farms in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut (n= 84) and 1 dairy farm in California (n= 99). The MC was milked from the cow at 6. 1 ± 5. 6 h postparturition and a sample was evaluated for Brix percentage by using an optical refractometer. Two additional samples (30 mL) were collected from the <b>milk</b> <b>bucket,</b> placed in vials, and frozen before analysis of total IgG by radial immunodiffusion (RID) using commercially available plates and by turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA). The second sample was analyzed for total bacterial counts and coliform counts at laboratories in New York (Northeast samples) and California (California samples). The Brix percentage (mean ± SD) was 23. 8 ± 3. 5, IgG concentration measured by RID was 73. 4 ± 26. 2 g/L, and IgG concentration measured by TIA was 67. 5 ± 25. 0 g/L. The Brix percentage was highly correlated (r= 0. 75) with IgG analyzed by RID. The Brix percentage cut point to define high- or low-quality colostrum (50 g of IgG/L measured by RID) that classified more samples correctly given the proportion of high- (86 %) and low-quality (14 %) samples in this study was 21 %, which is slightly lower than other recent estimates of Brix measurements. At this cut point, the test sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 92. 9, 65. 5, 93. 5, 63. 3, and 88. 5 %, respectively. Measurement of IgG by TIA correlated with Brix (r= 0. 63) and RID (r= 0. 87); however, TIA and RID methods of IgG measurement were not consistent throughout the range of samples tested. We conclude that Brix measurement of total solids in fresh MC is an inexpensive, rapid, and satisfactorily accurate method of estimating IgG concentration. A cut point of 21 % Brix to estimate samples of MC > 50 g/L was most appropriate for our data. Measurement of IgG in MC by TIA differed from measurement by RID...|$|R
