40|$|Abstract — Frequency {{compensation}} of two-stage integratedcircuit operational amplifiers is normally accomplished with a capacitor around the second stage. This compensation capacitance creates the desired dominant-pole {{behavior in the}} openloop transfer function of the op amp. Circuit analysis of this compensation leads to a mathematical observation of “pole splitting: ” that as the compensation capacitance is increased, the parasitic poles of the amplifier <b>separate</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency.</b> Treatment of op-amp compensation as minor-loop feedback, instead of pole splitting, greatly simplifies and generalizes the analysis and design of op-amp frequency response. Using classical-control techniques instead of direct circuit analysis, insight and intuition into the behavior and flexibility of the system are gained. I...|$|E

40|$|SummaryJust as {{the visual}} system parses complex scenes into {{identifiable}} objects, the auditory system must organize sound elements scattered <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> and time into coherent “streams. ” Current neurocomputational theories of auditory streaming rely on tonotopic {{organization of the}} auditory system to explain the observation that sequential spectrally distant sound elements tend to form separate perceptual streams. Here, we show that spectral components that are well <b>separated</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> are no longer heard as separate streams if presented synchronously rather than consecutively. In contrast, responses from neurons in primary auditory cortex of ferrets show that both synchronous and asynchronous tone sequences produce comparably segregated responses along the tonotopic axis. The results argue against tonotopic separation per se as a neural correlate of stream segregation. Instead we propose a computational model of stream segregation that can account for the data by using temporal coherence as the primary criterion for predicting stream formation...|$|R

High coherence can be attained by building circuits from fixed-frequency qubits, however, leading techniques cannot couple qubits {{that are far}} detuned. Here we introduce a method based on a tunable bus which allows for the coupling of two fixed-frequency qubits even at large detunings. By parametrically oscillating the bus at the qubit-qubit detuning we enable a resonant exchange (XX+YY) interaction. We use this interaction to implement a 183 ns two-qubit iSWAP gate between qubits <b>separated</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> by 854 MHz with a measured average fidelity of 0. 9823 (4) from interleaved randomized benchmarking.
