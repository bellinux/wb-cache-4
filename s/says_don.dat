60|$|Some miles {{brought me}} nigh the hills; {{but out of}} present sight of them. I was not lost; for road-side golden-rods, as guide-posts, pointed, I doubted not, {{the way to the}} golden window. Following them, I came to a lone and languid region, where the grass-grown ways were {{traveled}} but by drowsy cattle, that, less waked than stirred by day, seemed to walk in sleep.

"CON tal que las {{costumbres}} de un autor," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Don</b> Thomas de las Torres, in {{the preface}} to his [...] "Amatory Poems" [...] "sean puras y castas, importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras"--meaning, in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there until his [...] "Amatory Poems" [...] get out of print, or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon the [...] "Batrachomyomachia," [...] and proved that the poet's object was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in [...] "The Antediluvians," [...] a parable in Powhatan, [...] "new views in Cock Robin," [...] and transcendentalism in [...] "Hop O' My Thumb." [...] In short, {{it has been shown that}} no man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example, need have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is somewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the [...] "Dial," [...] or the [...] "Down-Easter," [...] together with all that he ought to have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very straight in the end.|$|E

"Doing enough little things right will add up to big differences in profitability. no matter whether you're a cow-calf operator, a backgrounder or a cattle finisher. ‚Äù He offers some interesting ideas for cattle ranchers. The economist says cow herd costs are running around $ 375 per cow-calf unit per year. This includes $ 178 for feed, including pasture for 15 % replacements. 15 % interest on the value of the cow ($ 450) and $ 32 a year for 1 abor. "A 92 % calf crop with steer sale weights averaging 475 lbs. and heifers at 425 lbs. indicates the producer needs $ 98 cwt. for his steers and $ 92 cwt. for heifers to cover all of his costs. " the economist notes. Current prices of $ 67 and $ 61. respectively, show a full-cost loss of $ 101 per cow-cal f unit. ‚Äù The specialist says survival strategy warrants looking only at cash costs, including rented grass.

40|$|Know that feeling? All that faraway talk, even in your trusted Spore, {{about the}} new 'Information Age' {{and how it is}} going to {{liberate}} everybody. It might still seem a long way away from the perspective of an ACP agriculturist. And yet, at each stage of our waking, working day, we find ourselves having to deal with information. Sometimes we do not have enough to take a wise decision, in which case the experts call us informationally deprived. At other times we have too much information and are unable to pick out the right bits, in which case we are informationally overloaded. It is a problem faced by any manager in a development organisation, and it is especially for these managers that Mike Powell, himself such a person, put together this dense work on Information Management for Development Organisations. For a reader who is professionally aware of information systems, the logic of libraries, computers and personnel policy as well as what really happens in the village, this is a comforting and informative guide through a sometimes bewildering area. Terms like information architecture, mapping and monitoring and learning organisations rain down on you, but if you can handle that, you will find this book a sound professional companion as you draw up and implement your detailed information policy. There are lighter sections of the book, where Powell shines in communicating common sense. If you want to understand the needs of your user, he <b>says,</b> <b>don</b> t just study them, socialise with them, go to social events, chat don t talk, listen don t gawk. It is a shame that he made some of his messages so hard to get at; they deserve to be shared among more people than the community of 'information professionals'.

40|$|ABSTRACT ‚ÄúWe {{live in an}} age of {{conspiracy}}‚Äù <b>says</b> <b>Don</b> DeLillo (1989). In 2014 {{it seems}} that conspiracy theories, and speculation concerning the ‚Äútruth‚Äù about major events, has become a popular theme and pastime in contemporary society. From sold out eleven hour David Icke presentations at Wembley Stadium in the UK (as well as his world tours), to the ever expanding radio and television network of Alex Jones in the United States, it is clear that there {{is more than just a}} fringe interest in conspiracy theories. In the academic literature dating back to Richard Hofstadter (1964) though, the phenomenon has been cast as a purely pathological or paranoid behaviour. Recent works, such as that of Sunstien and Vermeule (2009), Aaronovitch (2011) and van der Linden (2013) go further in suggesting that engagement with conspiracy theories is not only a pathological behaviour, but a danger both to modern society and one which threatens to bring an end to the ‚Äúage of reason. ‚Äù Others however, such as Jane and Fleming (2014) have suggested that conspiracy theories are actually a direct result of Enlightenment thinking, and that they offer a valuable counterweight to modern forms of propaganda. In this thesis I seek to challenge the view that conspiracy theories are a pathological behaviour, and offer instead that in contemporary engagement with conspiracy theories is a form of political resistance that allows the excluded and disaffected a political voice. I also offer that conspiracy theories are best understood as social, cultural and political narratives that are in the words of Michael Barkun (2003) a form of stigmatized knowledge. From this perspective it is possible, I argue, to contextualise conspiracy theories in terms of contemporary political and social issues. Finally, I suggest that conspiracy theories may be a method that is used by those who engage to negotiate social ambivalence as outlined by Bauman (1991). To do this, I interviewed eight Melbournians who were either engaged with conspiracy theories or considered themselves ‚Äúsceptics. ‚Äù Each of the participants, shared stories of their everyday experiences with conspiracy theories with me. I have analysed their responses using a thematic narrative analysis and underpinning my research were four research questions: [1] How do people living and working in Melbourne define and use conspiracy theories in their everyday lives?; [2] In my data, are conspiracy theories being discussed (and used) as a form of political action for the alienated and marginalized? [3] Does my data collected conform to the two broad understandings that I have outlined in the literature review (the cultural and psychological approaches) ? [4] Following question 3, do my participants engage with conspiracy theories as social, cultural and political narratives that offer a new or alternative means of political resistance...|$|E
