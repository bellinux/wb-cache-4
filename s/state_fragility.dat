50|$|There is a {{relationship}} between <b>state</b> <b>fragility</b> and service delivery and they are both seen as interrelated and mutually reinforcing, yet some also suggest that the provision of basic services can reduce <b>state</b> <b>fragility.</b> In fragile states service delivery may be impacted by financial constraints, limited expertise {{and a lack of}} information Long and protracted violence leads to the neglect and subsequent decay of the infrastructure required for provision. Governance and the breakdown of social order can also heighten the social exclusion of specific groups along ethnic, religious, political and gender lines. Such violence can be political, including conflict and terrorism, but can also be social or criminal, leading to a broad combination of security-based obstacles to effective service provision.|$|E

The study suggests that the majority of FDI in fragile states is driven by the motives of resource-seeking multinationals. While this investment can lead to economic growth, this potential is often not realised, and receiving investment solely for resource extraction can lead to further conflict: a phenomenon known as the resource curse.|$|E

40|$|Fragile {{states are}} {{characterized}} by institutions which {{do not have the}} political will or ability to reduce poverty in the interests of their citizen, to establish basic social security, to promote a successful development process, and to guarantee security and human rights. The regional disintegration processes after the period of imperialism and the fall of the iron curtain have created many new states, which still are politically unstable and unable for a sustainable development. In the literature such states are describes as "weak", "failing or failed", "collapsed", "conflict or post-conflict" - dependant on the extent of the particular state failure. Several indicators try to describe such states and partly allow for projections of the future development. Then the role of taxation is discussed in detail before recommendations for the development cooperation are presented.

40|$|Performance-based design, PBD, {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} and its concept hasbeen applied in many international seismic building codes. In this research, five real structures designed {{according to the}} Egyptian Building Code, which does not consider PBD, are considered and modeled in a three dimensional way using the software SeismoStruct {{in order to assess}} their performance under expected earthquakes. The structures are 2 -story, 4 - story, 6 -story, 8 -story and 10 -story reinforced concrete framed structures. The structural system of these structures is of the moment-resisting frame type, with and without shear walls. The structures weredesigned under dead, live and seismic forces of “Zone 3 ” with a design acceleration of 0. 15 g. The models were analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis, IDA, considering 12 real records of historical earthquakes. IDA curves were developed for all analyzed models, considering four damage <b>states.</b> <b>Fragility</b> curves were subsequently developed to provide an overview of the expected seismic performance of a typical low or mid-rise multistory reinforced concrete framed structure in Egypt as designed in accordance with thecurrent Egyptian Building Code...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that a {{structure}} does not collapse when subjected to the action of strong ground motions, modern codes include prescriptions in order to guarantee the ductile behavior of the elements and of the whole structure. Obviously, it would be of special importance for the designer to know during the design process the extent of damage that the structure will suffer under the seismic action specified by the design spectrum and also the probability of occurrence of different states of behavior. The incremental nonlinear static analysis procedure used in this paper allows formulating a new, simplified, seismic damage index and damage thresholds associated with five limit states. The seismic behavior of a set of regular reinforced concrete buildings designed according to the EC- 2 /EC- 8 prescriptions for a high seismic hazard level is then studied using the proposed damage index and damage <b>states.</b> <b>Fragility</b> curves and damage probability matrices corresponding to the performance point are calculated for the studied buildings.

30|$|In {{spite of}} these strengths, voucher {{programmes}} are not a health system approach and do not solve the many longer-term and entrenched challenges faced by health systems in fragile states.

5000|$|While {{there are}} no {{universal}} criteria to determine <b>state</b> <b>fragility,</b> the World Bank, through its LICUS programme (Low Income Countries Under Stress) and its Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index, {{has been able to}} establish a preeminent frame of reference for donor countries and other institutional partners. Based on four clusters (including economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion/equity and Public Sector Management and institutions) as well as 16 indicators, the CPIA index rates state performance, with those countries scoring under 3.2 {{out of a total of}} 6 qualifying as [...] "fragile". Such low performing countries may then be, in turn, suitable for the allocation of financial assistance from a variety of international actors such as the International Development Association and other, similar bodies.|$|E
50|$|Followed by many donor {{countries}} and international organisations and institutions, {{this approach has}} led to a spirited debate within academia and beyond. While on the one hand, some scholars deem the categorisation of states as fragile as useful, highlighting the potential to predict state collapse and assess the many possibilities to prevent it, a more critical-minded literature disputes this. Two main criticisms emerge, challenging on one side the potential of abuse of the category of <b>state</b> <b>fragility,</b> legitimising external intervention {{at the expense of the}} local agency. On the other, the analytical utility of the categorization effort itself is disputed; the state-centric grouping together of a wide range of diverse countries leads to highly standardised development responses that cannot take into account often highly divergent political, economic and social conditions.|$|E
50|$|Quantitative {{measurement}} of state failure means {{the creation of}} indexes and rankings underlying certain indicators. To measure state failure the Fragile States Index (FSI), formerly called Failed States Index, the Fragility Index (FI) and the <b>State</b> <b>Fragility</b> Index (SFI) are particularly important. However, {{a number of other}} indexes are generally used to describe state weakness, often focusing on the developmental level of the state. Examples are: the Freedom House Index (FHI), the Human Development Index (HDI) or the World Bank Governance Indicators. Additionally, regional evaluation might give concrete details about, inter alia, the level of democracy such as the Report of Democratic Development in Latin America (Informe de desarrollo democrático de América Latina). However, the Fragile States Index has received comparatively much attention since its first publication in 2005. Edited by the magazine Foreign Policy, the ranking examines 178 countries based on analytical research of the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST) of the Fund for Peace.|$|E

30|$|The {{main results}} show that an {{increase}} in temperature significantly correlates with a higher migration flow between a country pair. Changes in precipitation are also positively and significantly correlated with migration, but to a lower extent. These findings are robust to various model modifications. Furthermore, emigration from more agriculturally-dependent countries appears {{to be related to}} changes in temperature only, while less agricultural countries are merely affected by precipitation changes when it comes to emigration. A <b>state’s</b> internal <b>fragility</b> on the other hand seems to have a direct effect on emigration, but no significant interaction with climate change.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the {{fragility}} functions provide additional valuable information {{in regards to}} far-fault and near-fault records effects under different damage <b>states.</b> The obtained <b>fragilities</b> indicate that the vulnerability under near-fault records is larger than far-fault records for the minor and moderate damage states under severe MS-severe AS sequence (e.g. Fig.  13 b vs. f). However, for collapse damage <b>state,</b> the <b>fragilities</b> under far-fault ground motions were slightly {{higher than those of}} the near-fault records (e.g. Fig.  13 d vs. h). The obtained results indicate higher vulnerability for far-fault AS under collapse damage state for severe MS-severe AS. For minor and moderate damage states the near-fault record aftershocks are more prominent over far-fault aftershocks. For severe MS-moderate AS the near-fault records were more prominent. The obtained results suggest that maybe there is a relation between significance of earthquake type (far-fault or near-fault) and intensity of the seismic sequence considered (severe MS-severe AS or severe MS-moderate AS) at different damage states which requires further studies. Needless to mention, this observation on earthquake type effect at various damage states is limited only to the present study, and may not be generalized.|$|R
50|$|A 2015 study, {{commissioned}} by the G7 member states, identifies seven climate-fragility risks that pose threats to the stability of states and societies in the decades ahead. The report finds that in fragile regions, where inequality persists {{and the government is}} unable to respond to stresses, the impacts of climate change on water, food and land will multiply existing pressures. It suggests that dynamics of <b>state</b> <b>fragility,</b> social and political fragility, may be exacerbated by climate change impacts and that the consequence of this is reduced adaptation capacity. A downward spiral of fragility or 'vicious climate-fragility cycle' begins. The report also describes how one can measure the capacity of states and societies {{to meet the challenges of}} environmental change along a 'spectrum of fragility', from 'most fragile' to 'most resilient'. In fragile situations, where the government lacks ability to carry out basic functions, the state is more vulnerable to and less able to cope with climate change pressures such as natural resource scarcity, land use change, extreme weather events or volatile food prices, and hence more at risk from further instability.|$|E
50|$|Fragile {{states and}} post-conflict {{countries}} {{have participated in}} many intergovernmental groups and associations since the Second World War, including the Group of 77 and regional groups such as ASEAN and the African Union. However until recently countries affected by conflict had no dedicated international platform. In 2010 the g7+ was founded {{by a group of}} post-conflict countries to better represent their interests on the international stage. The g7+ is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together countries that have recent experience of conflict. The group aims {{to draw attention to the}} special challenges faced by fragile states, provides a platform for conflict-affected countries to come together to discuss their shared development challenges, and advocates for better international policies to address the needs of conflict-affected countries. The g7+ has embarked on its very own index for measuring <b>state</b> <b>fragility,</b> identifying five clusters (political legitimacy, justice, security, economic foundation, revenue and services), which are located on a fragility- ”spectrum” containing five stages. Main differences to other indices are constituted by privileged role of individual, state-specific characteristics and self- rather than external assessment. There are currently 20 member countries: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé e Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo and Yemen. Sierra Leone's Minister of Finance and Development, Dr Kaifala Marah, is the current Chair, taking over the role in May 2014. The role of Chair was previously held by Minister Emilia Pires of Timor-Leste who oversaw the development of the forum in its earliest years. The g7+ Secretariat was established in 2010 and is based in Dili, Timor-Leste.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{determinants}} of <b>state</b> <b>fragility</b> in sub-Saharan Africa using hitherto unexplored variables in the literature. The previously missing dimension of nation building is integrated and the hypothesis of <b>state</b> <b>fragility</b> being a function of rent seeking and/or lobbying by de facto power holders is tested. The resulting interesting finding is that, political interference, rent seeking and lobbying increase the probability of <b>state</b> <b>fragility</b> by mitigating the effectiveness of governance capacity. This relationship (after controlling {{for a range of}} economic, institutional and demographic factors) is consistent with a plethora of models and specifications. The validity of the hypothesis is confirmed in a scenario of extreme <b>state</b> <b>fragility.</b> Moreover, the interaction between political interferences and revolutions mitigate the probability of <b>state</b> <b>fragility</b> while the interaction between natural resources and political interferences breeds the probability of extreme <b>state</b> <b>fragility.</b> As a policy implication, there is a ‘sub-Saharan African specificity’ in ‘nation building’ and prevention of conflicts. Blanket fragility oriented policies will be misplaced unless they are contingent on the degree of fragility, since ‘fragile’ and ‘extreme fragile’ countries respond differently to economic, institutional and demographic characteristics of <b>state</b> <b>fragility.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|Most {{measures}} of fragile or failing states {{are rooted in}} and build upon the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals, which are the eight areas of international development that all UN members committed to achieving by 2015. They include eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women; reducing child mortality rates; improving maternal health; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development. Thus, most indices of fragile states measure a state’s ability to achieve these goals because they reflect the relative strength and control a state has over formal and informal institutions, security, and society. The World Bank, for example, defines “fragile situations” using two criteria: a Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score {{and the presence of}} UN and/or regional peace-keeping/building missions. The second criterion though, in particular, places more emphasis on violent conflict as a measure of a <b>state’s</b> <b>fragility.</b> Many other organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, identify and work with fragile states, without generating their own lists of which states are considered “fragile.” The Overseas Development Institute, a British think tank, for example, provides analysis and policy guidance on aid, delivery of human services, human security, poverty, and crisis response in dealing with fragile states but does not distinguish which countries are considered fragile. The Global Peace Index as well as the Food Security Index also provide useful data and analysis.|$|R
