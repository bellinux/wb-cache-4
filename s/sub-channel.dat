25|$|The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by {{multipath}} propagation, {{can be considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM <b>sub-channel</b> if the <b>sub-channel</b> is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected sub-carrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.|$|E
30|$|In the {{proposed}} PCA scheme, the <b>sub-channels</b> {{are divided into}} two sections. One section is for SU 1, where α (0 <α<MN) <b>sub-channels</b> are assigned among MN <b>sub-channels.</b> The other section is for SU 2 users, where up to MN−α <b>sub-channels</b> can be assigned. In {{the proposed}} scheme, channel allocation of PUs are assigned in an ascending sequential order (i.e., 1, 2, …,M) and the SU 1 s scan and use the CR <b>sub-channels</b> in a descending sequential order from MN to MN−α+ 1 (i.e., MN,MN− 1,…,MN−α+ 1). In addition, the SU 2 s scan and use the CR <b>sub-channels</b> in a descending sequential order from MN−α to 1 (i.e., MN−α,MN−α− 1,…, 1).|$|R
30|$|Polar code {{is known}} as the first provable capacity-achieving code in memoryless channels. Inspired by the {{conception}} of channel polarization [27], the polar code scheme will divide the end-to-end channel into a series of <b>sub-channels.</b> Such virtual <b>sub-channels</b> will possess different transmission qualities, i.e., some <b>sub-channels</b> may be capable of the excellent transmission quality and can provide errorless transmissions, while the remaining <b>sub-channels</b> have the high error ratio approaching 0.5. So, the polar encoder will exploit such two polarized <b>sub-channels,</b> which will differ essentially from a common sense of polarizations in the electromagnetic field. If the channel is polarized based on some dividing strategy, then encode process will be straightforward. The useful information will be load to the virtual channels with the excellent quality, while the frozen bits (i.e., the useless padding information) will be padded into other bad <b>sub-channels.</b>|$|R

25|$|In OFDM, the {{sub-carrier}} frequencies {{are chosen}} {{so that the}} sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that cross-talk between the sub-channels is eliminated and inter-carrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver; unlike conventional FDM, a separate filter for each <b>sub-channel</b> is not required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Network-on-chip (NoC) {{has been}} used as the new on-chip {{communication}} paradigm. Asynchronous NoCs are power efficient and robust to process variation but they are slow. One reason for the low speed is the way that asynchronous routers use to build wide channels. To meet the bandwidth requirement, current routers broaden their channels by synchronizing multiple <b>sub-channels.</b> The C-element and buffer trees introduced by the synchronization increase the cycle period. A new router is proposed to use multiple independent <b>sub-channels</b> to transmit data. Since the synchronization is removed, the cycle period of all <b>sub-channels</b> are reduced speeding up the network. Two routers, one using multiple independent <b>sub-channels</b> and one using the synchronized wide channel, are implemented at the layout level. The simulation results show that the new router using multiple independent <b>sub-channels</b> reduces the router latency and the cycle period. I...|$|R

25|$|In a sense, {{improvements}} in FIR equalization using FFTs or partial FFTs leads mathematically closer to OFDM, but the OFDM technique {{is easier to}} understand and implement, and the sub-channels can be independently adapted in other ways than varying equalization coefficients, such as switching between different QAM constellation patterns and error-correction schemes to match individual <b>sub-channel</b> noise and interference characteristics.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{polarize}} the channel, {{according to the}} Arikan’s original work [27], usually the recursive combining and splitting process will be implemented. In the first stage, total N virtual <b>sub-channels</b> are combined. Then, in the second stage these combined channels will be splitted into N new <b>sub-channels.</b> After each recursion, the transmission capacity of good channels will be further improved, while the capacity of bad channels will be gradually degraded. Finally, the channel will be polarized to good <b>sub-channels</b> with ideal transmission capacity of 1 and the others bad <b>sub-channels</b> with worst capacity of 0. Relying on the channel combining and splitting, the encoding and decoding scheme of PC scheme can be obtained.|$|R

2500|$|Most Unariuns {{were skeptical}} about the future {{predictions}} of a spacefleet landing, also channeled by Louis Spiegel. Many Unariuns felt that these predictions undermined the original mission of Ernest Norman and a falling out occurred. Circa 1980, Thomas Miller, the primary <b>sub-channel,</b> left the organization, leaving Louis Spiegel as the only <b>sub-channel.</b> From this point forward, ever more activities revolved around these predictions. Ruth Norman, now 80, participated less and less in the goings on at the center and so Unariuns turned primarily to Louis Spiegel (aka [...] "Antares", [...] "Vaughn" [...] and [...] "Charles") for guidance and instruction.|$|E

2500|$|A {{channel program}} is a {{sequence}} of channel command words (CCWs) which are executed by the I/O channel subsystem in the IBM System/360 and subsequent architectures. [...] A channel program consists {{of one or more}} channel command words. [...] The operating system signals the I/O channel subsystem to begin executing the channel program with a SSCH (start <b>sub-channel)</b> instruction. [...] The central processor is then free to proceed with non-I/O instructions until interrupted. [...] When the channel operations are complete, the channel interrupts the central processor with an I/O interruption. [...] In earlier models of the IBM mainframe line, the channel unit was an identifiable component, one for each channel. In modern mainframes, the channels are implemented using an independent RISC processor, the channel processor, one for all channels. IBM System/370 Extended Architecture and its successors replaced the earlier SIO (start I/O) and SIOF (start I/O fast release) assembler instructions (System/360 and early System/370) with the SSCH (start <b>sub-channel)</b> instruction (late System/370 and successors).|$|E

The letters would represent the first initial of its corporate parents, CBS (the parent company of UPN) and the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner. On February 22, News Corporation announced that they would start up another new network called MyNetworkTV. This new service, {{which would be a}} sister network to Fox, would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division, Twentieth Television. MyNetworkTV was created in order to give UPN and WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming independent. It was also created to compete against The CW. CBS affiliate WANE-TV aired UPN on a second digital subchannel. The Fort Wayne affiliate of The WB was cable-only [...] "WBFW" [...] which was part of The WB 100+. The station was co-owned with WPTA by Malara Broadcasting. It was announced in March 2006 that WBFW would affiliate with The CW via The CW Plus (a similar operation to The WB 100+). WPTA decided to create a new second digital <b>sub-channel</b> to simulcast WBFW and offer access to CW programming for over-the-air viewers. On September 18, The CW debuted on WBFW (which became officially known as having the WPTA-DT2 calls). The station became known on-air as [...] "Fort Wayne's CW". On September 5, WISE-TV moved NBC Weather Plus from its second digital subchannel in order for it to become the area's affiliate of MyNetworkTV. Weather Plus then began airing on WISE-TV's third digital subchannel.|$|E
