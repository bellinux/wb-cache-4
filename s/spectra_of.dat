40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of MathematicsZongzhu LinIn the {{endeavor}} to study noncommutative algebraic geometry, Alex Rosenberg defined in [13] the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> an Abelian category. This spectrum generalizes the prime <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> a commutative {{ring in the}} sense that the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> the Abelian category R − mod is homeomorphic to the prime <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> R. This <b>spectrum</b> can be seen as the beginning of “categorical geometry”, and was used in [15] to study noncommutative algebriac geometry. In this thesis, we are concerned with geometries extending beyond traditional algebraic geometry coming from the algebraic structure of rings. We consider monoids in a monoidal category as the appropriate generalization of rings–rings being monoids in the monoidal category of Abelian groups. Drawing inspiration from the definition <b>of</b> the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> an Abelian category in [13], and the exploration of it in [15], we define the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> a monoidal category, which we will call the monoidal spectrum. We prove a descent condition which is the mathematical formalization of the statment “R − mod is the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the monoidal <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> R − mod”. In addition, we prove a functoriality condidition for the spectrum, and show that for a commutative Noetherian ring, the monoidal <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> R − mod is homeomorphic to the prime <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> the ring R.
