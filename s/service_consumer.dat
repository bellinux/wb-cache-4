40|$|International audienceServices Oriented Architectures have {{provided}} flexibility and agility for <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> {{to build their}} business processes. An important issue concerning the service orchestrations supporting business processes is the Quality of <b>Service</b> (QoS). <b>Service</b> <b>consumers</b> put more and more importance to the QoS of their service orchestrations to be more competitive. Therefore, {{they need to know}} how much the service orchestrations fit their QoS expectations in order to measure their satisfaction. In this context, we propose an approach to evaluate the satisfaction degree of service orchestrations according to the <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> expectations from QoS point of view. This approach is based on Workflow patterns aggregation rules and on the application of a Multi- Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. It helps <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> to interpret the Quality of Service of their service orchestrations and to make a decision whenever they are no longer satisfied...|$|R

50|$|The {{interaction}} between a <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> and a service provider is normally {{initiated by the}} <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> as it needs to respond to an event that occurs within the boundary of the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> itself e.g. requiring some data from an external resource (i.e. the service provider) in order to perform a calculation whose results need to be relayed back to a user interface {{in response to an}} action performed by the user. However, there are situations where the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> needs to wait for the occurrence of an event within the boundary of the service provider itself. Under these circumstances, the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> somehow needs to be informed of the event as and when it happens. One way is to program the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> to poll the service provider with regular intervals so that it can check if the event happened or not. This approach not only manifests inefficiency but also behavioral unpredictability. Inefficiency because the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> and the service provider are engaged in unproductive interactions and unreliable because it might be that the event actually happened more than once before the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> could poll the <b>service</b> <b>consumer,</b> thereby missing the previous events and their related data. Apart from these problems, such a technique also introduces latency as the interval with which the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> performs the polling is fixed and, therefore, it would only fetch the event data at that time and not when the event actually occurred. This whole scenario deteriorates even further if multiple service consumers are dependent on a particular service provider.|$|E
50|$|Within the service-orientation design paradigm, service loose {{coupling}} is a design principle that {{is applied to}} the services {{in order to ensure that}} the service contract is not tightly coupled to the <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> and to the underlying service logic and implementation.

40|$|Background: This study {{analyzed}} {{differences between}} transparency of information disclosure and related demands {{from the health}} <b>service</b> <b>consumer’s</b> perspective. It also compared how health <b>service</b> providers and <b>consumers</b> are associated by different levels of mandatory information disclosure. Methods: We obtained our research data using a questionnaire survey (health services providers, n = 201; health <b>service</b> <b>consumers,</b> n = 384). Results: Health <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> do not have major concerns regarding mandatory information disclosure. However, {{they are concerned about}} complaint channels and settlement results, results of patient satisfaction surveys, and disclosure of hospital financial statements (p < 0. 001). We identified significant differences in health service providers’ and consumers’ awareness regarding the transparency of information disclosure (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: It may not be possible for outsiders to properly interpret the information provided by hospitals. Thus, when a hospital discloses information, it is necessary for the government to consider the information’s applicability. Toward improving medical expertise and information asymmetry, the government has to reduce the burden among health <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> in dealing with this information, and it has to use the information effectively...|$|R

40|$|The loss {{of control}} over {{information}} assets is a major security and privacy concern in the Cloud. <b>Service</b> <b>consumers</b> typically have no insights which controls protect their information assets and how effectively. To tackle this challenge, we propose an approach where <b>service</b> providers and <b>consumers</b> conjointly manage security requirements for a Cloud service following the ISO 27001 standard for information security management. We have developed a security management platform that provides tool support for <b>service</b> providers and <b>consumers</b> (i) to specify and consolidate security requirements and (ii) to collect, measure, analyse and report information {{about the effectiveness of}} implemented controls. By involving <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> in management activities following an international standard, our approach helps service providers to increase transparency and traceability of their security measures whereas <b>service</b> <b>consumers</b> gain much-needed insights in the protection of their information assets.

50|$|A service {{contract}} that contains details {{about what it}} encapsulates (e.g., the logic, implementation and the technology used to build the service) may end up being used in a particular manner by providing the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> more knowledge about the working of the service.

There is a chance that additional information could impede the reusability of the service as the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> designer may streamline his design based on this knowledge. However, doing so would affect {{the evolution of the}} {{service contract}} as now the <b>service</b> <b>consumer</b> is indirectly coupled to the service implementation, which may need to be replaced in the future.
