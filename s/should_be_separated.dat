5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, the Welsh Pony and Cob Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that the Welsh Stud Book <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as Section A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, Section B was added. In the first stud books, the Section B was the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the Welsh Cob was Section C and Section D. The upper height limit for Section D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections C and D were combined as simply Section C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections C and D were finalised in 1949. Until the mid 20th century, the British War Office considered the Welsh Cob so valuable that they paid premiums to the best stallions. After World War II, only three stallions were registered in Section C, but numbers have since recovered.|$|E

25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} are not allowed to mingle during prayer services, and Orthodox synagogues {{generally}} include a divider, called a mechitza, creating separate men's and women's sections. This idea comes from the old Jewish practice during the times of the temple in Jerusalem when there was a women's balcony in the Ezrat Nashim to separate the male and female spectators at the special Succot celebrations. There is also a prophecy in Zechariah (Zechariah 12:12) that talks about {{men and women}} mourning separately. The Talmud took this account and inferred that if men and women <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separate</b> in times of mourning, then they certainly <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separate</b> in times of happiness.|$|R
25|$|Contrary to the {{tradition}} that {{the children of the}} imperial family <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring to raise their children instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country to meet people but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989.|$|E

25|$|According to {{preliminary}} observations {{two different}} subunits <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> and both communities {{should be regarded}} as sub-associations within a united community. Apart from the subunit within Peucedano-Pinetum heldreichii M.

Associated species are Heracleum sphondylium, Lilium martagon var. cattaniae and Asphodelus albus. The appearance of Paeonia daurica Andrews (syn. Paeonia mascula subsp. triternata Boiss.), as observed at the latter community and nearby scattered individuals of Betula pendula and Acer heldreichii, underline that specially this part of Mt. Orjen belongs to the transitional oromediterranean type where the orophytic vegetation contains mixtures of submediterranean and temperate chorological elements.|$|E

25|$|After {{visiting his}} family in Haiti in 1843, Kingsley boarded a ship going to New York City to conduct {{business}} there. His death of pulmonary disease at 78 years old was recorded in New York City, where Kingsley was buried in a Quaker cemetery. He left much of his land to his wives and children, a bequest which was immediately contested on racial grounds by his white relatives. Kingsley's niece, Anna McNeill (who married George Whistler; their son James Whistler became a noted artist) was among the family members who tried {{to have all of}} Kingsley's family of African descent excluded from his will. Kingsley's will stipulated that no remaining slaves <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from their families, and that they should {{be given the opportunity to}} purchase their freedom at half their market price. Anna Madgigine Jai, who kept her African name through the marriage, returned to Florida in 1846 to oppose Kingsley's white relatives in court in Duval County. Arguing her case within the dictates of the Adams–Onís Treaty, she was successful; an extraordinary achievement in light of the state and local policy that was hostile toward freed slaves or blacks of any status.|$|E
25|$|The {{permanent}} council {{established at the}} instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest administrative tribunal, and occupied itself with the elaboration of {{a plan that would}} make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous Komisja Edukacji Narodowej ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One {{of the members of the}} commission, kanclerz Andrzej Zamoyski, along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some szlachta and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the French Revolution of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{necessary}} {{to have at least}} three spacecraft if permanent high elevation coverage is needed for a large area like the whole of Russia where some parts are as far south as 45° N. If three spacecraft are used, each spacecraft is active for periods of eight hours per orbit centered at apogee as illustrated in figure 9. The Earth completes half a rotation in 12 hours, so the apogees of successive Molniya orbits will alternate between one half of the northern hemisphere and the other half. For example if the apogee longitudes are 90° E and 90° W, the apogees will alternately serve Europe and Asia (see figures 3 to 5) and next Northern America (see figures 6 to 8). The orbits of the three spacecraft should then have the same apogee longitudes (for example 90° W and 90° E), but pass the apogee with eight hours shift; i.e. the right ascensions of the ascending nodes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> with 120°. When one spacecraft has reached the point corresponding to figure 5 (or figure 8) four hours after apogee passage, the next spacecraft has four hours left to reach apogee and having a right ascension of ascending node 120° larger than the previous spacecraft. Said next spacecraft has the visibility displayed in figure 3 (or figure 6) and the switch-over can take place. Note that the two spacecraft at the time of switch-over are separated about 1500km, so that the ground stations only have to move the antennas a few degrees to acquire the new spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.|$|E
25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism. In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.|$|E
25|$|Babe {{breaches}} the pub licence {{when she}} sells {{alcohol in the}} morning, when the licence does not cover this. An undercover police officer becomes a regular customer, and eventually Mick, Babe and Shirley are arrested, charged and fined £20,000 in court. Babe leaves Sylvie near the canal, {{in an attempt to}} let her drown; when Sylvie is found, it is revealed Babe is responsible and Mick evicts her after she starts insulting Linda. The next day, Mick is disgusted to learn that Lee had hit Whitney during a row and confides in Shirley who suggest that Lee and Whitney <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> for Whitney's safety, which he regretfully tells Lee. Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a note saying he no longer loves her, but Mick persuades him to explain to her his reasons before going. With Babe missing, Mick no is no longer required to pay her share of the fine, however, realising that Mick cannot pay the fine as well as other debts, including bills for the repair of leaks in the pub, Shirley decides to put the blame for the licence break on herself. As the fine is unpaid, Shirley is jailed and subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice, which increases her sentence from six weeks to three months. A few days later, Ian's wife, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he has left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to storm out. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument between the two although they later make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Soon after Linda's departure, Mick receives a phone call from Tamwar saying that Nancy has been critically injured after being hit by a car while backpacking in Bulgaria. He immediately leaves Walford and flies to Bulgaria to be with her.|$|E
