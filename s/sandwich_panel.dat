Therefore it is important to fully understand the resistance of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> subjected to impact loading conditions. The main objective of this work was to study the resistance of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with different aluminium honeycomb cores, air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> (no core between the two face sheets) and monolithic plates of equivalent mass subjected to impact from foam projectiles. The deformation and the elastic spring-back of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates have been compared and discussed. The resistance of the panels and plates has been quantified by their back-face deflection with respect to the projectile impulse. Five different types of aluminium honeycombs have been used as the core material. The front-face sheet and the back-face sheet of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are made of aluminium plate with 1 mm thickness. Cylindrical ALPORAS aluminium foams with a relative density between 9 % and 11 % are employed as the metal foam projectiles. They are fired at several hundred metres per second towards the centre of the panels and plates using a gas gun. The deflection histories of the back-face have been measured using a laser displacement sensor. From the deflection histories, the maximum deflection and the final deflection of the back-face can be distinguished. Deformation modes and failure modes of the individual component have been observed and classified into several categories. Moreover, the deflections of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> have been compared with deflections from air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> It is found that the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> outperform both the air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates within an impulse range of 2. 25 kNsm(- 2) similar to 4. 70 kNsm(- 2). Outside this operational range, the advantages associated with employing the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> as a protective structure upon impact of foam projectiles diminishes.

40|$|Thermoplastic <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are {{attractive}} for automotive applications since {{they can be}} readily formed into the light weight complex structures with good impact resistance and high flexural rigidity. In this experimental study, the extent of enhancement in properties achieved {{through the use of}} thermoplastic composite skins combined with a recycled thermoplastic core is demonstrated. The thermal behavior of polypropylene (PP) -based recycled materials and the possibility of turning them into the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> via a plastic extrusion processing were investigated. A sheet extrudate of recycled thermoplastic composite was sandwiched between two thermoplastic skins on both sides to make the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> The core material composed of recycled polypropylene (RPP) and shreds of recycled PP/Fiberglass (e. g. twintex scraps) with the weight ratio of 1 : 1. A commercial thermoplastic skin, TWINTEX, which is a roving made of commingled E-Glass and polypropylene filaments woven into highly conformable fabrics, is used as the face sheets to bond with the core material.

40|$|Recently, {{mitigation}} of blast effects {{has become}} one of the major challenges in structural engineering. In this regard, <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are considered attractive systems for blast mitigation applications. This is contributed to their considerable energy absorption capability compared to solid panels of the same weight. These <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> can have different inner core configurations to provide adequate stiffness, strength, and energy absorption for resisting different blast loads. This research evaluates numerically the effectiveness of using woven shapes as a new core topology in <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> to act as a suppressive layer for resisting blast loads. The new shape has been studied for both fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and metallic <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> The numerical models have been created using nonlinear explicit finite element simulation. Each model has been validated using available data in the literature that uses honeycomb and folded shapes. The results of proposed woven shapes have been compared to those of honeycomb and folded shapes to examine the effectiveness of using woven shape in blast mitigation. Throughout the study, twelve FRP panels with different inner core configurations are proposed to enhance panels' performance by reducing their peak deformation and increasing their energy dissipation. A parametric study was conducted on the best performing inner core configurations to achieve the highest resistance for blast loads. Moreover, the study investigates the effect of filling the FRP <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with sand, polyurethane foam, and dytherm foam on the panels' blast resistance. In order to generalize the findings of this research, other panels with the new proposed inner core configurations are simulated using stainless steel instead of FRP. Finally, the effect of changing the outer layers' thickness, applying successive blast loads on the same <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels,</b> and changing scaled distance has been investigated for metallic <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> Comparing woven shapes to honeycomb and folded shapes shows that using <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with woven shapes provides a better impulsive resistance...|$|R
50|$|The {{theory of}} {{sandwich}} panels {{and functions of}} the individual components may be described by making an analogy to an I-beam.

The web of the I-beam and the core of the sandwich panels carry the beam shear stresses. The core in a <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> differs from the web of an I-beam in that it maintains a continuous support for the facings, allowing the facings to be worked up to or above their yield strength without crimping or buckling. Obviously, the bonds between the core and facings must be capable of transmitting shear loads between these two components, thus making the entire structure an integral unit.|$|E
