5|$|A descendent of John de Charlton, {{the first}} <b>Sir</b> Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son, also named <b>Sir</b> Thomas, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He died in 1465, {{at which point}} his son <b>Sir</b> Richard became owner of the manor. <b>Sir</b> Richard was killed {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The victor of the battle, Henry VII, named him in his Act of Attainder, though he granted <b>Sir</b> Richard's wife Elizabeth a life interest in the manor. However, <b>Sir</b> Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon <b>Sir</b> Thomas' death in 1510, the manor passed to <b>Sir</b> John Peeche as his executor. <b>Sir</b> John had no children, so Swakeleys passed to the Earl of Devon, Henry Courteney in 1521.

We describe the design, fabrication and measurement of stepped impedance resonators (<b>SIRs),</b> {{which are more}} compact in size than commonly used uniform impedance resonators (UIRs). With properly chosen impedance ratio, <b>SIRs</b> can be 27 % shorter than UIRs. As a result, the area occupied by <b>SIRs</b> can be reduced. Two kinds of designs containing both <b>SIRs</b> and UIRs are fabricated and measured.

The reduced size of <b>SIRs</b> may also lead to reduced overall circuit area and increased integration level. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures, IEEE ASC 201...|$|R
40|$|High {{quality factor}} {{coplanar}} resonators are critical elements in superconducting quantum circuits. We describe the design, fabrication and measurement of stepped impedance resonators (<b>SIRs),</b> which have more compact size than commonly used uniform impedance resonators (UIRs). With properly chosen impedance ratio, <b>SIRs</b> {{can be much}} shorter in total length than that of UIRs. Two kinds of designs containing both <b>SIRs</b> and UIRs are fabricated and measured. The power dependence of the extracted internal quality factors (Qi) for all the resonators indicated that <b>SIRs</b> and UIRs had comparable performance at high incident power. However, as the incident power decreased, the internal quality factor of <b>SIRs</b> decreased much slower than that of UIRs. All the <b>SIRs</b> in design I kept near half-million Qi at single-photon level, while the two UIRs on the same chip decreased heavily to less than 2 × 10 ^ 5. These results indicate potential advantages of <b>SIRs</b> in quantum computer architectures: they consume less space than UIRs, while perform excellent under single-photon level. The resonators in design II were measured under a large residual magnetic field. The measured {{results showed that the}} internal quality factor of all the <b>SIRs</b> and UIRs were more or less suppressed. Such behavior confirmed that trapped vortices in the coplanar resonators provide another loss channel...|$|R
