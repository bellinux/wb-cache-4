6000|$|Our {{boat was}} moored to a deserted quay. Excepting a few fishing vessels visible near us, the harbor of this once prosperous {{place was a}} vast {{solitude}} of water, varied here and there by dreary banks of sand. Looking inland, I saw the lonely buildings of the Dead City--black, grim, and dreadful under the mysterious starlight. Not a human creature, not even a <b>stray</b> <b>animal,</b> was to be seen anywhere. The place might have been desolated by a pestilence, so empty and so lifeless did it now appear. Little {{more than a hundred}} years ago, the record of its population reached sixty thousand. The inhabitants had dwindled to a tenth of that number when I looked at Enkhuizen now! ...|$|E

I will give a low whistle, like this, when I get near you. If you hear any one approaching, and he doesn't whistle, {{challenge}}, but don't shout too loud, or you might be heard by any Kaffirs who may be in search of us. If he don't answer, challenge again, and then step into the bushes. If he comes on, and you are sure it is a man, fire; but don't fire if you have the slightest doubt, for it might be a <b>stray</b> <b>animal,</b> and your rifle might bring the Kaffirs down on us." ...|$|E

60|$|Whether it {{were the}} oracular cow or some other one, {{it did not seem}} {{reasonable}} that she should travel a great way farther. So, whenever they reached a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hill-side, or in a sheltered vale, or flowery meadow, on the shore of a calm lake, or along the bank of a clear stream, Cadmus looked eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home. But still, whether he liked the place or no, the brindled cow never offered to lie down. On she went at the quiet pace of a cow going homeward to the barn-yard; and, every moment, Cadmus expected to see a milkmaid approaching with a pail, or a herdsman running to head the <b>stray</b> <b>animal,</b> and turn her back towards the pasture. But no milkmaid came; no herdsman drove her back; and Cadmus followed the stray Brindle till he was almost ready to drop down with fatigue.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not only}} in {{complexion}} and stature and ways of thinking that Billy and Benham contrasted. Benham inclined a little to eloquence, he liked very clean hands, he had a dread of ridiculous outlines. Prothero lapsed readily into ostentatious slovenliness, when his hands were dirty he pitied them sooner than scrubbed them, he would have worn an overcoat with one tail torn off rather than have gone cold. Moreover, Prothero had an earthy liking for animals, he could stroke and tickle strange cats until they wanted to leave father and mother and all earthly possessions and follow after him, and he mortgaged a term's pocket money and bought and kept a small terrier in the school house against all law and tradition, under the baseless pretence {{that it was a}} <b>stray</b> <b>animal</b> of unknown origin. Benham, on the other hand, was shy with small animals and faintly hostile to big ones. Beasts he thought were just beasts. And Prothero had a gift for caricature, while Benham's aptitude was for music.|$|E
