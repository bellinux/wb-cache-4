5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of the <b>Schengen</b> Area, and because Belgium and France are not part of the Common Travel Area, all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls. Both the British Government and the <b>Schengen</b> governments concerned (Belgium and France) have legal obligations to check the travel documents of those entering their respective countries (as well as those leaving, in the case of Belgium and France).|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 2008, the {{interior}} and justice ministers of European Union in Brussels announced Switzerland's accession to the <b>Schengen</b> passport-free zone from 12 December 2008. The land border checkpoints will remain in place only for goods movements, but should not run controls on people, though people entering the country had their passports checked until 29 March 2009 if they originated from a <b>Schengen</b> nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{police also}} have the {{responsibility}} for prisoner transport during detention, including transport to and from court. The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the <b>Schengen</b> Area. The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as Interpol, Europol, the <b>Schengen</b> Information System, Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations.|$|E
5|$|When the {{tripartite}} agreements were signed, the Belgian Government {{said that}} it had {{serious questions about the}} compatibility of this agreement with the <b>Schengen</b> Convention and the principle of free movement of people enshrined in various European Treaties.|$|E
5|$|While Malta cannot {{unilaterally}} {{drop the}} requirement for nations it makes agreements with to obtain visas to enter the <b>Schengen</b> Area through its border crossing points, it is permitted to offer visa discounts to certain nationalities. At present, Malta has 'visa facilitation agreements' with eight nations: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Macedonia, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strategic}} Croatian {{foreign policy}} {{goal for the}} 2000s was NATO membership. Croatia {{was included in the}} Partnership for Peace in 2000, invited to NATO membership in 2008 and formally joined the alliance on 1 April 2009. Croatia {{became a member of the}} United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term, assuming presidency in December 2008. The country is preparing to join the <b>Schengen</b> Area.|$|E
5|$|European Union {{citizens}} {{have the right}} to travel freely into Malta without completing any special formalities. The nationals of many countries are not required to hold visas to enter Malta, although many are in accordance with uniform European Union regulations. A full list of nationalities required to hold visas to enter Malta and the <b>Schengen</b> Area is published on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' web site.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full {{part of the}} Kingdom of Norway. The {{archipelago}} is administrated by the Governor of Svalbard, {{which is}} subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. Unlike the rest of Norway (including Jan Mayen), Svalbard is a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, and {{is not part of}} the <b>Schengen</b> Area nor the European Economic Area.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} both the Czech Republic and Poland to the European Union in May 2004, and {{especially}} the entry of the countries to the EU's passport-free <b>Schengen</b> zone in late 2007, reduced the significance of territorial disputes, ending systematic controls {{on the border between}} the countries. Signs prohibiting passage across the state border were removed, with people now allowed to cross the border freely at any point of their choosing.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people who visited Malta in 2009 dropped {{considerably}} compared to the figures for 2008 - overall, the country's tourism industry suffered an 8 percent drop from 2008. Visits from non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than visits from European Union countries (and even more so than visits from Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009. Visitors from most countries require a visa to visit Malta. The nationalities requiring a visa are standardised as per European Union rules. Visitors already holding a valid <b>Schengen</b> Area visa most likely will not need to complete any more formalities to enter Malta (so long as they are already inside the <b>Schengen</b> Area). Visitors holding citizenship of the European Union do not require a visa to enter Malta as they hold the right to free movement within the European Union. In recent years, the country's tourism industry has been faced with a number of issues relating to the nation's small size, both in terms of area and population. These issues include stretched resources and infrastructure (such as water, waste management, beaches and roads), especially during the summer months of July and August.|$|E
5|$|To {{operate on}} these lines would require new or heavily {{modified}} rolling stock designed {{to operate at}} these different voltages, {{in addition to those}} already in use. Signalling systems also differ. In addition to the infrastructure difficulties, any potential Eurostar services beyond Paris and Brussels would also require the installation of stringent security measures, due to the UK's not having signed up to the <b>Schengen</b> Agreement, which allows unrestricted movement across borders of member countries.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} <b>Schengen</b> Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, for {{the first}} time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini {{included}} Parliament in talks on the second <b>Schengen</b> Information System even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated {{he would like to}} include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the Treaty of Lisbon. Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Republic of Germany was a {{founding}} member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993. It is part of the <b>Schengen</b> Area, and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7 (formerly G8), the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} has established an Integration Office under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs. To minimise {{the negative consequences}} of Switzerland's isolation from the rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the <b>Schengen</b> Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others. They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances {{that might}} entail military, political, or direct {{economic}} action {{and has been}} neutral {{since the end of}} its expansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations {{and it was the first}} state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s. However, Switzerland does participate in the <b>Schengen</b> Area.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the <b>Schengen</b> Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on {{the banks}} of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of {{population}} density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the <b>Schengen</b> Area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a , characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the <b>Schengen</b> treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Schengen</b> was subsumed {{into the}} EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam, Ireland and the UK {{obtained}} an opt-out from {{the part of}} the treaty which was to incorporate the <b>Schengen</b> rules (or acquis) into EU Law. Under the relevant protocol, Ireland and the United Kingdom may request to participate in aspects of the <b>Schengen</b> acquis but this is subject to the approval of the <b>Schengen</b> states.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, Australian {{citizens}} {{can visit the}} above <b>Schengen</b> member states visa-free for periods of up to three months in each country. If, however, an Australian citizen then visits another <b>Schengen</b> state {{not included in the}} list above, the restriction of no more than three months out of a six-month period in the <b>Schengen</b> area as a whole applies. Therefore, if an Australian citizen has already spent three months in {{one or more of the}} above <b>Schengen</b> countries, any visits to another <b>Schengen</b> country without a bilateral visa waiver agreement with Australia may lead to difficulties with local law enforcement agencies (e.g. being accused of having overstayed upon leaving a <b>Schengen</b> country which is not in the list above).|$|E
25|$|During June 2011 Croatia {{began with}} {{implementation}} of the projects and reforms required to join the <b>Schengen</b> Area by 2015. By joining the <b>Schengen</b> Area, border checks will be eliminated at the land border with Hungary and Slovenia, {{as well as at}} airports and ports for flights and ships to/from <b>Schengen</b> member states, thus facilitating the freer movement of persons between Croatia {{and the rest of the}} <b>Schengen</b> Area.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a New Zealand {{citizen who}} has already spent up to 3 months {{in other parts of}} the <b>Schengen</b> Area can enter Hungary and remain there for up to a further 90 days visa-free. Following the stay in Hungary, if 3 months has already spent {{elsewhere}} in the <b>Schengen</b> area, he/she must then leave the <b>Schengen</b> area from Hungary and go directly to a country outside the <b>Schengen</b> Area.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Schengen</b> Area {{consists}} of 22 European Union member states and four non-members {{who are members}} of EFTA: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are not yet part of the <b>Schengen</b> Area but, nonetheless, have a visa policy that is based on the <b>Schengen</b> acquis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Schengen</b> Area {{consists}} of 26 states, including four {{which are not}} members of the European Union (EU). Two of the non-EU members, Iceland and Norway, {{are part of the}} Nordic Passport Union and are officially classified as 'states associated with the <b>Schengen</b> activities of the EU'. Switzerland was subsequently allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Liechtenstein joined the <b>Schengen</b> Area on 19 December 2011. De facto, the <b>Schengen</b> Area also includes three European micro-statesMonaco, San Marino and the Vatican Citythat maintain open or semi-open borders with other <b>Schengen</b> member countries. Two EU membersIreland and the United Kingdomnegotiated opt-outs from <b>Schengen</b> and continue to operate the Common Travel Area systematic border controls with other EU member states.|$|E
25|$|The {{other four}} microstates are not {{party to the}} <b>Schengen</b> Agreement, cannot issue <b>Schengen</b> visas and, with the {{exception}} of Monaco, {{are not part of the}} <b>Schengen</b> Area. San Marino and the Vatican City are both landlocked states surrounded by Italy. As they both have open borders, they can be considered to be de facto within the <b>Schengen</b> Area, meaning they are not officially in an agreement but are accessible without any border controls. San Marino and the Vatican City do not perform border checks for arrivals from outside <b>Schengen,</b> but these are not needed since neither of them have any airports or seaports. Helicopters are not permitted to go from outside <b>Schengen</b> or from a ship directly to San Marino or the Vatican City.|$|E
25|$|Liechtenstein {{has been}} a member of the <b>Schengen</b> Area since 2011. However, Liechtenstein does not issue visas, and {{recommends}} visitors to apply for a visa in another <b>Schengen</b> country, e.g. Switzerland. Liechtenstein has no border check at the Balzers heliport, so helicopters must go inside <b>Schengen</b> only.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Schengen</b> Agreement {{was signed}} on 14 June 1985 by {{five of the}} ten EEC member states {{in the town of}} <b>Schengen,</b> Luxembourg. The <b>Schengen</b> Area was {{established}} separately from the European Economic Community, when consensus could not be reached among all EC member states on the abolition of border controls.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Schengen</b> Visa is a visa for the <b>Schengen</b> Area, which {{consists}} of the European Economic Area, plus several other adjacent countries. The visa allows visitors {{to stay in the}} <b>Schengen</b> Area for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. The visa is valid for tourism, family visits, and business.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand Government {{has signed}} {{bilateral}} visa waiver agreements {{with a number}} of the individual countries who are <b>Schengen</b> signatories, which allow New Zealand citizens to spend up to three months in the relevant country, without reference to time spent in other <b>Schengen</b> signatory states. Since these agreements continue to remain valid despite the implementation of the <b>Schengen</b> agreement, the European Commission has confirmed that in practice if New Zealanders visit <b>Schengen</b> countries which have signed these types of bilateral agreements with New Zealand, then the terms of these agreements override the conditions normally imposed {{as a result of the}} <b>Schengen</b> visa exemption agreement.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, the Agreement was {{supplemented}} by the <b>Schengen</b> Convention which proposed {{the abolition of}} internal border controls and a common visa policy. It was this Convention that created the <b>Schengen</b> Area through the complete abolition of border controls between <b>Schengen</b> member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial cooperation.|$|E
25|$|While {{nominally}} {{part of the}} <b>Schengen</b> Area, Spain performs {{identity checks}} on all sea and air passengers leaving the enclaves for elsewhere in the <b>Schengen</b> Area.|$|E
25|$|In December 1996 two non-EU member states, Norway and Iceland, {{signed an}} {{association}} {{agreement with the}} signatories of the Agreement {{to become part of}} the <b>Schengen</b> Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the <b>Schengen</b> Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The <b>Schengen</b> Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states. In 2009, Switzerland finalised its official entry to the <b>Schengen</b> Area with the acceptance of an association agreement by popular referendum in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the <b>Schengen</b> Area, and <b>Schengen</b> visas are not valid. However, the islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union and the <b>Schengen</b> Agreement {{provides}} that travellers passing between the islands and the <b>Schengen</b> Area are not to be treated as passing the external frontier of the Area. This means that there is an identity check at air or boat travel to the islands where Nordic citizens on intra-Nordic travel need no passport, only showing the ticket plus identity card.|$|E
25|$|According to the <b>Schengen</b> rules, {{hotels and}} other types of {{commercial}} accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other <b>Schengen</b> states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand. This does not apply to accompanying spouses and minor children or members of travel groups. In addition, a valid identification document has to be produced to the hotel manager or staff. The <b>Schengen</b> rules do not require any other procedures; thus, the <b>Schengen</b> states are free to regulate further details on the content of the registration forms, and identity documents which are to be produced, and may also require the persons exempted from registration by <b>Schengen</b> laws to be registered. Enforcement of these rules varies by country.|$|E
25|$|Although the United Kingdom is {{not part}} of the <b>Schengen</b> passport-free area, it still uses the <b>Schengen</b> Information System, a {{governmental}} database used by European countries to store and disseminate information on individuals and property. This allows the UK to exchange information with countries that are a part of the <b>Schengen</b> agreement, often for the sake of liaising over law enforcement.|$|E
