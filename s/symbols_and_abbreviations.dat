5000|$|A {{variety of}} unit <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> {{have been in}} use for the astronomical unit. In a 1976 resolution, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) used the symbol A for the astronomical unit. In the astronomical literature, the symbol AU was (and remains) common. In 2006, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) {{recommended}} ua as the symbol for the unit. In the non-normative Annex C to ISO 80000-3 (2006), {{the symbol of the}} astronomical unit is [...] "ua". In 2012, the IAU, noting [...] "that various symbols are presently in use for the astronomical unit", recommended the use of the symbol [...] "au".

5000|$|Internet slang (Internet shorthand, cyber-slang, netspeak, or chatspeak) {{refers to}} a variety of slang {{languages}} used by different people on the Internet. An example of Internet slang is [...] "" [...] meaning [...] "laugh out loud". It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature. However, it can be understood to be a type of slang that Internet users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. Such terms often originate with the purpose of saving keystrokes or to compensate for small character limits. Many people use the same abbreviations in texting and instant messaging, and social networking websites. Acronyms, keyboard <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> are common types of Internet slang. New dialects of slang, such as leet or Lolspeak, develop as ingroup internet memes rather than time savers.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to communication in online settings {{is the lack of}} emotional cues. Facial cues dictate the mood and corresponding diction of two people in a conversation. During phone conversations, tone of voice communicates the emotions of the person on the other line. But with chat rooms, instant messaging apps and texting, any signals that would indicate the tone of a person's words or their state of emotion are absent. Because of this, there have been some interesting accommodations. Perhaps the two most prevalent compensating behaviors are the use of emoticons and abbreviations. Emoticons use punctuation marks to illustrate common symbols that pertain to facial cues. For example, one would combine a colon and parenthesis to recreate the symbol of the smiley face indicating the happiness or satisfaction of the other person. To symbolize laughter, the abbreviation [...] "LOL" [...] standing for [...] "laughing out loud" [...] developed. Along with these, countless other <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> have developed including, [...] "BRB" [...] ("be right back"), [...] "TTYL" [...] (talk to you later) and specific designs incorporated by apps of a laughing face, sad face, crying face, angry face etc.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} contains {{recommendations for}} terminology in mass spectrometry. Development of standard terms {{dates back to}} 1974 when the IUPAC Commission on Analytical Nomenclature issued recommendations on mass spectrometry terms and definitions. In 1978, the IUPAC Commission on Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy updated and extended the recommendations and made further recommendations regarding <b>symbols,</b> acronyms, <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations.</b> The IUPAC Physical Chemistry Division Commission on Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy’s Subcommittee on Mass Spectroscopy revised the recommended terms in 1991 and appended terms relating to vacuum technology. Some additional terms related to tandem mass spectrometry were added in 1993 and accelerator mass spectrometry in 1994. Owing to {{the rapid expansion of}} the field in the intervening years, particularly in mass spectrometry of biomolecules, a further revision of the recommendations has become necessary.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks is studying of special features of term–abbreviations and term–symbols in scientific texts. These units in contexts are mainly used with the only indication to interpretation that formalize information presenting and affirms their functioning as independent units together with detailed variants (analogues). In the article the status of <b>abbreviation</b> <b>and</b> symbolic duplets is defined as substitutes, also types of abbreviation duplets are distinguished; symbolic duplets are examined as demonstration of the author’s making of terms. The subject is syntactic terminology of the Ukrainian language, and the object is <b>abbreviation</b> <b>and</b> symbolic variants of the term system of syntax. The aim of the article is to analyze peculiarities of <b>abbreviation</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> functioning in terminology of the Ukrainian language syntax. The tasks of this work are to define the origin of term – <b>abbreviations</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> to classify <b>abbreviation</b> duplets in syntactical system of terms. Analysis of Ukrainian syntactic terms allowed distinguishing the following types of abbreviations: initial abbreviations (lettered, sound <b>abbreviations</b> <b>and</b> combined). We are going to distinguish symbol words as the manifestation of author’s term forming. The process of term substitution in texts is caused by logical, terminological, linguistic reasons, and it also partially depends on text style where it is used...|$|R

50|$|Developed in 2007 and {{produced}} {{for sale in}} 2008, the Sony XEL-1 is the world's first organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television. It was also the world's thinnest television during its production, at 3 mm. It has a screen size of 11 inches with a native resolution 960×540. As the screen is too thin for I/O ports and buttons, Sony has connected the screen to a non-detachable base that contains these. The top of the base has the speaker and the power, volume, channel, input, and menu buttons, which are backlit so the <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> change when the XMB interface is accessed. The back of the panel has a DMeX service input, a 16-volt DC input, a VHF/UHF/cable input, a Memory Stick slot, and two HDMI inputs. On {{the left side of}} the panel there is an analog/digital audio output. The XEL-1 has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, high color saturation, large viewing angles, high screen uniformity, and low power consumption. On the other hand, it has poor primary color accuracy, a quarter of the full HD resolution (1920×1080), no anti-judder processing, a light-reflective screen, few inputs, a non-detachable panel, a small screen and a MSRP of US$2,499.99. It was sold in the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, Europe and Australia.|$|E
50|$|The first {{international}} standard for thesauri was ISO 2788, Guidelines {{for the establishment}} and development of monolingual thesauri, originally published in 1974 and updated in 1986. In 1985 it was joined by the complementary standard ISO 5964, Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri.Over the years ISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were adopted as national standards in several countries, for example Canada, France and UK. In the UK they were given alias numbers BS 5723 and BS 6723 respectively. And {{it was in the}} UK {{around the turn of the}} century that work began to revise them for the networking needs of the new millennium. This resulted during 2005 - 2008 in publication of the 5-part British Standard BS 8723, as follows: BS 8723 Structured vocabularies for information retrieval - Guide Part 1: Definitions, <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> Part 2: Thesauri Part 3: Vocabularies other than thesauri Part 4: Interoperability between vocabularies Part 5: Exchange formats and protocols for interoperabilityEven before the last part of BS 8723 was published, work began to adopt and adapt it as an international standard to replace ISO 2788 and ISO 5964. The project was led by a Working Group of ISO’s Technical Committee 46 (Information and documentation) Subcommittee 9 (Identification and description) known as “ISO TC46/SC9/WG8 Structured Vocabularies”.|$|E

5000|$|During its short {{commercial}} lifetime, the Fizmo {{was much}} criticized {{because of its}} unfinished operating system, editing peculiarities, unreliability (concerning problems with the external power supply adapter and/or the Fizmo's internal power supply DC regulator) and misunderstood concept and sound. To access most of the operating system, the software tool Emagic SoundDiver is required (A Fizmo Only version of the editor can be downloaded free from the Fizmo User's Yahoo Group - see below). To make things worse, its physical appearance wasn't welcomed. While it sported an analog synth-like appearance, it didn't sound like its virtual analog contemporaries (Roland JP-8000, Yamaha AN1x, and Clavia Nord Lead, for example), didn't sound like additive synthesizers (like Kawai K5000s), and to be fair, didn't sound like anything else. Also, its retro-looking 4-digit 7-segment display didn't convince magazines or customers with its cryptic <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> strange <b>abbreviations.</b> But like many vanished, past-criticized things, the Fizmo found a loyal group of users which accepted it [...] "as it is" [...] and reached a curious cult status. An estimated 500-2,000 were produced. 100-500 limited-run rack versions were also produced, comprising the full Fizmo's panel into a 5-unit rack standard.|$|R
5000|$|A text-to-speech system (or [...] "engine") is {{composed}} of two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end has two major tasks. First, it converts raw text containing <b>symbols</b> like numbers <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> into the equivalent of written-out words. This process is often called text normalization, pre-processing, or tokenization. The front-end then assigns phonetic transcriptions to each word, and divides and marks the text into prosodic units, like phrases, clauses, and sentences. The process of assigning phonetic transcriptions to words is called text-to-phoneme or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Phonetic transcriptions and prosody information together make up the symbolic linguistic representation that is output by the front-end. The back-end—often {{referred to as the}} synthesizer—then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into sound. In certain systems, this part includes the computation of the target prosody (pitch contour, phoneme durations), which is then imposed on the output speech.|$|R

40|$|Chart {{adequacy}} and completeness information {{consists of}} the <b>symbols,</b> <b>abbreviations</b> <b>and</b> warnings used to inform mariners {{of the level of}} confidence that should be given to data on a nautical chart. This information is derived both from the nautical chart and sailing directions. However, analysis based solely on these datasets is limited without access to the sources (e. g., smooth sheets). Publically-available, multi-spectral satellite imagery and published algorithms can be used to derive estimates of the relative bathymetry in shallow, clear waters. In this study, we evaluate the potential of these methods for supplementing the procedure to assess the adequacy of hydrographic surveying and nautical charting coverage. Optically-derived bathymetry provides information in areas that have not been surveyed and monitor any seafloor changes that may have occurred since the last survey of the area. Preliminary results show that multi-spectral satellite remote sensing is also potentially beneficial as a reconnaissance tool prior to a hydrographic acoustic survey...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{handwriting}} recognition algorithms {{rely heavily on}} small lexicons and clean word images. Unfortunately, emergency medical documents do not satisfy either of these conditions. This paper describes a strategy whereby given an image representing a noisy handwritten word from a medical document, and a large lexicon consisting of English, medical <b>and</b> pharmacological words, <b>symbols,</b> <b>abbreviations</b> <b>and</b> acronyms, significantly reduces {{the size of the}} lexicon while keeping the unknown desired entry within the lexicon. An approach for segmenting handwritten text is also presented. Stroke analyses are performed and image primitives are extracted for word detection. A heuristics-based approach, involving gap spacing, height transitions, and the average stroke width of the writer is used in detecting word boundaries. Experiments show perfect segmentation of 69 %, outperforming the more tested and proven algorithms by as much as 15 %.
