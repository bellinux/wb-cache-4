25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> left heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E

6000|$|... "So, pretty lady," [...] said I to myself, [...] "we shall <b>see</b> <b>if</b> {{presently}} <b>your</b> lip will curl when I {{show you}} something of my wizard's art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum! we {{may prove}} that. In two days' {{time is the}} vepres du tournoi, when we may <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> lance is as quick as your wit." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Tut, man, we {{must take}} things as they come. You stick to me, and I'll stick to you, and we'll pull through together. You shall sign the cheques to-morrow night, and we shall <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> luck is better than mine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then do it. I'll pierce your ears, and {{you must}} wear a bit of silk in them till they are well; your curls will hide them nicely; then, some day, slip in your {{smallest}} ear-rings, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> uncle don't like them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we're ready. Where's your papa? I {{think it}} time this baggage was set out. Do look out, Eva, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you <b>see</b> <b>your</b> papa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} had time to see," [...] Jethro replied. [...] "Let me help you to your feet, and let us <b>see</b> <b>if</b> any of <b>your</b> ribs are broken. I will see about her afterward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May, {{look out}} {{and see what we}} found in the stable. None of us can catch him, so do come and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you can; <b>your</b> name is on the card tied to his mane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can look}} among the prisoners and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> friend is here. If he is, {{when you see him}} brought in you must come in and repeat your story. By the way, how did you {{understand}} what this Arab said about his father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you see that, {{if we go}} on so three evenings, {{you will}} all have got three lessons, and the fourth evening we will have for recitation. I will hear you spell, and examine your writing, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> sums are done right." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{depends upon}} what you <b>see.</b> <b>If</b> <b>your</b> {{surroundings}} never change, {{you come to}} know them too well and begin to think that nothing different is possible. It makes one narrow. We may both need patience, Craig, before we learn to understand each other's point of view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ask nothing better," [...] {{cried the}} eldest, [...] "than {{to have the}} Sultan's baker for a husband.

6000|$|FRIEDRICH. [...] "Your effrontery astonishes me. After {{what you}} have done, and what is clear as day, you persist, instead of owning {{yourself}} culpable. Do not imagine you will make people believe that black is white; when one [ON, meaning I] does not see, the reason [sic]? ONE p. 218, book XVI +++++++++++++++++ is, one {{does not want to}} <b>see</b> everything.

Also that she knows that he is in love with her. In fact, she told me so. And you will see she rather likes it. Every married woman requires a holiday from her husband occasionally, even when he suits her perfectly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel! weel! sae let it be. Bide awhile, {{and rest}} ye. We'll no' chairge ye for that--and we'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> husband comes.

40|$|I have {{developed}} a reputation on The Street— Wall Street, that is. I am known as the toughest hiring manager of technical communicators in the New York Financial Market. It’s a specialty niche, I admit. But I’m proud of that reputation. In 2000, I screened 327 resumes and I hired 21 technical communicators. If you do the math, you’ll <b>see</b> that <b>if</b> <b>your</b> resume came to me, there was only about a 6. 4 percent chance I’d hire you. I also {{have a reputation for}} being successful—for hiring solid all-around employees who fit well in our environment and who produce customer-pleasing results.

Edgar would never have done that, and in that case it is pretty certain that they would have chopped his head off. As it is, the chief of these Arabs who took him evidently means to keep him as a slave for himself. Of course it is not {{pleasant}} to be a slave, but it is better than having the choice between worshipping a greasy Arab or having your head chopped off, and it will give him time to learn the language, to make his plans of escape, and to carry them out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will {{certainly}} do that, Miss Myrtle, and I think {{it a very}} wise precaution on your part.
