40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Exclusive {{breast feeding}} is highly {{recommended}} {{for children under}} six months and {{the best time for}} starting supplementary food is the end of sixth months. Inadequate feeding can lead to malnutrition. Since infants' supplementary feeding pattern is influenced highly by the socio-cultural status; it is necessary to study the subject in diverse conditions. This study aimed to investigate supplementary feeding pattern in 6 - 12 months children referred to Ilam clinics in 2002. Methods &amp; Materials: In this study, 364 mothers with 6 - 12 months children were selected using convenient sampling method from 10 health care centers. Data were collected using a four-sectioned questionnaire including mothers and their babies demographic characteristics, feeding pattern (frequency, the type of milk), supplementary food (the age of onset and the type of the first supplementary food, the time of starting mixed foods, and the source of information about supplementary food) and mothers' performance about feeding with supplementary food. The questionnaire was filled via interview. Results: Findings showed that the growth curve in 84. 8 % of babies was in the health road. About 38 % of babies were the first child. In 50. 9 % of samples, supplementary food was started before 6 months of age and in 49. 9 % of the cases, it was started after 6 month old. Supplementary feeding accompanied with breast feeding in 83. 5 % of the infants. The most used supplementary food was rice mucilage (40. 8 % of the babies). The interval between starting one supplementary food and the other one was 3 - 4 days in 50. 2 % of the cases. Also 80. 8 % of samples started feeding in the amount of one spoon and increased it gradually. The majority of mothers (64 %) did not add sugar, salt and spices in order to attract their babies. As well, 75. 6 % of <b>samples</b> used <b>spoon</b> and cup for feeding and 92. 9 % knew the safe time for keeping cooked food in the refrigerator. The source of information about supplementary feeding in 65. 4 % of mothers was health care providers and in 5 % were books and booklets. Conclusion: Findings indicated {{that more than half of}} mothers began supplementary feeding for their children before 6 months old without pursuing any accepted pattern. It seems that usual educational programs in Ilam were unable to answer all the problems aroused in this issue. Hence, educating mothers using other methods such as visual teaching material is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{pollution}} in the Laurentian Great Lakes is becoming a significant environmental concern with the threats of species entanglement, adsorption of toxins such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and persistent organic molecules (POPs), and subsequent ingestion. Lake Erie tributary (by Petite Ponar), beach (by Split <b>Spoon</b> <b>sampler),</b> and benthic sediments (by Shipek grabs) were collected and evaluated for microplastic particles (0. 5 mm) (by quadrats and transects). These results were mapped using ArcGIS software to show distribution and abundance in regards to quaternary watershed population density and plastic industrial plants, manufacturers, and distributors. Tributaries in urban areas were more abundant in microplastics than in more rural tributaries. At beaches, backshores were more abundant in microplastics than in the foreshore, likely due to natural beach dynamics of sediment accumulation. The greatest abundance of microplastics {{was found in the}} Western Basin of Lake Erie, where the Detroit River drains into the lake. Quaternary watersheds borderingLake Eriewith higher population densities were most abundant in microplastic and macroplastic pollution. Macroplastics were most abundant at beaches in highly populated areas, and macroplastics were least abundant at beaches that were part of conservation areas. A random selection of microplastic fragments and microbeads were analysed using Nicolet Almega Dispersive Raman Spectroscopy and NXR FT-Raman Spectroscopy to determine types of plastics. Polyethylene was the most common microplastic observed among this sample selection. Overall, high population density around the sampling locations correlated to a higher abundance in plastic debris. Conservation areas had the lowest abundance of plastic debris; therefore, employing conservation area environmental practices could be beneficial to reducing plastic debris at other locations along Lake Erie...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results and}} conclusions from a research program that developed a nondestructive indicator of sample disturbance in saturated soft clays using soil suction. A portable, field deployable, suction probe {{was designed and}} built for the research using primarily off-the-shelf parts and the procedures developed for its use {{in the field are}} relatively simple to perform. ^ The probe, once placed in contact with an unconfined soil sample, requires approximately 10 to 20 minutes to reach equilibrium with the suction in the sample. The measurements were found to be accurate and repeatable based on laboratory proof testing of the device and its subsequent use in the field during sampling operations. ^ A test site located in northeast Massachusetts was used to evaluate the suction probe. The site contains a 10 m layer of Boston Blue Clay with a thin, stiff upper crust followed by a medium to low overconsolidation ratio soft layer. A series of samples ranging from high quality to poor quality were collected including Sherbrooke block samples (high quality), 76 mm fixed piston tube samples with modified tube geometry, 76 mm free piston tube samples, and 76 mm split <b>spoon</b> <b>samples</b> (very poor quality). ^ Soil suction was measured on all samples in the field and subsequently over time in the laboratory. Sample quality was evaluated using the well established but destructive volumetric strain method (i. e., 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;vol or Δe/e 0 at σ′vo) from the consolidation phase of CRS, CAUC, and DSS tests. The suction values were found to generally mirror that of the volumetric strain measurements, with higher suction values correlating with lower volumetric strains, and hence better quality samples. Normalization of the suction values by σ′ vo provides better resolution of the data and is hence used for development of a suggested nondestructive sample quality criterion for clays using soil suction. ...|$|R
40|$|Sanitation {{conditions}} and microbiological quality of 52 “Clean Food Good Taste” restaurants in Hat Yai city municipality were examined using a standard food sanitation survey checklist {{based on the}} Department of Health and Department of Medical Science, Ministry of Public Health. Coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were investigated in samples of foods and drinking water, whereas total bacterial count (TBC) {{was carried out in}} samples of foods, plates, spoons, glasses and food handlers. The methods of investigation were the Most Probable Number (MPN) method for coliform bacteria, E. coli and the standard plate count method for TBC. The SI- 2 field test kit was used to indicate microbiological contamination, particularly coliform bacteria. It was found that 38 / 52 (73. 1 %) restaurants passed all items of food sanitation standard. The food sanitation condition with the lowest number passing was the dressing of food handlers (45 / 52, 86. 5 %) followed by the area for eating, preparing and cooking (47 / 52, 90. 4 %). Microbiological quality of food samples based on both MPN of coliform bacteria and E. coli was at an acceptable level in 190 / 202 samples (94. 1 %). However, in samples of drinking water only 19 / 52 (36. 5 %) passed the MPN standard for coliform bacteria and 45 / 52 (86. 5 %) that for E. coli. Moreover, among the 52 restaurants, the numbers (percentages) passing the standard TBC in <b>samples</b> of plate, <b>spoon,</b> glass, cooker handlers and server handlers were 32 (61. 5 %), 27 (51. 9 %), 20 (38. 5 %), 2 (3. 9 %) and 1 (1. 9 %), respectively. Comparison of microbiological quality between the SI- 2 test kit and MPN coliform/TBC showed no significant differences for samples of foods, but significant differences {{for the rest of the}} samples (p< 0. 05, t-test) ...|$|R
40|$|Elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) is {{expected}} to be achieved through Universal Salt lodization (USI) where at least 90 percent of households consume iodised salt that contained sufficient iodine i. e. 30 ppm of potassium iodate. At national level, simple semi quantitative test kit is used to estimate and monitor of iodine content in salt at household level. However, result of estimation of iodine content in salt maybe influenced by the obsener. This paper present the influenced of observers in the estimation of iodine content in salt using semi quantitative tes kit. Methods. Forty five house wives and forty five cadres in Bantul District, Yogyakarta were selected purposively as observer. Every test observer was asked to bring salt <b>sample</b> (3 tables <b>spoon).</b> The observation was conducted twice where the second observation was done 2 weeks after the first observation. The semi quantitative test kit used in this study was test kit that developed by BP 2 GAKI, Magelang. The analysis chi square and F-test was done to examine the influenced of test observer on the result of iodine content compared to the iodometric titration as a reference method. Results. The results showed that observation test from 60, 46 % of house wives and 71, 10 % cadres at the first obsenation was similar to with the reference method. However, at the second observation test, only 52, 38 %, of house wives and 56, 82 % of cadres was similar to with the reference method (p> 0. 05). Result from group of 34 - 44 years of age had the highest coincidence with reference method.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the ILC which focused on the determination of the food contact surface area of kitchen utensils. The general aim of the exercise was to assess the capability of official control laboratories to measure the food contact surface area of kitchen utensils and to compare the most commonly used approaches for the determination of the surface area in terms of reproducibility and trueness. the ILC 01 2012 highlighted several issues in the determination of the surface area of kitchen utensils. The results for the food contact surface area of a melamine <b>spoon</b> <b>sample</b> ranged from 0. 73 - 1. 99 dm 2. Iin order to figure out whether the approaches that were used for the determination of the surface area were unsuitable or the performance of the laboratories was unacceptable. The test materials were five different types of plastic kitchen utensils obtained from a global supplier. Homogeneity studies on width, depth, length and thickness of the samples were carried out by the EURL-FCM. They indicated sufficient sample homogeneity. Samples were dispatched to 67 participants (30 NRLs + 37 national official control laboratories from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), 63 of them submitted results for the surface area and 53 for the envelope volume. Results showed a satisfactory laboratory performance. Difficulties were observed for the determination of the sample height that will be foreseeably in food contact (Hf). They would not affect migration results if the migration is constant over the entire sample surface, i. e. unless the tested articles are multi-material products or have a printing on the handle. For the determination of the surface area, the trueness and precision of the methods depended on the sample shape. With respect to the final migration result, the obtained reproducibility standard deviations for all four approaches were acceptable considering that the migration measurement itself can be affected by uncertainties of similar levels as those of the determination of the surface area.

40|$|The use of {{different}} 			pressuremeters for in-situ soil testing is now well established. The 			pressuremeters, which provide high quality design parameters, are 			affordable on high cost projects only. Small cost projects permit 			the use of low cost techniques only (e. g. SPT), which often yield 			poor quality design parameters. Usually pressuremeters are employed 			for soil characterization using pre-bored or self-boring or 			full-displacement techniques. There {{was a need}} to develop a device 			in Pakistan that could be used as pre-bored as well as 			full-displacement pressuremeter for characterizing the alluvial soil 			deposits of Punjab province. Moreover, the new device should be 			simple, robust, cost effective and still produces parameters of high 			quality. 			This thesis describes the development of such a new in-situ testing 			device; namely the New Pressuremeter. Certain modifications have 			been made to the design of Newcastle Full-Displacement Pressuremeter 			(NFDPM), developed earlier by Akbar (2001) that has a radial 			displacement measurement system. The length of the probe of NFDPM is 			 420 mm (length to diameter ratio of 8. 4), which creates handling 			problems in the field. To overcome this difficulty it was decided to 			reduce the length of the test section and to keep the length of the 			probe of the new device equal to the length of SPT split <b>spoon</b> 			<b>sampler</b> to get benefit from the available large SPT data. On the 			basis of this fact, the length of the probe of the new device was 			taken as 305 mm giving length to diameter ratio of 6. 3. The analysis 			of a pressuremeter test {{is based on the assumption}} that the membrane 			expands as a right circular cylinder. 			With modifications, the new pressuremeter was developed using most 			of the local resources. The main body of the 48. 2 mm diameter (D) 			probe is made of high strength stainless steel. Both ends of the 			main body are identical. The upper end of the probe is connected to 			drill rods used to push the probe into place. A pressure hose and 			electrical cable pass through the drill rods and are connected to 			the probe by a re-usable hydraulic fitting.

40|$|The Newcastle {{dilatometer}} (NDMT) is {{a distinct}} in-situ geotechnical investigation device developed at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK in 2001. The NDMT compatibility in medium-to-stiff cohesive and loose-to-medium cohesionless normally consolidated soil deposits has already been proved. The NDMT compatibility in overconsolidated cohesive and cohesionless soil deposits {{is yet to be}} established in-order to extend its application to larger variety of soils. Moreover, the stresses in soils due to pushing of the NDMT probe or expansion of the rigid piston are also to be investigated experimentally. These objectives were achieved in this research through an extensive field and laboratory investigation program comprising of the Newcastle Dilatometer Test (NDMT), Cone Penetration Test (CPT) and Standard Penetration Test (SPT). Test pits were excavated adjacent to the in-situ test locations for the collection of undisturbed (UD) soil samples. Laboratory tests were performed on undisturbed soil samples from the test pits which included; resonant column, triaxial compression, consolidation, and unconfined compression tests. The disturbed soil samples obtained from SPT <b>spoon</b> <b>sampler</b> were subjected to laboratory tests such as; natural moisture content, particles size analysis, Atterberg limits, specific gravity, maximum and minimum unit weight, direct shear, and permeability. The estimation of soil properties such as bulk unit weight, relative density, pre-consolidation pressure, overconsolidation ratio, coefficient of earth pressure at rest, undrained shear strength, friction angle, shear modulus, constrained modulus, and shear wave velocity were assessed from the NDMT data in comparison with laboratory, CPT and the SPT tests invariably. The horizontal stress index (KD) was found to be the most comparable parameter from the NDMT in overconsolidated soils for deriving various correlations with laboratory and other in-situ test (CPT/SPT) parameters. The NDMT pressure penetration curves were analyzed likewise the pressuremeter test and it was observed that the soil properties especially the strength and stiffness are functions of the NDMT pressure penetration profile. The determination of strength and stiffness from the analysis of the final unloading portion of the NDMT curve is the exclusive finding of this research, which can eliminate the need of inducing unload-reload loop in the pressure penetration profile of the NDMT. Correlations between soil stiffness (small strain and static shear modulus) and limit pressure obtained from the NDMT are also explored. This thesis also presents the development and test results of a calibration chamber assembly equipped with load cells, hydraulic pushing system and sample preparation system. The assembly was successfully used to determine stresses in soils due to pushing the NDMT probe and expansion of the NDMT piston. It was found that stresses during loading of the soil during testing and pushing of the NDMT remains quite uniform. It is concluded that the NDMT has a strong potential as a substitute in-situ test device. Further, the device has the capability; if not fully to replace the laboratory and other in-situ tests in geotechnical engineering. However, more research is required to enhance the capabilities of the NDMT in geotechnical engineering practice by strengthening the correlations and findings suggested in this study...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2009. Major: Geology. Advisor: Dr. Howard D. Mooers. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvii, 172 pages, appendix A. Subsurface correlation of aquifer and aquitard materials can be challenging, especially in glaciated terrain, because of complexity in the thickness and lateral {{extent of the}} depositional units and a general scarcity of data. Geostatistical methods provide a means for exploring that correlation structure, allowing comparisons of results from different geomorphological settings and approaches to populating the hydraulic conductivity arrays of numerical groundwater flow models. In this study, indicator geostatistics and transition probability geostatistics are applied to nearly 300 km of drilling data derived mainly from over 11, 000 private well drilling logs. Analyses are focused on a nearly 12, 000 -km 2 region in central Minnesota comprised of four counties plus {{a portion of a}} fifth, in a setting dominated by the Rainy, Superior, and Wadena lobes of late-Wisconsinan glaciation. The area of interest surrounds Camp Ripley, a 210 -km 2 Minnesota National Guard training facility. Data for Camp Ripley include 208 monitoring wells with detailed logging information obtained through split <b>spoon</b> <b>sampling</b> and nine even higher quality rotasonic boreholes. These data provide a basis for comparison of high-quality data to the abundant water well logs in the surrounding counties. The drilling data are categorized according to the logged sediment descriptions. In one scheme, the materials are separated according to presumed high or low hydraulic conductivity (K) for use in binary indicator geostatistical and transition probability geostatistical analyses. In another, the number of categories is expanded to five on the basis of combined K and depositional setting information for use in a separate transition probability geostatistical analysis. The drilling data are separated into different geomorphological settings associated with various depositional environments of several ice advances. Vertical variograms are very well supported in all geomorphological areas, while lateral variograms vary from well supported to indecipherable scatter. The ratio of vertical to lateral range varies but has an average value of ten. Results for the numerous geomorphological settings indicate overlapping geostatistical parameters in terms of ranges, sills, and vertical lens thicknesses. A lack of stationarity was observed, consistent with a fundamental complexity of glacial depositional and erosional processes. Correlation generally varied as much between geographically distinct zones of like geomorphology as it did between zones of different geomorphology. High-resolution data associated with monitoring well installation typically deviated from the private well data; this is attributed to site-specific geology and detailed logging of thin units. Indicator variography and kriging, as well as binary and 5 -category transition probability geostatistical simulation, were applied to a drilling data set in the Camp Ripley vicinity to evaluate their relative capability for 3 -D numerical modeling of regional groundwater flow in the glacial drift. For the kriging approach, the flow model relied on the kriging results by grading the K values between high and low values {{on the basis of the}} indicator output. Calibration was performed by systematic testing of various plausible end members of the K range. The transition probability runs were calibrated by stochastic inverse modeling. A baseline single-K analysis was also calibrated through inverse modeling. Resulting K values from all four approaches were comparable, with the indicator kriging providing a slight edge in terms of the calculated errors at calibration targets. The modeling suggests that in complex glaciated terrain, in which lateral correlation of hydrostratigraphic units is small relative to grid spacing and drilling data spacing, a single-K model provides a suitable approach to determining regional groundwater flow, despite the large contrasts in K prevalent in glacial drift materials...|$|R
