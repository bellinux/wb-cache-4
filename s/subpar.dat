5|$|The Menacer {{is remembered}} as a {{critical}} and commercial flop. Critics found the six-game pack <b>subpar</b> and repetitive, and criticized the peripheral's lack of games. The ToeJam & Earl spinoff game {{was held in the}} highest regard, and reviewers recommended the Menacer-compatible Terminator 2 game. A direct-to-TV light gun that includes the six-game Menacer pack was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and <b>subpar</b> games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, the project {{would not have been}} possible. The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at £40k. Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews and}} sales estimates ranged from <b>subpar</b> to par. Reviewers praised Kameo graphics as setting {{standards for the}} new console, and noted its vivid color palette. Their criticism focused on the gameplay, in particular its repetition, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overbearing tutorial. Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core morphing concept. They had high praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.|$|E
5|$|Simms' {{next four}} years were marred by {{injuries}} and inconsistent play. He finished the 1980 season with 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, while completing a <b>subpar</b> 48.0% of his passes for 2,321yards. In 1981, Simms threw for 2,031yards, 11 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions on 54.4% completion percentage before suffering a separated shoulder in a November 15 loss to the Washington Redskins. With Simms out, the Giants went on a run led by Scott Brunner and advanced to {{the second round of}} the playoffs. Simms suffered a torn knee ligament in a preseason game against the New York Jets, preventing him from playing the entire 1982 season. Following the season, Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the University of Alabama, and was replaced by the team's defensive coordinator Bill Parcells. In the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Simms.|$|E
5|$|Although USC coach Pete Carroll {{and many}} scouts {{considered}} him too inexperienced, Sanchez announced {{his intention to}} enter the 2009 NFL Draft. He was selected by the Jets after they traded up with the Cleveland Browns, and was named the starting quarterback {{prior to the start}} of the season. Despite a <b>subpar</b> performance, Sanchez led the Jets to the AFC Championship Game, a losing effort to the Indianapolis Colts, becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first playoff game and the second to win two playoff games. In his second season, Sanchez continued to develop and led the Jets to the playoffs and the team's second consecutive AFC Championship Game where they narrowly lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24–19. With the win over the New England Patriots the week prior, Sanchez tied four other quarterbacks for the second most post-season road victories by a quarterback in NFL history. In leading the Jets to two consecutive conference championships, Sanchez joined quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the conference championship in their first two seasons in the league.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a <b>subpar</b> stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Parcells {{first year}} proved difficult. In {{his first major}} {{decision}} as head coach, he decided to bench Simms in favor of Brunner {{based on what he}} had done in the 1981 season after Simms was injured. At first it appeared that Parcells' decision was justified, especially after a 27–3 victory over the Green Bay Packers gave the Giants a 2–2 record after 4 games. However, the Giants collapsed from there. The team went winless in their next seven games, losing six and garnering a tie with the St. Louis Cardinals, before defeating the Philadelphia Eagles to end the streak. The Giants then lost their remaining games to finish with a 3-12-1 record, including a 1-6-1 division record and a 1-7 home record (their only win was the game against the Packers; they defeated the Eagles at Veterans Stadium and their first win came at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium against the Falcons). Brunner had a <b>subpar</b> season, completing just 49.2% of his passes and throwing 9 touchdowns against 22 interceptions.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 2010, Sanchez {{underwent}} {{surgery to repair}} the patella ligament in his left knee that he originally injured when he played for USC. The surgery was successful. Sanchez was expected to miss early workouts and return in time for training camp however Sanchez made a quick recovery and participated in team drills during Organized Team Activities (OTA). The Jets opened the 2010 season with a 5–1 record despite the passing game being <b>subpar</b> as Sanchez struggled to accurately throw the football. Sanchez recorded his first career 300-yard passing game in a win over the Detroit Lions on November 7, 2010. At 10–4, the Jets faced the Chicago Bears on December 26, 2010 {{with a chance to}} clinch a playoff berth. Though Sanchez injured his shoulder in a victory over Pittsburgh the previous week, he started the game completing 24 of his 37 passes for a touchdown and an interception. However, the Jets were unable to defend the Bears' offense and subsequently lost the game 38–34 after a comeback drive was halted when Sanchez was intercepted. Due to a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars that same day, the Jets clinched the playoff berth. Sanchez finished the season with 3,291 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.|$|E
25|$|Also, Western {{critics have}} {{generally}} considered most newer JRPGs {{to be either}} average or <b>subpar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>subpar</b> {{performances}} in Test and ODI play, the West Indies were confident {{heading into the}} tournament. Much of {{this was due to}} the number of players with IPL experience and that the majority were part of the 2012 champion squad, off-spinner Sunil Narine and all-rounder Kieron Pollard being notable exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Major {{criticisms of}} the GTO {{continued}} to center on its slow steering (ratio of 17.5:1, four turns lock-to-lock) and <b>subpar</b> brakes. Car Life was satisfied with the metallic brakes on its GTO, but Motor Trend and Road Test found the four-wheel drum brakes with organic linings to be alarmingly inadequate in high-speed driving.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017, HFR – a {{hedge fund}} {{research}} data and service provider – reported {{that there were more}} hedge-fund closures in 2016 than during the 2009 recession. According to the report, several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds, because the funds’ <b>subpar</b> performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged.|$|E
25|$|Problems arose {{with the}} web press. The main {{drawback}} was {{its inability to}} sustain long continuous runs compared to the standard (Giori) sheet fed method of intaglio printing, resulting in constant breakdown. In addition, {{the quality of the}} prints were <b>subpar</b> compared to the established method. Due to these factors, the web press was discontinued in July 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Braves did {{not perform}} at the level they had grown {{accustomed}} to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and <b>subpar</b> bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6-21 record {{for the month of}} June, the worst month ever in the city of Atlanta, and just percentage points better than the Boston Braves of May 1935 (4-20).|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} round of the 1984 NBA Playoffs, Thomas and the Pistons faced off against Bernard King and the New York Knicks. In the pivotal fifth game, Thomas was having a <b>subpar</b> performance, while Bernard King was having an {{excellent}} game. Thomas scored 16 points in the last 94 seconds to force the game into overtime. Isiah then fouled out in overtime, however, and the Knicks held on to win.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the German Defence Ministry {{lost its}} lawsuit filed against Heckler & Koch on the ministry's claim for {{compensation}} or warranty work on the <b>subpar</b> G36 rifles, because the Bundeswehr did not make its specifications for the weapon clear enough {{in the beginning of}} the procurement process. The District Court of Koblenz rejected claims from the Bundeswehr procurement office, and ruled that weapon manufacturer Heckler & Koch did not have to pay damages on the 167,000 rifles still in use out of more than 176,000 G36 rifles Germany had originally purchased.|$|E
25|$|The Historic Park Street Business District {{is known}} for its many {{buildings}} that date back to the 1800s and is a designated Historic Commercial District on the National Register. This main thoroughfare of downtown Alameda Is filled with local shops, restaurants, drinking establishments, and services. The renovated 1932 Alameda Theatre & Cineplex is the cultural centerpiece of the commercial district. In addition, popular attractions include High Scores Arcade Museum (a retro video game arcade) and <b>Subpar</b> Miniature Golf (an indoor miniature golf complex that features Bay Area landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Coit Tower at each hole).|$|E
25|$|The Sign o' the Times {{tour was}} a success overseas, and Warner Bros. and Prince's {{managers}} wanted {{to bring it to}} the US to promote sales of the album; however, Prince balked at a full US tour, as he was ready to produce a new album. As a compromise, the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed <b>subpar,</b> and reshoots were performed at Prince's Paisley Park studios. The film Sign o' the Times was released on November 20, 1987. The film got better reviews than Under the Cherry Moon, but its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.|$|E
25|$|Following two <b>subpar</b> {{defensive}} performances, the Buccaneers {{held the}} Bills without a touchdown until the fourth quarter, when the Buccaneers {{already had a}} 31–3 lead. Buc defenders cheered a return to their regular 3–4 alignment. Johnny Davis gained 78 yards on 18 carries after a Bills player fell on Ricky Bell's knee. The injury to Bell, combined with the earlier injuries to Doug Williams and Jimmy DuBose, left the Buccaneers without their entire starting backfield. Buccaneers running backs nevertheless combined for 204 yards. Bell and Davis ran for a touchdown each. Mike Rae threw two touchdown passes; one to Morris Owens, and another to Jimmie Giles {{for the first of}} Giles’ career.|$|E
25|$|After three <b>subpar</b> {{games in}} Weeks 2-4, Warner was {{replaced}} at quarterback by rookie Matt Leinart {{in the fourth}} quarter of week 4. Then-coach Dennis Green stated that Warner would be the backup quarterback for the remainder of the season. In week 16, Leinart went down with a shoulder injury against the 49ers, forcing Warner to see his first action since week 4. Warner filled in nicely, as he was able to hang on for the Cardinals win. In week 17 against the San Diego Chargers, Warner started again in place of the injured Leinart, throwing for 365 yards (which led the NFL for that week) and a touchdown, though the Chargers were able to hang on for a 27–20 win.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the Bears' {{defense was}} even stingier {{coming off the}} Super Bowl {{establishing}} a new NFL record low for 187 points allowed as the Bears finished with another NFC Central title and a 14–2 record. The Bears attempt to defend their Super Bowl title took a blow when Jim McMahon suffered an injury {{as the result of}} an illegal hit by Packers' defender Charles Martin. McMahon threw an interception and was slammed into the turf by Martin, injuring his shoulder and ending his season, which had already been <b>subpar.</b> Doug Flutie took over, but proved to be ineffective as the Bears were shocked by the Washington Redskins in the divisional playoffs, 27–13. A notable game in '86 was the inaugural American Bowl, being the first Bears game outside of North America, with the Bears defeating the Cowboys 17–6 in Wembley Stadium.|$|E
25|$|After an {{inconclusive}} year in pinstripes, New York fans {{hoped that}} Johnson {{would return to}} his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished {{the season with a}} 17–11 record, a <b>subpar</b> 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It had been revealed {{at the end of the}} 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure had caused him to miss his last start of 2006. After being given epidural anesthesia and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS, however he gave up 5 runs in 5 innings.|$|E
25|$|In September 1979, {{before the}} Olympics, the American team started {{exhibition}} play. They played {{a total of}} 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and America. Through these games, Herb Brooks instilled a European style of play in the American team, emphasizing wide open play with sufficient body contact. He believed {{it would be the}} only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets. From the start of the exhibitions, he conducted the team through skating windsprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and back. Some of the players took to calling these Herbies. On September 17, 1979, the team played to a 3-3 tie in Norway. Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game, and after a while, the lights were turned off by custodians and the practice continued in the dark. Near the end of the exhibition season, although he had supported them throughout, Brooks threatened because of <b>subpar</b> play to cut Eruzione (the captain) and replace Craig as the starting goalie with Steve Janaszak.|$|E
25|$|Still, it too {{has gone}} through some controversies over its lifetime. There were criticisms, some {{legitimate}} like the perceived costly entry fees and <b>subpar</b> tracks that hosted nationals. There were also complaints of scheduling conflicts with the rival NBL and NBA; rules discrimination and the general politics between the sanctioning bodies and promoters. Most of these concerns were the worry {{of some of the}} governing officers of the ABA and outside observers in the BMX press. However, {{with the exception of the}} issues of entrance fees and the quality of the national tracks, the rank in file racers and families were largely oblivious. They were seeing well run races that met the needs of the consumer. This was reflected by the growth rate and attendance levels at both the local level and at its Nationals. The in house tabloid newspaper, ABA Action, was as efficient as the organization itself with its always current listings of points standings and race coverage, which were of course the direct concern of the rank and file racers. The ABA served the majority's needs and not the concerns, even the legitimate concerns of the Professional and top Expert racers, the BMX Press and the in house politicking between ABA officers.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} back-to-back stretches in Pitt football history occurred during the 1936 and 1937 seasons which featured Heisman Trophy candidate and Hall of Fame running back Marshall Goldberg. In 1936, Pitt shut out five of its opponents, including a 34–0 win over West Virginia, a 6–0 victory at Ohio State, and a 26–0 win over Notre Dame in which the Irish did not achieve a first down {{until late in the}} third quarter. The Panthers also won at Nebraska 19–6 and defeated Penn State 24–7. Only the second of three consecutive scoreless ties at the Polo Grounds against Fordham, and a mid-October 7–0 upset loss against crosstown rival Duquesne, marred the record. The Panthers finished the regular season winning the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy as Eastern Champions and ranked third in the Associate Press Poll, the inaugural year of the poll, whose rankings were finalized before the bowl season. Pitt accepted a bid to the Rose Bowl to face Washington, and this time Sutherland was determined not to lose again out west. To avoid <b>subpar</b> play following the cross country train trip, Sutherland took his team out two weeks early to allow for adequate preparation. These moves paid off with a 21–0 rout of Washington which led many selectors to name Pitt as the 1936 national champions. However, it was during this time that the seeds of a rift between Sutherland and the university's administration were being sown, partly initiated by the refusal of the university to supply pocket money for players during the Rose Bowl trip, which Sutherland then decided to supply out of his own pocket.|$|E
25|$|Clemente {{spent much}} of his time during the {{off-season}} involved in charity work. When Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, was affected by a massive earthquake on December 23, 1972, Clemente (who visited Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors. The airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and <b>subpar</b> flight personnel, and was overloaded by 4,200 pounds. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972 due to engine failure. A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case apparently belonging to Clemente was the only personal item recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was {{the only member of the}} Pirates not to attend Roberto's memorial service. The Pirates catcher chose instead to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane, were never recovered. Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico (in a league later named after Clemente), helped Clemente load the plane, but either because of the plane's weight load or because he wanted Walker, who was single, to go enjoy New Year's, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. Walker's son is current Milwaukee Brewers second baseman and former Met and Pirate Neil Walker.|$|E
500|$|Reception to {{the book}} was mixed. Some reviewers found William C. Dietz's style of writing <b>subpar</b> when {{compared}} to that of Eric Nylund. [...] Dietz's interpretation of the Master Chief was very different from Nylund's. [...] Other critics took issue with how the novel did not depart enough from the game's storyline; [...] Fans complained about inconsistencies with the other novels and the game itself.|$|E
500|$|Metacritic, a film review aggregator, {{gave the}} film a 40/100 {{approval}} rating based on 34reviews by top rated reviewers, {{placing it in}} the [...] "mixed reviews" [...] category. Based on 186reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, only 21% of them were positive. The majority found the film [...] "heavy on special effects, but without a coherent story at its base, [...] is a <b>subpar</b> re-imagining of the 1951 science-fiction classic." ...|$|E
500|$|Granderson hit a {{home run}} in his first Yankee at bat on April 4, 2010, {{becoming}} the twelfth player to do so. Although he missed some games due to a strained groin, Granderson finished the season with 136 games played, a [...]247 batting average, and 24 home runs. Granderson, who struggled against left-handed pitching throughout his career, also put up <b>subpar</b> numbers against right-handed pitchers, causing Granderson to revamp his swing with the help of hitting coach Kevin Long in August 2010.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Nas made {{an artistic}} {{comeback}} with his fifth album Stillmatic and his highly publicized feud with rapper Jay-Z. Both revitalized his image in hip hop {{music at the}} time, following a string of commercially successful but critically <b>subpar</b> albums. Nas' record label, Columbia Records, capitalized on his comeback with a promotional campaign that included the release of two archival albums, the extended play [...] and The Lost Tapes, while {{leading up to the}} release of his 2002 studio album God's Son.|$|E
500|$|Kirkus Reviews said Godwin had [...] "a {{couple of}} <b>subpar</b> efforts," [...] until {{publishing}} Queen of the Underworld in 2006. Flora (2013) {{became one of}} her better selling books. Godwin also authored an autobiography, Publishing that appeared in 2015. The Los Angeles Times said her auto-biography was a [...] "preemptive strike" [...] after she was approached by an independent biographer. As of 2015, Godwin's published works have included 14 novels, two collections of short stories, three non-fiction works, and ten libretti.|$|E
500|$|A mixed review {{came from}} Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly, {{who felt that}} Gaga and Kelly's vocals track did not [...] "come together" [...] since Gaga's singing style {{interfered}} with {{the composition of the}} song as well as Kelly's R vocals. Anderson also felt that the lyrics sung by Kelly were rehash and <b>subpar.</b> He concluded saying that the song is [...] "an intriguing mind-meld nonetheless". March Hogan from Spin magazine said that the song was [...] "as usual" [...] about fame but felt that the cover art complemented the theme the song portrayed.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' {{return to}} London, George Harrison replied to a {{question}} about their long-term plans: [...] "We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans." [...] His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and <b>subpar</b> performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: ...|$|E
500|$|The show, {{which ran}} 12–16 minutes in length, {{featured}} Spears accompanied by four female back-up dancers performing choreographed dance numbers to shortened versions of five songs, including hits such as [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Toxic". [...] During {{the performance of}} one song, a male audience member participated onstage. Spears' vocals during the performance were lip-synched. The shows received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some said that Spears looked happy and in great shape, while others deemed the show as <b>subpar.</b> Scalpers outside the San Diego venue sold tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500.|$|E
500|$|After the 2010 season, Uribe {{reached an}} {{agreement}} on a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. His first season with the Dodgers {{was one of his}} worst seasons as he made two trips to the disabled list and only managed to appear in 77 of 162 games, his fewest amount of games since 2001. His production was the weakest of his career, as he hit a <b>subpar</b> [...]204 with four home runs and 28 RBIs. He was placed on the disabled list on July 30, with what was described as abdominal pain. He was expected to return after 15 days, but the injury didn't get better and was recharacterized as a sports hernia, which needed season-ending surgery.|$|E
500|$|By 1990, {{enrollment}} was declining and {{the academic}} program at Baltimore City College had once again become <b>subpar</b> compared to its historically high standards. The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, the organization that had accredited the school for years, began raising questions about the institution's ability to offer students an academically rigorous course of study. During this period of decline, the [...] "A" [...] Course was discontinued by newly appointed Principal Joseph Antenson, who contended that the program was racially discriminatory and opted for a standardized curriculum.
