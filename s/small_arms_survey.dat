500|$|After the meeting, Justice Minister Tuija Brax {{said that}} Finland's laws {{pertaining}} to gun ownership should be reviewed [...] "as soon as possible", and Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen pledged government action. Neither specified what measures {{the government would}} be taking. Finland's population owned an averaged total of 2.9 million firearms within a population of 5.2 million people, and thus ranked as having the third highest gun ownership rate in the world, behind only the US and Yemen, according to a 2007 <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> <b>survey</b> {{carried out by the}} Graduate Institute of International Studies. The government had previously discussed raising the minimum age for owning a gun from 15 (with parental consent) to 18 after the Jokela High School shooting (Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the shooter in that incident, was aged 18), but no law regarding this had taken effect.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters {{of keeping}} the gun {{registry}} cited that better gun controls would prevent {{events such as the}} Dawson College shooting in 2006 and the Ecole Polytechnique massacre in 1989. One of the victims of the Dawson shooting also challenged Harper for a debate on gun control. Among the groups opposed to the Conservatives plan included the Canadian Auto Workers and the Quebec Women's Federation. [...] A study from Swiss research group, Graduate Institute of International Studies, also cited, in a report called <b>Small</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Survey</b> 2006, that maintaining the gun registry was more cost effective saving Canada up to $1.4 billion a year in costs associated with gun violence while citing a sharp {{decrease in the number of}} gun deaths and injuries.|$|E

The majority of the Sudanese government’s total self-reported imports of small arms and light weapons, their ammunition, and ‘conventional weapons’ over the period originated in China (58 per cent), followed by Iran (13 per cent), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (9 per cent), and Ukraine (8 per cent)." [...] The report found that Chinese weapons were pervasive among most parties to the Sudanese conflicts, including the war in Darfur, but identified few if any weapons of Russian origin.

40|$|Insurgents are {{increasingly}} using impro-vised explosive devices (IEDs) against government forces and civilians. 1 The ease {{of access to}} components and low-tech assembly requirements have fuelled the proliferation of these weapons. While IEDs are often constructed from commercially available and relatively inexpensive products—such as ammonium nitrate, acetone, hydrogen peroxide, and potas-sium chlorate (WCO, 2013, p. 3) —the main charge and booster can also be sourced from conventional ammunition, such as artillery shells and mortar bombs (Wilkinson, Bevan, and Biddle, 2008, p. 137). As discussed in this Research Note, effective stockpile manage-ment of such conventional munitions 2 is key to curbing the use of stockpile-derived materials in IED fabrication. The Note high-lights ongoing counter-IED efforts, building on the <b>Small</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Survey’s</b> earlier work on these devices. 3 Trends and humanitarian impacts Although the use of IEDs is highest in Afghan...|$|R
40|$|This annexe {{provides}} {{supplementary information}} on the methodology used in Chapter 1 to calculate the dollar value estimate of USD 1. 58 billion for firearms transfers worldwide in 2006. The estimate, and {{the process by which}} it was derived, is part of a multi-year effort to reassess the <b>Small</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Survey’s</b> current estimate of USD 4 billion for the annual authorized international trade in small arms; light weapons; and their parts, accessories, and ammunition. 1 Caveat regarding data and estimates It {{is important to note that}} the USD 1. 58 billion figure is simply an estimate; ambiguities and gaps in existing data preclude the calculation of a definitive total. Many exporting countries provide only partial data on their firearms exports and some provide no data at all. Other countries aggregate their data on firearms exports with data on other arms transfers, or provide only data on licences issued rather than actual exports. Furthermore, the different reporting mechanisms through which governments provide data on firearms exports are not standardized, making it difficult to combine data from different sources and corroborate individual data points. For example, some reports only provide data on the number of units exported, while others only provide monetary values. Compounding these problems are ambiguities and errors in the data...|$|R
40|$|This annexe {{provides}} {{supplementary information}} on the methodology used in Chapter 1, ‘Emerging from Obscurity’, to calculate the average value estimate of USD 4. 3 billion for annual authorized international transfers of ammunition for <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> and light weapons between 2006 and 2009. The estimate, and {{the process by which}} it was derived, is part of a multi-year effort to reassess the <b>Small</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Survey’s</b> current estimate of USD 4 billion for the annual authorized international trade in <b>small</b> <b>arms</b> and light weapons, and their parts, accessories, and ammunition. Estimating annual light weapons ammunition transfers Basic methodology Because of the almost complete absence of data on transfers of light weapons ammunition in the public domain, 1 the study makes use of the slightly more plentiful data on public procurement 2 of ammunition. Publicly available records were used to build a fairly complete picture of government procurement of light weapons ammunition for a sample of countries. By analysing the identity and location of the contractor supplying the ammunition, the authors categorized purchases as either imports or domestic procurement for each of these countries. They then identified a number of factors (‘independent variables’) believed to predict levels of light weapons ammunition procurement by states. These variables were used in conjunction with the data on imports by the sample countries to generate an estimated level of light weapons ammunition procurement for every country outside the sample. The USD 2. 5 billion estimate of average annual authorized transfers of light weapons ammunition is the sum of the data on imports for the sample countries and the import estimates for every other country in the world. Sample The authors were able to compile what they believe to be fairly complete data on government procurement (including imports) of light weapons ammunition for te...|$|R
