By then, the world {{traveller}} had <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{a life of}} farm activities, social events, and serving as an officer (eventually president) of the county historical society.

Later, further class 47/0s were converted to class 47/4s and renumbered into the series from 47556 onwards, which eventually reached 47665.|$|E

5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E
5|$|In Cyprus, all the kingdoms had revolted {{except that}} of Amathus. The {{leader of the}} Cypriot revolt was Onesilus, brother of the king of Salamis, Gorgus. Gorgus {{did not want to}} revolt, so Onesilus locked his brother out of the city and made himself king. Gorgus went over to the Persians, and Onesilus persuaded the other Cypriots, apart from the Amathusians, to revolt. He then <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> besiege Amathus.|$|E
5|$|The ARVN {{operation}} soon <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{become a}} search and destroy mission, with South Vietnamese troops combing the countryside in small patrols looking for PAVN supply caches. Phase II {{of the operation}} began {{with the arrival of}} elements of the 9th Infantry Division. Four tank-infantry task forces attacked into the Parrot's Beak from the south. After three days of operations, ARVN claimed 1,010 PAVN troops had been killed and 204 prisoners taken for the loss of 66 ARVN dead and 330 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Grierson, {{commander}} of the 10th Cavalry, traversed the hot Chihuahuan Desert and then the narrow valleys of the Chinati Mountains, reaching Rattlesnake Springs {{on the morning of}} August 6, 1880. His cavalrymen and their mounts were worn down from the forced march of over 65miles in 21 hours. After resting and getting water, Grierson carefully placed his men in ambush positions. Carpenter, with his two cavalry troops, arrived as reinforcements and were posted in reserve a short distance south of the spring. The cavalrymen <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> wait as Indian scouts brushed away any sign of their presence.|$|E
5|$|With {{the birth}} of his first {{daughter}}, Michaela, in 1958, Jolin <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a more quiet life as a father and family man. His second daughter Angelina was born in 1966. He continued to paint, mostly still life and portraits, at his studio apartment at Stagneliusvägen 34, in Fredhäll. He spent most summers with his family in Tällberg in the Dalarna County or at Villa San Michele on the island of Capri. Although he held some minor exhibitions, his work from the 1960s to his death in 1976, did not receive the same acclaim as his earlier paintings.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E

5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> wait for the first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels {{that had been used}} for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
5|$|When the Ionians and Persians {{arrived at}} Naxos, they were faced by a well-fortified and {{supplied}} city. Herodotus does not explicitly say, {{but this was}} presumably the eponymous capital of Naxos. He provides few details of the military actions that ensued, {{although there is a}} suggestion that there was an initial assault on the city, which was repelled. The Ionians and Persians thus <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> besiege the city. However, after four months, the Persians had run out of money, with Aristagoras also spending a great deal. Thoroughly demoralised, the expedition prepared to return to Asia Minor empty handed. Before leaving, they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxian aristocrats on the island. This was a typical strategy in the Greek world for those exiled by internal strife, giving them a base from which to quickly return, as events permitted.|$|E

5|$|With the new consensus, {{the major}} issues {{concerning}} Poland and Germany were settled in {{the second week of}} February 1815. Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress <b>settled</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.|$|E
