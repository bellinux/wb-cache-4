5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group <b>solidarity,</b> <b>and</b> support for radical labour movements.|$|E

Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for the formation of political solidarities across the spatial divisions being intensified by dominant responses to the European crisis. In doing so it takes inspiration from Doreen Massey’s thinking around the contested terms on which space and politics are articulated and her engagement with the 2008 crisis through projects such as the Kilburn Manifesto. We argue that her book World City powerfully articulates a way of thinking about the spatial politics of a particular conjuncture. The paper traces the ways in which various political interventions in post-crisis politics have been shaped by distinctive ‘nationed’ geographical imaginaries. In particular we explore how left-wing nationed narratives impact on the discursive horizon and unpack their implications for the articulation of <b>solidarities</b> <b>and</b> emancipatory politics {{in the context of the}} ‘European Crisis’. Building on this, we reflect on how trans-local <b>solidarities</b> <b>and</b> alliances might be articulated across socio-spatial divisions and contest the decidedly uneven, racialised, gendered and classed impacts of dominant European politics. We argue that such <b>solidarities</b> <b>and</b> alliances can form a crucial intervention in challenging the dominant spatial politics of crisis and articulating left political strategies on different terms...|$|R

5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class <b>solidarity</b> <b>and</b> nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this article}} is to identify possible convergences between the concept of degrowth mostly defended in Northern countries, <b>solidarity</b> economy <b>and</b> agroecology in Brazil in order to build a common platform of discussion. Through the use of bibliographical research this paper identifies seven common elements between degrowth <b>and</b> <b>solidarity</b> economics <b>and</b> seven between degrowth and agroecology. It is concluded that <b>solidarity</b> economics <b>and</b> agroecology in Brazil have elements to establish themselves in convengence spaces for a common platform amongst groups that defend an economy of low ecological impact, degrowth groups in the North and sociocultural movements in the South. Furthermore, this paper suggests the analysis of principles and practices of social groups in the South as additional orientation in the debate between the two Hemispheres in the context of degrowth. Finally, some suggestions are made in order to deepen the analysis of the relations between degrowth, <b>solidarity</b> economics <b>and</b> agroecology in Brazil...|$|R

5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in <b>Solidarity</b> <b>and</b> were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E

The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CCPPD) also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn this meeting.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, <b>Solidarity</b> <b>and</b> the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E

40|$|Political {{and social}} {{movements}} are both empowering and power-seeking: they seek both to mobilize {{civil society and}} overwhelm state institutions. As organisations they mobilize collective power, generating <b>solidarities</b> <b>and</b> transforming social structures. As such, political organisations both challenge power and exercise power. This article addresses organizational vehicles for political change in Australia, drawing out limits and possibilities. Three organizational forms are discussed - the political party, the non-government organization (NGO), and the social movement - {{in terms of their}} capacity and limits. The social <b>solidarities</b> <b>and</b> social structures that frame political organization are debated, highlighting the impact of political conflicts over ecological change.

5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with <b>Solidarity,</b> <b>and</b> arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|Prince Paul {{recognised}} {{the lack}} of national <b>solidarity</b> <b>and</b> political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Maček, {{the leader of the}} dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović met with Maček at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinović was unwilling or unable to grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class. In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) commander, General Dušan Simović had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the Vatican, and another coup plot following the December election.|$|E

The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E

5|$|The {{liberal and}} {{national}} uprising displeased the Austria of Metternich, the principal political {{architect of the}} Holy Alliance. However, Russia, another reactionary gendarme of Europe, looked favorably on the insurrection due to its Orthodox religious <b>solidarity</b> <b>and</b> its geostrategic interest (control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus). France, another {{active member of the}} Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at Trocadero (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade. Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the regional situation primarily because it lay on the route to India and London wished to exercise a form of control there. For all of Europe, Greece represented the cradle of Western civilisation and of art since antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{performance}} {{was an important}} part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called sansei. During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called nisei faced internment in the United States and in Canada {{on the basis of their}} race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the Civil Rights Movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for <b>solidarity</b> <b>and</b> to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, {{performance was}} meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.|$|E
5|$|The {{adoption}} of Middle Scots by the aristocracy {{has been seen}} as building a shared sense of national <b>solidarity</b> <b>and</b> culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history {{in the service of the}} Crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional version of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks.|$|E
