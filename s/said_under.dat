5|$|Napier {{assisted}} in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful Axis invasion. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to Alexandria, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later Napier was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve German dive-bombers. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the stern, the engine room and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in Port <b>Said</b> <b>under</b> repair.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of {{the theory}} include sexual {{behavior}} scientists J. Michael Bailey, James Cantor, Alice Dreger, and some openly trans health care providers, Anne Lawrence and Maxine Peterson, and others who {{say that there are}} {{significant differences between the two}} proposed groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life, generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds, have lower IQs, as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or asexual. They are also <b>said</b> <b>under</b> the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise paraphilic arousal.|$|E

25|$|At Thurii, {{the colony}} newly {{planted on the}} Tarentine Gulf, the boy may have seen Herodotus, now a man in middle life, and a {{friendship}} may have grown up between them. There, too, Lysias {{is said to have}} commenced his studies in rhetoricdoubtless under a master of the Sicilian school possibly, as tradition <b>said,</b> <b>under</b> Tisias, the pupil of Corax, whose name is associated with the first attempt to formulate rhetoric as an art. In 413 BC the Athenian armament in Sicily was annihilated. The desire to link famous names is illustrated by the ancient ascription to Lysias of a rhetorical exercise purporting to be a speech in which the captive general Nicias appealed for mercy to the Sicilians. The terrible blow to Athens quickened the energies of an anti-Athenian faction at Thurii. Lysias and his elder brother Polemarchus, with three hundred other persons, were accused of Atticizing. They were driven from Thurii and settled at Athens (412 BC).|$|E

500|$|Melvin {{defended his}} {{decision}} to hold people without access to legal advice by arguing that lawyers, unwittingly or otherwise, might pass information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects. He <b>said</b> <b>under</b> cross-examination during the 1987 murder trial that, in his view, [...] "the integrity of some firms of solicitors left {{a lot to be}} desired"; he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said. The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot QC, told the court that the police had one effective weapon, namely that suspects did not know who else had spoken to police and what they had said, and that [...] "the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective." ...|$|E

2500|$|And {{what they}} {{believed}} Churchill to have <b>said,</b> <b>under</b> Connick, was disruptive enough to justify adverse action {{regardless of whether it}} addressed a public concern, which the plurality declined to decide. [...] "Discouraging people from coming to work for a department certainly qualifies as disruption." [...] Perkins-Graham herself had told Davis she didn't think the hospital could [...] "tolerate that kind of negativism" [...] much longer, and if Churchill had indeed denied the possibility of getting along with Waters, Churchill's continued effectiveness as a nurse under Waters' supervision could be reasonably expected to be diminished.|$|E

2500|$|After Corday's decapitation, a {{man named}} Legros lifted her head from the basket and slapped it on the cheek. Charles-Henri Sanson, the executioner, indignantly {{rejected}} published reports that Legros {{was one of his}} assistants. Sanson stated in his diary that Legros was in fact a carpenter who had been hired to make repairs to the guillotine. Witnesses report an expression of [...] "unequivocal indignation" [...] on her face when her cheek was slapped. The oft-repeated anecdote has served to suggest that victims of the guillotine may in fact retain consciousness for a short while, including by Albert Camus in his Reflections on the Guillotine. ("Charlotte Corday's severed head blushed, it is <b>said,</b> <b>under</b> the executioner's slap.").|$|E
2500|$|Grant's {{decision}} {{to pursue the}} suggestion ran into conflict with Dennis O'Neil, who protested against it. Grant recalled, [...] "Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky's father and <b>said</b> <b>under</b> no circumstances would DC allow that." [...] Grant persisted, suggesting that the move would generate interest for the comic book, and that the story could be undone later in another story. With O'Neil's permission, the sub-plot of Anarky's unrevealed heritage {{was published in the}} series' first issue. With the eventual series cancellation, the final issue was quickly written to reveal the identity of Anarky's father as the Joker, simply to resolve the plot line, and leaving any future rebuttal to a future publications.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Matthew Bryza, {{the deputy}} {{assistant}} secretary of State, said the contents of the recorded phone conversations (which were presented as evidence of Russian invasion on 7 August) were consistent with what Georgians believed on August 7, in the final hours before the war, when a cease-fire collapsed. [...] "During the height of all of these developments, when I {{was on the phone with}} senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," [...] he stated. [...] "I <b>said,</b> <b>under</b> instructions, that we urge you not to engage these Russians directly." [...] Bryza had also said earlier in August 2008, [...] "They felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages. It was a very dangerous dynamic. That was part of an action-reaction, 'Guns of August' scenario that we tried to defuse." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2006, Tutu {{repeated}} {{these statements}} after a UN report was published {{which called for}} {{the closure of the}} camp. Tutu stated that the Guantanamo camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28-day detention period for terror suspects was [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "untenable". Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African is an awful déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in the bad old days a 90-day detention law," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Under</b> apartheid, as at Guantanamo, people were held for [...] "unconscionably long periods" [...] and then released, he said.|$|E
2500|$|Cunningham was {{president}} of the National League of Cities during his time as mayor. He was recognized for his innovations in the delivery of local government services by both the U.S. Conference of Mayors (1999) and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. In 2000, the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist political reform organization, named Cunningham one of the [...] "100 Hundred to Watch" [...] among Democrats across the nation, and one of the Top 10 new Democrats under the age of 40. Pennsylvania Senator Lisa Boscola <b>said</b> <b>under</b> Cunningham's leadership, the once-troubled city of Bethlehem [...] "moved out of the shadow of Bethlehem Steel and into a future that is bright and full of promise". In a 2009 column, Morning Call columnist Bill White declared Cunningham the best ever mayor among Lehigh Valley's three cities of Bethlehem, Allentown and Easton. Near the end of Cunningham's mayoral tenure, speculation arose that he would run for a seat vacated by Pat Toomey on the United States House of Representatives, representing Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district, but Cunningham ruled it out because it would mean too much time away from his family.|$|E
