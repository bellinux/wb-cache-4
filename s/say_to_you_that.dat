500|$|On 24 July 2008, Brown {{spoke at}} the [...] "Walk of Witness" [...] in support of poverty {{reduction}} worldwide during the Lambeth Conference. He called the march [...] "one of the greatest demonstrations of faith this great city has ever seen." [...] Brown said that [...] "at our current rates of progress," [...] the MDGs will not be met by the 2015 deadline. He told the Anglican Communion bishops, [...] "I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the poor {{of the world have}} been patient but 100 years is too long for people to wait for justice and that is why we must act now." [...] The full speech can be read at ...|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1841 {{after the}} second bank veto, members of the cabinet entered Tyler's office {{one by one and}} resigned—an {{orchestration}} by Clay to force Tyler's resignation and place his own lieutenant, Senate President pro tempore Samuel L. Southard, in the White House. The only exception was Webster, who remained to finalize what became the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty, and to demonstrate his independence from Clay. When told by Webster {{that he was willing to}} stay, Tyler is reported to have said, [...] "Give me your hand on that, and now I will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Henry Clay is a doomed man." [...] On September 13, when the president did not resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party. Tyler was lambasted by Whig newspapers and received hundreds of letters threatening his assassination. Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds to fix the White House, which had fallen into disrepair.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Valenti became notorious for his {{flamboyant}} {{attacks on the}} Sony Betamax Video Cassette Recorder (VCR), which the MPAA feared would devastate the movie industry. He famously told a congressional panel in 1982, [...] "I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone." [...] Despite Valenti's prediction, the home video market ultimately came to be the mainstay of movie studio revenues throughout the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

6000|$|... "Wheel!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "I was not {{thinking}} of wheels! I {{will tell you what}} is not all right! It is not right for me to go away without <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{chose to}} make her a witness. Harlowe! you're a good fellow! I don't mind <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> these are papers I prefer that my WIFE should not use. We'll leave it for the present--Unfinished Business." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jesus {{comments}} on these commandments in the Gospel of Matthew:You {{have heard that}} it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not commit adultery. But I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.Jesus also makes reference to the passages from Genesis in his teachings on marriage in Matthew:Have ye not read, that he who made man from the beginning, Made them male and female? And he said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. They [...] say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away? He [...] saith to them: Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.|$|E
2500|$|The Oregon years saw an {{increased}} emphasis on Rajneesh's prediction that the world might be destroyed by nuclear war or other disasters sometime in the 1990s. Rajneesh had said as early as 1964 that [...] "the third and last war {{is now on the}} way" [...] and frequently spoke of the need to create a [...] "new humanity" [...] to avoid global suicide. This now became the basis for a new exclusivism, and a 1983 article in the Rajneesh Foundation Newsletter announcing that [...] "Rajneeshism is creating a Noah's Ark of consciousness... I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> except this there is no other way", increased the sense of urgency in building the Oregon commune. In March 1984, Sheela announced that Rajneesh had predicted the death of two-thirds of humanity from AIDS. Sannyasins were required to wear rubber gloves and condoms if they had sex, and to refrain from kissing, measures widely represented in the press as an extreme over-reaction since condoms were not usually recommended for AIDS prevention because AIDS was considered a homosexual disease at that stage.|$|E
2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, and {{you take care of}} the young ones as you think best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E
60|$|What was it he {{saw that}} made his heart stand still? Why was no word spoken between the two? Thou canst say, who hast seen that same {{expression}} on the face dearest to thee;--that look indescribable, hopeless, unmistakable, <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> thy beloved is no longer thine.|$|R
5000|$|The Queen of Wands is said {{by some to}} {{represent}} one's basic instinct. Her strength and task are providing initial inputs.

I remember <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I thought <b>you</b> cared for me more than Tom did." ...|$|R
5000|$|The phrase first {{occurs in}} Jesus' comment {{concerning}} {{the faith of}} the Centurion of Capernaum: Matthew 8:11 'And I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven: But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” D-R ...|$|R

"Dear, faithful, old servitor," [...] {{he said in}} an {{unsteady}} voice, [...] "I don't mind <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> 'Mars' Pendleton' {{spent his}} last dollar in the world a week ago. We will accept this money, Uncle Mose, since, in a way, it is a sort of payment, as well as a token of the loyalty and devotion of the old regime. Lydia, my dear, take the money.
