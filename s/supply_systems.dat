5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command, returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water <b>supply</b> <b>systems,</b> telephone services, {{as well as the}} harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
5|$|Nicole {{produced}} {{a tremendous amount}} of rain in Jamaica, totaling to 37.42in (950.5mm) in Belleisle. Severe flooding and landslides affected up to 507,831 residents, resulting 16 deaths and 42 injuries. Flooded roadways isolated communities, trapping hundreds of people in their homes. Over 288,000 residences lost power, over 40 percent of the island's water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> were inoperable at one point, and dozens of bridges collapsed. Infrastructure damage totaled to $235.4 million, while property damage reached $3.2 million and agricultural damage amounted to $6.8 million. In nearby Cuba, rainfall reached 9.22in (234mm) and winds gusted to 53mph (85km/h); houses were flooded, crops were damaged, and livestock was killed as a result. Similar impacts occurred across the Cayman Islands, with sporadic power outages, flooding in low-lying locations, and damaged houses. While the remnants of Nicole produced only minor impacts across Florida, mainly in the form of street flooding, impacts were much more severe across the Mid-Atlantic as the system combined with a large area of low pressure across the region. Record-breaking rainfall, accumulating to 22.54in (572.5mm) in Wilmington, North Carolina, closed over 150 roadways, knocked out power, and caused traffic accidents.|$|E

5|$|The {{capital city}} was {{completely}} {{dependent on the}} water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians {{a picture of the}} prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.|$|E
