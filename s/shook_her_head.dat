5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} victim {{linked to the}} Michigan Murderer was a 19-year-old Eastern Michigan University {{accounting}} student named Mary Terese Fleszar, who was last seen alive {{on the evening of}} July 9, 1967, by a neighbor walking towards her Ypsilanti apartment. This neighbor twice observed {{a young man in a}} blue-grey Chevrolet slow to a halt beside Fleszar and begin talking to her: each time, Fleszar had <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and walked away from the car. Her nude body was found by two 15-year-old boys on an abandoned farm in Superior Township on August 7, and was formally identified via dental records the following day.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Reagan {{was honored}} at a gala {{dinner at the}} Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., where guests {{included}} Dick Cheney, Harry Reid, and Condoleezza Rice. The event was her first major public appearance since her husband's funeral. When asked about her plans, Reagan <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and responded, [...] "I don't know. I'll know when I'll know. But the Reagan library is Ronnie, so that's where I spend my time." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{frequent}} customer saw Heeringa {{working late}} at the station. The customer commented to Heeringa that she shouldn't be alone that {{late at night}} and that her boyfriend should be there with her. She said a man overheard the women's conversation and said, [...] "She's got her customers looking out for her too." [...] She said that Heeringa [...] "sort of <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and started shivering ... like a chill went up her spine or something." [...] She then said Heeringa [...] "wasn't her usual happy self" [...] and she felt that [...] "something was wrong", so she parked outside the station until it closed. She saw the man leave that night.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, {{he took a}} moment to ask her whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish said that when he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> indicating it was not, but that she nodded her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E
2500|$|Unusually {{for a first}} {{language}} learner, Genie never engaged {{in any kind of}} experimentation with language. Sometimes if Genie mastered an aspect of grammar she would not use it in everyday interactions, such as imperatives, and with many others, such as past tense or plural words, she only used the correct words or markers if separately and specifically asked. If someone asked Genie a yes or no question she often repeated part of the question or said [...] "no" [...] even if she clearly meant yes and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> the correct way, which Curtiss concluded was Genie simply repeating the last word of the sentence. By contrast, she frequently understood and responded to highly complex questions that she could not on tests, especially sentences requiring some degree of inference and sentences performing both a locutionary and illocutionary act. Her comprehension of other complex sentences remained inconsistent, although beginning in November 1973 researchers recorded slow but noticeable improvement.|$|E

2500|$|With Democrats facing {{possible}} large {{losses in}} the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led {{to the notion that}} Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, she smiled and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was [...] "completely unfounded" [...] and that [...] "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are." [...] (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, but the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) ...|$|E
