40|$|There {{is a great}} {{shortage}} of some professionals like chartered accountants, while {{the standards of the}} professional body are relentless in denying the unsuitably qualified. Low pass rates in the first year challenge Higher Education’s eventual delivery of adequate numbers of candidates in order to balance the book of supply and demand. In this paper we outline the results of the research that informed the design and piloting of new teaching initiatives in Financial Accounting, the rationale and instructional design principles behind them, and briefly describe the approaches aimed at increasing the success of first-year students. At the end of 2010, the Department of Financial Accounting sought to uncover the reasons for the unacceptable attrition levels in the first year. Research entailed semi-structured focus-group interviews with students across all levels of achievement. Students also completed a questionnaire consisting of both open-ended and structured questions. The results of this mixed-method investigation were triangulated with a larger longitudinal study of student expectations and experiences in the Faculty. One of the most salient findings was that students had unrealistic perceptions of the subject. What they learnt at school did not prepare them to think wider and to solve problems. Students eschewed the lecturers’ recommended approaches to solving problems because of ill-perceived expertise (based on high marks at school). Students also underestimated the importance of studying the theory of accounting before attempting solutions. The findings of this research provided the second research question that called for learning innovations to address those. The lecturers therefore provided a wish-list that constituted the third research question, namely how to design and implement in a learning management system the required educational innovations. Some of the initiatives that were designed primarily for implementation in the learning management system (LMS) are • a clickable mind-map of all the courses in the 4 years of study, explaining how they articulate horizontally and with the next academic level • a <b>scrolling</b> <b>banner</b> and pop-up windows reminding students to study their theory before attempting problem-solving • online glossaries of terms explaining subject terminology in lay language • a weekly multiple choice test with explanatory feed-back • online tutoring questions-solving in the Discussions. Implementation of the newly designed Accounting pilot course is taking place during 2011 with about 120 students, with some of the practices already being replicated in other classes in this Department.

5000|$|Banner stands: Banner stands are {{a smaller}} type of trade show display with one large graphic {{supported}} in a standing frame. Similar in construction to pop-up displays but composed of one free-standing panel, {{they are a}} portable and lightweight display solution. Some varieties come with retractable roll-up panels for ease of transport, detachable graphics, or lights. Other types of banner stands include outdoor banners, X banner stands, retractable <b>banner</b> stands, motorized <b>scrolling</b> <b>banners,</b> and frame-based tension fabric banners.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the same}} year the home shirts were {{sponsored}} in 1985, the club displayed a crest for the first time. The crest reflected the club's nickname [...] "The Wasps", featuring a black wasp on a basic gold shield with the club's initials below. The design of the crest was edited slightly in 1994 with an almost identical wasp on a similar gold shield and the club's full name was displayed below on a gold <b>scroll</b> <b>banner.</b> The crest colour varied along with the shade of colour on the strip and featured until 2010 when it was again redesigned. The new design features a large cartoon Wasp and is referred to by fans of the club as 'the hornet'.|$|R

5000|$|The {{networks}} of Turner Broadcasting System used traditional score bugs until TBS began broadcasting the 2007 Major League Baseball Division Series, {{in which they}} converted to a top screen banner. ESPN began using a banner starting with the 2006 FIFA World Cup and MLB Home Run Derby, a bottom-screen banner for NBA and AFL telecasts and in 2007, a top-screen banner for NASCAR and baseball telecasts, plus a center-screen bug for its Monday Night Football telecasts in 2006 and 2007 before switching to a bottom-screen banner in 2008. Starting in 2007, the channel began using banners for its college football and college basketball telecasts. In addition, ESPN's college sports telecasts added two (lacrosse), three (college football) or five (college basketball) yellow stripes, representing the timeouts the team has left to use on the banner. Timeout indicators were also added for ESPN's Monday Night Football telecasts, beginning with Week 4 of the 2009 NFL season. In 2006, CBS began using a bottom-of-the-screen banner for NCAA basketball telecasts, but retained the traditional box for all NFL broadcasts, but [...] uses a banner for college football and NFL games {{at the top of}} the screen. Sibling network CBS College Sports however, began using a top-screen banner for baseball in 2008, which later expanded to other sports, duplicating the bottom screen banners for basketball. The one exception among all the networks is motor racing, as all of them will use <b>scrolling</b> <b>banners</b> for these races. In 2007, TBS began using a top-screen banner for postseason baseball broadcasts, and continued into the 2008 season, returning to a longer bug in 2009.|$|R
