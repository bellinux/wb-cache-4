5|$|Critics {{also note}} the {{entertaining}} {{methods used to}} drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> true, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> beautiful, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good,--I owed her <b>so</b> much gratitude, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> dear to me, that I {{could find}} no {{utterance}} for what I felt. I tried to bless her, tried to thank her, {{tried to tell her}} (as I had often done in letters) what an influence she had upon me; but all my efforts were in vain. My love and joy were dumb.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Todgers laughed immensely at {{the dear}} love's humour, and {{declared}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite afraid of her, that <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> very severe.|$|R

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> reasonable, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> gently right! It {{took him}} {{an hour to}} make his escape, with nothing settled and {{everything}} horribly settled. In a barren freedom of icy Northern wind he sighed, [...] "Thank God that's over! Poor Tanis, poor darling decent Tanis! But it is over. Absolute! I'm free!" ...|$|R

25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{has said}} that when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> young, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> liberal in her {{politics}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> almost Maoist, although <b>she</b> <b>is</b> now conservative.|$|R

500|$|Uma (performed by Stephanie D'Abruzzo) is Oobi's sister. She loves singing, pretending, and chickens. Her catchphrases are [...] "Nice!" [...] and [...] "Pretty."

500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as pulling at her clothes. An early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte I was appalled to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> nervous & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound as it should be – and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder". The young girl was also underweight and had a troublesome digestion.|$|E
500|$|Charlie later {{struggles to}} deal with Ruby's {{relationship}} with Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: [...] "Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't {{want to see her}} getting hurt. She's only very recently been in a relationship with Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell), and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly." [...] Anderson opined it is Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) who gives Charlie her first piece of good parenting advice. She concluded that Charlie's approach only causes conflict with Ruby because <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> strong-willed.|$|E
60|$|When the Princess {{saw that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> delighted that <b>she</b> {{did not know}} what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing, and skipped and danced.|$|R

500|$|Variety {{magazine}} {{praised the}} performances, writing, [...] "Dafoe gives a disciplined and noteworthy portrayal of Ward... But it's Hackman who steals the picture as Anderson... Glowing performance of Frances McDormand as the deputy's wife who's drawn to Hackman is an asset both to his role and the picture." [...] Sheila Benson, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Hackman's mastery at suggesting {{an infinite number}} of layers beneath a wry, self-deprecating surface reaches a peak here, but McDormand soars right with him. And since she is the film's sole voice of morality, it's right that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> memorable." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, the lead vocalist of Yellowcard, Ryan Key, praised Clarkson in the music video. He said, [...] "She is so unbelievably gorgeous in that video that is all over TV right now [...] The wet wedding dress and the wet hair and ... come on, man! Who knew? <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> hot. She looks so good in it." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy opined that the music video is Clarkson's best video to date. The music video had a successful run at Total Request Live where it topped the chart for 33 days, a record that Clarkson holds for the longest stay by a female artist at {{number one on the}} chart.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe {{described}} Jenny stating: [...] "Dreary, confused, introverted narcissist [...] downcast, secretive, almost Goth in {{her black}} moodiness, she {{is the epitome of}} an unhappy egotist. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> consumed with {{the ups and downs of}} her own depression and self-loathing, she just doesn't have the energy to look outward. Her misery is her mirror, and she's forever gazing into it." [...] New York Magazine describe Jenny as a capricious yet obnoxious type of character adding that she can be patronizing. They also observe her as looking [...] "fabulous, fun, and sexy but her downfall is her annoying side." [...] Diane Shipley of The Guardian branded Jenny a [...] "whiny egomaniac". Lesbian magazine Curve brands Jenny a [...] "narcissistic navel-gazer".|$|E
