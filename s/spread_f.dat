40|$|Recurrent {{liquefaction}} in Christchurch {{during the}} 2010 - 2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence created {{a wealth of}} shallow subsurface intrusions with geometries and orientations governed by (1) strong ground motion severity and duration, and (2) intrinsic site characteristics including liquefaction susceptibility, lateral spreading severity, geomorphic setting, host sediment heterogeneity, and anthropogenic soil modifications. We present a suite of case studies that demonstrate how each of these characteristics influenced the geologic expressions of contemporary liquefaction in the shallow subsurface. We compare contemporary features with paleo-features to show how geologic investigations of recurrent liquefaction can provide novel insights into the shaking characteristics of modern and paleo-earthquakes, the influence of geomorphology on liquefaction vulnerability, and the possible controls of anthropogenic activity on the geologic record. We conclude that (a) sites of paleo-liquefaction in the last 1000 - 2000 years corresponded with most severe liquefaction during the Canterbury earthquake sequence, (b) less vulnerable sites that only liquefied in the strongest and most proximal contemporary earthquakes are unlikely to have liquefied in the last 1000 - 2000 years or more, (c) proximal strong earthquakes with large vertical accelerations favoured sill formation at some locations, (d) contemporary liquefaction was more severe than paleoliquefaction at all study sites, and (e) stratigraphic records of successive dike formation were more complete at sites with severe lateral <b>spreading,</b> (<b>f)</b> anthropogenic fill suppressed surface liquefaction features and altered subsurface liquefaction architecture...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spread</b> <b>F</b> is a {{phenomenon}} of the ionosphere in which the pulses returned from the ionosphere are of a much greater duration than the transmitted ones. The occurrence of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> can be predicted using the technique of Neural Networks (NNs). This thesis presents the development and evaluation of NN based models (two single station models and a regional model) for predicting the occurrence of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> over selected stations within the Brazilian sector. The input space for the NNs included the day number (seasonal variation), hour (diurnal variation), sunspot number (measure of the solar activity), magnetic index (measure of the magnetic activity) and magnetic position (latitude, magnetic declination and inclination). Twelve years of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> data measured during 1978 to 1989 inclusively at the equatorial site Fortaleza and low latitude site Cachoeira Paulista {{are used in the}} development of an input space and NN architecture for the NN models. <b>Spread</b> <b>F</b> data that is believed to be related to plasma bubble developments (range <b>spread</b> <b>F)</b> were used {{in the development of the}} models while those associated with narrow spectrum irregularities that occur near the F layer (frequency <b>spread</b> <b>F)</b> were excluded. The results of the models show the dependency of the probability of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> as a function of local time, season and latitude. The models also illustrate some characteristics of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> such as the onset and peak occurrence of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> as a function of distance from the equator.

50|$|Several {{strategies}} {{are currently being}} used to help decrease the <b>spread</b> of <b>F.</b> circinatum. Irrigation water can be chemically treated with a chlorination system or ozone treatment. Following corrected pH levels in water, {{it is recommended that}} 2-3 ppm of chlorine be administered. Proper hygiene practices and surface sterilization are to be maintained throughout management, especially by preventing the accumulation of water nearby to deter increases in insect populations. The use of insecticides can reduce the number of vectors present that typically allow the infection to occur. Within pine nurseries, it is common for the dying seedlings to be removed and saturated with a fungicide. It should be noted that a single, systematic fungicide should not be used continuously as resistance can develop.|$|R

Two different nonlinear theories of <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> turbulence are studied here and shown {{to be consistent with}} the experimental spectra when the knee is observed.

3000|$|There are {{two major}} causes of {{uncertainties}} in h’F. When h’F is low, recombination of the plasma density is dominant. For this case, h’F variation does not represent actual movement of the F layer altitude, so that eastward electric field cannot be estimated from the h’F variation. When h’F is less than 300  km, it is probably affected by the recombination process (Bittencourt and Abdu 1981; Maruyama et al. 2007). Therefore, in the present study, we do not use the data when h’F is less than 300  km. Another source of uncertainty is <b>spread</b> <b>F.</b> We exclude h’F and dh’F/dt {{during the period of}} <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> occurrence because accuracy for scaling h’F is degraded during the <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> event due to spread of the F layer trace in the ionogram.

30|$|In the {{scenario}} of a threshold PRE for ESF occurrence, the PRE must reach a minimum value (the threshold) for {{the generation of}} ESF. In other words, ESF will be generated if the PRE {{is larger than the}} threshold or not be generated if the PRE is smaller than the threshold. However, observations show that for a given PRE, the ESF strength could be significantly different. For example, the range <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> index varied from zero (no <b>spread</b> <b>F)</b> to two (moderate <b>spread</b> <b>F)</b> for a vertical drift at 22  m/s and from 0.3 (almost no <b>spread</b> <b>F)</b> to 2.4 (moderate to strong <b>spread</b> <b>F)</b> for a vertical drift at 33  m/s (Abdu et al. 1983). In some other cases, no <b>spread</b> <b>F</b> was observed even when the PRE was large (Huang and Hairston 2015), and strong ESF was observed when the PRE was nearly zero (Huang and Hairston 2015; Smith et al. (2016)). These observations indicate that ESF might not occur even if the PRE reached the threshold and that ESF could occur even if the PRE was smaller than the threshold.|$|E

The published article can be found at: [URL] duplications are radical evolutionary events that have driven speciation and adaptation in many taxa. Higher-order polyploids have complex histories often including interspecific hybridization and dynamic genomic changes. This chromosomal reshuffling is poorly understood for most polyploid species, despite their evolutionary and agricultural importance, due to the challenge of distinguishing homologous sequences from each other. Here, we use dense linkage maps generated with targeted sequence capture to improve the diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca) reference genome and to disentangle the subgenomes of the wild octoploid progenitors of cultivated strawberry, Fragaria virginiana and Fragaria chiloensis. Our novel approach, POLiMAPS (Phylogenetics Of Linkage-Map-Anchored Polyploid Subgenomes), leverages sequence reads to associate informative interhomeolog phylogenetic markers with linkage groups and reference genome positions. In contrast to a widely accepted model, we find that one of the four subgenomes originates with the diploid cytoplasm donor F. vesca, one with the diploid Fragaria iinumae, and two with an unknown ancestor close to F. iinumae. Extensive unidirectional introgression has converted F. iinumae-like subgenomes to be more F. vesca-like, but never the reverse, due either to homoploid hybridization in the F. iinumae-like diploid ancestors or else strong selection <b>spreading</b> <b>F.</b> vesca-like sequence among subgenomes through homeologous exchange.

New imaging in the F 343 N filter, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope, is combined with archival F 555 W and F 814 W observations to determine {{the strength of the}} NH band near 3370 Å. After accounting for observational errors, the <b>spread</b> in the <b>F</b> 343 N-F 555 W colors of red giants in the Fornax GCs is similar to that in M 15 and corresponds to an abundance range of ∆[N/Fe] ∼ 2 dex, as observed also in several Galactic GCs.

The stars with the reddest F 343 N-F 555 W colors (indicative of N-enhanced composition) have more centrally concentrated radial distributions in all four clusters, although the difference is not highly statistically significant within any individual cluster. From double-Gaussian fits to the color distributions we find roughly equal numbers of “N-normal ” and “N-enhanced ” stars (formally ∼ 40 % N-normal stars in Fornax 1, 3, and 5 and ∼ 60 % in Fornax 2).
