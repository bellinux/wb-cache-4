50|$|Dick Molyneux's team started season strongly, {{reaching}} {{top spot}} in the First Division after five matches. The demands on the small squad led Brentford to fall back into mid-table and a goalkeeping crisis suffered in early 1904 exacerbated the problem. Molyneux brought in former trialist John Bishop and paid him money to play, an illegal move as Bishop was a serving soldier with the Scots Guards and therefore an amateur player. After his third appearance, Bishop returned late to barracks, was reported to his commanding officer and then made a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> about his involvement with Brentford. The statement was {{passed on to the}} FA, who fined Brentford £25 and suspended director Bill Dodge for two years and manager Molyneux for the final month of the season. With secretary William Lewis in caretaker charge, the Bees took one point from the remaining five matches of the season to finish in 13th position.|$|E

With {{the growing number of}} Iranian students studying overseas, it is necessary to see whether the Persian rhetorical culture influences students ’ English writing. In this study, the researcher aimed to investigate the style differences between English and Persian writing and the possibility of transfer. A total of 65 university students took part in the study. Data was collected through two argumentative writing tasks and a 15 - 20 minute interview. A total of 130 argumentative essays (65 Persian and 65 English) were analyzed according to the five contrastive features framework provided by Xing, Wang, and Spencer (2008). Inter-rater reliability was used in order to enhance the precision in essay correction. The results show that there is a great possibility of transfer from the participants ’ L 1 into L 2 in the areas of number of topic sentences per paragraph, and also figurative language usage. Traces of backward transfer were also detected in inductive/deductive use of thesis <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing.</b> Practical implications for teachers, professors and also students have been provided {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|E

50|$|A lie {{is a false}} {{statement}} to a person or group made by another person or group who knows {{it is not the}} whole truth, intentionally. A fabrication is a lie told when someone submits a statement as truth without knowing for certain whether or not it actually is true. A half-truth is a deceptive statement that includes some element of truth. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may employ some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame, or misrepresent the truth. An honest lie (or confabulation) is defined by verbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe history, background, and present situations. Perjury is the act of lying or making verifiably {{false statement}}s on a material matter under oath or affirmation in a court of law, or in any of various sworn <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing.</b> White lies are minor lies which could be considered to be harmless, or even beneficial, in the long term.|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{analyze the}} talk between a suspect and a {{prosecutor}} during a pretrial hearing {{within the framework}} of the French criminal procedure of comparution immédiate (immediate trial). In this hearing, according to the law, the prosecutor is supposed to verify the suspect’s identity, inform the suspect of the charges against him or her, and write down the suspect’s statements if he or she chooses to make any. 1 However, most of this meeting is taken up by a prosecutor-led discussion during which interlocutors display accounts of the alleged facts, produce series of questions and answers, dispute issues related to the case, and formulate the suspect’s <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> <b>written</b> form. I show that this statement, overseen carefully by the prosecutor, emerges through the interweaving of different sequential activities, with talk and text reflexively constituting one another, in a restrictive speech exchange system fitted to the prosecutor’s institutional orientations mainly with respect to building the case against the suspect. The French code of criminal procedure (Section 393) provides that during the hearing preliminary to a comparution immédiate (immediate court appearance or immediate trial), the prosecutor shall inform the sus...|$|R
50|$|Embedded SQL is {{a method}} of {{combining}} the computing power of a programming language and the database manipulation capabilities of SQL. Embedded SQL statements are SQL statements written inline with the program source code of the host language. The embedded SQL statements are parsed by an embedded SQL preprocessor and replaced by host-language calls to a code library. The output from the preprocessor is then compiled by the host compiler. This allows programmers to embed SQL <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> programs <b>written</b> <b>in</b> any number of languages such as , COBOL and Fortran.
