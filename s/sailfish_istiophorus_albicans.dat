Because of the low prevalence of this species in this fishery, the standardized CPUE was developed using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model assuming a delta-lognormal error distribution. The results obtained indicate that the overall trend of the standardized CPUE was similar for the total Atlantic areas and for the East and West stocks.

40|$|<b>Sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus) is a circumtropically {{distributed}} spe-cies (Hoolihan, 2005). Sailfish is {{a member}} of the billfish family, Istio-phoridae, which also includes marlins and spearfishes, and is considered a bycatch species in commercial fisher-ies. Off the eastern coast of Taiwan, sailfish are economically important and seasonally abundant from April to October (abundance peaks from May to July). Sailfish are mainly caught by drift gill nets, although some are also caught by set nets, harpoons, and as incidental bycatch in inshore long-line fisheries (Chiang, 2004). There are virtually no discards of sailfish in Taiwan. For the past decade, the annual landings of sailfish off Taiwan waters have fluctuated between 500 and 1000 metric tons, of which over 50 % have come from waters off Tai-tung (eastern Taiwan). Globally, large predatory fish spe-cies, including billfish, are declining at alarming rates because of exces-sive exploitation (Myers and Worm, 2003).

40|$|Trophic {{relations}} of cephalopods in southern Brazil were investigated from predation on cephalopods by 71 species of potential predators, including two squids, 47 fishes, seven seabirds and 15 marine mammals from shelf, upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters. In all, 27 families and 41 species of cephalopods were identified from stomach contents. The {{number of families}} ranged from six, in the diet of shelf predators, to 27 families in those from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. The most frequent cephalopod prey on the shelf was Loligo sanpaulensis, particularly important in the diet of Franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei, occurring also in the diet of the penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, the fur seals Arctocephalus australis, A. gazella, A. tropicalis, and several benthic and demersal fishes. Ommastrephidae, mainly Illex argentinus and Ornithoteuthis antillarum, was the most frequent family in the diet of predators from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. Illex argentinus was an important prey for the wreckfish Polyprion americanus, the bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, the swordfish Xiphias gladius and some marine mammals, especially in their winter and spring northward reproductive migration. Ornithoteuthis antillarum was frequent in the diet of the skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, the albacore Thunnus alalunga, the yellowfin tuna T. albacares, the Atlantic <b>sailfish</b> <b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans</b> and the white marlin Tetrapturus albidus.

40|$|Abstract. âThe biomass {{levels of}} several target {{species of the}} Atlantic pelagic {{longline}} fishery, including various tunas of the genus Thunnus and swordfish Xiphias gladius, {{are estimated to be}} close to those required to support the maximum sustainable yield. In contrast, several species captured incidentally are severely depleted. Live release of incidental catch is one means of reducing the fishing mortality of these species without sacrificing the target catch, but the efficacy of such a measure is predicated on the assumption that postrelease survival is relatively high. Prior work has evaluated postrelease survival from pelagic longline gear for the larger istiophorid billfishes, such as blue marlin Makaira nigricans and white marlin Kajikia albida, but survival rates are unknown for <b>sailfish</b> <b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus.

40|$|Abstract The {{reliability}} of estimations of catches of pelagic longline fisheries is especially worrying {{in the case}} of non-target species such as the <b>sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus) and spearfish (Tetrapturus pfluegeri), because they are often recorded aggregated in onboard maps. For this reason, generalized linear models were used to identify a number of important explanatory variables and their effect on sailfish and spearfish proportions. The response variable (number of sailfish in the aggregate capture) is assumed as binomial using the logit link function. The explanatory variables used were foram year, qrt (quarter), fleet, de (distance from equator) and d (distance from areas above sea level). The selected models showed that the equatorial and coastal regions presented higher densities or catchabilities of sailfish when compared to spearfish, as in the case for fleets of China Taipei and the United States. The lowest mean proportion of sailfish [sailfish/(sailfishÂ +Â spearfish) ] of the third quarter were driven mostly by the low estimations calculated for Japan and Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of larval istiophorid billfishes {{from the western}} North Atlantic Ocean has long been problematic.

Nine morphometric measurements were taken for a subset of larvae (species known), and lower jaw pigment patterns were recorded on a grid. Canonical variates analysis (CVA) was used to reveal {{the extent to which}} the combination of morphometric, pigment pattern, and month of capture information was diagnostic to species level. Linear regression revealed species-specific relationships between the ratio of snout length to eye orbit diameter and standard length (SL).

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of a novel form of group hunting. Individual <b>sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus) alternate attacks with other group members on their schooling prey (Sardinella aurita). While only 24 % of attacks result in prey capture, multiple prey are injured in 95 % of attacks, resulting in an increase of injured fish in the school {{with the number of}} attacks. How quickly prey are captured is positively correlated with the level of injury of the school, suggesting that hunters can benefit from other conspecifics' attacks on the prey. To explore this, we built a mathematical model capturing the dynamics of the hunt. We show that group hunting provides major efficiency gains (prey caught per unit time) for individuals in groups of up to 70 members. We also demonstrate that a free riding strategy, where some individuals wait until the prey are sufficiently injured before attacking, is only beneficial if the cost of attacking is high, and only then when waiting times are short. Our findings provide evidence that cooperative benefits can be realised through the facilitative effects of individuals' hunting actions without spatial coordination of attacks. Such "proto-cooperation" may be the pre-cursor to more complex group-hunting strategies...|$|R

In total, 1166 dorsal fins were collected, of which 1135 (97 %) (699 males and 436 females) were aged successfully. Trends in the monthly mean marginal increment ratio indicated that growth rings are formed once a year. Two methods were used to back-calculate the length of presumed ages, and growth was described by using the standard von Bertalanffy growth function and the Richards function.

In 1990, the Venezuelan Govern-ment issued a regulation restricting the landing and commercialization of billfish in a 50 -mile zone around La Guaira, {{in an effort to}} protect billfish populations in this area where sport fishing is particularly intense.

40|$|The {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of group living often depend on the spatial position of individuals within groups and the ability of individuals to occupy preferred positions. For example, models of predation events for moving prey groups predict higher mortality risk for individuals at the periphery and front of groups. We investigated these predictions in sardine (Sardinella aurita) schools under attack from group hunting <b>sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus) in the open ocean. Sailfish approached sardine schools about equally often from the front and rear, but prior to attack there was a chasing period in which sardines attempted to swim away from the predator. Consequently, all sailfish attacks were directed at the rear and peripheral positions of the school, resulting in higher predation risk for individuals at these positions. During attacks, sailfish slash at sardines with their bill causing prey injury including scale removal and tissue damage. Sardines injured in previous attacks were more often found in the rear half of the school than in the front half. Moreover, injured fish had lower tail-beat frequencies and lagged behind uninjured fish. Injuries inflicted by sailfish bills may, therefore, hinder prey swimming speed and drive spatial sorting in prey schools through passive self-assortment. We found only partial support for the theoretical predictions from current predator-prey models, highlighting the importance of incorporating more realistic predator-prey dynamics into these models.

40|$|Although sailfishes, {{predominantly}} {{represented by}} the Indo-Pacific <b>sailfish</b> <b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus constitute a prominent by-catch component of the tuna fishery of the Indian Ocean, very little effort is expended to estimate status of the stock, their biological characteristics {{and the impact of}} this by-catch fishery on the target species, if any. In India the sailfishes are exclusively the by-catches of tuna fishery as there is no exploitation of the species on commer cial line. The tuna long line survey results in the Indian EEZ shows that tunas, billfishes and sharks are the three major groups of fishes caught on the longline gears. Among billfishes, the sailfish, I platypterus form the major constituent. The information on the abundance indices indicates that the average catch rate obtained from the North West sector of the EEZ is 39. 42 kg/ 1000 hooks representing 15. 58 % of the total longline catches. From the seasonal variation of the catch rates it is observed that the second quarter (April-June) recorded the highest catch rate of 91. 97 kg/ 1000 hooks from this sector. The spawning season of the species is estimated to be protractive one from March-September in the Arabian Sea with peaks in March-April and August- September.

Mean density for all neuston net collections (n= 288) combined was 1. 5 sailfish per 1000 m 2, and maximum density was observed within frontal features created by hydrodynamic convergence (2. 3 sailfish per 1000 m 2). Sagittal otoliths were extracted from 1330 larvae, and otolith microstructure analysis indicated that the sailfish ranged in age from 4 to 24 days after hatching (mean= 10. 5 d, standard deviation [SD]= 3. 2 d). Instantaneous growth coefficients (g) among survey periods (n= 5) ranged from 0. 113 to 0. 127, and growth peaked during July 2005 collections when density within frontal features was highest. Daily instantaneous mortality rates (Z) ranged from 0. 228 to 0. 381, and Z was indexed to instantaneous weight-specific growth (G) to assess stage-specific production potential of larval cohorts. Ratios of G to Z were greater than 1. 0 for all but one cohort examined, indicating that cohorts were gaining biomass during the majority of months investigated. Stage-specific production potential, in combination with catch rates and densities of larvae, indicates that the Gulf of Mexico likely represents important spawning and nursery habitat for sailfish...|$|R
40|$|The biomass {{levels of}} several target {{species of the}} Atlantic pelagic {{longline}} fishery, including various tunas of the genus Thunnus and swordfish Xiphias gladius, {{are estimated to be}} close to those required to support the maximum sustainable yield. In contrast, several species captured incidentally are severely depleted. Live release of incidental catch is one means of reducing the fishing mortality of these species without sacrificing the target catch, but the efficacy of such a measure is predicated on the assumption that postrelease survival is relatively high. Prior work has evaluated postrelease survival from pelagic longline gear for the larger istiophorid billfishes, such as blue marlin Makaira nigricans and white marlin Kajikia albida, but survival rates are unknown for <b>sailfish</b> <b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus. To estimate the postrelease survival of sailfish caught on pelagic longline gear in the southern Gulf of Mexico, short-duration pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) were deployed on captured sailfish for 10 -d periods. Of the 29 sailfish captured, 20 (68. 9 %) were alive at the time of longline haulback, and the first 17 encountered alive were tagged. All tags transmitted at the preprogrammed times, and data from 15 of the 17 PSATs (88. 2 %) were consistent with the survival of the tagged sailfish for the 10 -d tag deployment. Our results clearly demonstrate that sailfish can survive the trauma from interaction with pelagic longline gear and that management measures promoting the release of live individuals from this fishery can significantly reduce sailfish mortality without reducing the catches of target species...|$|R
40|$|Pop-up {{satellite}} archival tags (PSATs) {{were deployed}} on 19 <b>sailfish</b> <b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus {{captured in the}} southern Gulf of Mexico and Florida Straits between 2005 and 2007 on commercial pelagic longline gear (n = 18) and recreational rod-and-reel gear (n = 1). The data from three tags indicated mortality events and were excluded from subsequent analyses. All PSATs were programmed to collect pressure (depth), temperature, and light-level data for 10 d at approximately 90 -s intervals. These transmitted point data subsequently allowed the reconstruction of vertical movement patterns. The remaining 16 PSAT data sets indicate that sailfish are primarily associated with the upper surface waters within the top 20 m (75. 7 % of total time during the day versus 46. 7 % at night) but undertake numerous short-duration vertical movements below the local mixed layer to depths of 50 â 150 m, presumably to feed. Analyses of 2, 279 individual vertical movements among all 16 tagged sailfish indicated two distinct types (short-duration âVâ and longer-duration âUâ movements) similar to those reported for white marlin Kajikia albida. Sailfish also exhibited movement type differences between diel periods (having higher proportions of V movements in daytime), suggesting directed foraging at depth. Although short-duration movement to depths by these tagged fish contribute {{a small percentage of}} the total time at depth, these depths overlap with themonitored shallow-set pelagic longline gear depths actively targeting swordfish by the vessel in the local fishery. These results suggest that time-at-depth histograms alone may be insufficient to capture feeding motivations at depth and, therefore, true interaction potentials between individual sailfish and pelagic longline gear...|$|R
40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM) {{over a three-year period}} (2006 â 2008) to determine the relative value of this region as early life habitat of <b>sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), white marlin (Kajikia albida), and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Sailfish were the dominant billfish collected in summer surveys, and larvae were present at 37. 5 % of the stations sampled. Blue marlin and white marlin larvae were present at 25. 0 % and 4. 6 % of the stations sampled, respectively, while swordfish occurred at 17. 2 % of the stations. Areas of peak production were detected and maximum density estimates for sailfish (22. 09 larvae 1000 mâ 2) were significantly higher than the three other species: blue marlin (9. 62 larvae 1000 mâ 2), white marlin (5. 44 larvae 1000 mâ 2), and swordfish (4. 67 larvae 1000 mâ 2). The distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae varied spatially and temporally, and several environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, sea surface height, distance to the Loop Current, current velocity, water depth, and Sargassum biomass) were deemed to be influential variables in generalized additive models (GAMs). Mesoscale features in the NGoM affected the distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae, with densities typically higher in frontal zones or areas proximal to the Loop Current. Habitat suitability of all four species was strongly linked to physicochemical attributes of the water masses they inhabited, and observed abundance was higher in slope waters with lower sea surface temperature and higher salinity. Our results highlight the value of the NGoM as early life habitat of billfishes and swordfish, and represent valuable baseline data for evaluating anthropogenic effects (i. e., Deepwater Horizon oil spill) on the Atlantic billfish and swordfish populations...|$|R
40|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius L.) and istiophorid {{billfish}} {{fisheries in}} all ocean basins are important commercially and recreationally. Proper assessments of these fisheries are hampered by species misidentification, unknown sex ratios, and unclarified population structure. This dissertation focuses on: 1) genetic assays to identify Pacific billfishes, 2) {{the characterization of}} molecular markers potentially linked to gender determination in swordfish and billfishes, and 3) the characterization of the genetic population structure of Pacific swordfish. Unambigous identification of black marlin (Istiompax indica), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), striped marlin (Kajikia audax) and <b>sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus) was accomplished with two variants of high resolution melting (HRM), including HRM of a 491 bp segment, and melting profiles of a 48 bp unlabeled probe. Both HRM assays target variation in the mitochondrial DNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND 2) gene and represent fast and robust alternatives to identify Pacific billfish. Surveys to identify gender-linked molecular markers were conducted using gender-validated samples. The characterization of Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers suggests a XY chromosomal system in blue marlin, and a ZW chromosomal system in sailfish, and possibly swordfish. Nucleotide sequence analyses of 12 loci known linked to gender determination in other teleosts showed no linkage in blue marlin, sailfish and swordfish. The genetic population structure of Pacific swordfish was surveyed using 16 samples (n= 891) with an ample geographic coverage and that included early stages (n= 150) and adults (n= 741). Bayesian analyses of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contained in 10 nuclear loci indicate statistically significant genetic heterogeneity of tropical samples relative to temperate samples, but also with respect to other tropical samples, but no differences among temperate samples. The observed patterns are discussed in light of differences among regions in oceanographic conditions, adult and larval distributions, and tagging experiments...|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic <b>sailfish</b> (<b>Istiophorus</b> platypterus) is {{considered}} over-fished in U. S. waters. Furthermore, preliminary analyses of abundance {{indicate that a}} decline in biomass has occurred. While seminal studies have provided useful baseline data about intra- and inter-oceanic variation within sailfish, such studies may have underestimated the amount of genetic variability {{as a result of}} small sample sizes and the poor resolution of restriction fragment length polymorphism data. We used 263 base pairs from the hypervariable mitochondrial control region and fragment polymorphisms from five microsatellite loci to assess the contemporary population structure between eastern (n = 30) and western (n = 192) Atlantic sailfish stocks. We failed to reject the hypothesis of panmixia in Atlantic sailfish; however, higher levels of genetic variation were observed within the eastern Atlantic sailfish, and the nature of this difference needs to be investigated further. Having found no evidence of transatlantic differentiation, we pooled the Atlantic samples (n = 222) and compared them to a sample from the eastern Pacific (n = 22) and rejected the null hypothesis, concluding that sailfish from separate ocean basins do not share a common gene pool. We also found evidence of a recent sudden expansion of Clade I (the ubiquitous clade found in both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans) sailfish into the Atlantic that appears to have occurred between 164000 and 351000 years ago, coinciding with interglacial periods during the Pleistocene. This study also presents the first evidence of a recent sudden expansion of sailfish into the eastern Pacific, roughly 85400 to 173000 years ago, following a period when cooling in the eastern Pacific would have restricted the sailfish range to the warmer waters of the western Indo-Pacific. We emphasize that sailfish from this region of the Pacific are phenotypically distinct from those {{in the rest of the}} species' range and encourage further studies in order to determine if the eastern Pacific sailfish population should be managed as a separate stock...|$|R
