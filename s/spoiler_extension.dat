50|$|The {{lines of}} the 200 Coup√© {{resulted}} from a completely new monoside and front and rear roof panels, new front and rear bumpers and a deep front <b>spoiler</b> <b>extension</b> with large intake grille.|$|E
5000|$|Indianapolis and the August Michigan race ran a high drag package, {{featuring}} a taller spoiler (9 in. height vertically with a 1 in wicker {{bill on the}} top of the spoiler), a 43 in radiator pan, and a 2 in <b>spoiler</b> <b>extension.</b> After complaints of overheating at the Indianapolis event, NASCAR mandated additional cooling holes in the right side window for the Michigan event. Due to concerns about drafting at these events, NASCAR also implemented the single-car qualifying system used at restrictor plate events for these two events.|$|E
50|$|There was no {{restriction}} on body size and doors until 1993, {{when it was}} changed to only allow cars {{with a minimum of}} four doors and no smaller than the EuroNCAP 'Small Family Car' class, although 'Large Family Car' tends to dominate the category. Until 1995, teams were only permitted to fit aerodynamic device that were available through dealers, but that changed when, in 1994 BTCC season, Alfa Romeo entered a 155 with Gabriele Tarquini and Giampiero Simoni as drivers. The car had a front spoiler with a bottom piece that could be unscrewed and moved forward, acting as a splitter, and a rear spoiler with a pair of extensions, giving the car more downforce. When Alfa Romeo won the first five rounds, Ford, supported by Vauxhall, made a complaint to the race stewards. TOCA soon decided the aero devices were illegal and Alfa Romeo were stripped of the points they earned at Snetterton and Silverstone, though this decision was later reversed by appeal. After this point, Alfa were forced to run their spoilers in the retracted position (the position in which the spoilers were fitted on the road going version, the Alfa 155 Silverstone, though the road car was sold with two unfitted <b>spoiler</b> <b>extension</b> brackets). In the mean time, Renault and BMW responded by introducing their own limited edition road cars - to enable them to run with oversized aerodynamic aids. Soon after that, the FIA changed the regulation in all series to allow cars to only use non-production aerodynamic devices with a restricted size. Restrictions varied depending on body type, with Volvo having to revert from the 850 Estate to their four-door saloon model the following season when they found themselves to be disadvantaged by the new rules. In the Italian Supertourismo category, teams entered extended spoilers without complaints.|$|E
50|$|The Magna Sports {{featured}} full exterior colour coding, six-spoke 16x6-inch alloy wheels, improved {{suspension and}} swaybars and a deck lid spoiler {{shared with the}} Magna VR-X. The mechanically similar VR-X shared these features, but also had aggressively styled front and rear bumper <b>spoiler</b> <b>extensions,</b> wheel arch extensions, side skirts and large diameter round chrome exhaust tip. Inside, the Sports and VR-X also shared white instrument cluster dials, sports fabric seat trim and front seat backrests embroidered with the respective models' name. The automatic VR-X also had a chrome gear gate inherited from the Verada. The subsequent and rare Magna Sports wagon (produced only with the TJ series) was fitted with a full bodykit featuring silver accents, unlike the Sports sedan that featured only had a deck lid spoiler.|$|R
40|$|A {{supplementary}} {{investigation has}} been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel of a 1 / 30 -scale model of the Grumman XFlOF- 1 airplane to determine what effect full-span slats {{would have on the}} spin-recovery characteristics of the swept-wing version of the XFlOF- 1 airplane, which had previously been indicated as possessing undesirable spin-recovery characteristics without slats. The effects of extended nose-wheel doors and of fairing the air-duct inlets were also determined. The results indicated that, with slats fully extended, satisfactory recovery could be obtained by rudder reversal provided it was accompanied by movement of the trimmer ailerons to full with the spin (only up-going <b>spoiler</b> operative), <b>Extension</b> of the nose-wheel doors or fairing of the air-duct inlets did not improve the recovery characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|Fifteen M3s {{were ordered}} by BMW Australia in 1994 to {{race in the}} Australian Super Production series. All were {{delivered}} to Tony Longhurst Racing for final preparation by the Frank Gardner run team. Eleven were {{made available to the}} general public (who had to possess a CAMS license to be allowed to buy one), while four were retained for the race series. The M3-R had locally sourced King springs fitted to Group N adjustable struts and rear perches, AP Racing twin plate clutch and four piston brake calipers, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head, A C Schnitzer cams, a 3.25:1 ratio medium case diff and M5 driveshaft, cold air snorkel into air filter box replacing left hand fog light, non-functional rear seat, air conditioner delete and more aggressive tune, GT front splitter and rear <b>spoiler</b> with <b>extensions</b> and gurney strips. This was the most powerful production E36 made with [...] A bolt-in FIA-approved roll cage was also a factory option (locally produced by Dencar) there were several differences between the cars depending on customer requirements, early numbers had non-staggered BBS wheels, later had staggered BBS wheels (individually numbered plaque fitted to centre console below emergency brake lever) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{infrared}} {{telescope is}} mounted in a cavity in the fuselage of a C- 141 airplane. The cavity is sealed {{off from the}} rest of the fuselage and can be opened to the outside for viewing. A retractable porous spoiler is installed ahead of the opening to inhibit cavity resonance. The paper presents the mean pressures, pressure fluctuations, spectra, phase, and coherence of the pressures in the cavity and on the fuselage near the cavity, along with pertinent acceleration and torque information for the aircraft structure and telescope. It is shown that a moderate <b>spoiler</b> <b>extension</b> controls resonance in normal flight attitudes and produces a cavity environment with approximately the same turbulence intensity as an attached turbulent boundary layer...|$|E
