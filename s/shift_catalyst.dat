The “High Temperature <b>Shift</b> <b>catalyst</b> began the process of ‘reduction’” where steam passes through the catalyst bed and out the SP8 vent stack. At this time lower temperatures in parts of the plant caused some of the steam to condense lower which caused chromium(VI) from the catalyst bed to dissolve into the liquid present.

30|$|The water gas shift {{reaction}} {{is an essential}} step in modern ammonia plants.

Hence, good performance of the <b>shift</b> <b>catalyst</b> and attainment of equilibrium CO slip from the catalyst system is critical for the efficient and economic operation of the plant to maximize the hydrogen production from the plant. In most ammonia plants, the shift conversion is carried out in two stages. Usually, a high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst is used as the first stage and typically converts over 80 % of the CO. A low temperature <b>shift</b> <b>catalyst</b> (LTS) then converts the majority of the remaining CO [1].

40|$|Restricted until 03 Nov. 2011. Hydrogen {{is widely}} {{considered}} as a fuel for the future to address the energy crisis and the environmental concerns. In this study, process intensification in hydrogen production from natural gas, coal- and biomass-derived syngas is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. A novel reactor/separator system, termed the “one-box” process is being employed. The heart of this system is a membrane reactor (MR) that combines the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction with hydrogen separation into a single unit, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the commonly utilized two separate WGS reactors and a distinct purification unit.; Impurity-resistant carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes and sour-gas <b>shift</b> <b>catalysts</b> are utilized in order to treat the gas streams with simulated coal/biomass-derived syngas compositions. Both have shown high tolerance for H 2 S and NH 3, which are the main impurities in the syngas (in fact, the sour-gas <b>shift</b> <b>catalysts</b> require sulfur to be present in order to remain active). This adds another benefit to the system by eliminating the need for gas clean-up upstream of the WGS reactor, which saves energy, and significantly simplifies the process design. The CMS membrane stability is further investigated in the presence of model tar and organic vapor compounds. The membranes proved to be stable at temperatures akin to the WGS environment. Permeation loss occurred at lower temperatures; however, regeneration was readily achieved by purging the membranes with inert gas at higher temperatures. This indicates that at low temperatures only surface coverage through condensation occurs, with little or no irreversible pore plugging of the membrane.; The project focus has been on experimental investigations in order to prove the feasibility of using the ‘one-box’ system for H 2 production and to validate a mathematical model developed for use for scale-up investigations. Prior to their use in the MR experiments, the membranes are characterized via single and multi-component gas permeation measurements. Packed-bed experiments are also performed in order to derive the kinetic rate expressions. The effect of different experimental conditions on MR performance, in terms of CO conversion, hydrogen product recovery and purity is experimentally studied, and the results are compared with those from the mathematical model. The model is further used for process scale-up, and in order predict the MR performance under conditions akin to the industrial applications. It is shown that the MR-based systems are capable of converting more CO into H 2 when compared to the more traditional packed-bed reactors, in some cases attaining almost complete CO conversions.; In addition to the CMS membrane-based MR, we have also investigated palladium (Pd) membranes with infinite selectivity towards hydrogen, combined with low-temperature <b>shift</b> (LTS) <b>catalysts</b> are used for ultra pure hydrogen production from gas streams with simulated natural gas reformate compositions, to serve as a feed for fuel cell applications.

Na-exchange of Sn-Beta titrates the neighboring SiOH {{group in the}} open Sn site and <b>shifts</b> <b>catalyst</b> selectivity to mannose formed by a 1, 2 -C-shift reaction. To probe structure/activity relationships in the zeolite, tin-containing silsesquioxanes with (1 a) and without (1 b) a neighboring SiOH group were recently synthesized and tested. These molecular catalysts are active for glucose conversion, and the presence (absence) of the SiOH favors fructose (mannose) selectivity by intramolecular H(C) -shift reactions. Using density functional theory, we investigated numerous H/C-shift pathways on these tin-silsesquioxane catalysts. On both 1 a and 1 b, the H-shift reaction occurs through a bidentate binding mode without participation of the SiOH, while the bidentate binding mode is not favored for the C-shift due to steric hindrance. Instead, the C-shift reaction occurs through different concerted reaction pathways, in which an acetylacetonate (acac) ligand interacts with the substrate in the transition state complexes. Favorable H-shift pathways without SiOH participation and acac ligand promotion of the C-shift pathway explain why 1 a produces mannose from C-shift reactions instead of exclusively catalyzing H-shift reactions, as the Sn-Beta open site does...|$|R

The catalyst samples have been characterized using temperature programmed sulfurization (TPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and laser Raman and BET surface area measurements. The results have shown that adding TiO 2 to the catalyst makes the active components, e. g., Mo and Co, easier to be sulfurized with higher sulfur capacity in the catalyst itself. This may be the main reason why the TiO 2 modified CoMo catalyst to be active even at low H 2 S gas stream. The results from industrial operation showed that adding TiO 2 to the <b>shift</b> <b>catalyst</b> increases the catalyst activity and stability, presents the higher shift activity in {{a broader range of}} H 2 S content, depresses the aggregating of the molybdenum oxide, and reduces carbon deposition.

In the freshly prepared catalyst, the active components e. g., MoO 3 is mainly present in the internal surface or sublayer of the catalyst, but it gradually migrates to the catalyst surface with the time on stream.

It has been established that a simple iron high temperature <b>shift</b> <b>catalyst</b> becomes ineffective in a membrane reactor because the reaction rate is severely inhibited by the build-up of the product CO{sub 2 }. During the past year, an improved microkinetic model for water-gas shift over iron oxide was developed. Its principal advantage over prior models is that it displays the correct asymptotic behavior at all temperatures and pressures as the composition approaches equilibrium. This model has been used to explore whether {{it might be possible to}} improve the performance of iron high temperature shift catalysts under conditions of high CO{sub 2 } partial pressure. The model predicts that weakening the surface oxygen bond strength by less than 5 % should lead to higher catalytic activity as well as resistance to rate inhibition at higher CO{sub 2 } partial pressures. Two promoted iron high temperature shift catalysts were studied. Ceria and copper were each studied as promoters since there were indications in the literature that they might weaken the surface oxygen bond strength.
