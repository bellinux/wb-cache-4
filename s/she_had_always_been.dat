5|$|And {{where in}} modern {{dramatic}} literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> ashamed to tell; Liliom crying {{out to the}} distant carousel the glad news that he {{is to be a}} father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.|$|E
5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, to Brian and Heather Stewart and has a younger brother named Connor. Breanna began playing {{basketball}} at an early age; in fifth grade, she decided to improve her game. Now six feet four inches tall, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> tall for her age, which often meant coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder. However, her father thought it would help if she had ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. Even after heading off to college, she still did the routine at home.|$|E

25|$|Chimega, {{possessed of}} a warm and patient personality, soon became the university's beloved mascot. She resided in a large cage just {{to the south of}} the University Center that was topped with a {{geodesic}} dome designed by visiting professor R. Buckminster Fuller. She was cared for by a student organization aptly named the Cougar Guard, who accompanied her on her twice-daily walks around the core campus and to a myriad of university activities, especially including athletic events. (In keeping with the times, the Cougar Guard was originally all-male, but eventually became co-ed.) Chimega mated in 1974 and bore two cubs, one stillborn, the second dying within hours. In the summer of 1982, having become less patient with people than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been,</b> Chimega was retired from active mascot service. She died in March 1985 and was buried near the pond located east of the classroom building now known as Founder's Hall.|$|E
25|$|Born Sybille Overhoff on 3 July 1926 to Edith née Kloeppel, her German mother, and Julius Overhoff, her Austrian father, {{she was one}} of five {{siblings}} {{including her}} twin sister Elfriede Knauer, an archaeologist. She grew up in a cultured family in Berlin, Frankfurt and Austria but her schooling was interrupted by the Nazi regime. She had to join Nazi youth organisations and spent a year doing compulsory labour in harsh conditions. After the war things remained difficult for some time and she studied Chinese while waiting for Frankfurt University to reopen in 1947. However, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> interested in the antiquities collected by her maternal great-grandfather, the sculptor and art historian , and had a long-standing wish to study classical archaeology, and in particular, Etruscology. Once at the Goethe University Frankfurt she studied classical archaeology, ancient history, art history and ethnology and found vacation work in museums in Paris, Rome, and London before graduating summa cum laude in December 1950. She went on to write a thesis on Etruscan bronze mirrors, supervised and encouraged by Guido von Kaschnitz.|$|E
25|$|Karen Michaelis, {{ten years}} or so before {{the day of the}} {{previous}} section, is sailing from her native England to visit her Aunt Violet and Uncle Bill Bent at Rushbrook, County Cork, Ireland. Karen is escaping the pressures of her recent engagement to Ray Forrestier, ambivalent about the wedding; Ray himself is on a business trip. Her time with Uncle Bill and Aunt Violet is rather uneventful and uninspiring until Uncle Bill, a nervous and socially inadequate man, tells Karen that Violet is to have surgery in the coming weeks, a procedure that could prove fatal. Back in England, Karen finds Naomi Fisher waiting for her; she has travelled to London to see to the affairs of her recently deceased aunt, and tells Karen of her engagement to Max Ebhart, whom Karen met years before while {{she was one of the}} girls staying at Mme Fisher's house. Despite Karen's objections — <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> afraid of Max — Naomi insists the three spend time together before Max and Naomi return home.|$|E

Because previously <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the good wife, and Jin was the bad husband".

500|$|Sigler, who {{was offered}} the role only days before filming commenced, said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a fan of Carey, and {{accepted}} the offer immediately. She described that the shoot was set in the 1960s, and that she played the singer's mother during and after her pregnancy. Sigler described the plot: [...] "With my character, she's basically going against her parent's wishes to be with this gentleman. She's pregnant with a baby, which is Mariah, and they run away together. So it's kind of an epic love story, it's nice." [...] Carey revealed that the video would incorporate a rainstorm scene in New York City. Carey jokingly explained how she originally {{did not intend to}} get wet, but felt it added a lot to the video.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 115 she {{attracted}} the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of rheumatism. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4ft 6 in [...] and her weight was 88 pounds she confirmed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> small, but she had lost weight in recent years.

500|$|Robert. C. Cooper {{suggested}} Australian actress Claudia Black for {{the role}} of Vala and contacted her agent two days before the filming of [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] began. The Stargate producers had approached Black several times before, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> busy with other projects. At [...] "Prometheus Unbound"'s casting stage, the actress had just finished dialogue looping sessions for [...] in Australia. She thought the script of [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] was funny and self-contained enough for creative experiments, so she accepted the role and called the episode's director, Andy Mikita, in advance. He suggested an Out of Sight-kind chemistry for Vala and Daniel, and encouraged the actress to push the character as far as possible. On set, Claudia Black and Michael Shanks decided to make one of their first scenes, a fight sequence, as funny and non-machismo as possible to mirror Daniel's non-military background. In the meantime, Black tried to transform her day-long jetlag and lack of sleep into humour. When the producers saw the on-screen chemistry between Black and Shanks, they decided to make the character a bigger part of the show.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs that was {{recorded}} for the album was [...] "Fantasy". While Carey began developing new ideas for Daydream, {{she thought of the}} song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] by Tom Tom Club. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a fan of the song, and presented Dave Hall with the idea of sampling the song's hook. Hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented Carey's voice, while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics. Carey recorded a remix to the song as well, featuring hip-hop verses from O.D.B of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as production from Puffy. She spoke highly of the remix, complimenting Puffy and O.D.B, [...] "He's so known in the street, and he's one of the best people out there...we kind of did what we both do and having O.D.B took it to another level. He was my ultimate choice, so I was really happy with the way it turned out." [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] was a song that Carey wrote with the R group Boyz II Men. After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the chorus and concept composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. It was produced by Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats.|$|E

Later she released a book, After the Change, which featured reprints of all 24 sketches.|$|E
2500|$|After {{establishing}} {{herself as}} a [...] "discovery" [...] of Hal Wallis, Miller soon found herself left behind. In an interview with Mike Fitzgerald, she was quoted as saying, [...] "Hal called me the 'Viking Girl.' He didn't {{know what to do}} with me." [...] The situation was aggravated by the return of veteran actors from overseas, either in uniform or the USO. Compounded by the economic slump after the war, rise of television and the breakup of the studio system, Miller's initial difficulties during the war years would be multiplied many fold. Miller's prospects began to look a little better when she met journalist and film producer Mark Hellinger, who felt sure that she could become a star. But Hellinger died suddenly in 1947, and Miller soon found herself making a living with the usual small roles that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> given. Of the nine films she would make under contract to Paramount, three were loan-outs to other studios, two of which were more significant than her Paramount films, with the exception of I Walk Alone. Typical of the Paramount years, in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948), she was cast as the wife of the investigating detective but was recast as the mistress of the physician, dropping from 3rd to 13th place in billing.|$|E

Writers also developed an affair storyline for Trevor and Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) {{to coincide with}} the wedding. The latter is due to marry Trevor's enemy Ben Bradley (Ben Richards). They visit each other in secret and concoct a plan to run away together. Kilkelly reported that Grace and Sienna's wedding preparations would see them turn into [...] "bridezillas" [...] clashing with one another over dresses. Passey told Tina Campbell of The Sun that the show were developing an unlikely, [...] "weird friendship" [...] between Sienna and Grace. The actress warned [...] "it will be short-lived", hinting that the affair would story would not be long-running. Viewers were divided over their support for each relationship as both pairing proved popular. Trevor and Sienna were given the fan worship name [...] "Trienna" [...] pitted against [...] "Trace" [...] fans. Wall told Campbell that she was surprised Grace never discovered the affair because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> portrayed as clued up about men.

2500|$|He {{accompanied}} William Walker on the latter's 1855 filibustering {{expedition to}} Nicaragua. In {{the spring of}} 1857, Miller took part in an expedition against the Pit River Tribe after they killed a white man on Pit River. Years later, he claimed that he had sided with the Native Americans and was run {{out of town for}} it. He was widely rumored to have married an Indian woman, possibly a Wintu princess who nursed him back to health after he was wounded by Modocs, and to have fathered with her a daughter named Cali-Shasta, or [...] "Lily of the Shasta." [...] Although Miller soon left the area to pursue other adventures, in the 1870s he sought out Cali-Shasta, then in her teens, and took her to San Francisco to be educated by his friend Ina Coolbrith. Contemporaries believed that Miller's [...] "Indian wife" [...] was the woman later kidnapped by Modocs and held in captivity for some years until rescued by a man named Jim Brock (whom she married), but when [...] "Amanda Brock" [...] died in 1909, Miller denied news reports describing his supposed romance with her. He credited her with saving his life, but said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a platonic friend.|$|E
2500|$|Other redheads whose {{personal}} style combined elegance with boho and gothic features were English model Lily Cole (who adopted black hair in 2010 – [...] "Golly goth", as one newspaper headline put it) and model/singer Karen Elson. Elson told a Times journalist that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> [...] "the weird looking one" [...] in modelling circles and remarked {{of herself and}} her then husband Jack White of the rock duo White Stripes that [...] "there's {{going to be a}} point when our children view us as the Addams Family". (In the 1960s incarnation of The Addams Family for ABC television, based on the characters created by Charles Addams for The New Yorker in 1938, Carolyn Jones had created a gothic icon with her portrayal of Morticia Addams.) Like Welch, Elson exuded pre-Raphaelite features, though a marked gothic strain was also apparent when, as a singer on stage in 2009, she wore a long salmon dress with black lace edging. Similarly, her lingerie portfolio that year for Agent Provocateur combined gothic and boho-rock features, there being, for example, a certain resonance between a black and white brassiere and panties set that formed part of that collection and the black swimsuit in which Zooey Deschanel was photographed in 2008. In 2010 Pixie Lott said that the item of clothing she would save in a fire were her [...] "favourite black frilly shorts".|$|E
