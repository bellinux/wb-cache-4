5|$|The {{game has}} several modes: Star Trip, Simple, Deluge, and Time Attack. Star Trip is Meteos story mode. Its plot {{centers on the}} evil planet Meteo sending its matter (the meteos) to other planets, killing life and {{destroying}} worlds. After three meteos fuse and launch themselves and other meteos into space, the civilizations on other planets plan a counterattack against Meteo. The player travels from planet to planet on the Metamo Ark, a warship made of metean ore. The story has branching paths, with the last level requiring the player to defeat Meteo itself. The Simple mode allowed a quick {{play of the game}} while letting the player change the rules, such as the difficulty and the number of lives they can have. The Deluge mode meanwhile lasts until the player dies. Time War has two goals: getting the high score in a limited time or launching as many meteos as possible from a set number. The game also has a multiplayer mode, where the player can <b>send</b> <b>up</b> to four other players a demo to play against each other with one game cartridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{afternoon}} of the wreck, the purser, Mr. J.W. McCully, went downriver to Salem, where he telegraphed to the company Oregon City to <b>send</b> <b>up</b> nails, lumber and carpenters to repair the Alice, and another steamer, either the Fannie Patton or the E.N. Cooke {{to come up and}} take off the cargo.|$|E
25|$|Because of this statement, {{reinforced}} by another more detailed report, issued on 10 August, {{there was a}} mindset {{in the ranks of}} the Luftwaffe that the RAF would run out of frontline fighters. The Luftwaffe believed it was weakening Fighter Command at three times the actual attrition rate. Many times, the leadership believed Fighter Command's strength had collapsed, only to discover that the RAF were able to <b>send</b> <b>up</b> defensive formations at will.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of pulque {{is complex and}} required {{the death of the}} maguey plant. As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to <b>send</b> <b>up</b> a single flower stalk, which may reach up to 20 feet in height. However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18inches in diameter. In this center, the maguey sap, known as aguamiel (honeywater), collects. It takes a maguey plant 12 years to mature enough to produce the sap for pulque.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{functions}} of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If white smoke appears, created by burning the ballots of the election, a new Pope has been elected. If a candidate receives less than a two-thirds vote, the cardinals <b>send</b> <b>up</b> black smoke — created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives — it means that no successful election has yet occurred.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the RAND Corporation {{analysed}} ISIL's {{funding sources}} from documents captured between 2005 and 2010. It found that outside donations amounted to only 5% of the group's operating budgets, and that cells inside Iraq {{were required to}} <b>send</b> <b>up</b> to 20% of the income generated from kidnapping, extortion rackets and other activities {{to the next level}} of the group's leadership, which would then redistribute the funds to provincial or local cells that were in difficulties or needed money to conduct attacks. In 2016, RAND estimated that ISIL finances from its largest source of income — oil revenues and the taxes it extracts from people under its control — had fallen from about $1.9 billion in 2014 to $870 million.|$|E

25|$|The X-Men {{return from}} their {{confrontation}} with Blob and Pyro {{to find the}} mansion in ruins and the Professor and Kitty unconscious. Xavier once again reads Magneto's thoughts, this time learning the full details of his plan. Magneto plans to redirect the passing Scorpio comet onto {{a collision course with}} Earth. This would <b>send</b> <b>up</b> a cloud of dust and debris, blocking out the Sun for years, plunging the planet into another Ice Age, which would leave normal humans weakened, allowing the mutants to take over. The X-Men leave at once for Magneto's orbiting sanctuary Asteroid M, but the X-Men instruct Kitty to stay, as the mission is far too dangerous and she has not been trained. Kitty, however, wanting to prove her worth and make amends for her previous failure, phases aboard the Blackbird and hides, with the Professor's blessing.|$|E
25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system. The system will make the car 100% rear wheel drive when driving at a steady speed. When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can <b>send</b> <b>up</b> to 50% of torque to the front wheels. When the car's speed becomes steady again, the drivetrain will return torque to the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer torque to the front wheels if the system detects loss of traction. This technology was first used in the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, and has since been used in subsequent Skylines, and other vehicles in Japan and overseas, including the Nissan Bluebird, and Nissan Stagea.|$|E
25|$|The Brooklyn Class was {{equipped}} with 15 6"/47 Mark 16 naval guns developed from the 6"/53 Mark 8 used on the Omaha Class cruiser. The decision was reached as the gun could achieve up to ten rounds per minute rate of fire. This gave the class the ability to <b>send</b> <b>up</b> to {{one hundred and fifty}} rounds a minute at its intended target. This allowed the cruiser to smother an enemy ship with fire. The turret arrangement was five turrets each mounting three guns on a single sleeve. The six-inch guns were of a new design, the Mk 16, which could fire a 130-pound shell up to 26,100 yards (nearly 23,900 meters). The 130-pound shell had twice the penetrative power of the old gun noted at rising from 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches at 10,000 yards and 2 inches of deck armor at 20,000 yards. The impact of the shell changed the General Board's view on the usefulness of light cruisers in service. The ammunition was of the semi-fixed type.|$|E

25|$|Leaving {{nothing to}} chance, Motti Hod decided to {{assemble}} the best possible squad for the mission. Airmen selection rested with the Squadron commanders and each subsequently selected himself. Amos Amir, commanding 119 Squadron and a 5-kills ace at the time, selected Asher Snir (11 kills), Avraham Salmon (6) and Avi Gilad (2) to accompany him. Uri Even-Nir, commanding 117 Squadron and already credited with 3 kills, was {{to be accompanied by}} Itamar Neuner (4), Yehuda Koren (7) and Kobi Richter (7). Iftach Spector, an 8-kills ace leading 101 Squadron, was accompanied by Michael Tzuk (2), Israel Baharav (5) and Giora Ram-Furman. The 69 Squadron Phantoms was led by Avihu Bin-Nun, who had shot down 2 aircraft as a Mirage pilot, with navigator Shaul Levi. Also present were Aviem Sella (1) with Reuven Reshef, Ehud Hankin (3, navigator unknown) and Uri Gil (1) with Israel Parnas. To face the Soviets, who had little combat experience and no kills to their name, the IAF was preparing to <b>send</b> <b>up</b> some of its most experienced pilots, with a combined score of 67 aerial kills.|$|E

500|$|Walley {{managed to}} secure the group several paid engagements {{throughout}} the spring of 1957, including one at The Cavern Club A jazz club at the time, the Cavern tolerated skiffle as it was considered an offshoot of jazz.

500|$|Thorpe's {{television}} and radio work had brought him a measure of celebrity, and his colourful and individualistic campaigning style was widely admired. The journalist Christopher Booker recalled: [...] "He had an extraordinary ability both to cheer up [...] his followers and <b>send</b> <b>up</b> his opponents". However, throughout the 1950s Thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life, {{at a time when}} all such activity was illegal in the United Kingdom, and subject to heavy penalties; exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly. [...] This sexual preference, concealed from the wider public, was known and tolerated in North Devon, [...] and was at least suspected by many in the Liberal Party.|$|E

500|$|By 2010, {{only three}} {{countries}} had never sent female athletes to the Games: Brunei, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Brunei had {{taken part in}} only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would [...] "press" [...] these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Anita DeFrantz, chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the Qatar Olympic Committee announced that it [...] "hoped to <b>send</b> <b>up</b> to four female athletes in shooting and fencing" [...] to the 2012 Summer Games in London.|$|E
500|$|This {{meant the}} railroads and {{highways}} in Korea took central prominence to North Korean resupply. The North Koreans were given supplies by both China and the Soviet Union, neither {{of whom were}} committed to the war at this point, and did not commit combat troops directly. They fed supplies into North Korea through six rail lines, five from Manchuria and one from Siberia. China in particular had an extensive rail network and thousands of locomotives. The railroads {{had the capacity to}} <b>send</b> <b>up</b> to [...] of supplies into North Korea per day. The full amount of supplies that were actually sent to North Korea at this phase of the war is unclear, but historians suggest that even {{at the height of the}} war and Chinese involvement the supplies did not increase beyond [...] per day. However the railroads were primarily oriented on north–south routes, making resupply from east to west difficult.|$|E
500|$|The British {{had cleared}} the upper decks of American resistance, {{and most of}} Chesapeakes crew had taken refuge on the berth deck. A musket or pistol shot from the berth deck killed a British marine, William Young, who was {{guarding}} the main hatchway. The furious British crewmen then began firing through the hatchway at the Americans crowded below. Lieutenant Charles Leslie Falkiner of Shannon, {{the leader of the}} boarders who had rushed the maindeck, restored order by threatening to blow out the brains of the next person to fire. He then demanded that the Americans <b>send</b> <b>up</b> the man who had killed Young, adding that Chesapeake was taken and [...] "We have three hundred men aboard. If there is another act of hostility you will be called up on deck one by one– and shot." [...] Falkiner was given command of Chesapeake as a British prize-vessel.|$|E
