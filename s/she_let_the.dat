25|$|She {{fought in}} the major Russian engagements of the 1806-1807 Prussian campaign. During two of those battles, she saved the lives of two fellow Russian soldiers. The first was an enlisted man who fell off his horse on the {{battlefield}} and suffered a concussion. She gave him first aid under heavy fire and brought him to safety as the army retreated around them. The second was an officer, unhorsed but uninjured. Three French dragoons were closing on him. She couched her lance and scattered the enemy. Then, against regulations, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> officer borrow her own horse to hasten his retreat, which left her more vulnerable to attack.|$|E
25|$|Rahab {{promptly}} {{went up to}} the spies on {{the roof}} and told them that she knew that God had given the Israelites the land, and that the people lived in terror of the Israelites, having heard how God dried up the Red Sea before them and how the Israelites had destroyed the forces of Sihon and Og. So Rahab asked the spies to swear by God, since she had dealt kindly with them, that they would also deal kindly with her father's house and give her a token to save her family from the coming invasion. The spies told her that if she would not tell of their doings, then when God gave the Israelites the land, they would deal kindly with her. She let them down by a cord through her window, as her house was on the city wall. She told them to hide in the mountain for three days. They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die. She agreed, sent them on their way, and bound the scarlet line in her window.|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "She somersaulted while {{suspended}} in a harness. Thrilling! She sang {{happy birthday to}} a 2-year-old. Adorable! <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> crowd take over while singing 'Irreplaceable.' Fun! She got {{on her knees and}} mourned Michael Jackson. Poignant! She hit most of her notes too, though sometimes slipping badly in her lower register. And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations... Indeed, her production {{can be seen as a}} retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born in Warrington, Lancashire, England in 1942, Raymond Clark, {{along with}} his parents Anne and Samuel Clark and his siblings, moved to Oswaldtwistle during the war, hence his nickname, [...] "Ossie".
