5|$|On 6March 1429 Joan of Arc {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly voices that <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> would grant her an army {{to relieve the}} siege of Orléans. While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray. Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to Poitiers {{so that she could}} be cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E
500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", <b>said</b> <b>Charles,</b> [...] "but I forgive you because you do it to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E
500|$|Charles {{was accused}} of treason against England by using his power to pursue his {{personal}} interest rather than {{the good of the}} country. The charge stated that he, [...] "for accomplishment of such his designs, and for the protecting of himself and his adherents in his and their wicked practices, to the same ends hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented", and that the [...] "wicked designs, wars, and evil practices of him, the <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> Stuart, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will, power, and pretended prerogative to himself and his family, against the public interest, common right, liberty, justice, and peace of the people of this nation." [...] Reflecting the modern concept of command responsibility, the indictment held him [...] "guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to this nation, acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby." [...] An estimated 300,000 people, or 6% of the population, died during the war.|$|E

500|$|As part of Charles' Grammy Award for Album of the Year-winning Genius Loves Company, {{the song}} {{proved to be}} the most popular and {{critically}} acclaimed on the album. Although the song had its early detractors, it received mostly favorable reviews. Several reviewers noted the complementarity of Jones and Charles. The Daily Vault Jason Warburg described the song as a [...] "jazzy, slinky pas de deux" [...] in which Charles matches Jones note for note." [...] JazzTimes Christopher Loudon <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> [...] "blends seamlessly with Jones on a velvet-and-buckram" [...] performance. The song was described by the Orlando Sentinel Jim Abbott as a recreation of one of the gems from Charles' country music phase of the 1960s that produced the perfect [...] "combination of voices and instruments" [...] with Preston's accompanying role on Hammond B3. As opposed to other tracks on the album, when Charles' voice was understated, this song was said to represent his [...] "indomitable spirit", while Jones performed as [...] "an empathetic foil, [...] her warm, lazy vocals meshing convivially with his over a spare but funky arrangement". Author Mike Evans wrote that [...] "there's a mutual warmth of purpose in every breath [...] take" [...] on the song. Music Week staff noted the timeliness of the release with the biographical film Ray in theaters and described the song as soulful, that finely combines Charles' [...] "deep, honeyed growl with Jones's lighter timber", while noting Preston for his [...] "sweeping" [...] organ work.|$|E
500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. <b>Said</b> <b>Charles</b> Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we {{have never been able to}} let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contemporaries <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> {{appeared}} to be in a [...] "fever" [...] to begin the campaign and disconnected in his speech. Charles set off with an army on 1 July 1392. The progress of the army was slow, which nearly drove Charles into a frenzy of impatience.|$|E

2500|$|Gibbon has <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> was [...] "content {{with the}} titles of Mayor or Duke of the Franks, but he {{deserved}} to become {{the father of a}} line of kings," [...] which he did. Gibbon also says of him, [...] "in the public danger, he was summoned by the voice of his country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, {{post-traumatic}} growth, positive psychological change {{experienced as}} a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances could also result. The triumph of the miners in a highly challenging environment could also increase their self-confidence and strengthen bonds with each other and with their families. [...] "When people are deprived ... it can be really adverse, it can really mess up a person. With these guys, they were together", <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> Nelson, a psychologist with the operational stress injury clinic at Parkwood Hospital in London, Ontario. Peter Suedfeld, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia, said the men are less likely to have trouble returning to their jobs. [...] "Sailors who have been shipwrecked, for example ... many of them go back to sea", he said. [...] "They'll feel that they can cope with anything that comes up." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{writing the}} first two Broken Sword titles in the 1990s, Revolution Software's games were {{published}} by Virgin Interactive, who wanted {{to ensure that the}} games were of quality, putting Revolution under no pressure and giving them much creative freedom and little time restriction (more so with the first game, [...] ). Towards the end of the 1990s, however, adventure games, largely 2D and PC-exclusive, were declining in popularity during the rise of visceral, 3D platformers and were viewed as [...] "commercially unfeasible." [...] Cecil credited the decline to PlayStation, which introduced a new audience of University age interested in visceral, 3D games. As a result, publishers would rather pitch titles such as 3D shooters to retailers. This [...] "drove away the audience that wanted more cerebral games like adventures, so sales for the genre dropped even further and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Charles</b> Cecil, Revolution's CEO and Broken Sword creator.|$|E
