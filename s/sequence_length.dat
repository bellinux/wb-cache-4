25|$|Also {{known as}} the Corsi Span Test, this {{psychological}} test is commonly {{used to determine the}} visual-spatial memory span and the implicit visual-spatial learning abilities of an individual. Participants sit with nine wooden 3x3-cm blocks fastened before them on a 25- x 30-cm baseboard in a standard random order. The experiment taps onto the blocks a sequence pattern which participants must then replicate. The blocks are numbered on the experimenters' side to allow for efficient pattern demonstration. The <b>sequence</b> <b>length</b> increases each trial until the participant is no longer able to replicate the pattern correctly. The test can be used to measure both short-term and long-term spatial memory, depending on the length of time between test and recall.|$|E

25|$|Nivasch {{describes}} an algorithm {{that does not}} use a fixed amount of memory, but for which the expected amount of memory used (under {{the assumption that the}} input function is random) is logarithmic in the <b>sequence</b> <b>length.</b> An item is stored in the memory table, with this technique, when no later item has a smaller value. As Nivasch shows, the items with this technique can be maintained using a stack data structure, and each successive sequence value need be compared only {{to the top of the}} stack. The algorithm terminates when the repeated sequence element with smallest value is found. Running the same algorithm with multiple stacks, using random permutations of the values to reorder the values within each stack, allows a time–space tradeoff similar to the previous algorithms. However, even the version of this algorithm with a single stack is not a pointer algorithm, due to the comparisons needed to determine which of two values is smaller.|$|E

500|$|For n {{individual}} sequences, {{the naive}} method requires constructing the n-dimensional {{equivalent of the}} matrix formed in standard pairwise sequence alignment. The search space thus increases exponentially with increasing n and is also strongly dependent on <b>sequence</b> <b>length.</b> Expressed with the big O notation commonly used to measure computational complexity, a naïve MSA takes O(LengthNseqs) time to produce. [...] To find the global optimum for n sequences this way {{has been shown to}} be an NP-complete problem. [...] In 1989, based on Carrillo-Lipman Algorithm, Altschul introduced a practical method that uses pairwise alignments to constrain the n-dimensional search space. [...] In this approach pairwise dynamic programming alignments are performed on each pair of sequences in the query set, and only the space near the n-dimensional intersection of these alignments is searched for the n-way alignment. The MSA program optimizes the sum of all of the pairs of characters at each position in the alignment (the so-called sum of pair score) and has been implemented in a software program for constructing multiple sequence alignments.|$|E
40|$|Hidden Markov models (HMMs) play a {{major role}} in {{applications}} to unravel biomolecular functionality. Though HMMs are technically mature and widely applied in computational biology, there is a potential of methodical optimisation concerning its modelling of biological data sources with varying <b>sequence</b> <b>lengths.</b> Single building blocks of these models, the states, are associated with a certain holding time, being the link to the length distribution of represented sequence motifs. An adaptation of regular HMM topologies to bell-shaped <b>sequence</b> <b>lengths</b> is achieved by a serial chain-linking of hidden states, while residing in the class of conventional hidden Markov models. The factor of the repetition of states (r) and the parameter for state-specific duration of stay (p) are determined by fitting the distribution of <b>sequence</b> <b>lengths</b> with the method of moments (MM) and maximum likelihood (ML). Performance evaluations of differently adjusted HMM topologies underline the impact of an optimisation for HMMs based on <b>sequence</b> <b>lengths.</b> Secondary structure prediction on internal transcribed spacer 2 sequences demonstrates exemplarily the general impact of topological optimisations. In summary, we propose a general methodology to improve the modelling behaviour of HMMs by topological optimisation with ML and a fast and easily implementable moment estimator. ...|$|R

500|$|Gene {{expression}} of SFTPA2 is regulated {{at different levels}} including gene transcription, post-transcriptional processing, stability and translation (biology) of mature mRNA. One of the important features of human surfactant protein A mRNAs {{is that they have}} a variable five prime untranslated region (5’UTR) generated from splicing variation of exons A, B, C, and D. At least 10 forms of human SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 5’UTRs have been identified that differ in nucleotide <b>sequence,</b> <b>length,</b> and relative amount. Most SFTPA2 specific 5’UTRs include exon B. This 30-nucleotide long sequence has been shown to enhance both gene transcription and protein translation (biology), and {{plays a key role in}} the differential regulation of SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 expression. Both ABD and ABD’ are the most represented forms among SFTPA2 transcripts (~49% each), and experimental work has shown that this sequence can stabilize mRNA, enhance translation, and activate cap-independent eukaryotic translation. Exon B of SFTPA2 also binds specific proteins (e.g. 14-3-3) that may enhance translation, in a sequence- and secondary structure- specific way.

Specific SFTPA1 or SFTPA2 5’UTRs have also been characterized. Some SFTPA1 specific 5’UTRs include exons B’ or C.

The majority of SFTPA1 transcripts lack exon B, a sequence implicated in transcription and translation enhancement, indicating a differential regulation of SFTPA1 and SFTPA2 expression. The AD’ form is the most represented among SFTPA1 transcripts (81%), and experimental work has shown that this sequence can stabilize mRNA and enhance translation, but the mechanisms implicated in this regulation are still under investigation.

2500|$|Since gp120 plays a {{vital role}} in the ability of HIV-1 to enter CD4+ cells, its {{evolution}} is of particular interest. [...] Many neutralizing antibodies bind to sites located in variable regions of gp120, so mutations in these regions will be selected for strongly. [...] The diversity of env has been shown to increase by 1-2% per year in HIV-1 group M and the variable units are notable for rapid changes in amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>length.</b> [...] Increases in gp120 variability result in significantly elevated levels of viral replication, indicating an increase in viral fitness in individuals infected by diverse HIV-1 variants. [...] Further studies have shown that variability in potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) also result in increased viral fitness. [...] PNGSs allow for the binding of long-chain carbohydrates to the high variability regions of gp120, so the authors hypothesize that the number of PNGSs in env might affect the fitness of the virus by providing more or less sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. The presence of large carbohydrate chains extending from gp120 might obscure possible antibody binding sites.|$|E
