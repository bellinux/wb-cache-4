5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent.

Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{the first}} Capcom-designed Vs. {{installment}} to be rendered fully in 3D. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being ported to other consoles without completely re-building the game.

The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's <b>senior</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom physically or digitally.|$|E
