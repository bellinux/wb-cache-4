25|$|MD 282 was reconstructed from Cecilton to Earleville in 1966 and 1967. The highway was {{relocated}} at its sweeping {{curve in}} Earleville, eliminating a right-angle intersection at Peddlers Lane and a four-way intersection with <b>Sandy</b> <b>Bottom</b> Road and Grove Neck Road. The L-shaped bypassed highway at Peddlers Lane became MD 912, and the bypassed segments at <b>Sandy</b> <b>Bottom</b> Road became MD 282 auxiliary routes. MD 282 was reconstructed from Earleville to Crystal Beach in 1967 and 1968. The highway was relocated {{on either side}} of Glebe Road; Old Crystal Beach Road became MD 912A. MD 282 was widened from MD 213 to the Delaware state line in 1993 and from MD 213 to the west town limit of Cecilton in 1998.|$|E
25|$|MD 21 {{begins at}} Tolchester Beach Road's {{intersection}} {{with the northern}} end of MD 445 (Tolchester Road), the north leg of the intersection is county-maintained Bay Shore Road, and Tolchester Beach Road continues west as a county road to the eponymous beach community and its marina. MD 21 heads southeast as a two-lane road. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 20 (Rock Hall Road) at McClean's Corner south of Fairlee. The road continues southeast as county-maintained <b>Sandy</b> <b>Bottom</b> Road toward St. Paul's Church.|$|E

25|$|Recalde steered to {{the islands}} in search of shelter, riding on a swell through a tight gap at the eastern tip of the Great Blasket Island. His galleon made it through to calm water and dropped anchor over a <b>sandy</b> <b>bottom</b> beneath sheer cliffs. San Juan de Bautista and the smack soon followed. The {{anchorage}} ensured that the only wind that might drive the ships off would bring them clear to the open sea. It was a difficult manoeuvre, demanding prior knowledge of the coastline.|$|E
25|$|MD 20 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Beach Road and Lawton Avenue {{just east of}} where Swan Creek empties into the Chesapeake Bay {{in the town of}} Rock Hall. The highway heads east as two-lane Rock Hall Avenue between a pair of harbors: The Haven to the north and Rock Hall Harbor to the south. MD 20 intersects MD 445 (Main Street) on the north end of downtown and gains a center turn lane between there and the east town limit at Grays Inn Creek. East of the creek, the highway's name becomes Rock Hall Road, and it meets the eastern end of MD 674 (Sharp Street) and the north end of MD 288 (Crosby Road). MD 20 heads northeast through the hamlet of Edesville and crosses Shipyard Creek. The highway passes to the west of St. Paul's Church, which is accessed via Ricauds Branch Road or <b>Sandy</b> <b>Bottom</b> Road; opposite the latter county highway is the eastern end of MD 21 (Tolchester Beach Road).|$|E
25|$|Desmoulea {{remained}} at Suda Bay for several weeks, {{down on the}} <b>sandy</b> <b>bottom</b> by the stern, with its after well deck awash; the cargo {{was transferred to the}} tanker Eocene. Along with the torpedo attack on the cargo ship Clan Cumming by the Italian submarine Neghelli on 19 January, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea. After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the Antikithera Strait. Desmoulea was finally taken in tow by the armed boarding vessel HMS Chakla and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary storage vessel. It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers. Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, India and ran aground twice during the passage. Desmoulea was converted into a store ship, named Empire Thane and remained in port at Cochin until 1947, from where it was towed back to the United Kingdom. It was rebuilt under its original name in 1949, before being laid up in 1955 and scrapped in 1961.|$|E

25|$|Iberia {{departed}} London on {{her maiden}} voyage on 28 September 1954. From there, {{she crossed the}} Mediterranean Sea, calling in at Port Said before passing through the Suez Canal. It was here that she had her first mishap, grounding on the <b>sandy</b> <b>bottom.</b> Breakfast was being served {{at the time and}} passengers in the 1st Class Dining Room were given a fine view of the waters of the Canal as she listed about 15 degrees to port. She continued into the Red Sea and, after calling in at Aden, she traversed the Indian Ocean calling in at Mumbai (known as Bombay then), Colombo, Fremantle, Western Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, and Melbourne, Victoria, before arriving at Sydney in New South Wales, Australia on 1 November 1954. Iberia operated on this route for most of her working life. On 27 March 1956, while on her standard itinerary from London to Sydney and offshore of the island of Sri Lanka, she collided with the tanker , resulting in a gash amidships in her upper port decks, as well as damage to the bow of Stanvec Pretoria. Fortuitously, neither of the ships was put in danger of sinking. It was only after 17 days of repairs in Sydney that Iberia resumed her normal schedule.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} reaches {{sexual maturity}} at 54 to 61cm {{in length and}} {{three to four years}} of age, although many authors narrow this down to 60cm and three years of age. Sex ratio estimates from the Hawaiian Islands suggest the population is slightly skewed toward females, with the male:female ratio being 1:1.39. Spawning occurs during the warmer months in most locations, although the exact dates differ by location. In southern Africa, this occurs between July and March, with a peak between November and March; in the Philippines between December and January, with a lesser peak during June; and in Hawaii between April and November, with a major peak during May to August. Lunar cycles are also known to control the spawning events, with large schools forming in certain locations at specific phases of the moon in Hawaii and the Solomon Islands. Locations for spawning include reefs, the reef channels and offshore banks. Sampling of schools prior to spawning suggests the fish segregate into schools of only one sex, although the details are still unclear. Observations in the natural habitat found spawning occurred during the day immediately after and just before the change of tide when there were no currents. Giant trevally gathered in schools of over 100 individuals, although ripe individuals occurred slightly deeper; around 2â€“3 m above the seabed in groups of three or four, with one silver female being chased by several black males. Eventually, a pair would sink down to a <b>sandy</b> <b>bottom,</b> where eggs and sperm were released. The fish then diverged and swam away. Each individual appears to spawn more than once in each period, with only part of the gonads ripe in spawners. Fecundity is not known, although females are known to release several thousand eggs on capture during the spawning process. Eggs are described as pelagic and transparent in nature.|$|E

500|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{is found in}} most New England states, Nova Scotia, west to Michigan, {{northern}} Indiana and Minnesota, and south to Virginia. Overall, the distribution is disjunct with populations often being small and isolated. [...] Roughly 30% of its total population is in Canada. [...] It prefers slow-moving streams containing a <b>sandy</b> <b>bottom</b> and heavily vegetated banks. The soft bottoms and muddy shores of these streams are ideal for overwintering. Also, the areas bordering the streams (usually with open canopies [...] ) are used for nesting. Spring to summer is spent in open areas including forests, fields, bogs, wet meadows, and beaver ponds. The {{rest of the year}} is spent in the aforementioned waterways.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} began May 2, 1974, on {{the island}} of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, selected after consideration was given to eastern Long Island. Brown explained later that the production [...] "needed a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business." [...] Martha's Vineyard was also chosen because the surrounding ocean had a <b>sandy</b> <b>bottom</b> that never dropped below 35 feet (11m) for [...] out from shore, which allowed the mechanical sharks to operate while also beyond sight of land. As Spielberg wanted to film the aquatic sequences relatively close-up to resemble what people see while swimming, cinematographer Bill Butler devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting, including a rig to keep the camera stable regardless of tide and a sealed submersible camera box. Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe, so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock.|$|E
