40|$|In this PhD thesis {{the author}} has dealt with the design and {{characterization}} of novel antenna layouts for modern communication systems. Specific attention {{has been devoted to}} cost-effective and compact solutions; also, some of the proposed antenna layouts have been designed facing with severe integration constraints. A novel <b>slot-coupling</b> feeding technique for dual-polarized patch antennas is presented in Chapter I. A square patch is fed through a square ring slot excited by two non-overlapping feed lines printed {{on the same side of}} a single-layer substrate. This technique was used to implement a wideband dual-polarized 2 x 1 microstrip stacked patch array working in the GSM band (1710 – 1910 MHz), UMTS band (1920 - 2170 MHz), ISM band (2400 - 2484 MHz) and UMTS 3 G expansion band (2500 - 2690 MHz) or, alternatively, WIMAX™ band (2300 – 2700 MHz), with a resulting 45 % percentage bandwidth. Moreover a circularly polarized 2 x 2 microstrip array, where each array element is fed through two microstrip lines which are excited 90 ° out-of-phase, has been realized for the WiMAX (3300 - 3800 MHz) band, resulting in excellent Axial Ratio performance. In Chapter II, a compact dual-band Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) working in both the DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial) and the WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) IEEE 802. 11 b,g frequency bands is presented. It has been designed to be integrated in a monitor-equipped device, exhibiting reduced electrical size with respect to similar PIFA solutions, also in a L-shape configuration. In the context of compact wideband antenna design, Chapter III presents a numerical analysis of a novel wideband two-arm Archimedean spiral antenna whose arms are made of vertical metallic strips. An advantage of this spiral is that the input impedance and polarization purity can be effectively controlled by varying the strip width and turn thickness. Also, when the antenna is embedded in a dielectric block, miniaturization is more effective than in conventional planar Archimedean spirals. In Chapter IV, two configurations of slot antennas suitable for integration into a class of commercial large photovoltaic (PV) panels are presented. The basic idea is to exploit the room available between adjacent PV cells, also taking advantage of the presence of the cover glass layer that gives a valuable miniaturization effect. As test cases, two antenna designs are presented for stand-alone communication systems operating in the GSM/UMTS (1710 - 2170 MHz) and WIMAX (3300 - 3800 MHz) frequency bands. Finally, a top-loaded vertical monopole antenna was designed to be integrated in a wireless sensor of a car park monitoring system operating at 433 MHz, and it is described in Chapter V. The final design came out from a careful analysis of the effects on the antenna input impedance of nearby elements (photovoltaic cells, battery, sensor cover, ultrasonic transducer). A performance comparison between the proposed vertically polarized antenna and a commercial ceramic antenna has been carried out, showing an average increase of the received power level at the reader of about 2. 2 dB, when measurements are performed on a distance range of 10 - 60 m between the sensor and the reader antenna of the car park monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|Active {{integrated}} antenna (MA) is a {{very popular}} topic of research during recent decades. This is mostly due to its advantages, such as compact size, multiple functions and low cost, etc. The MA system {{can be regarded as}} an active microwave circuit which the output or input port is free space instead of a conventional 50 -ohm interface. The major drawbacks of the conventional MA include narrow bandwidth, low efficiency, etc. An experimental investigation on broadband <b>slot-coupled</b> antenna is carried out, which results an impedance bandwidth of 50 % is achieved by both a ring slot- coupled and square ring <b>slot-coupled</b> patch antenna. An improved design technique for broadband class-E power amplifier (PA) design, based on the theoretical analysis done by Mader [2], is introduced to calculate the circuit parameters. The technique is applied to a RF microwave class-E power amplifier design (PA) that results a bandwidth of 12 % power added efficiency (PAE) greater than 60 % is achieved. The aim of this work is to design broadband high efficiency linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) MA and arrays that will be useful for mobile communication system. The MA does not need conventional matching network between the amplifier and the antenna, because the antenna serves as both a harmonics-tuning network and a radiator. A novel high efficiency broadband LP MA is demonstrated using a ring <b>slot-coupled</b> patch antenna with a class-E PA. It exhibits a PAE over 50 % within a 14. 6 % bandwidth. For the first time, a high efficiency broadband CP MA is designed using a class-E PA integrated with a broadband CP antenna. The CP AIA achieves a PAE over 50 % within a 14 % bandwidth. The axial ratio of the CP MA is below 3 dB over a 9 % bandwidth. For further improve the performance, a novel L-shaped <b>slot-coupled</b> broadband CP MA is employed in a 2 x 2 array. The array consists of four sequentially rotated broadband CP antenna elements with an element spacing of half a free space wavelength. The antenna was designed to operate in the 3 G band around 2 GHz. A bandwidth of 22. 7 % PAE greater than 50 % is achieved together with a peak PAE of 71. 35 %. A bandwidth of 27 % axial ratio below 3 dB is resulted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Packet queuing and scheduling, {{two of the}} {{critical}} components in an input-queued packet switch, have been extensively studied {{in the context of}} either pure unicast traffic or pure multicast traffic. Unfortunately, the results from a study in one context are not applicable to the other context. The design of integrated scheduling for both types of traffic remains an open issue. This paper deals with the problem of integrating unicast and multicast scheduling in an N · N input-queued packet switch with first in first out buffers. Instead of using isolated switching fabrics for unicast and multicast traffic respectively, we efficiently utilize one switching fabric for both unicast and multicast traffic by a careful design. In our design, each input port maintains a set of unicast queues based on virtual output queuing technique and a set of multicast queues based on a load-balance policy. By employing the research advances that have already been gained for unicast and multicast scheduling, we propose two practical <b>slot-coupled</b> integration algorithms, lSCIA (a loosely <b>slot-coupled</b> integration algorithm) and fSCIA (a fully <b>slot-coupled</b> integration algorithm). In each time slot, unicast scheduling and multicast scheduling cooperate together and the scheduling priority is allocated to either unicast traffic or multicast traffic according to a certain service ratio. The working interval of service ratio is defined as a set such that the saturation throughput is not less than the output load if the service ratio falls into this set. The upper bound and lower bound for the working interval of service ratio are deduced. A 100 % throughput can be achieved with strong theoretical guarantees as long as the service ratio lies in the upper bound of the working interval. Both theoretical analysis and simulatio...|$|E
