25|$|Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} and CO2 emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions {{without the use}} of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, <b>solar</b> <b>shading,</b> and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.|$|E

A developed stochastic model for manual <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> was modeled in Building Controls Virtual Test Bed, which was coupled with EnergyPlus for co-simulation. Movable <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> were compared with two unshaded windows. Results show that movable <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> have {{more than half of the}} working hours with a comfortable illuminance level, which is about twice higher than low-e windows, with a less significant daylight illuminance fluctuation. For glare protection, movable <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> increase comfortable visual conditions by about 20 % compared to low-e windows. Moreover, the intolerable glare perception could be reduced by more than 20 % for movable <b>solar</b> <b>shades...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s Colt adapted its {{ventilation}} {{products to}} commercial buildings {{and entered the}} <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> market. In the 1990s the company invested in research in the control of daylighting levels and solar power. This led {{to the design of}} Shadovoltaic, a combined <b>solar</b> <b>shading,</b> daylighting and electricity generating system for facades and roofs of buildings. In 1990 Colt designed, built and installed the distinctive steel pyramid on top of the skyscraper at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf.|$|E

Digital fabrication can be used to unlock the inherent physical properties of common materials as a means to create <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> which change shape in response to ambient conditions and user needs in a system which relies on extremely simple mechanical actuation. These conformationally adaptive <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> take advantage of materials which can be deformed not only to occlude or permit the passage of light, but also to produce optimal angles for the maximization the interception of solar radiation of the surface of the device itself...|$|R
5000|$|Modifications to the [...] <b>solar</b> <b>shade</b> design {{have been}} {{suggested}} to solve the solar-sail problem. One suggested method is to use polar-orbiting, solar-synchronous mirrors that reflect light {{toward the back of}} the sunshade, from the non-sunward side of Venus. Photon pressure would push the support mirrors to an angle of 30 degrees away from the sunward side.|$|R

The paint used is completely organic and the wooden components have not undergone any specific treatment.

40|$|International audienceSolar shades are {{efficient}} architectural {{elements in}} order to reduce the thermal loads inside buildings. In one way, they can reduce significantly the energy needs of cooling systems. But in other way, they can decrease the visual comfort and increase the energy consumption of artificial lighting. Actually, the sizing of shading devices is mainly a thermal optimization process. The efficacy of <b>solar</b> <b>shades</b> must be assess taking into account both thermal and visual point of view. In this paper simple indices were proposed to compare the thermal and visual efficacy of different types of solar shadings in non-residential buildings. These indices can be derived from the results of numerical simulations that include thermal and daylighting analysis such as the EnergyPlus software. A typical office is studied {{in order to}} assess the efficacy of different types of solar protections.

50|$|Many {{proposals}} involve {{deployment of}} a <b>solar</b> <b>shade</b> or {{a system of}} orbital mirrors, {{for the purpose of}} reducing insolation and providing light to the dark side of Venus. Another common thread in most proposals involves some introduction of large quantities of hydrogen or water. Proposals also involve either freezing most of Venus's atmospheric CO2, or converting it to carbonates, urea or other forms.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} that anthropogenic global warming poses {{a serious threat}} to our civilization and its ecological support systems. Ideally this problem will be overcome by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Various space-based methods, including large-scale <b>solar</b> <b>shades,</b> diffusers or atmospheric pollutants, have been considered to reduce the solar constant (input flux) and the warming in case emissions reductions are not achieved in a timely way. Here it is pointed out that proposed technologies for near-Earth orbiting comet deflection, suggest a different kind of space-based <b>solar</b> <b>shade.</b> This shade would be made up of micron-sized dust particles derived from comet fragments or lunar mining, and positioned in orbits near the triangular Lagrange points of the Earth-Moon system. Solar radiation pressure can render such orbits unstable, but a class of nearly resonant, and long-lived orbits is shown to exist, though the phase space volume of such orbits depends on dust grain size. Advantages and disadvantages of this scheme relative to others are considered. Comment: Note and reference to work of Katz (1975) added. Original version in press for the J.

5000|$|A {{suitably}} large <b>solar</b> <b>shade</b> {{would be}} {{four times the}} diameter of Venus itself if at the [...] point. This would necessitate construction in space.
