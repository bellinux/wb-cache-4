The buckling nanoneedle was easily fabricated by using focused ion beam etching from a commercialized atomic force microscope cantilever. There are notable advantages of using buckling nanoneedle for single cells stiffness characterizations. First, severe cell damage from an excessive indentation force could be prevented. Second, large variations in single cells <b>stiffness</b> <b>property</b> could be easily detected either from the dented mark on the cell surface after the indentation and/or by comparing the buckling length of the nanoneedle during the indentation. The calibrations of the buckling nanoneedle were done experimentally and numerically. The calibration results from both methods showed a good agreement. The calibration data show {{the relationship between the}} indentation force and the buckling length of the nanoneedle. This relationship was used for obtaining force data during a nanoindentation experiment between a buckling nanoneedle and single cells.

5000|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} CFRP parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a mold {{in the shape}} of the final product.

High-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or autoclave-cured, because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength.

We hypothesize: (1) <b>Stiffness</b> <b>properties</b> of multiaxis feet in the frontal plane will vary significantly, and the feet will naturally divide into subcategories based on <b>stiffness</b> <b>properties,</b> and (2) Testing with shoes will influence the <b>stiffness</b> <b>properties</b> in the frontal plane of the multiaxis prosthetic foot. Methods: 6 multiaxis prosthetic feet (including dynamic response/multiaxis feet) were tested on an Instron materials testing machine. The feet underwent cyclic loading to simulate midstance phase of gait, and were loaded onto a range of inclines from 0 ° to 20 °. The tests were repeated with a shoe added to the feet. A SACH foot was also tested for comparison purposes. Results: There was significant variability among the feet when tested barefoot. The SACH foot displayed a lower stiffness than 3 of the multiaxis feet at all inclines. Statistical analysis showed there were natural divisions among the feet according to stiffness data. When the feet were tested with a shoe, the stiffness decreased for all feet in all conditions, although {{the magnitude of the}} change varied by foot. Natural divisions among feet were also present when tested with a shoe, but the divisions were different than when tested barefoot. Discussion: The results showed that <b>stiffness</b> <b>properties</b> among multiaxis feet did vary, and the feet did divide themselves naturally. When tested with a shoe, stiffness decreased for all feet in all conditions. Limitations of this study include anonymity of feet, variability of shoes, and small aspect of gait cycle.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Multiple-Pass Homogenization (MPH) {{technique}} {{is used to}} derive formulas for equivalent torsional and in-plane shear <b>stiffness</b> <b>properties</b> of sandwich plates with periodic core structures. In the first pass of the MPH, a discrete core structure is homogenized in a principal axis resulting in piecewise constant material properties, based on which the second pass can be analytically processed with respect to macroscopic torsion and in-plane shear modes. Two equivalent shear <b>stiffness</b> <b>properties</b> of periodic core structures, Gcxy and Gcxy, corresponding to torsion and in-plane shear, respectively, are conceptually and analytically distinguished from each other. By using the Saint-Venant’s semi-inverse method and periodic boundary conditions, analytical solutions of the equivalent shear stiffness are explicitly obtained {{in the form of}} Fourier series, which consist of a Voigt-type upper bound term and a correction term.
