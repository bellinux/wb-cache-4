5|$|Hašek's injury {{caused him}} to miss {{the rest of the}} regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that he would return in time for the playoffs. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of $500,000 with bonuses.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would not let Manu sleep with him, {{it would be a}} sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E

5|$|Citing his {{disappointment}} at failing to gain promotion, Stimson resigned {{from his post}} at Grays on 16 May 2006. He stated {{that at the time}} he had received no firm job offers from other clubs, and acknowledged that he was taking a gamble with his career, but <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was unable to find a new job as a manager he would move into youth coaching or open his own football school. He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United, but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May, and led the club to an eighth-place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge. Stevenage also defeated Stimson's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final, and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final, giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{administration}} of Harry Truman had become convinced that the Guatemalan government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, {{at least until the}} end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by Árbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFORTUNE. The plan had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. Truman gave the CIA permission {{to go ahead with the}} plan, without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the right-wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{acts as a}} {{link between}} the other main {{characters}} of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene. In an interview in Shōnen Jump's, Kishimoto <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether {{it would be in the}} manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot about its original name. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's Sharingan was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask.|$|E

5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, {{and secretary of state}} Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These connections made the Eisenhower administration more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government.|$|E

25|$|The BBC {{received}} further complaints for Neville's {{comments in}} January 2015, after Arsenal's Tomáš Rosický played a pass while looking in another direction; Neville <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were playing against a player doing that in training, he would deliberately injure that player.

25|$|A 2010 New York Times article {{reported}} that Dickey {{is an avid}} reader and that at the time, the stack of books in his locker included Life of Pi by Yann Martel {{and a collection of}} works by C.

Dickey named his bats for literary swords--Orcrist the Goblin Cleaver (from The Hobbit) and Hrunting (from Beowulf). Dickey mixed up Orcrist and Sting when explaining the origin of the name. In addition to his fantasy-named bats, Dickey's at-bat introduction song is the theme from Game of Thrones.|$|E
25|$|In June 1917, Maugham {{was asked}} by Sir William Wiseman, {{an officer of the}} British Secret Intelligence Service (later named MI6), to {{undertake}} a special mission in Russia. It was part of an attempt to keep the Provisional Government in power and Russia in the war by countering German pacifist propaganda. Two and a half months later, the Bolsheviks took control. Maugham subsequently <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been able to get there six months earlier, he might have succeeded. Quiet and observant, Maugham had a good temperament for intelligence work; he believed he had inherited from his lawyer father a gift for cool judgement and the ability to be undeceived by facile appearances.|$|E
