25|$|From 1941 to 1947, Fritz Bopp was a staff {{scientist}} at the KWIP, and worked with the Uranverein. In 1944, {{when most of the}} KWIP was evacuated to Hechingen in Southern Germany due to air raids on Berlin, he went there too, and he was the Institute's Deputy Director there. When the American Alsos Mission evacuated Hechingen and Haigerloch, near the end of World War II, French armed forces occupied Hechingen. Bopp did not get along with them and described the initial French policy objectives towards the KWIP as exploitation, forced evacuation to France, and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and equipment. The French occupation policy was not qualitatively {{different from that of the}} American and Soviet occupation forces, it was just carried out on a smaller scale. In order to put pressure on Bopp to evacuate the KWIP to France, the French Naval Commission imprisoned him for five days and threatened him with further imprisonment if he did not cooperate in the evacuation. During his imprisonment, the spectroscopist Hermann Schüler, who had a better relationship with the French, persuaded the French to appoint him as Deputy Director of the KWIP. This incident caused tension between the physicists and spectroscopists at the KWIP and within its umbrella organization the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (Kaiser Wilhelm Society).|$|E

50|$|However, in Gardener v Whitaker, Kentridge AJ “seemed to condone the {{indirect}} {{application of the}} Bill of Rights {{to the law of}} defamation” in relation to an alleged defamation that took place before the commencement of the interim Constitution.’04 Similarly, in Key v Attorney-General a search and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> had been completed before the interim Constitution came into force. This meant that the statutory provisions authorising the search and seizure could not be attacked as violations of the Constitution. Kriegler J nevertheless stated that if the evidence obtained by way of the search and seizure was tendered in criminal proceedings against the applicant, he would be entitled to raise Constitution-based objections to its admissibility. While the non-retrospectivity rule prevented the applicant in Key from challenging the provisions of the Investigation of Serious Economic Offences Act before or during the trial, a discretion to exclude otherwise admissible evidence could be developed by indirectly applying the Bill of Rights.|$|E
50|$|In the European and Pacific theaters of {{operations}} CIC deployed detachments at all levels. These detachments provided tactical intelligence about the enemy from captured documents, interrogations of captured troops, and from para-military and civilian sources. They were {{also involved in}} providing security for military installations and staging areas, located enemy agents, and acted to counter stay-behind networks. They also provided training to combat units in security, censorship, the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> and the dangers of booby traps. In some cases CIC agents such as Henry Kissinger found themselves acting as the de facto military government on the occupation of large towns {{before the arrival of}} Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) officers. As the war in Europe came to a close, CIC were involved in the Operations Alsos, Paperclip and TICOM, searching for German personnel and research in atomic weapons, rockets and cryptography. Recruits after World War II included Klaus Barbie, also known as the 'Butcher from Lyon', a former Gestapo member and war criminal.|$|E

50|$|On July 2, 1923, the Federal Grand Jury {{released}} {{four more}} indictments in the Fuller case, with {{the charges and}} names kept secret. It was revealed the indictments were linked with the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> from the baggage of William Frank McGee's ex-wife Nellie Shechan McGee several days earlier. On July 26, 1923, the bankruptcy hearing in the Fuller case was being held at 217 Broadway {{at the office of}} bankruptcy referee Harold P. Coffin. That day there was a conflict between Coffin and Foley's counsel Edward E. McCall, when a reference to William R. Hearst was ordered stricken from the record. McCall mentioned in proceedings that Hearst had offered money to McGee's ex-wife in Europe, asking her to return to New York. When she had asked Foley what it was about, he had theorized to her that Hearst had wanted to obtain press materials for his newspapers from her. McCall objected strongly to Coffin's choice to strike the statement from the record, with Coffin in turn threatening to force McCall to leave the proceedings.|$|E
50|$|This {{case was}} argued {{a few years}} after the Watergate scandal had broken out and the President was {{compelled}} to resign {{in the face of the}} impeachment process against Richard Nixon. The former President objected to the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> from the Nixon Administration, as he did not want to further tarnish the public’s already negative perception of him as a corrupt and scheming politician. Given that he was not liable to criminal prosecution, as he had been pardoned, Nixon’s concern for his reputation appears to be the primary reason that he did not want his private documents to be inspected by historical archivists and made available to the public. The forty two million pages of documents and eight hundred and eighty tape recordings produced during his presidency would reveal critical information about Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate scandal, his real opinions on a wide range of issues, and further perpetuate his image as a paranoid and secretive President. These are some of the underlying personal motives as to why Richard Nixon chose to file a lawsuit against the Administrator of General Services the day after President Ford signed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act into law.|$|E
5000|$|On August 31 and September 1, 2006 the FBI served some 20 search {{warrants}} in Anchorage, Juneau, Wasilla, Eagle River, Girdwood, and Willow, {{primarily on the}} offices of several legislators. Republican legislators whose offices were searched included Senator John Cowdery, Senate President (and son of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens) Ben Stevens, Representatives Vic Kohring, Bruce Weyhrauch, Pete Kott and Bev Masek as well as Democratic Senator Donny Olson. The warrants permitted the search of computer files, personal diaries, Alaska Public Offices Commission reports, and any other items showing evidence of financial ties between legislators and the oilfield services company VECO Corporation, as well as clothing items with the phrase [...] "Corrupt Bastards Club" [...] or its related acronym printed on it. A search warrant for Sen.

The dissenters, including Chief Judge Charles S. Desmond, found the dispositive issue was not the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>documents</b> but the long deliberations. [...] "Keeping the jury in deliberation for over 24 consecutive hours without any respite, and after they had advised the court of their fatigue on more than one occasion," [...] they wrote, [...] "constitutes coercion of the jury as matter of law."

25|$|This {{distinction}} {{is of particular}} importance {{with respect to the}} level of international judicial assistance afforded by Swiss authorities to foreign states that prosecute their own citizens for tax evasions committed in Switzerland, such as by depositing undeclared income with a Swiss bank. Up until recently, Swiss law prohibited all support to foreign jurisdictions for the prosecution of fiscal offences, except to the U.S. under the terms of a 1973 agreement. Since 1983, enforcement assistance is provided (such as the search and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> accounts and <b>documents)</b> for the prosecution of fiscal crimes (notably, tax fraud) but not for the prosecution of fiscal misdemeanours (notably, tax evasion). Under pressure from the G20 and the OECD, the Swiss government announced in March 2009 that it will abolish the distinction between tax fraud and tax evasion in dealings with foreign clients. The Swiss authorities will from now on also provide judicial assistance in the event of tax evasion by a foreign client. The distinction remains valid for domestic clients.|$|R
