40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the solvents in promoting gold desorption from activated carbon is in the order acetonitrile > methyl ethyl ketone ⩾ acetone ⪢ dimethylformamide > ethanol. Aqueous acetonitrile and aqueous acetone <b>strip</b> <b>gold</b> in < 8 h using 2 – 3 bed volumes at temperatures between 25 and 70 °C. These organic solvents in particular are strongly adsorbed onto carbon and significantly increase the activity of CN− relative to Au(CN) 2 −. Acetonitrile is quantitatively steam stripped from carbon and has {{little effect on the}} kinetic activity of carbon and on the electrowinning or cementation of gold. However, acetone is not so readily recovered from carbon and causes a significant loss of carbon activity. The concentrated gold eluates are readily electrowon in a batch or continuous mode using a simple diaphragm cell to give gold bullion foil. Preliminary cost analysis indicates that this procedure is cheaper than the Zadra elution procedure and comparable to the Anglo elution procedure...|$|E
