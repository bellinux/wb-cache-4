25|$|The delay, itself, {{comes from}} a special cable {{with a pair of}} {{conductors}} wound around a flexible, magnetically <b>soft</b> <b>core.</b> The coiling provides distributed inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed capacitance. The combination is a wideband transmission line with considerable delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances to avoid reflections.|$|E
25|$|Because {{hardened}} metal {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, hardening the metal uniformly throughout the piece) {{is not always}} a suitable choice for uses where the metal part is subject to sliding contact with hard or abrasive materials. In such circumstances, case-hardening can provide a part that will not fracture (because of the <b>soft</b> <b>core</b> that can absorb stresses without cracking) but also provides adequate wear resistance on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the <b>soft</b> <b>core,</b> while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E

5000|$|When a steel {{work-piece}} is quenched, {{the area}} {{in contact with the}} water immediately cools and temperature evens out with the quenching medium. The inner depths of the material however, do not cool quite so rapidly, and in work-pieces that are large, the cooling rate may be slow enough to allow the austenite to transform fully into a structure other than martensite or bainite. This results in a work-piece that does not have the same crystal structure throughout its entire structure; with a <b>softer</b> <b>core</b> and harder [...] "shell".

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{system-on-a-chip}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular for the integration of complex systems. New types of processor cores are now available that enable the designer to customize their processors for the target applications.

This paper proposes a method to derive applicationspecific embedded processors from <b>soft</b> processor <b>cores.</b> The derivation process involves {{an analysis of the}} resources of the processing core used by the target application. Then a series of optimizations based on the analysis results are performed on an optimizable model of the processor core.
