25|$|The GLM model {{does not}} take into account the {{contribution}} of relationships between multiple voxels. Whereas GLM analysis methods assess whether a voxel or region's signal amplitude is higher or lower for one condition than another, newer statistical models such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), utilize the unique contributions of multiple voxels within a voxel-population. In a typical implementation, a classifier or more basic algorithm is trained to distinguish trials for different conditions within a subset of the data. The trained model is then tested by predicting the conditions of the remaining (independent) data. This approach is most typically achieved by training and testing on different scanner sessions or runs. If the classifier is linear, then the training model is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> used to scale the value in each voxel before summing them to generate a single number that determines the condition for each testing set trial. More information on training and testing classifiers is at statistical classification.|$|E

It is shown that both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>weighting</b> functions produce results with a converse accuracy behavior in the near and far fields. Additional information, such as reciprocity and the fulfillment of the boundary condition, are needed to choose the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>weighting</b> functions that is most appropriate for a certain application. The obtained criteria are applied afterward to an iterative T-matrix approach we developed to analyze scattering on regular particle geometries with an impressed but slight surface irregularity.

40|$|This study investigates whether {{structural}} modeling, process tracing, and self-reports {{are able}} to provide similar information about attribute weights in multiattribute evaluation processes. In three experiments subjects had to evaluate {{a large number of}} profiles of fictitious persons described on a number of attributes. The experiments differed in type of judgment task, type of subjects, and number of attributes. Subject attribute weights were derived in all cases by fitting a statistical model (statistical weights), by analyzing verbal protocols (verbal protocol weights), and by directly asking the subject how important the attributes are for the judgments (subjective weights). Correspondence between the three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> is examined in two ways: by computing the correlation between three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> and by calculating how adequately the different <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights,</b> applied in a linear model, can predict the subject′s judgments. The first method appears to be inappropriate for investigating correspondence. The correlations are rather unstable because of the small number of attributes, and apart from that, they tend to underestimate real correspondence when the weights in the respective sets are approximately equal. The second method shows that the three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> are about equally adequate in predicting the actual subject judgments. It is concluded that this method convincingly demonstrates that the three different ways <b>of</b> eliciting attribute <b>weights</b> yield similar results. © 1995 Academic Press.
