25|$|In {{terms of}} medical {{management}} of the symptoms associated with Chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 Duplication Syndrome, families <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> individuals with chromosome 15 duplications may tolerate medications differently and may {{be more sensitive to}} side effects for some classes of medications, such as the serotonin reuptake inhibitor type medications (SSRI).|$|E
25|$|Aripiprazole is a {{substrate}} of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Coadministration with {{medications that}} inhibit (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) or induce (e.g. carbamazepine) these metabolic enzymes {{are known to}} increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of aripiprazole. As such, anyone taking aripiprazole <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> their dosage of aripiprazole {{may need to be}} adjusted.|$|E

5000|$|... "Buggie" [...] rides {{are offered}} locally in two styles, com emoção (lit:'with emotion': a riskier ride) or sem emoção (lit:'without emotion': a safer one). One <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware,</b> however, <b>that</b> only {{authorized}} professionals responsible for security of both tourists and environment <b>should</b> <b>be</b> hired.|$|R
25|$|Cat owners <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{domestic}} {{cats are}} introduced predators, and usually kill all chameleons {{in the immediate}} area. Consequently, one should not bring chameleons into a garden frequented by cats. It also {{is important to be}} cautious of the activity of shrikes, in particular the southern fiscal, which, if they get into the chameleon-hunting habit, will rapidly strip a garden.|$|E
25|$|Although rare, CNS {{disorders}} {{can sometimes}} present as BPPV. A practitioner <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{if a patient}} whose symptoms are consistent with BPPV, but does not show improvement or resolution after undergoing different particle repositioning maneuvers — detailed in the Treatment section below — {{need to have a}} detailed neurological assessment and imaging performed to help identify the pathological condition.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} A-T who have {{low levels of}} IgA, further testing should be {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} IgA level is low or completely absent. If absent, there is a slightly increased risk of a transfusion reaction. “Medical Alert” bracelets are not necessary, but the family and primary physician <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if there is elective surgery requiring red cell transfusion, the cells should be washed to decrease the risk of an allergic reaction.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{surgeons}} can use {{the innovative}} and promising products available on the market, but they <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> some products have been tested {{over the long term}} and are safe for clinical use while others have short clinical histories and require caution.|$|R
50|$|Patent owners <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> a {{counterclaim}} of infringement is a compulsory counterclaim to {{a claim for}} declaratory judgment of non-infringement. If a patent owner fails to assert an infringement counterclaim in a declaratory-judgment non-infringement suit, the patent infringement claim will be deemed waived.|$|R
50|$|One <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> pond-reared red {{ramshorn}} snails {{are able}} to carry various parasitic flukes, which can be transmitted to fish, or humans. Most of these flukes require intermediate hosts, so that leaving the snails in a fish-free aquarium {{for a month or}} so will eliminate any parasites.|$|R
25|$|Parking in the Jewellery Quarter is {{predominantly}} pay and display and permit holders bays. There {{are a variety}} of cheaper off-road options at around 50p per hour. If you are very lucky you will sometimes find one of the very limited Free parking space on one of the side streets. Free bays are marked by a white P in a blue square on a nearby sign. Visitors <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> traffic wardens are very vigilant in this area.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting {{that in order to}} successfully use a mnemonic device an individual <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants were made aware of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who were made aware of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic than those who were not made aware of the mnemonic before recall.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication poses {{a problem}} {{not only to}} ecosystems, but to humans as well. Reducing {{eutrophication}} should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a sustainable solution for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. Finnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with economic analyst and commentator Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel, June 26, 2007, in speaking of income tax resistance, Paul said that he supports the right of those who engage in nonviolent resistance when they believe a law is unjust, bringing up the names of Martin Luther King, Jr., Lysander Spooner, and Mahatma Gandhi as examples of practitioners of peaceful civil disobedience; but he cautioned that those who do <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the consequences could be imprisonment. He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, {{he said that he}} prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E

500|$|The {{appellate court}} also faulted the {{district}} judge for allowing [...] "more {{than a year}} and a half elapsed before the filing and disposition of the motions for summary judgment". Posner noted in his opinion that [...] "the governing principles are clear, the facts have been explored exhaustively, and the defendants <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> efforts to mount a last-ditch, no-holds-barred defense may simply increase their liability for the plaintiff's attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988." [...] He then affirmed the district court's decision.|$|E

500|$|Rogan {{writes in}} the book's introduction: [...] "an {{important}} caveat to any serious, well-researched biography or study of Morrison's life is that the reader <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons. The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the reader who neglects to {{read between the lines}} may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1883 Pony Track to {{the summit}} (also known as the Ben Path, the Mountain Path or the Tourist Route) remains the {{simplest}} and most popular route of ascent. It begins at Achintee {{on the east side}} of Glen Nevis about [...] from Fort William town centre, at around 20 metres above sea level. Bridges from the Visitor Centre and the youth hostel now allow access from the west side of Glen Nevis. The path climbs steeply to the saddle by Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe (colloquially known as the 'Halfway Lake') at 570m, then ascends the remaining 700 metres up the stony west flank of Ben Nevis in a series of zig-zags. The path is regularly maintained but running water, uneven rocks and loose scree make it hazardous and slippery in places. Thanks to the zig-zags, the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages, but inexperienced walkers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, in {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "On Some Apparent Sketches for Sibelius's Eighth Symphony", the musical theorist Nors Josephson identifies around 20 manuscripts or fragments held in the Helsinki University Library as being relevant to the symphony and concludes that: [...] "Given the abundance of preserved material for this work, one looks forward with great anticipation to a thoughtful, meticulous completion of the entire composition". Another Sibelius scholar, Timo Virtanen, has examined the same material and is more restrained, concluding that {{although some of the}} sketches may relate to the Eighth Symphony, {{it is not possible to}} determine exactly which, if any, these are. Even the fragment marked [...] "VIII", he maintains, cannot with certainty be said to relate to the symphony, since Sibelius often used both Roman and Arabic numerals to refer to themes, motifs or passages within a composition. Virtanen provides a further note of caution: [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> [...] are, after all, drafts: unfinished as music, and representing only a certain stage in planning a new composition".|$|E

500|$|On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a {{march in}} Brick Lane, {{organised}} by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding {{a ban on}} alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as [...] "strongly linked" [...] to Anjem Choudary's banned group Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted [...] "hundreds" [...] would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come {{from as far away}} as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: “What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> just because it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E
500|$|The above {{calculations}} {{make several}} assumptions, {{such as that}} the level of [...] in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of [...] in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. [...] This is done by calibration curves, which convert a measurement of [...] in a sample into an estimated calendar age. [...] The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the [...] "radiocarbon age", which is the age in [...] "radiocarbon years" [...] of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the / ratio has not changed over time. [...] Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for , which {{for more than a decade}} after Libby's initial work was thought to be 5,568 years. [...] This was revised in the early 1960s to 5,730 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%). [...] For consistency with these early papers, and to avoid the risk of a double correction for the incorrect half-life, radiocarbon ages are still calculated using the incorrect half-life value. [...] A correction for the half-life is incorporated into calibration curves, so even though radiocarbon ages are calculated using a half-life value that is known to be incorrect, the final reported calibrated date, in calendar years, is accurate. [...] When a date is quoted, the reader <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of [...] in the atmosphere over time.|$|E
