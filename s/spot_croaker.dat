5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include <b>spot</b> <b>croaker</b> (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), <b>spot</b> <b>croaker</b> (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E
25|$|Commercial fishing {{has always}} been an {{important}} component of the island economy. Historically, this trade included whaling and the hunting of dolphins. Until ice became available in the 1920s, the primary commercial catch was mullet, which was caught near the beaches of Shackleford Bank and Core Bank and salted on shore. In the late 19th century, the Core Sound area produced 80% of the salted mullet sold on the United States east coast. An ice plant was built in nearby Beaufort in 1920, and fish houses were established on the island to process fish and shellfish. Some bay areas on the north side of the island have been developed for harvesting cultured shellfish. In addition to mullet, the commercial fishing industry of Harkers Island brings in oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops, crabs, <b>spot,</b> <b>croaker,</b> trout, flounder, bluefish, and mackerel.|$|E
50|$|The sound also {{sports a}} variety of fish populations {{including}} red drum, speckled trout, flounder, striped bass (known as rockfish by local populations), <b>croaker,</b> <b>spot,</b> pompano, kingfish, and bluefish.

5000|$|Sinepuxent Bay WMA {{serves as}} {{breeding}} habitat for birds which nest together in large colonies. Royal terns and black skimmers {{are among the}} [...] "colonial nesting" [...] shorebirds on the islands. Ducks and herons nest on islands with grasses or small trees. Since 1987, one of these islands is home for a colony of nesting brown pelicans. In the fall, hunters will find ducks, snow geese, Atlantic brant and Canada geese. Fishing is excellent for flounder, sea trout, <b>croaker,</b> <b>spot,</b> and bluefish.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinguishing}} {{mark on the}} red drum is one large black spot on {{the upper part of}} the tail base. Having multiple spots is not uncommon for this fish, but having no spots is extremely rare. As the fish with multiple spots grow older, they seem to lose their excess spots. Scientists believe that the black spot near their tail helps fool predators into attacking the red drum's tail instead of its head, allowing the red drum to escape. The red drum uses its senses of sight and touch, and its downturned mouth, to locate forage on the bottom through vacuuming or biting. On the top and middle of the water column, it uses changes in the light that might look like food. In the summer and fall, adult red drum feed on crabs, shrimp, and mullet; in the spring and winter, adults primarily feed on menhaden, mullet, pinfish, sea robin, lizardfish, <b>spot,</b> Atlantic <b>croaker,</b> and mudminnows.|$|R

Fishermen use rods 10 to 13 feet to cast to drum using baits like cut mullet, bunker (cut menhaden, or pogies as Carolina anglers call them), and cut bait from <b>spot,</b> <b>croaker,</b> or bluefish. Red drum hit a bait aggressively and are a much beloved surf fishing species. The overfished status of this fish for many years due to the blackened redfish craze of the 1980s led to strict recreational size and creel limits, however, so surf anglers must learn the local rules.|$|E

40|$|The Coastal Bays {{contain a}} diverse {{community}} of finfish populations. Many of the mid-Atlantic region’s most valuable commercial finfish {{are composed of}} estuarine-dependent types like summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), <b>spot</b> (Leiostomus xanthurus), <b>croaker</b> (Micropogonias undulatus), striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and others. These species depend on the Coastal Bays {{as a place to}} find food, and several species use the bays as a nursery. A forage fish index has been developed and adopted as a measure of food availability in the Bays. This index is based on the abundance of four species- bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchelli), menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), spot, and Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia). These species represent the most common finfish forage in Maryland’s Coastal Bays. Since 1972, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has monitored this resource through annual trawl and seine surveys. Despite annual fluctuations, the forage index from both trawl and seine surveys trended downward slowly since the mid...|$|R
40|$|The 42 -mile-long White Oak River {{is one of}} {{the last}} {{relatively}} unblemished watery jewels of the N. C. coast. The predominantly black water river meanders through Jones, Carteret and Onslow counties along the central N. C. coast, gradually widening as it flows past Swansboro and into the Atlantic Ocean. It drains almost 12, 000 acres of estuaries [...] saltwater marshes lined with cordgrass, narrow and impenetrable hardwood swamps and rare stands of red cedar that are flooded with wind tides. The lower portion of the river was so renowned for fat oysters and clams that in times past competing watermen came to blows over its bounty at places that now bear names like Battleground Rock. The lower river is also a designated primary nursery area for such commercially important species as shrimp, <b>spot,</b> Atlantic <b>croaker,</b> blue crabs, weakfish and southern flounder. But the river has been discovered. The permanent population along the lower White Oak increased by almost a third since 1990, and the amount of developed land increased 82 percent during the same period. With the growth have come bacteria. Since the late 1990 s, much of the lower White Oak has been added to North Carolina’s list of impaired waters because of bacterial pollution. Forty-two percent of the rivers’ oyster and clam beds are permanently closed to shellfishing because of high bacteria levels. Fully two-thirds of the river’s shellfish beds are now permanently off limits or close temporarily after a moderate rain. State monitoring indicates that increased runoff from urbanization is the probable cause of the bacterial pollution. (PDF contains 4 pages...|$|R

40|$|Offshore winter-spawned fishes {{dominate}} the nekton of south-eastern United States estuaries. Their juveniles reside {{for several months}} in shallow, soft bottom estuarine creeks and bays called primary nursery areas. Despite similarity in many nursery characteristics, there is, between and within species, variability in the occupation of these habitats. Whether all occupied habitats are equally valuable to individuals {{of the same species}} or whether most recruiting juveniles end up in the best habitats is not known. If nursery quality varies, then factors controlling variation in pre-settlement fish distribution are important to year-class success. If nursery areas have similar values, interannual variation in distribution across nursery creeks should have less effect on population sizes or production. I used early nursery period age-specific growth and mortality rates of spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) —two dominant estuarine fishes—to assess relative habitat quality across a wide variety of nursery conditions, assuming that fish growth and mortality rates were direct reflections of overall physical and biological conditions in the nurseries. I tested the hypothesis that habitat quality varies for these fishes by comparing growth and mortality rates and distribution patterns across a wide range of typical nursery habitats at extreme ends of two systems. Juvenile <b>spot</b> and Atlantic <b>croaker</b> were collected from 10 creeks in the Cape Fear River estuary and from 18 creeks in the Pamlico Sound system, North Carolina, during the 1987 recruitment season (mid-March–mid-June). Sampled creeks were similar in size, depth, and substrates but varied in salinities, tidal regimes, and distances from inlets. Spot was widely distributed among all the estuarine creeks, but was least abundant in the creeks in middle reaches of both systems. Atlantic croaker occurred in the greatest abundance in oligohaline creeks of both systems. Instantaneous growth rates derived from daily otolith ages were generally similar for all creeks and for both species, except that spot exhibited a short-term growth depression in the upriver Pamlico system creeks—perhaps the result of the long migration distance of this species to this area. <b>Spot</b> and Atlantic <b>croaker</b> from upriver oligohaline creeks exhibited lower mortality rates than fish from downstream polyhaline creeks. These results indicated that even though growth was similar at the ends of the estuaries, the upstream habitats provided conditions that may optimize fitness through improved survival...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, <b>spot,</b> Atlantic <b>croaker,</b> northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|R
40|$|Bycatch, or the {{incidental}} catch of nontarget organisms during fi shing operations, {{is a major}} issue in U. S. shrimp trawl fisheries. Because bycatch is typically discarded at sea, total bycatch is usually estimated by extrapolating from an observed bycatch sample to the entire fleet with either mean-per-unit or ratio estimators. Using both field observations of commercial shrimp trawlers and computer simulations, I compared five methods for generating bycatch estimates that were used in past studies, a mean-per-unit estimator and four forms of the ratio estimator, respectively: 1) the mean fish catch per unit of effort, where unit effort was a proxy for sample size, 2) the mean of the individual fish to shrimp ratios, 3) the ratio of mean fish catch to mean shrimp catch, 4) the mean of the ratios of fish catch per time fished (a variable measure of effort), and 5) the ratio of mean fish catch per mean time fished. For field data, different methods used to estimate bycatch of Atlantic <b>croaker,</b> <b>spot,</b> and weakfish yielded extremely different results, with no discernible pattern in the estimates by method, geographic region, or species. Simulated fishing fleets were used to compare bycatch estimated by the fi ve methods with “actual” (simulated) bycatch. Simulations were conducted by using both normal and delta lognormal distributions of fish and shrimp and employed a range of values for several parameters, including mean catches of fish and shrimp, variability in the catches of fish and shrimp, variability in fishing effort, number of observations, and correlations between fish and shrimp catches. Results indicated that only the mean per unit estimators provided statistically unbiased estimates, while all other methods overestimated bycatch. The mean of the individual fish to shrimp ratios, the method used in the South Atlantic Bight before the 1990 s, gave the most biased estimates. Because of the statistically significant two- and 3 -way interactions among parameters, it is unlikely that estimates generated by one method can be converted or corrected to estimates made by another method: therefore bycatch estimates obtained with different methods should not be compared directly...|$|R
50|$|The Outer Banks are {{a popular}} {{destination}} for bottom fish like spot and mullet, {{these two types}} of fish are caught throughout the year. The peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of May. If the angler is solely searching for top water fish, then late May and June would be the ideal time to fish, especially if they are searching for Mackerel. In the offseason, or winter months, the true fishermen are out searching for Trout, Sea Bass, Bluefish, Bluefin Tuna, Oysters, King Mackerel, Bay Scallops, and Striped Bass. In the spring, the popular catches are Grouper, Sea Trout, Sea Bass, Bluefish, Bluefin and Yellowfin tuna, Oysters, Snapper, Striped Bass, Red Drum, Croaker, Sea Mullet, King Mackerel, and Wahoo Late Spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top-water fish to move into the coastal waters near the Outer Banks, because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water The top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water Plus they will start to migrate back North as the coastal waters to the south become too hot, the waters farther North will warm to their desired temperatures. Yet, in the prime tourist season of the summer, fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue Marlin, White Marlin, Dolphin, Wahoo, Cobia, King Mackerel, Bluefish, Tuna, Flounder, snapper, Grouper, Spanish Mackerel, Crabs, Soft Crabs, Shrimp, <b>Spot,</b> <b>Croaker,</b> Sailfish, and Sea Mullet. By the fall, most tourists have started to leave, but fishermen are still out searching for Snapper, Channel Bass, Bluefish, King Mackerel, Grouper, Tuna, Oysters, Striped Bass, Sea Mullet, Spot, Clams, Speckled Trout, Flounder, and Shrimp. The prime season for fall fishing is late September to October 23. Though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds, there is still some big game fish left. Most of these fish are vacating back to the South for the warm waters. This makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky, colder water.|$|E
