Analysis of partial cDNA clones has shown that the COOH terminus is composed predominantly of three tandemly repeated regions of 450 amino acids each (15). In this report, we present a cDNA sequence that encodes the NH 2 terminus of CR 1. It appears to have been derived from an alternatively processed transcript, caused by polyadenylation occurring at a site within an intron in the CR 1 transcriptional unit. The resulting truncated messenger carries an open reading frame that would produce a short, secreted CR 1 form. We present genomic sequences and Northern blots which support this hypothesis and we propose that the NH 2 -terminal end of CR 1 is a likely location for active sites.

This tumor marker is shown here to be associated noncovalently with a second 130 -kD protein. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies of surface iodinated lung tumor cell lysates reveal that this beterodimeric complex is indistinguishable serologically and structurally from the integrin VLA 2, found originally on activated T lymphocytes and platelets. The VLA 2 -like complex expressed on the lung tumors possesses similar characteristic Mgt- 1 dependent binding of collagen and laminin as observed with VLA- 2 on normal cells. RNA analysis indicates that human lung tumors express at least 20 times more VLA 2 ci chain message than normal adult human lung tissue.

In addition to being one of the few mammalian proteases capable of functioning at a neutral pH to cleave mature, crosslinked elastin, NE can also attack the major forms of collagen, the protein components ofproteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, components of the complement and coagulation cascades, and Escherichia coli cell walls (1, 2, 4, 6). As such, NE is considered to be useful because of its likely role in normal tissue turnover and host defense, yet dangerous in its ability to destroy normal tissues. The latter concept is most dramatically illustrated by the hereditary disorder al-antitrypsin (cdAT) deficiency, in which a deficiency of the major inhibitor of NE allows NE to attack alveolar walls in an unfettered fashion, resulting in the clinical disorder, emphysema (6, 7).

This antigen was not expressed at detectable levels on medullary thymocytes, mature peripheral leukocytes, bone marrow cells or on other types of tissues elsewhere in the human body. Immunohistologic analysis revealed that JL 1 had a clear pattern of distribution on cortical thymocytes. Immunoprecipitation of 125 I- labeled cell lysates from human thymocytes and Molt- 4 leukemic cell line with anti-JL 1 mAb yielded a 120 - 130 -kD <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> <b>glycoprotein.</b> When immunoprecipitation of cell lysate was done after endoglycosidase F treatment, JL 1 antigen was still detected by antibody but the band showed a reduction in apparent molecular mass of approximately 5 kD.

40|$|The human C 3 b/C 4 b receptor, or {{complement}} receptor type one (CRI) t is a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> membrane <b>glycoprotein</b> {{found on}} a variety of cell types (reviewed in reference 1). It is one ofa family of proteins that interacts with the two complement proteins, C 3 b and C 4 b, which bind to immune complexes and to foreign particles. Over 85 % of the CR 1 on circulating cells is located on the surface of erythrocytes, where it can mediate the binding, processing, and transport ofC 3 b-coated immune complexes. In addition, CR 1 on phagocytic cells promotes endocytosis ofsmall complexes and phagocytosis of larger particles. CRI also expresses regulatory activity in that it acts as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C 3 b and C 4 b and accelerates the decay of the classical and alternative pathway C 3 convertases The proteins that bind C 3 b/C 4 b have recently become the focus of intense interest, in part because many of them (CR 1, H, C 4 bp, CR 2, and DAF) are found at a single locus on human chromosome 1 (2 - 6).

40|$|Complement C 2 is a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> serum <b>glycoprotein</b> (110 kDa), {{which serves}} as the {{catalytic}} subunit of C 3 and C 5 convertases in the classical and lectin pathways. During complement activation, C 2 is cleaved by classical (C 1 s) or lectin (MBL-associated serine protease- 2; MASP- 2) proteases into two fragments: C 2 b and C 2 a. C 2 a, a serine protease, in complex with C 4 b fragment of complement factor C 4, generates the C 3 (C 4 b 2 a) or C 5 (C 4 b 2 a 3 b) convertase. C 3 convertase is very short-lived and cleaves complement C 3 into C 3 a and C 3 b fragments (selective cleavage of Arg-|-Ser bond in C 3 alpha-chain). C 3 convertase requires the presence of magnesium and decays over time at physiologic temperatures. However, continuous activation of complement pathways shifts the substrate preference from C 3 to C 5 by formation of C 5 convertase (formed by addition of C 3 b fragment to C 3 convertase i. e. C 4 b 2 a 3 b). C 5 convertase cleaves complement C 5 to become activated into C 5 a and C 5 b fragments (selective cleavage of Arg-|-Xaa bond in C 5 alpha-chain) and {{by a series of}} additional steps, promotes lysis of bacteria and damaged cells by pore or membrane attack complex (MAC) formation.

40|$|Complement factor H (fH) is a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> plasma <b>glycoprotein</b> (approximately 150 kDa in size), with 20 domains termed {{complement}} control protein (CCP) domains {{or short}} consensus repeats (SCR). The complement factor H gene (CFH) {{is located on}} chromosome 1 q 32 in the regulators of complement activation (RCA) gene cluster, adjacent to the genes that code for the Complement factor H-Related Proteins (CFHRs). The RCA cluster includes additional regulators containing SCR domains, such as C 4 Binding Protein (C 4 BP), Complement receptor type 1 (CR 1), Complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF), Membrane cofactor protein (MCP). fH and C 4 BP are fluid-phase (soluble) complement regulators, while the remaining are membrane-bound and all these regulators share similarities in their structure and function. fH prevents {{the formation of the}} alternative pathway C 3 (C 3 bBb) and C 5 (C 3 bBb 3 b) convertases. This inhibitory effect is either by competition with Complement factor B (fB) for C 3 b binding, by convertase decay acceleration activity or by acting as a cofactor for the Complement factor I (fI) -mediated degradation of C 3 b. Important targets for fH binding, in the neighborhood of C 3 b on host cells, are glycosaminoglycans and sialic acid (polyanionic molecules), which increase the affinity of fH for C 3 b. In addition to C 3 b and polyanionic molecules, fH also interacts with various endogenous molecules, such as pentraxins, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, prion protein, adrenomedullin, DNA, annexin-II and histones, to inhibit complement activation on certain host surfaces such as glomerular basement membrane, the extracellular matrix, and late apoptotic cells. CFH gene mutations and polymorphisms, and auto-antibodies against fH adversely affect regulatory and target recognition functions of fH. Some of the diseases associated with fH dysfunction are atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), dense deposit disease (DDD; also termed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type II) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Interestingly, microbes and multicellular pathogens can recruit host fH to their surface in order to protect themselves from complement attack...|$|R

Besides the removal of C 3 b- or C 4 b-coated microorganisms or immune complexes (4), CRl also serves as an inhibitor of the C 3 and the C 5 convertases by dissociating C 2 b and Bb fragments and by acting as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C 3 b and C 4 b (5, 6).

The carbohydrate chain binding positions, Asn 81, 99 and 148, were located in the neighbourhood of an active site cleft. In this study, the enzymatic property of the deglycosylated protease was compared to the intact protease in order to elucidate the role of the carbohydrate chain. The deglycosylation of the protease was carried out by glycosidase treatment and the deglycosylated protease with a molecular weight of 26. 5 kDa was obtained. The intact protease converted human fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrinopeptide A, B and Bβ 1 - 42 were released during fibrin clot formation. The deglycosylated protease also formed the fibrin clot. Fibrinopeptide A primarily released although the release of the fibrinopeptide B and Bβ 1 - 42 was significantly reduced. Removal of the carbohydrate moiety resulted in a decrease in these fragment releases, suggesting that the access of the fibrinogen Bβ chain to the active site was restricted by the deglycosylation. Thus, the carbohydrate chain may {{play an important role in}} the conformational integrity of the active site and also in the interaction between the protease and substrates, especially a large molecular substrate such as fibrinogen...|$|E

BjussuSP-I showed a high clotting activity upon human plasma, which was inhibited by PMSF, leupeptin, heparin and 1, 10 -phenantroline. This enzyme showed high stability regarding coagulant activity when analyzed at different temperatures (- 70 to 37 degrees C), pHs (4. 5 to 8. 0), and presence of two divalent metal ions (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +). It also displayed TAME esterase and proteolytic activities toward natural (fibrinogen and fibrin) and synthetic (BAPNA) substrates, respectively, being also inhibited by PMSF and leupeptin. BjussuSP-I can induce production of polyclonal antibodies able to inhibit its clotting activity, but unable to inhibit its proteolytic activity on fibrinogen.

Contrary to the preference of cathepsin B, cathepsin X normally acts as a carboxymonopeptidase. However, the preference for Arg in the P 1 position is so strong that cathepsin X cleaves substrates with Arg in antepenultimate position, acting also as a carboxydipeptidase. A large hydrophobic residue such as Trp is preferred in the P 1 ' position, although the enzyme cleaved all P 1 ' residues investigated (Trp, Phe, Ala, Arg, Pro).

The gene encoding hK 3, hKLK 3, is located on chromosome 19 and its expression {{has been shown to be}} regulated by steroid hormones through androgen receptor-mediated transcription. hK 3 was once thought to be exclusively expressed and secreted by prostatic epithelial cells, hence the initial name of prostate-specific antigen, but has since been isolated in several nonprostatic tissues and ongoing characterization of alternative splicing variants has found at least 13 distinct mRNA transcripts. The detection of hK 3 in cerebrospinal fluid prompted the hypothesis that hK 3 may be produced in the brain. To test this notion, in this study we used RT-PCR amplification of brain tissue total RNA and examined hK 3 protein by immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analysis. RT-PCR revealed several hK 3 mRNA transcripts in the brain. Confirming these findings, both immunohistochemical staining and western immunoblotting showed evidence for hK 3 protein in neuronal cells.

Histological analysis revealed a marked reduction of F 9 tumour cells and excessive deposition of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix after treatment with <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> antibody fragments- 2 -dioxy- 5 -fluorouridylyl-N(4) -octadecyl- 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-liposomes. <b>Single</b> <b>chain</b> antibody fragments-liposomes targeted to ED-B fibronectin positive tumours therefore represent a promising and versatile novel drug delivery system for the treatment of tumours...|$|R
40|$|Fast atom {{bombardment}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{has proved to}} be a powerful technique for locating the disulfide bonds in proteins. Both applications and potential of the method have been investigated in this study. The disulfide bonds in three proteins, human antithrombin III, hen egg-white lysozyme and ovine luteinizing hormone β subunit, have been studied by FABMS analysis. ^ Human antithrombin III is a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> with 432 amino acid residues and three disulfide bonds. The protein is readily cleaved into disulfide-containing peptides which are analyzed by FABMS. Based on the molecular weights of the disulfide-containing peptides and their corresponding constituent peptides, the locations of three disulfide bonds are assigned to 8 - 128, 21 - 95 and 247 - 430. ^ A new method has been studied for locating disulfide bonds in proteins which can not be cleaved between half-cystine residues by enzymatic methods. Partial acid hydrolysis has been applied to a model protein, hen egg-white lysozyme, to produce disulfide-containing peptides. HPLC fractions of the hydrolysate are analyzed by FABMS before and after chemical reduction. Computer assisted analysis is then used to relate the molecular weights obtained from FAB mass spectra to specific segments of the protein from which the disulfide connectivities can be deduced. The method is successfully applied to hen egg-white lysozyme to locate the four disulfide bonds in this protein. ^ The method of FABMS analysis is finally applied to ovine luteinizing hormone β subunit, a glycoprotein with 119 amino acid residues and six disulfide bonds. The protein is cleaved by combined use of partial acid hydrolysis and proteolysis. Three of six disulfide bonds are assigned as 23 - 72, 26 - 110 and 34 - 57. The obstacles for locating disulfide bonds in this protein have been discussed. ^ The results presented in this thesis show that FABMS is a very sensitive, rapid, selective and accurate method for locating the disulfide bonds in proteins. The requirements of disulfide-containing peptides having proper sizes and containing only one disulfide bond may become a limitation when protein is highly cross-linked and the half-cystinyl residues are located with proximity in protein sequence. ...|$|E
40|$|The class II antigens of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) 1 are critical to the generation of an immune response. They control {{the magnitude of the}} immune response of antigens and direct interactions among immunocompetent cells. Despite their well-documented role in a variety of immune phenomena, the biochemical mechanisms of Ia-mediated immune effects is not clearly understood at this time. Biochemical analyses indicate that Ia antigens consist of a 33 - 35 kD a <b>chain</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> and a 25 - 27 kD/ 3 <b>chain</b> <b>glycoprotein,</b> both of which are encoded by genes within the MHC. Over the past several years, additional components {{have been found to be}} noncovalently associated with the Ia heterodimer. The most extensively characterized of these is a 31 kD <b>glycoprotein,</b> termed invariant <b>chain</b> (Ii), which specifically associates with cytoplasmic forms of murine Ia antigens (1). Molecules homologous to invariant chain have since been identified in association with the human, rat, and guinea pig class II antigens (2 - 5). Although studied extensively by a number of laboratories, the function of the invariant chain in the biology of Ia has eluded investigators...|$|R
