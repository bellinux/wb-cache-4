5|$|Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME {{of the newly}} formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten Kclass locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, {{although most of the}} component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled on the Central section. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (air) brakes for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock on the Central section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in <b>superheater</b> area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of <b>superheater</b> that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of Harry Wainwright, {{who had left}} a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire traffic of the railway. The first of these was the Nclass 2-6-0, which gave the SECR a capable mixed-traffic locomotive. For the express passenger design that could cope with the heavy boat trains, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing Lclass 4-4-0 with Walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged <b>superheater,</b> but this design would have resulted in a too heavy axle loading. Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H.Pearson and Harold Holcroft from the Great Western Railway at Swindon and James Clayton from the Midland Railway at Derby, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1915, all {{engines in}} the class were fitted with <b>superheaters.</b> The final two engines, built in 1921, were fitted with <b>superheaters</b> from the outset.|$|R
50|$|The {{last two}} engines {{of the second}} batch, 366 and 367, were {{delivered}} with Schmidt <b>superheaters,</b> and were the first superheated locomotives to enter service in Western Australia. They were designated as class Fs. Between 1924 and 1948, all bar 398, 401, 403 and 415 were retrofitted with <b>superheaters,</b> and reclassified as Fs class engines. Some were renumbered in 1949/1950. Towards {{the end of their}} lives, some had their <b>superheaters</b> removed as an economy measure.|$|R
50|$|After Drummond's death, Robert Urie, his successor, fitted {{the class}} with Eastleigh <b>superheaters.</b> These {{had a very}} small {{superheating}} surface so they were replaced by Maunsell <b>superheaters,</b> when Richard Maunsell was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway after the grouping of 1923.|$|R
5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a <b>superheater.</b> Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.|$|E
25|$|The Yarrow <b>superheater</b> {{consisted}} of hairpin tubes, {{parallel to the}} existing steam generator tubes. One bank of the generator tubes was separated in two, with individual lower water drums for them. The <b>superheater</b> {{was placed in the}} gap formed between these, with both ends of its tubes connected to a single <b>superheater</b> header drum, and an internal baffle to separate wet and dry steam.|$|E
25|$|When {{superheating}} was adopted, {{primarily for}} use with steam turbines after 1900, the first Yarrow boilers placed their <b>superheater</b> coil outside the main tube bank. Later designs became asymmetrical, with the tube bank on one side doubled and a hairpin-tube <b>superheater</b> placed between them.|$|E

50|$|Schmidt <b>superheaters</b> {{and longer}} smokeboxes were fitted between 1913 and 1917.|$|R
25|$|Alternatively the 'double flow' boiler {{retained}} full {{gas flow}} through both sides, although {{only one of}} these contained a <b>superheater.</b> A controllable baffle on the non-superheated side could be closed to increase flow through the <b>superheater.</b> These boilers usually incorporated additional feedwater heaters in the updraught above these baffles.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{loops of}} hottest superheaters {{can be made}} of {{austenitic}} material, with better corrosion resistance. The steam velocity in the hottest <b>superheater</b> tubes is high, decreasing the tube surface temperature. Low tube surface temperatures are essential to prevent <b>superheater</b> corrosion. A high steam side pressure loss over the hot superheaters ensures uniform steam flow in tube elements.|$|E
25|$|The spacing between <b>superheater</b> panels has increased. All superheaters are now wide spaced to {{minimize}} fouling. This arrangement, {{in combination with}} sweetwater attemperators, ensures maximum protection against corrosion. With wide spacing plugging of the superheaters becomes less likely, the deposit cleaning is easier and the sootblowing steam consumption is lower. Increased number of superheaters facilitates the control of <b>superheater</b> outlet steam temperature especially during start ups.|$|E

25|$|A {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} <b>superheater</b> was to increase the temperature differential between inner and outer tubes of the bank, thus encouraging circulation. The two water drums were often linked by unheated downcomers, to allow this flow between the drums. This effect was later encouraged in the Admiralty boiler, where the tubes of a bank were curved apart to leave space for a <b>superheater,</b> whilst retaining the single water drum.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a single}} <b>superheater</b> was ever installed, {{on just one}} side of the boiler. The simplest, and smallest, boilers moved their exhaust flue to this side, passing all of the exhaust through the bank with the <b>superheater.</b> The now-asymmetric boiler could pass all of its exhaust gas through the {{superheated}} side as the single flow type. The other bank remained in use for purely radiative heating, often with fewer rows of tubes.|$|E
25|$|The Galloway boiler {{was still}} being {{improved}} around this time. In 1902 the company introduced a <b>superheater</b> and in 1910 began to use another design of the same.|$|E

50|$|The {{impurity}} carryover {{can cause}} corrosion and fouling of steam turbines, reheaters, and <b>superheaters.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{steam power}} plant gets its input heat from the high {{temperature}} exhaust gases from gas turbine power plant. The steam generated thus {{can be used to}} drive steam turbine. The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) has 3 sections: Economiser, evaporator and <b>superheater.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recovery boilers {{were soon}} {{licensed}} and produced in Scandinavia and Japan. These boilers were built by local manufacturers from drawings and with instructions of licensors. One {{of the early}} Scandinavian Tomlinson units employed an 8.0 m high furnace that had 2.8*4.1 m furnace bottom which expanded to 4.0*4.1 m at <b>superheater</b> entrance.|$|E
25|$|Separate {{downcomers}} {{were used}} by most designs, even after Yarrow's experiments had demonstrated that circulation could still take place amongst the heated tubes alone. Again, the Admiralty boiler (which omitted downcomers) {{was the culmination of}} this approach, placing the <b>superheater</b> within the tube bank, so as to encourage the necessary temperature difference.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of A2 locomotives were originally built with saturated steam boilers.

25|$|The carburetted water gas {{process was}} {{improved}} by Thaddeus S. C. Lowe in 1875. The gas oil was fixed into the BWG via thermocracking in the carburettor and <b>superheater</b> of the CWG generating set. CWG was the dominant {{technology in the}} USA from the 1880s until the 1950s, replacing coal gasification. CWG has a CV of 20 MJ/m³ i.e. {{slightly more than half}} that of natural gas.|$|E
25|$|A {{fossil fuel}} steam {{generator}} includes an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and <b>superheater</b> coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air preheater (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse) and the flue gas stack.|$|E
