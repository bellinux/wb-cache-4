5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> {{and painted}} turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> home ranges tend {{to occupy}} limited areas of about 0.5 to 3.5 {{hectares}} (1.2 to 8.6 acres). Note {{that due to}} their size, these small turtles are highly vulnerable to predation, particularly during their frequent terrestrial wanderings. Many specimens will show mutilation injuries and scars from past predation attempts. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are particularly adept at consuming and killing this species. <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> have been observed to dive {{into the water and}} bury themselves in the bottom mud when surprised while basking. Muskrats kill many <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> during the winter dormant period.|$|R
5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles,</b> hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> use a {{wide variety}} of wetland {{habitats}} with soft bottoms and aquatic vegetation (Ernst et al. 1994; Hulse et al. 2001; NatureServe 2010). <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> use mostly unpolluted, small, shallow bodies of water such as small marshes, marshy pastures, bogs, fens, woodland streams, swamps, small ponds, and vernal pools. They may also use brackish tidal streams. Ponds surrounded by relatively undisturbed meadow or undergrowth are most favorable. <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> often bask along the water’s edge, on brush piles in water, and on logs or vegetation clumps. When inactive, they hide in bottom mud and detritus or in muskrat burrows. The species range extends from southern Maine, southern Ontario, lower peninsula of Michigan, and northeastern Illinois, south to central Indiana, central Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and southward along the U. S...|$|R
5|$|The Pine Bush is {{also home}} to 30 of the 44 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata) and wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.|$|E
25|$|The 37 {{amphibian}} and reptile species {{found in}} the area include six deemed to be of special concern by the state: Jefferson salamander, blue-spotted salamander, spotted salamander, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> wood turtle and eastern hognose snake.|$|E
500|$|The {{wood turtle}} (Glyptemys insculpta) is {{a species of}} turtle endemic to North America. It is in the genus Glyptemys, a genus which {{contains}} only one other species of turtle: the bog turtle (Glyptemys muhlenbergii [...] ). The wood turtle reaches a straight carapace length of , its defining characteristic being the pyramidal shape of the scutes on its upper shell. Morphologically, it {{is similar to the}} bog turtle, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata), and Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii [...] ). The wood turtle exists in a broad geographic range extending from Nova Scotia in the north (and east) to Minnesota in the west and Virginia in the south. In the past, it was forced south by encroaching glaciers: skeletal remains have been found as far south as Georgia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>spotted</b> box <b>turtle</b> (Terrapene nelsoni klauberi [...] ), also {{commonly known}} as Klauber's box <b>turtle</b> and Klauber's <b>spotted</b> box <b>turtle,</b> is a species of turtle in the family Emydidae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle's</b> range {{overlaps}} that of {{many other}} turtles. It can often {{be found in the}} same wetlands as wood turtles, bog turtles, snapping turtles, painted turtles, Blanding's turtles, eastern box turtles, common musk turtles, and eastern mud turtles.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} types of snakes and turtles that lived in the area before the office complex was built. Garter snakes, brown snakes, ringneck snakes, water snakes, and milk snakes {{inhabited}} the area. Turtles included snapping turtles, box <b>turtles,</b> wood <b>turtles,</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles,</b> musk and mud turtles.|$|R
2500|$|The {{wetlands}} and floodplain forests provide habitat to {{nearly half of}} all migratory birds in Indiana and Michigan and are a vital habitat for resident species as well, such as wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), coyote (Canis latrans), fox, beaver (Castor canadensis), mink (Neovison vison), Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina), [...] and the rare <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata) and northern redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata), both protected by the State of Michigan. The lower Pigeon River is home to the federally endangered Indiana Bat.|$|E
2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen's swamp monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, golden-headed lion tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, lion-tailed macaque, pygmy marmoset, ring-tailed lemur, and white-faced saki.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, {{the genus}} Clemmys {{consisted}} of four species (bog turtle, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> western pond turtle, {{and the wood}} turtle). Recent genetic analyses have revealed that the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is distinct from the other three species. The bog turtle and the wood turtle were moved to the genus Glyptemys, while the western pond turtle has been renamed Actinemys. This makes the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> the sole member of the genus Clemmys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> are aquatic omnivores that inhabit {{a variety}} of {{semi-aquatic}} or in other words, shallow, fresh-water areas such as flooded forests, marshes, wet meadows, bogs and woodland streams in southern Canada (Ontario) and the eastern US: the eastern Great Lakes and east of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|R

50|$|Several New York State {{species of}} concern — the blue-spotted, Jefferson's and marbled {{salamanders}} — have found habitat {{dependent on the}} brook. Indiana bats, a federal endangered species, use trees near it as roosting sites and {{have been found to}} forage in it. The Eastern box, wood and <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> also make their homes in and near the brook.|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} of {{the park}} also support significant animal species including <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles,</b> Blanding’s turtles and eastern Massassauga rattlesnakes. Uplands support both the hognose snake and five-lined skink, {{both of which are}} considered species of special concern. There is also a population of fox snakes, which use offshore islands extensively, and overwinter in hibernacula in the area.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the rare}} animals in the bog are the Bog Elfin butterfly, Fletcher's dragonfly, and <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> {{occupies}} {{a variety of}} habitats including swamps, bogs, fens, marshes, woodland streams, and wet pastures. Also, brackish streams that are influenced by tides can {{also serve as a}} home to this turtle in addition to ditches, vernal pools, and sedge meadows. [...] For a habitat to be sufficient for <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> survival it must have areas of soft substrate and at least some aquatic vegetation. [...] An optimum habitat would include shallow and slow moving waters with soft muddy soil, sedge tussocks, water lilies, sphagnum moss, and cattails. [...] Because it is so often found in areas that contain duckweed, the yellow spots on these turtles may serve as a form of camouflage. [...] The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> avoids artificial reservoirs and deep, open-water areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{one species}} whose sex is {{determined}} by temperature during embryonic development. Some researchers have claimed that global warming may deleteriously impact population sex ratios.|$|E
50|$|Being an {{accredited}} {{member of}} the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the zoo partakes in multiple captive breeding programs and Species Survival Plans. The zoo works to care for and breed multiple endangered species such as Amur tigers, Amur leopards, Canada lynx, Brazilian ocelots, red wolves, Mexican wolves, maned wolves, giant anteaters, Chacoan peccaries, golden lion tamarins, North American river otters, Andean condors, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles,</b> and Eastern hellbenders.|$|R
50|$|Eleven hundred {{acres at}} the Perry plant were {{designated}} in 1993 as an urban wildlife sanctuary by the National Institute for Urban Wildlife. The area has trees, shrubs, streams and ponds; and a habitat for heron, belted kingfisher, ducks and geese. The forested area {{is ideal for}} the crane-fly orchid, a rare species in Ohio. The site includes a wetland that contains <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles,</b> an endangered species in Ohio.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{large number of}} populations in Canada, many are not self-sustaining because of the following reasons: {{the majority of the}} populations are small, they all have less than 200 individuals, and the areas are all isolated from one another. All told it is estimated that anywhere from 1000 to 2000 <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> live in Canada however, with individual populations ceasing to exist, this number is declining.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{freezing}} temperatures of winter and the extreme heat of summer, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> become inactive during environmentally unfavorable conditions. However, the species {{appears to be}} relatively tolerant of drought conditions. <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> do become active {{very early in the}} spring, and are often active at relatively cold water temperatures during that season. Activity appears to peak during April and May {{in the northern part of}} the range. In the warmest part of the summer (when water temperatures exceed 30 °C), they may aestivate terrestrially or aquatically for long periods of time. During summer dormancy, the turtles may burrow into leaf litter in woodlands or marsh edges or open fields; others remain in muskrat burrows or other aquatic refuges. Litzgus and Brooks (2000) have questioned the common presumption that summer dormancy is an attempt by the turtles to avoid high temperatures; data from Ontario and elsewhere suggests that avoidance of predation and conservation of energy resources may be viable alternate explanations. No matter the explanation for dormancy, the [...] "winter" [...] dormant period may commence in late summer or fall, but in almost every instance after a return to aquatic habitats.|$|R
