5000|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>and</b> bulk erosion are two {{different}} forms of erosion that describe how a degrading polymer erodes. In surface erosion, the polymer degrades from the exterior surface. The inside of the material does not degrade until all the surrounding material around it has been degraded. [...] In bulk erosion, degradation occurs throughout the whole material equally. Both the <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> {{the inside of the}} material degrade. [...] <b>Surface</b> erosion <b>and</b> bulk erosion are not exclusive, many materials undergo a combination of <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> bulk erosion.

How {{to demonstrate the}} deformation and failure mode of the slope under combine <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> underground mining and evaluate its stability scientifically {{is one of the}} problems that need urgent solutions in mining engineering. First, the deformation and failure mode of the slope under simple surface mining, the deformation and failure mechanism of the overlying strata affected by underground mining and deformation mechanism of the slope under combined <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> underground mining were analyzed, then the failure mode and the stability calculation method of the slope under combined <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> underground mining was studied. The results show that the failure modes of the slope under combined <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> underground mining involve three patterns: slipping failure, subsiding failure and slipping-subsiding combined failure, that the failure modes and the stability of the slope under combined <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> underground mining be significantly affected by the underground mining positions and the influence be mainly controlled by the length of the latent slide plane of the slope and the weakening degree of the rock masses in the subsidence range. Finally, a limit equilibrium method to calculate the slope stability under combined <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> underground mining was put forward...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new snow}} wetness {{estimation}} model is proposed for full-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. <b>Surface</b> <b>and</b> volume are the dominant scattering components in wet-snow conditions. The generalized four component polarimetric decomposition with unitary transformation (G 4 U) based generalized <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> volume parameters are utilized to invert snow <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> volume dielectric constants using the Bragg coefficients and Fresnel transmission coefficients respectively. The snow <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> volume wetness are then estimated using an empirical relationship. The effective snow wetness {{is derived from}} the weighted averaged <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> volume snow wetness. The weights are derived from the normalized <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> volume scattering powers obtained from the generalized full-polarimetric SAR decomposition method. Six Radarsat- 2 fine resolution full-polarimetric datasets acquired over Himachal Pradesh, India along with the near-real time in situ measurements were used to validate the proposed model. The snow wetness derived from the SAR data by the proposed model with in situ measurements indicated that the absolute error at 95 % confidence interval is 1. 3 % by volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.
