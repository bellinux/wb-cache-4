This thesis focuses on the steep outer flank and surrounding apron deposits of Koko Crater, O’ahu, Hawaii. Four sections were logged in detail and interpreted. The steep outer slope deposits are dominated by <b>slumped</b> pyroclastic fallout deposits, {{some of which may}} be directly eruption-fed, and minor pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits, that are rarely <b>slumped.</b> The lack of <b>slumping</b> of the PDC deposits is interpreted as due to their lower eruption volumes, lower depositional rates, lower water content, and longer transport distances, all of which favor more stable slopes. <b>Slumping</b> is also less common on previously <b>slumped</b> substrate, as <b>slumps</b> typically generate a lower gradient than the primary deposits. The occurrence of PDC deposits overlying fallout deposits, may suggest that the PDC deposits were generated by column collapse (partial, sustained or complete). The flanking apron deposits, i. e. those {{around the base of the}} steep outer slopes, are dominated by pyroclastic density current, with minor fallout deposits. <b>Slumping</b> is rare in the flanking apron deposits, probably because of the lower substrate gradients. The increasing abundance of PDC deposits with distance from the vent is most likely due to the longer transport distance compared to the ballistic fallout. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slumping</b> (or thermal shaping) of thin glass sheets onto high {{precision}} mandrels {{was used by}} NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to fabricate the NuSTAR telescope with success. But this process requires long thermal cycles and produces mid-range spatial frequency errors due to the anti-stick mandrel coatings. Over the last few years, MIT Space Nanotechnology Lab has developed a non-contact <b>slumping</b> process differentiating from the preceding contact <b>slumping,</b> which utilizes a pair of porous air bearing mandrels through which compressed nitrogen is forced, with a thin piece of glass sheet floating between two thin layers of nitrogen during the thermal cycle. However, the underlying mechanism behind air bearing <b>slumping</b> still remains unveiled. This thesis describes a series of design and tests on horizontal <b>slumping</b> tool with improved active control algorithm and fiber sensing techniques, which results in glass with reduced mid-range spatial frequency errors that could be accomplished in much shorter thermal cycles. We examined {{the influence of the}} <b>slumping</b> time, the supply pressure and the air film thickness and gravity to the outcome shape of the glass. To complement the experiments and to understand the mechanism, we built a finite element model with fluid-structure interaction to analyze the viscoelastic behavior of glass during air bearing <b>slumping.</b> We proved that for the 2 D axisymmetric model, experimental and numerical approaches have comparable results. We also discovered the crucial impacts of bearing permeability to the glass shape. The 3 D cylindrical model is also in development, and a novel vertical <b>slumping</b> tool is to eliminate the undesirable influence of gravity under test. Through both experiments and simulations, we believe that non-contact <b>slumping</b> using air bearing could remove mid-range spatial frequency errors, which is critical to producing high-resolution large-aperture thin mirrors for X-ray telescopes. by Heng Zuo.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the work of}} M. Akilian and A. Husseini on developing a noncontact glass slumping/shaping process. The shift from vertical <b>slumping</b> to horizontal <b>slumping</b> is implemented and various technologies required for the horizontal <b>slumping</b> process are developed. In the horizontal <b>slumping</b> process, a thin sheet of glass is placed in between two horizontal ceramic air bearings with a bearing to glass gap of about 50 pm, and the assembly is heated up to 600 *C. The glass is unconstrained in the horizontal plane and must be positioned without any solid contact. Specifically, the technologies developed are: an optical distance sensor for positioning of the glass, glass position control via air bearing fluid shear force and tilt of device, and device mechanisms for operation in 600 *C. Glass was <b>slumped</b> horizontally with bearing-to-glass gaps of > 50 [mu]m, 36 ± 2. 5 pm, and 30. 5 ± 2. 5 [mu]m. The best flatness achieved was 6. 7 / 3. 6 + 0. 5 [mu]m for front/back of the glass sheet, with a gap of 36 + 2. 5 [mu]pm. It was discovered that 600 *C is hotter than necessary and that 550 *C is still too hot for optimal <b>slumping</b> conditions. In addition, an important shift is made from using an oven, which heats the entire device, to using in-line pipe heaters, which supply heated air. This allows for much quicker heating and cooling times, which decreases <b>slumping</b> time to less than 30 minutes (10 minutes heating, 5 minutes <b>slumping,</b> 10 minutes cooling). by Edward Sung.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{objective}} of this research project was to investigate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the behavior of materials in partially <b>slumped</b> fluidized beds. View windows {{along the side of}} the experiment facility made visual observations of bed profiles possible. These observations were recorded on movie films showing the effects of variations in <b>slumping</b> length, bed depth and fluidizing velocity. Quantitative experiments were also carried out under different sets of experimental conditions with pressure drops across the bed being recorded. Dimensional analysis then correlates the pressure drops, to Reynolds number, Froude number, the <b>slumping</b> ratio of bed depth and particle size. Plots were constructed to show the trend of variation in the pressure drop versus that of Reynolds number and logarithm of Froude number, respectively, holding the <b>slumping</b> ratio and the ratio of bed depth to particle size constant. Statistical regression techniques were employed to develop two mathematical models that provide quantitative predictions of the pressure distribution in a <b>slumped</b> fluidized bed. The results showed formation of ridges when the bed was slumped; movement of the position of the ridge and also changes in its height. No difficulty was encountered when the <b>slumped</b> region was refluidized if the bed is originally fluidized under bubbling conditions. Two mathematical models were proposed and were checked with the data obtained in the experiments. It was shown that these models were statistically acceptable however, an error test showed that improvements are needed on these models.

40|$|Current X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM were {{designed}} and built to privilege the angular resolution or the collecting area respectively, but using two different manufacturing techniques, and these two key aspects could not be optimised at the same time. The {{result is that the}} high-redshift X-ray Universe is still too unresolved to provide us with the understanding of the time evolution of the universe as we see it nowadays. Now the ATHENA mission, approved for the L 2 slot in the Cosmic Vision program, is required to have an effective area of 2 m 2 at 1 keV and an angular resolution better than 5 arcsec Half-Energy Width (HEW). At this regard, in addition to the baseline solution based on Silicon Pore Optics (SPO), thin glass foils are considered a viable alternative. <b>Slumped</b> glass foils are also considered as substrates for X-ray optics being developed in other projects; for example, the X-ray Surveyor mission being developed at SAO/CfA in USA, and the AXYOM project being developed in Italy. They both foresee the use of piezo-electric actuators to correct the shape errors of the mirrors. The Brera Astronomical Observatory (INAF-OAB, Merate - Italy) has been working, from 2009 till 2013, under ESA contract aimed to develop in Europe a <b>Slumped</b> Glass Optics (SGO) technology, alternative to the one based on silicon pores, and based on the <b>slumping</b> of thin glass foils, in parallel to the work being carried out at NASA/GSFC and other institutes. The INAFOAB innovation is the use of pressure in the hot <b>slumping</b> process to replicate the mould figure. This technology is coupled with an integration process able to damp low frequency errors. My Ph. D. activity, carried out at the INAF-OAB, is devoted to the advancement in the hot <b>slumping</b> technology assisted by pressure, for the production of glass mirrors for future X-ray telescopes. As a preliminary work, I have developed a new method to precisely characterise the mid frequency errors of the glass foils. An existing model, developed by Jimenez-Garate in 2003 to account for the relaxation of ripples in the <b>slumped</b> glass foil when in contact with the <b>slumping</b> mould, was modified to include the application of pressure, and the model was compared to the experimental results. The pressure was found to be essential, also from the the theory viewpoint, to reduce mid-frequency errors in the profile of <b>slumped</b> glass foils, which crucially degrade the performances of the optics. As for the <b>slumping</b> process, I have introduced a new glass material (Corning Eagle XG) combined with the Schott Zerodur K 20, already chosen at earlier times as <b>slumping</b> mould material for its anti-sticking properties. I have developed cleaning protocols, used different thermal cycles and different pressures conditions, and reconditioned the pressure control system. I have also optimised the mould height with experiments based on Finite Element Analysis, and reduced the thermal gradients inside the mould and the glass foils. The final result obtained in this research are <b>slumped</b> glass foils with angular resolution improved from the initial 7 arcsec to 2. 2 ± 0. 3 arcsec in single reflection, as expected from metrology at 1 keV X-ray energy and 0. 7 incidence angle, and computed by simulating a perfect integration. This result has to be compared with 2 arcsec defined as the error budget allocated for the <b>slumped</b> glass foils. About 1 arcsec is due to replication of the mid-frequency errors in the <b>slumping</b> mould which, owing to the improved result in the <b>slumping,</b> are now a limiting factor in the quality of the <b>slumped</b> glass foils. From the roughness point of view, the contribution to the HEW is guaranteed to be less then 1 arcsec at 1 keV, with an rms improvement from 21 to 11 Å throughout my Ph. D. Moreover, the last tests carried out proved that the roughness of the <b>slumped</b> glass foils can be further reduced to _ 7 Å, making the technology attractive also for higher X-ray energies and higher incidence angles. The glass foils <b>slumped</b> during this Ph. D. have been used for the production of two SGO Proof Of Concept prototypes (POC) for the ATHENA mission: the POC# 3, (with 2 glass foils assembled) is characterised by HEW value of 5. 5 arcsec at 0. 27 keV in the best portion of the module, as tested at the PANTER facility; the POC# 4 (with 8 glass foils) has expected HEW of about 15 arcsec from metrological data, but the result in X-ray was much higher because of accidental problems during the integration. The next prototype, the POC# 5 (with the best eight glass foils produced during my Ph. D. activity), will soon be integrated and tested in X-rays, to assess the improvement already proven by metrology and simulations. Some of the produced <b>slumped</b> glass foils have also been used for studies of active profile corrections with piezoelectric elements, both for the AXYOM project and X-ray Surveyor mission. Alternative materials and techniques have been used in this research to further improve the result. To reduce the surface micro-roughness of the <b>slumped</b> glass foils, I have proven that the <b>slumping</b> technique with pressure application can also be suited in the indirect <b>slumping,</b> in which the optical surface of the glass is not in contact with the mould, thus preserving its initial surface smoothness. Moreover, the dip coating technique was studied to fill the micro-pores present {{on the surface of the}} glass foils <b>slumped</b> with the direct technique. Alternative materials for the <b>slumping</b> mould were tested, defining Si 3 N 4 as a very promising candidate, owing to its higher rigidity with respect to Zerodur K 20 and therefore preferable to avoid mould deformations with the <b>slumping,</b> as experienced with K 20. The Gorilla glass (normally used for smartphones and tablets), was proven to preserve the surface quality of the glass foils, once <b>slumped</b> and chemically tempered to increase the mirror endurance against the vibrations experienced at launch. Finally, I have also studied the scattering and the reflectivity properties of multilayer coatings for X-ray optics. I have upgraded an IDL code to simulate the roughness growth in the multilayer deposition process, extending the computations from periodic to the more general case of graded multilayers. I have also contributed to the X-ray measurements at the BEAR beamline of the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, on multilayers deposited on glass, silicon and electroformed nickel, for the polarimetric LAMP projec...|$|R
