40|$|IMARES {{has been}} tasked {{to perform an}} ICA {{assessment}} on a simulated Jack Mackerel dataset. This {{in order to provide}} management advice within the <b>SPRFMO</b> framework. The results of the assessments are only briefly discussed, as the Assessment Simulation Task Team mainly focused on agreeing on the underlying simulated dataset and assessment settings during the 8 th <b>SPRFMO</b> meeting in Auckland, New Zealand. The summarized outcome of these discussions was that more realistic characteristics of the real fishery and surveys should be incorporated into the simulated dataset. This has been communicated to the designer of the dataset and will result in a revised dataset. CVO (Centrum voor Visserij Onderzoek) has proposed to include the <b>SPRFMO</b> work in the near future into WOT tasks (Wettelijke Onderzoeks Taken). Early 2010 another meeting will be organized in which the Assessment Simulation Task Team will discuss the revised simulated datasets, discuss general assessment settings, perform assessments, compare and discuss these results. The results as listed in this report will be used within these discussions...|$|E
40|$|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61 / 105 on {{sustainable}} fisheries (UNGA 2007) establishes three difficult questions for participants in high-seas bottom fisheries to answer: 1) Where are vulnerable marine systems (VMEs) likely to occur?; 2) What is {{the likelihood of}} fisheries interaction with these VMEs?; and 3) What might qualify as adequate conservation and management measures to prevent significant adverse impacts? This paper develops an approach to answering these questions for bottom trawling activities in the Convention Area of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (<b>SPRFMO)</b> within a quantitative risk assessment and cost : benefit analysis framework. The predicted distribution of deep-sea corals from habitat suitability models is used to answer the first question. Distribution of historical bottom trawl effort is used to answer the second, with estimates of seabed areas swept by bottom trawlers being used to develop discounting factors for reduced biodiversity in previously fished areas. These are used in a quantitative ecological risk assessment approach to guide spatial protection planning to address the third question. The coral VME likelihood (average, discounted, predicted coral habitat suitability) of existing spatial closures implemented by New Zealand within the <b>SPRFMO</b> area is evaluated. Historical catch {{is used as a}} measure of cost to industry in a cost : benefit analysis of alternative spatial closure scenarios. Results indicate that current closures within the New Zealand <b>SPRFMO</b> area bottom trawl footprint are suboptimal for protection of VMEs. Examples of alternative trawl closure scenarios are provided to illustrate how the approach could be used to optimise protection of VMEs under chosen management objectives, balancing protection of VMEs against economic loss to commercial fishers from closure of historically fished areas...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations General Assembly {{resolution}} 61 / 105 {{calls for}} States to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), including cold water corals, from destructive fishing practices in international waters. In response, the developing South Pacific Regional Fishery Management Organization (<b>SPRFMO)</b> adopted interim measures requiring Participating States {{to assess whether}} individual bottom fishing activities encounter VMEs, and to prevent significant adverse impacts to VMEs, including requiring vessels to cease fishing and move away from such areas. Criteria were developed to identify VMEs from trawl fishery bycatch data and other available scientific information. The criteria integrate information about the vulnerable taxa present, their relative abundance as bycatch, evidence from previous fishery interactions in the area, the degree of habitat isolation, and an index of taxonomic distinctness. We also analysed observer data from previous fishing by New Zealand vessels {{to evaluate the use}} of bycatch thresholds to trigger a move-on rule in the <b>SPRFMO</b> Area. A focus on documenting the distribution of vulnerable taxa and habitat associations through the most robust survey and habitat modelling means feasible will facilitate identifying representative spatial closures for long-term protection of VMEs...|$|E
40|$|Vulnerable marine {{ecosystems}} (VMEs) are ecosystems at {{risk from}} the effects of fishing or other kinds of disturbance, as determined by the vulnerability of their components (e. g., habitats, communities, or species). Habitat suitability modeling is being used increasingly to predict distribution patterns of VME indicator taxa in the deep sea, where data are particularly sparse, and the models are considered useful for marine ecosystem management. The Louisville Seamount Chain is located within the South Pacific Regional Fishery Management Organization (<b>SPRFMO)</b> Convention Area, and some seamounts are the subject of bottom trawling for orange roughy by the New Zealand fishery. The aim {{of the present study was}} to produce high-resolution habitat suitability maps for VME indicator taxa and VME habitat on these seamounts, in order to evaluate the feasibility of designing within-seamount spatial closures to protect VMEs. We used a multi-model habitat suitability mapping approach, based on bathymetric and backscatter data collected by multibeam echo sounder survey, and data collected by towed underwater camera for the stony coral and habitat-forming VME indicator species Solenosmilia variabilis, as well as two taxa indicative of stony coral habitat (Brisingida, Crinoidea). Model performance varied among the different model types used (Boosted Regression Tree, Random Forest, Generalized Additive Models), but abundance-based models consistently out-performed models based on presence-absence data. Uncertainty for ensemble models (combination of all models) was lower overall compared to the other models. Maps resulting from our models showed that suitable habitat for S. variabilis is distributed around the summit-slope break of seamounts, and along ridges that extend down the seamount flanks. Only the flat, soft sediment summits are predicted to be unsuitable habitat for this stony coral species. We translated a definition for stony coral-reef habitat into a S. variabilis abundance-based threshold in order to use our models to map this VME habitat. These maps showed that coral-reef occurred in small and isolated patches, and that most of the seabed on these seamounts is predicted to be unsuitable habitat for this VME. We discuss the implications of these results for spatial management closures on the Louisville Seamount Chain seamounts and the wider <b>SPRFMO</b> area, and future modeling improvements that could aid efforts to use habitat suitability maps for managing the impact of fishing on VMEs...|$|E
40|$|The Working Group on Fisheries Acoustic Science and Technology (WGFAST) met in Nantes, France, on 29 May 2015. Verena Trenkel, France, {{served as}} Chair. There were 43 {{participants}} who discussed {{the report from}} the linked Working Group on Target Classification (WGTC), the needs created by {{the increasing use of}} wideband acoustics and resulting potential future activities for WGFAST, the contribution to the South Pacific regional management organization (<b>SPRFMO)</b> initiative on calibrating echosounders on fishing vessels, the organization of an ICES training course on how to run an acoustic survey and other initiatives. The working group meeting followed the ICES Symposium on “Marine Ecosystem Acoustics – observing the ocean interior across scales in support of integrated management”, which attracted 214 participants from 31 countries. During the symposium 94 talks including three key note talks and 87 posters were presented on i) recent developments in acoustic sensor and platform technologies, ii) acoustic characterization of aquatic organisms, ecosystem structure, and ecosystem processes and iii) the contribution of acoustics to integrated ecosystem assessments and management. The presentations were followed by lively debates...|$|E
40|$|The {{study on}} Hydrography and Jack Mackerel stock (Trachurus murphyi) in the South Pacific is {{currently}} one year underway. The main achievement consisted of collecting detailed datasets on Chilean, Peruvian and European fisheries activities {{and information on}} the hydrographical / biochemical and environmental conditions present in the South Pacific. The hydrographical and environmental datasets {{are based on the}} analyses of available acoustic information collected on-board survey and fishing vessels and satellite imagery data. Jack Mackerel habitat models are being developed based on these datasets. These models will be used to produce maps of the potential habitat of Jack Mackerel, on the basis of which different stock structure hypotheses will be tested. The models developed so far are able to accurately represent the distribution of Jack Mackerel as observed by fishing and surveying activities, although some additional investigations are needed to improve the statistical fits. Good fits with hydrographical conditions have been found. The models are not yet ready to be used for testing stock structure hypotheses, but this should be the case in the near future. During {{the first year of the}} project, an extensive literature review on Jack Mackerel has also been conducted, and a synthesis has been written, giving an overview on the species biology, ecology and stock structure. The literature suggests that a meta-population structure can be seen as a potential stock structure hypothesis. The literature review also contributed to identify environmental variables that should be crucial to define the suitable habitat of Jack Mackerel. Previously published results indicate, among others, temperature and dissolved oxygen ranges in which Jack Mackerel is able to survive. Finally, a framework to derive reference points for Jack Mackerel, assuming the single stock structure as used within the <b>SPRFMO</b> assessment, has been developed and made available to the <b>SPRFMO</b> Science Committee for review. Analyses of the assessment results within this framework indicate that the fishing mortality corresponding to maximum sustainable yield might be at around 0. 15 per year with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of around 10 million tonnes. Different harvest control rules have been evaluated and show little risk to overexploitation in the medium and long term, although these result heavily rely on strong incoming year classes. The tools to evaluate sustainable management options for the Jack Mackerel population, when a stock structure other than a single one is assumed, are currently under development. The design of scenarios to be tested depend on the results of the habitat modelling exercises. Therefore, preliminary results will only become available early 2014...|$|E
40|$|The {{criteria}} {{adopted by}} the SEAFO Commission {{for the establishment of}} a fishing footprint, “if an area has been fished in two consecutive years during the period 1987 - 2007 ”, is considered not a good starting point for any rigorous analysis of the historical spatial effort in the region because of losing valuable data and the difficulties on its application. Spanish data consisting in 1191 records of haul by haul (August 1996 - November 2006) were analyzed using a protocol developed by New Zealand at <b>SPRFMO</b> to study trawl footprints in this region. The use of 20 ’x 20 ’ blocks method clearly overestimate the footprint. Thus, 10 ’ gridding fits better fishing footprint area. However, at any case more than one point (e. g., midpoint) has to be used to define a set/haul position. Longlining is the fishing activity more widely spread out with 144 blocks (8. 79 %) of which 67 % “lightly fished”; and 33 % “moderately fished”. However, bottom trawl tend to concentrate its activity in small areas as Valdivia Bank and the North-East of the Walvis Ridge, with 5 “heavily fished” blocks (0. 31 %). A general vision of current and recent past situation of fisheries in the SEAFO region was also mad...|$|E

40|$|The {{conservation}} and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) {{is a global}} challenge. The loss of marine biodiversity {{has been attributed to}} intensifying human activities on and in the oceans, and the nonparticipation in and non-compliance by States with international and regional fisheries instruments. The special legal status of the high seas as a global commons also contributes to the difficulties in achieving the {{conservation and}} sustainable use of marine biodiversity in ABNJ. With no legal instruments adequately addressing the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in ABNJ, there is a pressing need to find ways to address obstacles to marine biodiversity conservation in ABNJ. The strengthening of the legal and institutional framework at the regional level provides such an option. This thesis examines the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in the high seas from a fisheries-threat perspective, focusing on the ecologically important and productive Southeast Pacific region. Regional cooperation, mainly across sectors, is a key requirement for successful high seas management and the conservation and sustainable use of high seas biodiversity. Regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) are key players in this endeavour as they provide a platform for States to cooperate regionally and develop management principles and procedures. The Southeast Pacific encompasses an area of 30. 02 million km 2 extending from northern Colombia to southern Chile and is the second most productive fisheries region in the world. This thesis examines the adequacy of the regional legal and institutional framework of the Southeast Pacific to address the conservation of high seas biodiversity. In a first step, it critically assesses the level of interaction and cooperation between the three regional fisheries organisations in the region: Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (<b>SPRFMO)</b> and Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (CPPS; Permanent Commission for the South Pacific). It then analyses {{the extent to which these}} regional fisheries organisations have incorporated global legal provisions and measures pertinent to the conservation of high seas biodiversity into their conventions and implemented them. This is the first study of its kind with a focus on RFMO governance from a high seas biodiversity conservation perspective. It is also the first comprehensive regional study focusing on evaluating institutional interplay management, cooperation between RFMOs and regional seas organisations (RSOs) and the incorporation of biodiversity obligations in RFMOs within one region. This thesis concludes that, although this region has several opportunities to strengthen the conservation and sustainable use of high seas biodiversity, it still has to overcome a range of institutional, cooperative and management challenges. It proposes options to improve the conservation and sustainable use of high seas biodiversity in the Southeast Pacific, ranging from legal, scientific and institutional cooperative mechanisms to the strengthening of conservation and management and compliance and enforcement measures...|$|E
