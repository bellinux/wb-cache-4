50|$|The TACR2 {{was built}} on the Carmichael Commando chassis. This is a 775mm (30.5inch) six-wheeled rear {{extension}} of the classic Range Rover. It uses the Range Rover drivetrain, with the two leading axles (front axle and original rear axle) powered through the Range Rover permanent four wheel drive transfer case. The new rear axle is an unpowered trailer, using similar coil spring suspension. The chassis was converted by Carmichael from a standard Range Rover chassis supplied by Land Rover {{in the form of a}} drivable chassis cab, therefore most components were standard Range Rover. Some TACR2s have been converted to six wheel drive. This is usually achieved by welding an input cone mounting flange to the rear of the middle axle in place of the diff pan, attaching a second, rearward facing 'input' cone (as an output cone), linked by a <b>short</b> <b>prop</b> to the input cone of the rear axle, this and the diff and diff pan need to be turned over (so the crown wheel is on the opposite side to the middle axle's crown wheel) to maintain correct rotation. This should be used in conjunction with free wheeling hubs to prevent diff wind-up when driving on-road or tarmac.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half inches thick, bisects {{a corner of the room}} and is prevented from falling by a <b>short</b> cylindrical <b>prop</b> wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Let F be a {{field of}} {{characteristic}} `> 0 and let G be a finite group. It is well-known that the dimension of the minimal projective cover ΦG 1 (the so-called 1 -PIM) of the trivial left F[G]-module is a multiple of the `-part |G| ` of the order ofG. In this note we study finite groups G satisfying dimF(ΦG 1) = |G|`. In particular, we classify the non-abelian finite simple groups G and primes ` satisfying this identity (Thm. A). As a consequence we show that finite soluble groups are precisely those finite groups which satisfy this identity for all prime numbers ` (Cor. B). Another consequence {{is the fact that}} the validity of this identity for a finite group G and for a small prime number ` ∈ { 2, 3, 5 } implies the existence of an `′-Hall subgroup for G (Thm. C). An important tool in our proofs is the super-multiplicativity of the dimension of the 1 -PIM over <b>short</b> exact sequences (<b>Prop.</b> 2. 2). 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} which uses "networks" (directed acyclic graphs with some extra structure) as a formalism for expressions in multilinear algebra. It is shown that this formalism is valid for arbitrary <b>PROPs</b> (<b>short</b> for 'PROducts and Permutations category'), and conversely that the PROP axioms are {{implicit in the}} concept of evaluating a network. Ordinary terms and operads constitute the special case that the graph underlying the network is a rooted tree. Furthermore a rewriting theory for networks is developed. Included in this is a subexpression concept for which is given both algebraic and effective graph-theoretical characterisations, a construction of reduction maps from rewriting systems, and an analysis of the obstructions to confluence that can occur. Several Diamond Lemmas for this rewriting theory are given. In addition there is much supporting material on various related subjects. In particular there is a "toolbox" for the construction of custom orders on the free PROP, so that an order can be tailored to suit a specific rewriting system. Other subjects treated are the abstract index notation in a general PROP context and the use of feedbacks (sometimes called traces) in PROPs.
