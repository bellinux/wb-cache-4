30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} the algorithm associated with the proposed distributed solution for the problem of parameter coordination. The sum-product algorithm [5] can be applied whenever the variables and functions associated with the factor graph are defined on a commutative <b>semi-ring</b> whose elements satisfy the distributive law. For our problem at hand, we apply the variant of sum-product algorithm {{that is based on}} the min-sum commutative <b>semi-ring</b> [12]. Recall that a <b>semi-ring</b> is a mathematical structure (e.g., a set) equivalent to a ring without an additive inverse. In a general way, the binary operations addition and multiplication can be replaced with others as long as the distributed law still holds. In this sense, a min-sum <b>semi-ring</b> simply replaces the addition operation with the minimum operation and the multiplication operation with the addition operation. In this case, the sum-product algorithm is also called the min-sum algorithm.|$|R

We show that all these systems can be interpreted in the relational category (Rel) of sets and relations. This is possible because of the notion of multiplicity <b>semi-ring</b> and allowing a great variety of exponential comonads in Rel. The interpretation of a particular typing system corresponds then to give a suitable notion of stratification of the exponential comonad associated with the <b>semi-ring</b> parametrising the exponential modality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{observed}} that the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) transformation based on min-plus algebra (or called Tropical <b>Semi-Rings)</b> leads to a very good characteristic in zero underestimating the reconstructed matrix. This paper introduces a novel distributed control framework for shared protection in optical networks with reduced routing information based on the Tropical <b>Semi-Rings</b> technique, called Sharing with Reduced Information with Tropical <b>Semi-Rings</b> (SRI-TROP). The design of the proposed framework aims to initiate a compromise {{between the amount of}} link-state dissemination and the performance impairment due to the incompleteness of routing information, such that the precision in the link-state matrix reconstruction can efficiently map to the reduction in blocking probability. Based on the framework, a series of novel schemes are proposed, which are verified and compared with the reported counterparts in a simulation. The simulation results show that the performance in terms of the precision in the reconstructed link-state and the resultant blocking probability can be significantly improved. ...|$|E

The measurements show that the amplitude and character of the oscillations are independent of the relation between the measuring current and the amplitude of the persistent current. By using asymmetric rings, it is demonstrated that the persistent current has clockwise or contra-clockwise direction. This means that the total current in one of the <b>semi-rings</b> may be directed against the electric field at measurement of the Little-Parks oscillations. The measurements at zero and low measuring current have revealed that the persistent current, like the conventional circulating current, causes a potential difference on the <b>semi-rings</b> with different cross sections in spite of the absence of the Faraday's voltage.

40|$|We discuss, {{compare and}} relate some old {{and some new}} models for {{incomplete}} and probabilistic databases. We characterize the expressive power of c-tables over infinite domains and we introduce {{a new kind of}} result, algebraic completion, for studying less expressive models. By viewing probabilistic models as incompleteness models with additional probability information, we define completeness and closure under query languages of general probabilistic database models and we introduce a new such model, probabilistic c-tables, that is shown to be complete and closed under the relational algebra. We also identify fundamental connections between query answering with incomplete and probabilistic databases and data provenance. We show that the calculations for incomplete databases, probabilistic databases, bag semantics, lineage, and why-provenance are particular cases of the same general algorithms involving <b>semi-rings.</b> This further suggests a comprehensive provenance representation that uses <b>semi-rings</b> of polynomials. Finally, we show that for positive Boolean c-tables, containment of positive relational queries is the same as for standard set semantics. ...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{access to}} {{resources}} needs to be regulated or informed by considerations such as risk, cost, and reputation. We therefore propose a framework for policy languages, based on <b>semi-rings,</b> that aggregate quantitative evidence to support decision-making in access control systems. As aggregation operators “addition”, “worst case”, and “best case ” over non-negative reals are both relevant in practice and amenable to analysis, we study an instance, Peal, of our framework in that setting. Peal is a stand-alone policy language but can also be integrated with existing policy languages. Peal policies can be synthesized into logical formulae that no longer make reference to quantities but capture all policy behavior. Satisfiability checking of such formulae {{can be used to}} validate and analyze policies in this new evidence-based approach. We discuss a number of applications, including vacuity, redundancy, change-impact and safety analysis. The synthesis algorithm requires a form of subset enumeration, for which we develop bespoke algorithms and demonstrate experimentally that our algorithms work better than generic state exploration methods.
