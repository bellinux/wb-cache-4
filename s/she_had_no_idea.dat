25|$|Becky Sharp says {{farewell}} to the Sedley family and enters {{the service of the}} crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, who has engaged her as a governess to his daughters. Her behaviour at Sir Pitt's house gains his favour, and after the premature death of his second wife, he proposes marriage to her. However he finds that she has secretly married his second son, Captain Rawdon Crawley. (Becky very much regrets having done that; however, when she married Rawdon <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that his father's wife would die so soon after). Sir Pitt's elder half sister, the spinster Miss Crawley, is very rich, having inherited her mother's fortune, and the whole Crawley family compete for her favour so she will bequeath them her wealth. Initially her favourite is Rawdon Crawley. But his marriage with Becky enrages her. First she favours the family of Sir Pitt's brother, but when she dies, she has left her money to Sir Pitt's oldest son, also called Pitt.|$|E
500|$|The moment Turner {{was told}} Stacey was {{the killer was}} filmed for a live {{reaction}} show broadcast immediately after [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] on BBC Three, {{though it was not}} broadcast. [...] was presented by Lamb's son George and included other behind-the-scenes material. Turner received a call to see Santer about 20 minutes before the broadcast, where she was told that Stacey was the killer. She explained that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> her character was the murderer, even after receiving the call. She hoped viewers would sympathise with the character as she not only has to deal with the guilt of killing Archie but was also inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. Wood was also told as he supported Turner in the final scene in which she was revealed as the killer. Santer also brought in Maslen and McDermott as decoys in case other cast and crew members realised. Following the live episode, a two-hander episode featuring Max and Stacey was announced. The episode, broadcast on 26 March 2010, explains how and why Stacey killed Archie.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E
500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what the hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{to appear}} more frequently, Dotty became a {{recurring}} character. Santer told Digital Spy in May 2009 that Dotty's storyline would go [...] "to a very, very dark place!" [...] He {{questioned whether the}} character was born bad or if her father had made her that way, and if she could be more dangerous than Nick. As the storyline between Dot, Dotty and Nick progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty was colluding with her father all along. The plot climaxed in June 2009 and marked Altman's departure from the show for the fourth time. Dotty later left on 23 February 2010.|$|E

500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who tell you that they are your family. But you feel nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|She Wolf is {{primarily}} an electropop album that combines influences from the musical styles of various countries and regions, like Africa, Colombia, India, and the Middle East. Shakira termed the album a [...] "sonic experimental trip", {{and said that}} she researched folk music from different countries in order to [...] "combine electronics with world sounds, tambourines, clarinets, Indian classical music, dancehall, etc." [...] The title track {{is an example of the}} electronic music styled production of the album, and is composed of 70s disco guitars and [...] "heaps of robot effects". [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a midtempo electropop song that contains elements of samba.

Tracks like [...] "Long Time" [...] and [...] "Good Stuff" [...] display dancehall, electronica and Latin elements. Critics found the 1980s-stylised electropop track [...] "Men in This Town" [...] similar to the work of American band No Doubt. The Wyclef Jean collaboration [...] "Spy" [...] is a bouncy disco and R song that is described as sultry and playful. Elements of rock music are also present on the album, mostly evident on the [...] "noisy" [...] stadium rock song [...] "Mon Amour". The US bonus track [...] "Give It Up to Me" [...] mixes pop and hip hop music with a playful rap by Lil Wayne. As Shakira wanted to make sure the [...] "kicks hit really hard", the tracks on She Wolf were made [...] "very bass-driven". She revealed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how the album would sound like at the end, describing it to be like [...] "standing in front of a white canvas", but admitted that she knew she wanted to make an electronica influenced album from the beginning.|$|E

The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event. Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> [...] "it was going to become such a big deal". This dress was the main reason that the chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt said they invented a way to search for images, creating Google Images.

2500|$|Five years later, on {{the night}} of November 27, 1989, and {{a few weeks before the}} Romanian Revolution, which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> was about to happen, Comăneci {{defected}} with a group of other Romanians. They were all guided by Constantin Panait, a Romanian who was now an American citizen after defecting, and whom Comăneci had met at a party given by one of her friends. In the years since Béla Károlyi's defection to the United States, she had changed her mind on the subject and met a number of Romanians at the party who talked about it. Comăneci notes in her memoir that her first impression of Panait was a positive one as [...] "he seemed nice, and he was believable because he was now an American." [...] Later after meeting Panait, her brother Adrian told her, [...] "Constantin was the real deal. He wasn't bluffing. There were six other Romanians who planned to trust him with their lives."

I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.'

I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> I would actually do it.

2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry.

2500|$|Although {{suspicious}} {{to begin}} with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick {{really was a}} reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: [...] "Nick's back, he's got a cute little daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?" [...] As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source reportedly told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty (real name Kirsty) was colluding with her father all along. In the storyline, Dotty suggested killing Dot for her life assurance policy. Nick leaves following this, allowing Dotty to work on Dot and he returns three months later where they begin their plan to convince Dot and her friends that she is suffering with dementia; Nick's aim being to kill Dot and blame her death on her deteriorating mental state. During Nick's brief stay in the square, he overheard Billy Mitchell telling Dot how he let Jase Dyer die and Nick blackmailed Billy by demanding regular payments or he would tell Jase's son Jay what Billy did. When Billy's cousin, Phil, found out about this, he led Nick into the barrel store of The Queen Vic, where he beats him up and ties him to a chair. Phil gave Billy the opportunity to scare Nick off and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the café and an accidental fire is started after Heather Trott pushes Nick into the chip pan. The hostages manage to escape due to a fight between Nick and Ryan Malloy, {{who was one of the}} hostages. This results in an explosion at the café with Nick and Bradley Branning inside. The storyline marked Altman's departure from the show once again. His departing episode was scripted as a cliffhanger, as it was not revealed whether Nick had survived the explosion at the end of the episode. However, in the following episode, on 4 June 2009, Nick is shown to survive the explosion and Bradley is hospitalised with injuries to his eye. Nick departs after once again being disowned by Dot. Dotty is left in Dot's care despite Nick explaining to his mother that Dotty is evil.|$|E
