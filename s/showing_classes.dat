40|$|Objective. Oral exfoliative {{cytology}} (OEC) {{has been}} {{implemented in the}} diagnosis of pathologic lesions for ages. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the cytomorphological features {{of some of the}} commonest potentially malignant disorders (leukoplakia, lichen planus, and oral submucous fibrosis) through a simple procedure and illustrate its importance in mass screening. Materials and Method. A total of 160 subjects with 25 â€“ 50 years of age were included in the study. Among them, 40 were clinically diagnosed with oral leukoplakia, 40 were diagnosed with oral lichen planus, 40 were diagnosed with oral submucous fibrosis, and 40 were in the control group. The prepared smears were subjected to Papanicolaou stain and analyzed microscopically for the evaluation of the cytomorphological features. Results and Discussion. When analyzed microscopically, 36 (90 %) out of the 40 oral leukoplakic lesions <b>showed</b> <b>Class</b> II cytological features whereas 4 (10 %) revealed Class I features. Among 40 patients with oral lichen planus, 26 (65 %) <b>showed</b> <b>Class</b> II features while the remaining 14 (35 %) revealed Class I features. In 40 subjects with oral submucous fibrosis, 32 (80 %) <b>showed</b> <b>Class</b> II features while the other 8 (20 %) <b>showed</b> <b>Class</b> I features. All the 40 control subjects <b>showed</b> <b>Class</b> I features. Thus, OEC can be widely advocated as an addition to clinical conclusion and an adjunct to biopsy...|$|R
