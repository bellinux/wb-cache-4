5|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} that Robert Hamilton, an archaeologist who worked on the Temple Mount after the 1927 Jericho earthquake, had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations. These included a mosaic like those used in Byzantine churches, and a Jewish mikveh from the <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{after the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and {{developed}} into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew continued {{to be used as}} a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval Hebrew, and Hebrew began a revival process in the 19th century, culminating in Modern Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel. Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel, and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E
5000|$|Naburiya was a Jewish {{village in}} the Galilee during the First and <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>periods.</b> Neburaya is {{believed}} to be identical with Nabratein, a location north of Safed where Eleazar of Modi'im and Jacob of Kfar Neburaya, a compiler of the Haggadah, are buried.|$|R
50|$|During the First <b>Temple</b> and <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>periods,</b> the burnt {{offering}} was a twice-daily animal sacrifice {{offered on}} the altar in the temple in Jerusalem that was completely consumed by fire.

25|$|Historians {{have argued}} over whether Karaism {{has a direct}} {{connection}} to anti-Rabbinic sects and views, {{such as those of}} the Sadducees, dating back {{to the end of the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> (70CE), or whether Karaism represents a novel emergence of similar views. Karaites have always maintained that, while there are some similarities to the Sadducees, due to the rejection of Rabbinical authority and the Oral Law, there are major differences. The ancestors of the Karaites were a group called Benei Ṣedeq during the <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Qalunya is {{identified}} with the Canaanite town of Mozah (Joshua 18:26), its name was found stamped on pottery handles in Tall al-Nasba. during First and <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>periods</b> Mozah was a Jewish village known for its willows that were used at the Temple of Jerusalem, the village was destroyed in the First Jewish-Roman War. After A.D. 71 Vespasian settled 800 Roman soldiers in the town, which became a Roman settlement known as Colonia Amosa or Colonia Emmaus.|$|R

25|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> is less certain. One scholar has noted {{that there are no}} laws from <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> sources that indicate any doubts about the length of a month or of a year. This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them to know in advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.|$|E

40|$|The thesis by William H. Jones {{examines}} the dual rituals of tevilah (Jewish ritual washing) and Christian baptism, especially {{in relation to}} the New Testament and <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>periods.</b> The extent of Jewish ritual washing is apparent in the excavations at the Ophel since 1967 with the unearthing of numerous cisterns and mikve 'ot, the immersion vats used in traditional Judaism at that time as a preparation for entrance to the Temple. It also notes variances in the use of mikve'ot at Qumran among the sect living there and at Masada, the final retreat for some of the sect members. Many observant Jews continue to use mikve 'ot today as a purification ritual. Christian baptism developed in this same time period, introduced by John the Baptist as a proclamation of the arrival of the kingdom of God and as a means of introducing the atoning and eschatological work of Jesus. Jewish ritual washing provides both a backdrop and an analogy for Christian baptism, since it uses the same immersion procedure and some of the same language, i. e., "born anew, " and "change of status. " The differences, however, such as no "agent " in tevilah but clearly an "agent " in Christian baptism suggest that baptism is not an evolution from tevilah but a revolution. Tevilah is self-immersion; baptism requires a baptizer, a clear understanding that the one being baptized cannot cleanse him/herself but relies on the mediator Jesus Christ. Christian baptism implies a believer's identification in the Holy Spirit with the death and resurrection of Jesus. Moreover, it points to the eschatological hope of the completion of the kingdom of God which has come and is coming...|$|R

40|$|Until {{the last}} few decades of the twentieth century, {{research}} on Judaism and astronomy and related celestial sciences tended to emphasize the medieval and <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>periods.</b> To date, with the exception of analyses of the Jewish calendar and its development, few studies in the history of science have focused upon the rabbinic period, although a growing number of scholars, including Annette Yoshiko Reed, Noah Efron, and Menachem Fisch, have begun to address this gap. The emerging sub-field of the history of rabbinic science ca. 70 - 750 C. E., spans the fields of both Jewish studies and the history of science. This dissertation represents an original contribution to knowledge, demonstrating both the richness of celestial discourse in the Babylonian Talmud and the nuanced play of differing typologies of rabbinic authority articulated by Avi Sagi, Michael S. Berger, and other scholars, particularly epistemic and deontic authority. These are shown to interact strongly with rabbinic discourses addressing the overlapping celestial concerns of astronomy, astrology, astral magic, astrolatry, and cosmogony. By examining these astronomical topics together in a study of this kind for the first time, I demonstrate a recurrent pattern of tight rabbinic controls over the celestial sciences preserved in the Babylonian Talmud. This is of importance to the trajectory of Jewish scientific thought due to the enduring centrality of the Bavli. I also underscore an idealized portrayal of rabbinic legal deontic authority over these sciences, and a focus upon shows of honour and prestige associated with the rabbinic station itself in the Bavli. Further, I highlight the ways in which these preserved talmudic portrayals also serve to illuminate the self-presentation of the rabbis as inheritors of the interpretive and legislative powers bequeathed to them by God, the cosmic lawgiver, at the time of creation and at the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai...|$|R
