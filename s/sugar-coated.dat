5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as <b>sugar-coated</b> comfits.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 1876, Colonel Lilly founded his own {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturing business, which {{became known as}} Eli Lilly and Company, at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis. Josiah, who was aged fourteen {{at the time was}} among its first employees. He had quit school to work in the laboratory of his father's company as an apprentice and errand boy. Within a few years Eli Lilly and Company became a very successful business that was known for manufacturing high-quality prescription drugs, especially gelatin- and <b>sugar-coated</b> pills and capsules and fruit-flavored elixirs. By 1879 company sales had grown to $48,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).|$|E

Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a <b>sugar-coated</b> version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States.

'Yes, I am a book about the environment. But I'm harmless! No, really!'" [...] The Canadian version, designed by Ellen Cipriano, is similar to the American version but with a photo illustration rather than the disarming cartoon illustration. Cover art for the international releases contrast the natural environment with a decaying built environment. Adam Grupper voiced the ten-hour-long, unabridged English language audiobook which was published by Macmillan Audio and BBC Audiobooks, and released simultaneously with the hardcover book. AudioFile gave the audio presentation its Earphones Award, called Grupper's reading sincere and balanced, and wrote, [...] "Never veering into sensationalism, always objective and phlegmatic, Grupper takes what could be a depressing topic and makes it a book you just can't stop listening to".|$|E
500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that <b>sugar-coated</b> some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Many reviews found the game avoided some of Aerosmith's [...] "more popular <b>sugar-coated</b> hits...like 'Amazing', 'Crazy', or 'I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing'", but felt that other major Aerosmith songs could {{have also been}} included. Game Informer noted that [...] "creating a band specific game was smart", but that [...] "very little has changed from the base game". They also complimented the great job that Activision did with their motion captures of Aerosmith. The difficulty of the game {{was not to be}} found as hard as Guitar Hero III due to the [...] "very riff-friendly guitarist" [...] Joe Perry; while reviewers felt this was a good correction from the previous game, they also noted that the easiness of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith led to some bland tiers, repetitive musical sections, and lack of any significant difficulty curve. The length of the game was poorly received, with reviewers commenting {{that it is difficult to}} justify the title priced equivalently as other next-generation console full games. Eurogamer commented that one's appreciation for the game [...] "lives or dies based on [...] fondness for Aerosmith", and that ultimately, with other available music games that offer additional downloadable songs, a game that focuses on a single band would need [...] "to offer gameplay innovations, spectacular fan service, or a lot more material" [...] than what Guitar Hero: Aerosmith provides. Reviews also noted the sparseness of downloadable content.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Wilkening, {{writing for}} Taste of Country, gave the song {{a score of}} 7.5 out of 10, writing that the song is [...] "surprisingly serious and dour" [...] in {{contrast}} to its subject matter, but he praised the [...] "catchy melody". It also received 3.5 stars out of five from John Hill of About.com, who found it [...] "lyrically lacking" [...] but a [...] "solid contribution to the power ballad genre". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine found the song to be repetitive in its lyrical theme, {{and said that the}} group was [...] "sticking to the blandly pleasant, cliché-driven songwriting of Need You Now, not taking a single risk." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger criticized the song for bearing a close resemblance to [...] "Need You Now" [...] and concluded that [...] "if you swooned for 'Need You Now', chances are you won't be able to resist the tidal pull of this one, either." [...] Shahryar Rizvi of Dallas Observer was also less enthusiastic about the song, writing that it [...] "seems kinda old-fashioned amongst all the outspoken and steamy acts in the Top 40." [...] Rizvi concluded by noting that [...] "maybe the music industry's just covering their bases by serving the demographic that appreciates <b>sugar-coated</b> love ballads over brash statements ... If not, well, then [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] will probably appear in sappy, modest teenage romantic comedies. If those types of movies still exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scientists have {{recently}} discovered that pigs can exhibit a cognitive bias and are optimists or pessimists, similar to humans. In {{a study by}} the University of Lincoln, 36 pigs were tested. They were placed in a room with two food bowls {{at each end of the}} room. One food bowl contained <b>sugar-coated</b> chocolate sweets and the other contained coffee beans. Optimistic pigs were likely to check if there was a third bowl filled with sweets. However pessimistic pigs would not even bother checking if the bowl was filled with sweets or not. It was said that [...] "Pro-active pigs were willing to see whether there was a positive outcome in the mystery bowl". The study shows that non-human animals can share similar traits with humans.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{development of new}} medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It {{was among the first}} manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage. Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others. A 1917 Scientific American article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was [...] "the largest capsule factory in the world" [...] and was [...] "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day". One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and <b>sugar-coated</b> pills to make their medicines easier to swallow. Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.|$|E
2500|$|One of John Smith's main {{incentives}} {{in writing}} about his New World experiences and observances was to promote the colonization of the New World by England. Many promotional writers <b>sugar-coated</b> their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but Smith {{was not one to}} exaggerate the facts. He was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that what was truly abundant within America was monetary opportunity in the form of industry.< Smith was realistic about his proposition for colonization and the benefits that it could yield. He recognized that no [...] "other motive [...] wealth…would draw [...] from their ease and humours at home". [...] "Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading".< ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2007, Petraeus {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that there were [...] "astonishing signs of normalcy" [...] in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that [...] "many problems remain" [...] and he noted the need to help the Iraqis [...] "stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence" [...] in late 2006. Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward. These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach. [...] "Indeed, Petraeus's realistic approach and assessments were lauded during the McLaughlin Group's 2008 Year-End Awards, when Monica Crowley nominated Petraeus for the most honest person of the year, stating, [...] "... e spoke about the great successes of the surge in Iraq, but he always tempered it, never <b>sugar-coated</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film had {{its opening}} premiere on March 2, 1965 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's [...] "romantic {{nonsense}} and sentiment", the children's [...] "artificial roles", and Robert Wise's [...] "cosy-cum-corny" [...] direction. Judith Crist, in a biting {{review in the}} New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as [...] "icky sticky" [...] and designed for [...] "the five to seven set and their mommies". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film [...] "the <b>sugar-coated</b> lie people {{seem to want to}} eat", and that audiences have [...] "turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs". [...] Wise later recalled, [...] "The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews." [...] Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as [...] "three hours of visual and vocal brilliance", and Daily Variety called it [...] "a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast". The [...] "wildly mixed film reviews" [...] reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country, and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years.|$|E

60|$|A {{few words}} told the story, and {{in five minutes}} she was sitting snugly tucked up {{watching}} an unpleasant mass of lobsters flap about dangerously near her toes, while the boat bounded over the waves with a delightful motion, and every instant brought her nearer home. She did not say much, but felt a good deal; and when they met two boats coming to meet her, manned by very anxious crews of men and boys, she was so pale and quiet that Jack was quite bowed down with remorse, and Frank nearly pitched the bicycle boy overboard because he gayly asked Jill how she left her friends in England. There was great rejoicing over her, for {{the people on the}} rocks had heard of her loss, and ran about like ants when their hill is disturbed. Of course half a dozen amiable souls posted off to the Willows to tell the family that the little girl was drowned, so that when the rescuers appeared quite a crowd was assembled on the beach to welcome her.

6000|$|Of {{course there}} came a time, at last, when Stephen could no longer borrow of his ancient creditors; so he was obliged to lie in wait for new men {{who did not know}} him. Such a victim was good-hearted, simple natured young Yates (I use a fictitious name, but the real name began, as this one does, with a Y). Young Yates {{graduated}} as a pilot, got a berth, and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk's office and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills, Stephen was there! His silvery tongue began to wag, and in a very little while Yates's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands. The fact was soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement and satisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous. But innocent Yates never suspected that Stephen's promise to pay promptly {{at the end of the}} week was a worthless one. Yates called for his money at the stipulated time; Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week. He called then, according to agreement, and came away <b>sugar-coated</b> again, but suffering under another postponement. So the thing went on. Yates haunted Stephen week after week, to no purpose, and at last gave it up. And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates appeared, there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there, but beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to pay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw him coming, he would turn and fly, and drag his company with him, if he had company; but it was of no use; his debtor would run him down and corner him.
