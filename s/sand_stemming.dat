5000|$|The Western Australian coastline, {{along with}} its islands, is over 20,000 km long. These {{tropical}} to temperate waters extend from latitudes 32-34°S to 12°S. The great diversity of habitat in these coastal regions of Western Australia are occupied by seagrasses, frequently 'engineering' habitat through colonisation of shallow ocean floors. These plants possess rhizomes which extend under the <b>sand,</b> <b>stems</b> emerge from these with one, or many, flattened and elongated leaves. These features allow the plants to stabilise the substrate, anchor themselves against currents, and change the environment. [...] A colony may have one or several species of seagrass, {{and a large number}} of other species living within it. The area covered by seagrass in Western Australian waters is equivalent to Australia's rainforest.|$|R
50|$|The rhizome type stems {{are found}} in two forms: one growing up to 150 cm beneath the sand and the other rising above the <b>sand.</b> All <b>stems</b> are {{approximately}} 10 mm thick and upright in habit. This arrangement of the rhizomes eventually forms a mat; the surface contains the active parts of the plant, whereas the center is a dense network of roots and decomposing stems.|$|R
40|$|Nature and {{periodicity}} {{of growth}} rings were investigated in Sonneratia apetala and Heritiera fomes, two Bangladeshi mangrove species. From both species we collected three stem discs {{in the natural}} forest reserve of the Sundarbans. In addition, three discs were sampled from planta-tion-grown S. apetala trees of known age. <b>Sanded</b> <b>stem</b> discs revealed distinct growth rings but no periodic fluctuations in vessel variables (vessel density, vessel diameter, vessel grouping), which were meas-ured at high resolution along a transect from pith to bark. The number of growth rings in plantation-grown S. apetala trees corresponded with the documented tree age, hence strongly suggesting the growth rings to be annual. Within species, the annual nature of the rings was further supported by a good match between the tree-ring series. The similar mean curves of S. apetala and H. fomes, growing at the same site in the Sundarbans, pointed {{to the presence of}} an external factor influencing their growth. A combination of precipitation and temperature was suggested influencing substrate salinity and phenological events. It became evident that tree-ring research in combination with the analysis of vessel patterns is a valuable tool to further investigate the complex interactions between tree growth and site ecology in mangrove forests.

50|$|The town's name {{derives from}} the rainbow-coloured sand dunes {{surrounding}} the settlement; according to the legends of the Kabi people, the dunes were coloured when Yiningie, a spirit represented by a rainbow, plunged into the cliffs after doing battle with an evil tribesman. Much of the <b>sand</b> colors <b>stem</b> from the rich content of minerals in the sand, such as rutile, ilmenite, zircon, and monazite. A black dune of ilmenite sands, overgrown by dune vegetation can be found north west of the main town. This is currently being removed for sale in China with complete removal expected to take two years.|$|R
5000|$|Nicolletia occidentalis is a desert-adapted {{perennial}} herb with a skeletonlike appearance. The narrow, fleshy leaves {{each end}} in a bristle and have large oil glands which exude a strong unpleasant scent. The plant grows from a deep taproot in the desert <b>sand</b> and the <b>stem</b> is sometimes surrounded by a depression in the sand, a trait that gives it its common name.|$|R
50|$|Brantingham Lake covers 341 acre with eleven miles (18 km) of shoreline. The lake has {{a maximum}} depth of 70 feet, {{and an average}} depth of 30 feet in {{accordance}} with fluctuating yearly water levels. There are two islands present, Grant, or Round Island, and Dark Island, in the north, northwest region. Two distinct sand bars, each one marked by buoys and one visibly submerged <b>sand</b> bar <b>stemming</b> off of Dark Island are visible. Depending on yearly water levels, these shallow sand bars may only be covered by {{a few feet of}} water, requiring caution from boaters. The lake bottom yields little vegetation, but rather is covered by organic matter and sand, making the lake favorable for recreational use during the summer months.|$|R

40|$|Grain {{breakage}} is {{of paramount}} importance for understanding the behaviour of granular materials used in various engineering applications, such as pavements, roads, rail tracks, the oil and gas industry, and mineral processing. Changes to grain properties of a uniformly graded <b>sand</b> specimen <b>stemming</b> from breakage during compression were studied with the aid of three-dimensional Synchrotron Radiation-based Micro-Computed Tomography. The fast scanning and high-resolution 4 D imaging were utilised to capture images from the interior body of the granular assembly during loading. The fractal distribution of the sand assembly showed that breakage becomes dominant in smaller grains rather than larger ones, where an increase in the amount of newly generated fine fragments leads to high coordination number surrounding the larger grains. More importantly, the results of morphological changes in the particulate assembly revealed that there is a reversal trend in the grain morphology evolution with increasing stress. The sand grains tended to create more spherical fragments with higher aspect ratio whereas by increasing the stress this trend completely shifted...|$|R
5000|$|Kurokawa {{explains}} that the Japanese tried to exploit the natural textures and colors of materials used in a building. The traditional tea room was intentionally built of only natural materials such as earth and <b>sand,</b> paper, the <b>stems</b> and leaves of plants, and small trees. Trees from a person's own backyard were preferred for the necessary timbers. All artificial colors were avoided, and the natural colors and texture of materials were shown to their best advantage. This honesty in materials stemmed from the idea that nature is already beautiful in itself. The Japanese feel that food tastes better, wood looks better, materials are better when natural. There is a belief that maximum enjoyment comes from the natural state.|$|R

Analysis {{of this study}} showed that there are {{presence}} of crystal sand in the leaves of V. ambacensis, V. racemosa, V. subterranea and V. vexillata. In the nodes, V. gracillis and V. racemosa possess aggregate crystals and crystal sand, V. ambacensis, V. unguiculata and V. vexillata possess crystal sand while V. reticulata and V. triloba possess aggregate crystals, respectively. In the petiole anatomy, there are crystal sand in V. ambacensis, V. triloba and V. unguculata, aggregate crystals in V. gracillis and rectangular and crystal sand in V. racemosa. There are rectangular crystals and crystal <b>sand</b> in the <b>stems</b> of V. reticulata and V. subterranea, crystal sand in V. ambacensis and V. vexillata while only the root of V. subterranea possess crystal sand. The diversity in shape of calcium oxalate crystals among the investigated species of Vigna is discussed in relation to their taxonomic significance...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution of}} sand pine (Pinus clausa) seedlings {{in relation to the}} locations of hardwoods and palmettos that had resprouted in five recently clear-cut and one burned stand in sand pine scrub vegetation in Ocala National Forest (Florida, USA). We also studied how the shade and mechanical support provided by the taller resprouts affect the allometry and biomechanics of <b>sand</b> pine seedling <b>stems.</b> Although soil surface temperatures were higher and soil moisture contents (0 – 5 cm) were lower in open than in covered microsites, sand pine seedling densities did not vary in relation to proximity to resprouted hardwoods and palmettos. There was no apparent nurse plant effect on sand pine seedling distributions, but seedlings that grew up under the resprouts had larger whole stem flexibilities, greater height:diameter ratios, and less tapered stems. In response to the mechanical support and shade of neighboring plants, sand pine seedlings grow taller per unit investment in stem tissue, thereby shortening the period during which they presumably suffer from above-ground competition. This biomechanical plasticity increases the rates at which sand pine seedlings can overtop their resprouted competitors...|$|R
40|$|Ammophila arenaria is a {{dominant}} sand-fixing plant {{species of the}} European coastal foredunes. It remains vigorous under regular burial conditions on seaward slopes, but starts to degenerate when sand accumulation diminishes. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this degeneration. In this study, we test the hypothesis that upward growth of plants following sand burial enables them to escape harmful soil organisms. Plants in a degenerating field stand of A. arenaria and potted plants grown in sterilized sand (outdoor pot experiment) were buried with sterilized or nonsterilized sand. Burial in both sterilized and nonsterilized <b>sand</b> resulted in <b>stem</b> elongation, increased numbers of living shoots, and increased shoot and root biomass. However, when plants were grown in and buried with sterilized sand, the numbers of shoots {{were significantly higher than}} those buried with nonsterilized sand. The new root zone of buried plants was colonized by pathogenic soil organisms (nematodes and fungi) during the same growing season. It is concluded that by upward growth through pathogen-free sand, the plants benefit, at least temporarily, from escaping its pathogens and parasites.

40|$|This annual Neutron Soil Moisture Monitoring report {{provides}} an analysis and summary for site inspections, meteorological information, and neutron soil moisture monitoring data obtained at the U- 3 fi Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Unit, located in Area 3 of the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada, during the October 1999 to October 2000 period. Inspections of the U- 3 fi Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Unit are {{conducted to determine}} and document the physical condition of the concrete pad, facilities, and any unusual conditions that could impact the proper operation of the waste unit closure. The objective of the neutron-logging program is to monitor the soil moisture conditions along the 128 -meter (m) (420 -feet [ft]) ER 3 - 3 monitoring well and detect changes that maybe indicative of moisture movement in the regulated interval extending between 73 to 82 m (240 to 270 ft) or to detect changes that maybe indicative of subsidence within the disposal unit itself. Physical inspections of the closure were completed in March and September 2000 and indicated that the site is in good condition with no significant findings noted. The directional survey which is required to be completed every five years was run in the ER 3 - 3 casing to determine if subsidence was occurring in the U- 3 fi emplacement borehole. Small changes were noted which are attributed to initial settling of the <b>sand</b> pack <b>stemming.</b> No evidence of subsidence within the emplacement borehole was observed. The subsidence survey for the October 1999 to October 2000 monitoring period indicated an increase in elevation of 0. 244 centimeters (cm) (0. 008 ft) compared to the previous year, July 1999. All changes in subsidence survey data taken to date are so small as {{to be at the}} survey instrument resolution level and it is not clear if they represent subsidence or measurement error. There is no clear evidence for any subsidence of the monument. Soil moisture monitoring results indicate dry stable conditions for all quarterly monitoring periods. The Residual Raw Neutron Counts remain below the compliance Action Level of 200 counts within the regulated interval of 73 to 82 m (240 to 270 ft) for the period from October 1999 through October 2000...|$|R
40|$|Author's {{manuscript}} {{made available}} {{in accordance with}} the publisher's policy. Aims Plant species response to erosion or burial has been extensively studied, but few studies have examined the combined effects of erosion and subsequent burial on plants. In active sand dunes of northern China, Artemisia wudanica falls to the ground following wind erosion, accumulating <b>sand</b> among fallen <b>stems</b> in a process that may facilitate its further growth and development. Therefore, we hypothesize that subsequent sand burial might compensate for the negative effects of erosion in the growth of A. wudanica. Methods A common garden experiment was conducted using A. wudanica seedlings to evaluate their growth in response to different degrees of burial and erosion as observed at the field. Seedlings were selected and randomly assigned to six erosion treatments, two burial treatments, twelve erosion and subsequent burial treatments, and control. Each treatment was replicated six times. Results Compared with the control treatment, total biomass and the relative growth rate of shoots were stimulated in the erosion and subsequent burial treatments (significantly under the 10 cm burial), hampered in erosion only treatments, and were not affected in the burial only treatments. Adventitious roots and ramets were only observed under burial only and erosion and subsequent burial treatments. Conclusions Our results indicate that subsequent sand burial following erosion compensate for the negative effects of erosion on the growth of A. wudanica seedlings, and greatly contributed to their tolerance to wind erosion...|$|R
