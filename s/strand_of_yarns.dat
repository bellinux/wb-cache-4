40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> due to unavailability {{of a mass}} <b>of</b> consecutive <b>yarns.</b> While multispectral imaging systems can capture images <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest. Finally, colors <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> specified by the proposed methods were compared with spectrophotometric colors <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> windings using 12 pairs <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> and yarn windings. Experimental results show the MA method yields the smallest lightness and chroma difference compared with spectrophotometric colors <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> windings. The average color difference between spectrophotometric colors <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> windings and multispectral imaging colors <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> specified by the AA, AC, MA, and LW methods is 3. 45, 2. 72, 2. 37, and 3. 33 CMC(2 : 1) units.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} multispectral {{imaging system}} can directly acquire the reflectance <b>of</b> a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that {{is impossible for}} traditional spectrophotometers. Instead, the spectrophotometric reflectance <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> winding, which is constituted by yarns wound on a background card, {{is regarded as the}} yarn reflectance in textile. While multispectral imaging systems and spectrophotometers can be separately used to acquire the reflectance <b>of</b> a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> and corresponding yarn winding, the quantitative relationship between them is not yet known. In this paper, the relationship is established based on models that describe the spectral response of a spectrophotometer to a yarn winding and that of a multispectral imaging system to a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> The reflectance matching function from a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to corresponding yarn winding is derived to be a second degree polynomial function, which coefficients are the solutions of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Experiments on 100 pairs of samples show that the proposed approach can reduce the color difference between yarn windings and single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> from 2. 449 to 1. 082 CIEDE 2000 units. The coefficients of the optimal reflection matching function imply that the reflectance <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> winding measured by a spectrophotometer consists of not only the intrinsic reflectance <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> but also the nonignorable interreflection component between <b>yarns.</b> Institute <b>of</b> Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

5000|$|The {{speed of}} a horn gear braider {{is limited by the}} effort needed to force bobbin {{carriers}} to follow a serpentine path. In 1922, Simon W.

[...] The carriers follow a simple circular path, while lever arms driven by a cam guide the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to their correct places. Because a lever arm has much less mass than a bobbin and carrier, the machine can run faster.|$|R

50|$|Since warp {{knitting}} {{requires that the}} number <b>of</b> separate <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> ("ends") equals the number of stitches in a row, {{warp knitting}} is almost always done by machine rather than by hand.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Yarn</b> is {{composed}} <b>of</b> twisted <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> fiber, which {{are known as}} plies when grouped together. These <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> are twisted together (plied) {{in the opposite direction}} to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either s&#8209;twist (the threads appear to go [...] "up" [...] to the left) or z&#8209;twist (to the right). For a single ply <b>yarn,</b> the direction <b>of</b> the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use for the}} {{technique}} is when working stranded color patterns, in which two yarns are alternated to certain of the stitches to create patterns. Weaving is used to attach the horizontal <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that pass unused behind stitches formed with the other yarn {{to the inside of}} the fabric. This is usually done to prevent overlong [...] "floats" [...] on the inside to prevent snags and create an even tension in the fabric.|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} the fiber to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be spun (or twisted) into a strand known as yarn. When the yarn is ready and dyed for use {{it can be made}} into cloth in a number of ways. Knitting and crochet are common methods of {{twisting}} and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric. The most common use <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to make cloth is weaving. In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a loom and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the warp. Then another <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp. This wrapped yarn is called the weft. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the textile}} arts, plying {{is a process}} {{used to create a}} strong, {{balanced}} yarn. It is done by taking two or more <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that each have a twist to them and putting them together. The strands are twisted together, in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. When {{just the right amount of}} twist is added, this creates a balanced yarn, one which has no tendency to twist upon itself. Almost all store-bought yarns are balanced, plied yarns. The word ply derives from the French verb plier, [...] "to fold", from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb πλέκω.|$|R

The yarn used in the weave of an afghan photo blanket is the same thickness in both horizontal and vertical directions while a tapestry photo blanket is manufactured with <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> two different diameters. In a tapestry photo blanket the thinner of the two yarns; i.e., the warp, actually consists of 6-8 different color <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> which are combined in various ways, based on a photo, to re-create the colors as accurately as possible (even black and white).|$|R
5000|$|Nålebinding (Danish: {{literally}} [...] "binding with a needle" [...] or [...] "needle-binding", also naalbinding, nålbinding, nålbindning or naalebinding) is {{a fabric}} creation technique predating both knitting and crochet. Also known in English as [...] "knotless netting," [...] "knotless knitting," [...] or [...] "single needle knitting," [...] {{the technique is}} distinct from crochet in that it involves passing {{the full length of}} the working thread through each loop, unlike crochet where the work is formed only of loops, never involving the free end. It also differs from knitting in that lengths must be pieced together during the process of nålebinding, rather than a continuous <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that can easily be pulled out. Archaeological specimens of fabric made by nålebinding can be difficult to distinguish from knitted fabric.|$|R
