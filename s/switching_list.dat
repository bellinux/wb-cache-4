Direct torque algorithm controls flux magnitude and direction by querying appropriate voltage vector in <b>switch</b> <b>list.</b> Taking torque as direct control variable can reduce the torque ripple of the motor, which broadens the application fields of switched reluctance motor. Starting with the theory of direct torque algorithm, based on MATLAB/Simulink platform, direct torque control and chopped current control system simulation model are designed. Under the condition that switched reluctance motor model and its load are consistent, it is compared with chopped current algorithm. At last, the feasibility of direct torque algorithm is verified through the platform of hardware experiments. It demonstrates that using direct torque algorithm can make the torque ripple be controlled effectively, which provides a wider application field for the switched reluctance motor...|$|R

40|$|Analog circuit {{technology}} is of vital importance in today's world of electronic design. Increasing prevalence of mobile electronics necessitates {{the search for}} solutions which offer high performance given tight constraints on power and chip area. Field programmable arrays utilizing floating-gate technology are one possible solution to analog design. It offers the advantages of analog processing with the additional advantage of reconfigurability, giving the designer the ability to test new analog designs without costly and time-consuming fabrication and test cycles. In this work, a new interface for FPAA's is demonstrated called Sim 2 spice, with which users can design signal processing systems in Matlab Simulink and compile them to SPICE circuit netlists. These netlists can be further compiled with a tool called GRASPER to a <b>switch</b> <b>list</b> for programming on an FPAA chip. Example library elements are shown, along with some compiled systems such as filters and vector-matrix multipliers. One particularly compelling application of reconfigurable analog design is the field of neuromorphic circuits, which aims to reproduce the basic functional characteristics of biological neurons and synapses in analog integrated circuit technology. Simulink libraries have been built to allow designers to build neuromorphic systems on several FPAAs {{that have been developed}} expressly for the purpose of building neurons and connecting them in networks with synapses. Several possible dynamically learning synapses have also been explored. M. S. Committee Chair: Paul Hasler; Committee Member: Christopher Rozell; Committee Member: David Anderso...|$|R

FEMRR engines and cars were not permitted on C&O tracks beyond the Yorktown Road grade crossing except in emergencies. Cars outbound from Fort Eustis would be spotted on a designated interchange track (other than passing track #493, which was a dedicated runaround track) and deemed delivered to the C&O when the bills of lading and <b>switch</b> <b>lists</b> were signed by the C&O station agent.

40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} of selecting and updating representations in declarative and procedural working memory (WM). Declarative WM holds the objects of thought available, whereas procedural WM holds representations {{of what to do}} with these objects. Both systems consist of three embedded components: activated long-term memory, a central capacity-limited component for building structures through temporary bindings, and a single-element focus of attention. Five experiments test the hypothesis of analogous mechanisms in declarative and procedural WM, investigating repetition effects across trials for individual representations (objects and responses) and for sets (memory sets and task sets), as well as set-congruency effects. Evidence for analogous processes was obtained from three phenomena: (1) Costs of task <b>switching</b> and of <b>list</b> <b>switching</b> are reduced with longer preparation interval. (2) The effects of task congruency and of list congruency are undiminished with longer preparation interval. (3) Response repetition interacts with task repetition in procedural WM; here we show an analogous interaction of list repetition with item repetition in declarative WM. All three patterns were reproduced by a connectionist model implementing the assumed selection and updating mechanisms. The model consists of two modules, an item-selection module selecting individual items from a memory set, or responses from a task set, and a set-selection module for selecting memory sets or task sets. The model codes the matrix of binding weights in the item-selection module as a pattern of activation in the set-selection module, thereby providing a mechanism for building chunks in LTM, and for unpacking them as structures into working memory...|$|R

40|$|When {{designing}} genetic circuits, {{the typical}} primitives used in major existing modelling formalisms are gene interaction graphs, where edges between genes denote either an activation or inhibition relation. However, when designing experiments, {{it is important}} to be precise about the low-level mechanistic details as to how each such relation is implemented. The rule-based modelling language Kappa allows to unambiguously specify mechanistic details such as DNA binding sites, dimerisation of transcription factors, or co-operative interactions. However, such a detailed description comes with complexity and computationally costly execution. We propose a general method for automatically transforming a rule-based program, by eliminating intermediate species and adjusting the rate constants accordingly. Our method consists of searching for those interaction patterns known to be amenable to equilibrium approximations (e. g. Michaelis-Menten scheme). The reduced model is efficiently obtained by static inspection over the rule-set, and it represents a particular theoretical limit of the original model. The Bhattacharyya distance is proposed as a metric to estimate the reduction error for a given observable. The tool is tested on a detailed rule-based model of a λ-phage <b>switch,</b> which <b>lists</b> 96 rules and 16 agents.
