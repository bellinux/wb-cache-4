40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{presence}} of certain chemical compounds in dialysis water which enter patients’ bodies through haemodialysis can cause various {{problems such as}} acute poisoning, brain damage, osteoarthritis, Therefore, applying the standards for dialysis water is indispensible. This study was carried out to determine the chemical quality of water entrance to dialysis machines and its comparison with AAMI and EPH standards in the hospitals of Qom province. Methods: This is a descriptive-cross sectional study which was carried out on 45 samples of water entrance to dialysis machines in hospitals of Qom province. Since there were 3 hospitals in Qom having dialysis units, out of each one 15 samples were chosen as the samples of this study. The following machines were used for analysis of samples in the research: Atomic Absorption, DR 4000 and Flame photometer. The gathered data were then analyzed by independent t-test (p< 0. 5). Results: The means of all measured compounds were statistically lower than <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> and had a significant difference with <b>standard</b> <b>levels.</b> The elements and compounds such as Lead, Zinc, Potassium, Sodium, Sulphate, Nitrate, and Chloride in all the measured samples were below the <b>standard</b> <b>levels,</b> but elements such as Aluminum, Cadmium, and Fluoride were above the <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> in 13, 6 and 9 percent of samples, respectively. Conclusion: The {{results of the study}} showed that in all cases the means of all the studied compounds were below the <b>standard</b> <b>levels,</b> indicating high quality dialysis water in the hospitals. However, the {{presence of}} high level of elements such as Aluminum, Cadmium, and Fluoride compared with the <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> signifies that much should be done in examining dialysis water...|$|R
5|$|Points {{are awarded}} from 1 to 7, with 7 being equal to A*, 6 equal to A, and so on. Up to three {{additional}} points are awarded {{depending on the}} grades achieved in the extended essay and theory of knowledge, so the maximum possible point total in the IBDP is 45. The global pass rate for the IB diploma is approximately 80%. In order to receive an IB diploma, candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points or an average of four (or C) {{out of a possible}} seven points for six subjects. Candidates must also receive a minimum of 12 points from their Higher Level subjects and a minimum of 9 points from their <b>Standard</b> <b>Level</b> subjects. Additionally, candidates must complete all of the requirements for the EE, CAS and TOK. Failing conditions that will prevent a student from being awarded a diploma, regardless of points received, are non-completion of CAS, more than three scores of 3 or below, not meeting the specific points required for Higher Level or <b>Standard</b> <b>Level</b> subjects, or plagiarism in addition to scoring higher than a score of 1 in any subject/level.|$|E

In the present study, we measured psychometric functions for detection and discrimination with and without flankers to investigate whether these effects occur throughout the contrast continuum.

Psychometric functions for discrimination reveal that discrimination thresholds with and without flankers are similar across <b>standard</b> <b>levels,</b> and that the broadening of psychometric functions with flankers disappears as standard contrast increases, {{to the point that}} psychometric functions at high <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> are virtually identical with or without flankers.

2500|$|To {{test the}} students' {{grasp of the}} {{language}} subjects, such as the English language or the mother tongue languages {{at the end of}} primary school, there are several separate examinations. As the student is usually required to take examinations for both his/her mother tongue language and the English language (with the exceptions of exemption or additional languages), the average student repeats the following procedures twice. With each mother tongue subject, there are three levels of examination, the <b>standard</b> <b>level,</b> the foundational level and the separate and optional [...] "Higher Mother Tongue" [...] subject. A student will have to choose between standard and foundational mother tongue based on his/her proficiency in the language. Whether a Higher Mother Tongue subject is taken also depends on the student's proficiency in the language. English, Mathematics and Science are available at the standard and foundational levels. A student can opt to take different subjects at different levels. In the past, whether a student took Higher Mother Tongue or not was determined by which stream he/she was in, namely the EM1 (higher) stream and the EM2 (standard) stream. These streams had the same standard subjects except for the additional EM1 subject of Higher Mother Tongue, which differentiated the streams. This streaming was based on the overall performance of the student when he/she was in Primary Four, his/her fourth year in primary school. There was also an EM3 (foundational) stream, in which a student took all four subjects (English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics and Science) at the foundational level. EM3 Science (a foundation Science curriculum for the EM3 stream) was not available then, it will be only available from 2010, and also the new science syllabus. From 2007, Primary Four pupils underwent subject-based rather than overall streaming, so that the labels EM1, EM2 and EM3 disappeared, leaving only the options to take different subjects at the standard or foundational level and the option of taking Higher Mother Tongue. At the end of Primary Four, the students' parents decide their combination of subjects. At the end of Primary Five, the school will make the final decision on the student's combination of subjects.|$|E
