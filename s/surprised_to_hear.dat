5|$|Tomlinson's {{death was}} {{confirmed}} {{in a statement}} that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were not told he had died until nine hours after his death. The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were not <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> he had had a heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.|$|E
5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{enters the}} neutral zone, to {{investigate}} the distress call of a Talarian freighter. The freighter is badly damaged, and three life forms are detected aboard. An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns {{with them to the}} Enterprise before the freighter explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the freighter was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the freighter to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the freighter adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about a fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet.|$|E

60|$|By looking {{behind the}} {{tapestry}} in various places, the Captain at length discovered a private door, and behind that a winding passage, terminated by another door, which doubtless entered the chapel. But {{what was his}} disagreeable <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> {{on the other side}} of this second door, the sonorous voice of a divine in the act of preaching.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, Rivera joined Panamá Oeste, a local amateur {{baseball}} team, {{as their}} shortstop. Scout Herb Raybourn watched him {{play in a}} baseball tournament but did not project {{him to be a}} major league shortstop. A year later, Panamá Oeste's pitcher performed so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion. Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent to a contract with the Yankees organization on February17, 1990; the contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($ today), according to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 68, {{in another}} battle after Xiaoyao Ford, when Ling Tong was duelling with Yue Jin, Cao Xiu fired an arrow which hit Ling's horse, causing Ling {{to be thrown}} to the ground. Just as Yue Jin was moving in for the kill, he was {{suddenly}} hit by an arrow in the face. Both sides immediately rushed forth to rescue their respective generals and withdrew their forces after that. Later, Ling Tong was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from Sun Quan that it was Gan Ning who saved him, and he knelt down and thanked the latter. Since then, Ling Tong forgot his past feud with Gan Ning and they became close friends.|$|E

My initial response, no doubt mirrored around the world, was what has President Obama done to warrant receiving this award? This is a question that numerous other blogs have covered directly, for example Gideon Rachman's blog at the FT...|$|R
25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors were equally <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about the defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E
25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that this was criticised.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review. [...] "'Wimbledon' is a well-behaved movie about nice {{people who have}} good things happen to them. That's kind of startling, {{in a world where}} movie characters, especially in sports movies, occupy the edge of human experience. What a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> conversation instead of dialogue, and to realize that the villain may actually be right some of the time". He ultimately gave the movie three out of four stars.|$|R

6000|$|On {{the morning}} of the 26th October, 1884, as his Majesty Louis Philippe was at breakfast reading the Debats newspaper, and wishing that what the journal said about [...] "Cholera Morbus in the Camp of the Pretender Henri,"--"Chicken-pox raging in the Forts of the Traitor Bonaparte,"--might be true, what was his <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the report of a gun; and at the same instant--whiz! came an eighty-four-pound ball through the window and took off the head of the {{faithful}} Monsieur de Montalivet, who was coming in with a plate of muffins.|$|R
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
500|$|Sir Henry Wood was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Busoni playing {{passages}} in a Mozart concerto, written as single notes, with two hands in double octaves; at which Donald Tovey proclaimed Busoni [...] "to be an absolute purist in not confining himself strictly to Mozart's written text", that is, that Mozart himself {{could have taken}} similar liberties. The musicologist Percy Scholes wrote that [...] "Busoni, from his perfect command over every means of expression and his complete consideration of every phrase in a composition to every other phrase and to the whole, was the truest artist of all the pianists [...] had ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob has no {{lines of}} {{dialogue}} {{during the first}} half of [...] "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose [...] "lamenting tones became [...] foundation for Sideshow Bob".|$|E

500|$|The Nadaswaram {{played by}} Ganesan and Rajan was played {{off-screen}} by the brothers, M. P. N. Sethuraman and M. P. N. Ponnusamy.

Their rehearsals took place over 15 days in Mahadevan's recording studio in Chennai. Nagarajan then listened to a radio recital by the duo, and was impressed with their rendition of Thyagaraja's Keerthana, [...] "Nagumomu Ganaleni". The Keerthana was later selected as one of the soundtrack instrumentals in the film. After Thillana Mohanambals release, a Russian delegation met Ganesan in person. They were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that he was only acting and not actually playing the Nadaswaram.|$|E
500|$|This story occurs {{some time}} after {{the events of the}} kinetic novel, as human civilization struggles in a losing battle against the {{poisonous}} rain.

When they bring him down, they are <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the adults calling him [...] "Man of the Stars". The children grow quite interested about his strange nickname, as well as {{the fact that they have}} never seen a visitor from the outside world. The old man recovers a bit and has the children help him in putting together a portable planetarium projector. This story offers an ultimate conclusion to the story in the kinetic novel.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian Coe was {{instrumental}} in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. [...] Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. [...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, {{and she told him}} to ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary.

500|$|Ricky Lee and Doug {{departed}} in June 1992 due {{to creative}} differences. According to Richard, Ricky Lee's tenure as lead vocalist was [...] "a bad time" [...] {{for the band}} given his opposition to Richard's opinions, although Richard was still <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of the brothers' departure, and said, [...] "I tried everything I could {{to get them to}} stay." [...] Ricky Lee, meanwhile, said that he [...] "was a country singer more than anything" [...] and wanted to eliminate most of the band's hard rock sounds. He and Doug then founded Brother Phelps, which had a more mainstream country sound than The Kentucky Headhunters did. Brother Phelps released two albums for Asylum Records and charted in the country top 40 with [...] "Let Go" [...] and [...] "Were You Really Livin'," [...] which peaked at number 6 and 28 respectively.|$|E
500|$|Harrison, meanwhile, {{struggled}} {{to keep up with}} the demands of Henry Clay and others who sought offices and influence in his administration. Harrison's old age and fading health were no secret during the campaign, and the question of the presidential succession was on every politician's mind. The first few weeks of the presidency took a toll on Harrison's health, and after being caught in a rainstorm in late March he came down with pneumonia and pleurisy. Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent word to Tyler of Harrison's illness on April 1; two days later, Richmond attorney James Lyons wrote with the news that the president had taken a turn for the worse, remarking that [...] "I shall not be <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> by tomorrow's mail that Gen'l Harrison is no more." [...] Tyler determined not to travel to Washington, not wanting to appear unseemly in anticipating the president's death. At dawn on April 5, Webster's son Fletcher, Chief Clerk of the State Department, arrived at Tyler's plantation with a letter from Webster, informing the new president of Harrison's death the morning before.|$|E
500|$|Bhatti {{revealed}} that since appearing in EastEnders, {{people have come}} up {{to him in the}} street and called him a [...] "bad man", and that fans call him [...] "Dr Evil". In May 2011, Bhatti was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the TV Quick Awards and the storyline where he tries to destroy the Masoods' marriage was nomated for Best Storyline. Bhatti was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that Yusef is liked mainly by women, but {{in an interview with the}} Daily Mirror, he admits that he is nothing like Yusef in real life. BBC News branded Yusef as [...] "Zainab's sinister first husband", elsewhere, Metro.co.uk described Yusef as a [...] "deceptive doctor". Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Zainab sending Yusef into the blazing building was a [...] "stroke of genius". Simon also said that it's unknown what Yusef is hoping to achieve with his [...] "one-man reign of terror. Being married to a woman he can’t stand, with a son he doesn’t want."
