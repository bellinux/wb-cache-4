Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months.

5|$|After {{copulation}} it {{is generally}} the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) guano. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6–7% of mother's body mass is laid, and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months. Both parents take turns feeding {{for the first three}} months, after which the male's attendance tails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents' throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.|$|E

25|$|When a male is mature, {{he spins}} a sperm web, {{deposits}} semen on it, and charges his palpal bulbs with the sperm. Black widow spiders reproduce sexually when the male inserts his palpal bulbs into the female's spermathecal openings. The female deposits her {{eggs in a}} globular silken container in which they remain camouflaged and guarded. A female black widow spider can produce four to nine egg sacs in one summer, each containing about 100–400 eggs. Usually, eggs incubate for twenty to thirty days. It is rare {{for more than a}} hundred to survive this process. On average, thirty will survive through the first molting, because of cannibalism, lack of food, or lack of proper shelter. It takes two to four months for black widow spiders to mature enough to breed, however full maturation typically takes <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months.</b> The females can live for up to three years, while a male's lifespan is about three to four months.

The need for improved streamflow and snowpack forecast models in the Upper Colorado River and Great Basin is of the utmost importance. In this research, the use of oceanic and climatic variables as predictors to improve the long lead-time (three <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months)</b> forecast of streamflow and snowpack was investigated. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis was used to identify a region of Pacific Ocean SSTs and a region of 500 mbar geopotential height (Z 500) that were teleconnected with streamflow (and snowpack) in Upper Colorado River and Great Basin headwaters. The resulting Pacific Ocean SSTs and Z 500 regions were used to create indices that were then used as predictors in a non-parametric forecasting model. The majority of forecasts resulted in positive statistical skill, which indicated an improvement of the forecast over the climatology or no-skill forecast. The results indicated that derived indices from Pacific Ocean SSTs were better suited for long lead-time (<b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month)</b> forecasts of streamflow (and snowpack) while the derived indices from Z 500 improved short-lead time (3 month) forecasts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{provision}} {{and content}} of child health surveillance (CHS) has changed greatly since 1990. However, its value continues to be questioned. The introduction of the personal child health record (PCHR) has provided a new means of collecting data about CHS. AIM: To identify what problems are recorded at CHS reviews in the PCHR {{during the first year}} of life, and what follow-up/referrals result directly from these reviews. METHOD: A total of 28 practices were recruited from one health authority. All babies born to mothers registered with study practices during one year were followed up. Health visitors returned copies of CHS reviews recorded in children's PCHRs. Written comments on returned reviews were analysed. RESULTS: In all, 2308 babies were entered into the study and 2001 (87 %) were followed up for one year. A total of 7848 (78 %) CHS reviews were returned. Physical problems were recorded in 58 % of children at the 10 - 14 day, 35 % at the <b>six</b> <b>to</b> eight week, and 39 % at the <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> review. Of physical problems recorded at CHS reviews, 30 % required follow-up in primary care and 7 % required referral to hospital. Other problems were recorded less frequently and health promotion was recorded at only 7. 5 % of CHS reviews. CONCLUSION: Child health surveillance provides important opportunities to discuss problems that may cause parental concern and to identify children requiring treatment or follow-up. The design and use of the PCHR needs to change to reflect increasing emphasis on health promotion...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{research}} has shown that there is a significant relationship between western U. S. streamflow and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In some regions, there is a six month lead time between the ENSO predictor and the ensuing streamflow. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Wright Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTw) are used here to study the lag relationship between western U. S. streamflow and ENSO indices. In the southwest and northwest, the spring-summer runoff is significantly correlated with the prior summer and autumn SOI and SSTw values. These <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> lag correlations are important in making long-range streamflow forecasts. A long-range seasonal streamflow forecasting model is developed and tested on the Columbia River Basin, Washington State. A probabilistic streamflow forecast is made from an optimal linear combination of SOI Phase, SSTw Phase, and SOI Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and SSTw LDA forecasts. The forecast {{takes the form of a}} probability of the streamflow occurring in specified categories (i. e., below normal, normal, and above normal).

40|$|Long-range {{forecasting}} of streamflow {{is important}} to hydrologists and water resource planners {{for the maintenance of}} a diverse ecosystem and for optimal operation of water resource systems. In the Western U. S., there is a significant relationship between streamflow and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Wright Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) are used here to study the lag relationship between Western U. S. streamflow and ENSO indices. Preliminary research has shown that the North (Montana, Northern Idaho, Eastern Washington) experiences below normal spring-summer runoff during ENSO events while the South (New Mexico, Arizona, Southern California) experiences above normal spring- summer runoff. In both of these regions, the spring- summer runoff is significantly correlated with the prior summer and autumn SOI and SST values. These <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> lag correlations are important in making long- range streamflow forecasts. A long-range seasonal streamflow forecasting model is developed and tested on the Columbia River Basin, Washington State.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a best {{practice}} protocol for providing children living in India, ages <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>to</b> fifty <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> old, with maximally effective vitamin A supplementation every six months. Vitamin A supplements work as a prophylactic treatment to prevent the occurrence of ocular symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality rates in children. The author first identifies the public health problem of vitamin A deficiency and discusses epidemiological trends of incidence and prevalence. Pertinent background information provides the history of supplementation in India. A brief overview addresses the physiological role of vitamin A and the negative impacts that occur when daily vitamin A requirements are not met. The author initiates a discussion about culturally specific attitudes and values regarding the process of vitamin A supplementation. The diffusion of innovation theory provides a conceptual framework. An in depth review of literature reflects recently published research on the degree of effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation on the youth population in India. Additional research results indicate an effective dose of vitamin A supplementation and how frequently to administer supplements.
