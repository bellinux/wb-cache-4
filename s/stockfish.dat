5|$|An {{artificial}} intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse ("Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute"), which compares chess grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish—a chess engine which outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen {{as the best}} player of all time as he had the highest probability of all World Chess Champions to play the moves which <b>Stockfish</b> suggested.|$|E
5|$|In 1497 Bristol was the {{starting}} point for John Cabot's voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought freeze-dried cod, called <b>stockfish,</b> from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic trade at this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants. It has often been suggested that this drove Bristol's merchants to look West for new sources of cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there. Moreover, recent research has shown that England's fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow 'pushed out' of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. <b>Stockfish,</b> cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of <b>stockfish),</b> or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stockfish</b> is Norway's longest {{sustained}} export commodity. <b>Stockfish</b> {{is first}} {{mentioned as a}} commodity in the 13th-century Icelandic prose work Egil's Saga, where chieftain Thorolf Kveldulfsson, in the year 875 AD, ships <b>stockfish</b> from Helgeland in mid-Norway to Britain. This product accounted for most of Norway's trade income from the Viking age throughout the Medieval period.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stockfish</b> is {{extremely}} popular and is widely consumed in Catholic Mediterranean countries, mostly in Portugal and secondly also in Italy. (<b>Stockfish</b> is called stoccafisso in most Italian dialects, but confusingly baccalà—which normally refers to salt cod—in the Veneto).|$|E
25|$|After sorting by quality, {{most of the}} <b>stockfish</b> is {{exported}} to Italy, Croatia and Nigeria. In Norway and Iceland, the <b>stockfish</b> is mostly used as a snack and for lutefisk production. In Italy, the fish (called stoccafisso) is soaked and used in various courses, and {{is viewed as a}} delicacy.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>stockfish</b> {{and salt}} cod {{can be made}} into lutefisk.|$|E
25|$|For centuries jekts were {{important}} for Northern Norway's export of <b>stockfish.</b> Each jekt could make two voyages {{a year to}} Bergen with this cargo, the city had for many hundred years monopoly on trading with Northern Norway. After the <b>stockfish</b> cargo had been loaded in Bergen the jekt would return with goods that Northern Norway did not produce.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stockfish</b> is {{typically}} sold in whole bales (100lbs per bale) or half-a-bale, one-quarter bale or even one-tenth-bale.|$|E
25|$|Low-quality <b>stockfish</b> is also {{commonly}} used as supplemental food for pets, primarily as dog food or dog treats.|$|E
25|$|Cod is {{the most}} common fish used in <b>stockfish</b> production, while other whitefish, such as pollock, haddock, ling and cusk, are used to a lesser degree.|$|E
25|$|A European Union-funded project “” is {{developing}} an innovative indoor production of <b>stockfish</b> {{to accelerate the}} maturing and drying of fish, and to secure seafood safety, quality and traceability. The project started 01 December 2012 and finishes by 30 April 2015.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stockfish</b> is cured in {{a process}} called {{fermentation}} where cold-adapted bacteria matures the fish, similar to the maturing process of cheese. Clipfish is processed in a chemical curing process called salt-maturing, similar to the maturing processes of other salt-matured products like Parma ham.|$|E
25|$|Lightfoot's sound, both in {{the studio}} and on tour, is centred on Lightfoot's {{baritone}} voice and folk-based twelve-string acoustic guitar. From 1965 to 1970, lead guitarist Red Shea was an important supporting player, with bassists Paul Wideman and John <b>Stockfish</b> filling out the arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The {{science of}} {{producing}} good <b>stockfish</b> {{is in many}} ways comparable to that of making a good cognac, Parma ham, or a well-matured cheese. The Slow Food movement insists that all these artisanal products must be made on a small scale and given time to mature.|$|E
25|$|The Finnmark coast was {{originally}} {{important as a}} source of furs from the trade with the Karelians, but this trade dropped off as the Hanseatic League increased the fur trade through their Novgorod centre. Finnmark remained important as a fishery; the fish was shipped as <b>stockfish</b> to Bergen and traded there with the Hansa merchants.|$|E
25|$|A crowned silver <b>stockfish</b> on red was {{formerly}} included to represent Iceland, {{but due to}} Icelandic opposition, this symbol was replaced in 1903 by a silver falcon on blue. The falcon was in turn removed from the royal arms in 1948 {{following the death of}} King Christian X in 1947 and reflecting the 1944 breakup of the Dano-Icelandic union.|$|E
25|$|After {{its three}} months {{hanging on the}} hjell, the fish is then matured for another {{two to three months}} indoors in a dry and airy environment. During the drying, about 80% of the water in the fish evaporates. The <b>stockfish</b> retains all the {{nutrients}} from the fresh fish, only concentrated: it is therefore rich in proteins, vitamins, iron, and calcium.|$|E
25|$|Anna Karoline {{was bought}} in 1929 {{by the firm}} J. Angell & Sønner in Hopen in Lofoten. The vessel was used both summer and winter. During the vinter Anna Karoline was used while fish were salted and for {{producing}} Cod liver oil, she had similar duties in Finnmark in the spring. During summer Anna Karoline transported guano and <b>stockfish</b> from Nordland and Troms south to Bergen.|$|E
25|$|In Quảng Ninh {{aquatic fauna}} is very abundant, both fresh and sea water. There are large {{species of fish}} in the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. In addition, there are special species such as pearl mussels, <b>stockfish,</b> sea turtles and lobsters, while along the coastline, oysters and edible seaweed abound. These {{numerous}} fish resources of the sea have always been {{an important source of}} income for the residents of Quảng Ninh.|$|E
25|$|Lutfisk, lyed fish made of <b>stockfish</b> (dried ling or cod {{served with}} boiled potato and thick white sauce) and green peas {{that can be}} served with the warm dishes or as a {{separate}} fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include rice pudding (risgrynsgröt), sprinkled with cinnamon powder. Traditionally, an almond is hidden {{in the bowl of}} rice porridge, and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognized for having good luck.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} long history, cod differ from most fish because the fishing grounds are far from {{population}} centers. The large cod fisheries {{along the coast of}} North Norway (and in particular close to the Lofoten islands) have been developed almost uniquely for export, depending on sea transport of <b>stockfish</b> over large distances. Since the introduction of salt, dried and salted cod (clipfish or 'klippfisk' in Norwegian) has also been exported. By the end of the 14th century, the Hanseatic League dominated trade operations and sea transport, with Bergen as the most important port.|$|E
25|$|Iceland (Island): 16th century - 1903: Gules, a <b>stockfish</b> Argent ensigned by a crown Or. The symbol {{had been}} {{associated}} with Iceland from the early sixteenth century. First included {{in the arms of}} Frederick II. From 1903 to 1948 different arms were used, viz. Azure, a falcon Argent. Iceland dissolved the union with Denmark in 1944, and following the death of King Christian X in 1947, the new King Frederick IX decided to remove the falcon from his arms. This change took place by royal decree on 6 July 1948.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from its}} long history, this {{particular}} trade also differs from most other fishing trades by {{the location of}} the fishing grounds, far from large populations and without any domestic market. The large cod fisheries along the coast of North Norway (and in particular close to the Lofoten islands) have been developed almost uniquely for export, depending on sea transport of <b>stockfish</b> over large distances. Since the introduction of salt, dried salt cod ('klippfisk' in Norwegian) has also been exported. The trade operations and the sea transport were {{by the end of the}} 14th century taken over by the Hanseatic League, Bergen being the most important port of trade.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} export traded from Bergen was {{dried cod}} {{from the northern}} Norwegian coast, which started around 1100. The city was granted monopoly with regard to trade from the north of Norway, by King Håkon Håkonsson (1217-1263). <b>Stockfish</b> was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe's largest centres for trade at the time. By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as {{the centre of the}} trade in Norway. The Hanseatic merchants lived in their own separate quarter of town, where Middle Low German was used, enjoying exclusive rights to trade with the northern fishermen who each summer sailed to Bergen. Today, Bergen's old quayside, Bryggen, is on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.|$|E
25|$|Anna Karoline {{served as}} a cargo vessel and the cargo changed {{depending}} on what owners she had, {{time of the year}} and where she was stationed. When Ole Vandsvik was one of the owners Anna Karoline started the new year with a voyage to Lofoten to buy fish. The fish was salted on board the vessel and she returned in May to Kiran in Roan where the fish was dried. While the fish was drying the jekt was transporting timber from Namsen to Northern Norway. When the fish had dried the vessel was loaded with <b>stockfish,</b> and sailed to Bergen. The vessel was also used for transporting herring and as sleeping quarters during fishing.|$|E
25|$|In medieval times, seafood {{was less}} prestigious than other animal meats, and {{often seen as}} merely an {{alternative}} to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea {{could be found in}} markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. <b>Stockfish,</b> cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water.

25|$|Fish was {{of great}} {{importance}} to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the herring fishing in the Limfjord and Oresund. The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers. The amount of fish caught {{was more than enough}} to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish. Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at Skanör in Scania, which was in the Middle Ages part of Denmark. From this market alone, merchant vessels of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels of salted herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages. Of equal, or even greater importance was cod, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make <b>stockfish,</b> and imported as an important staple, particularly during fast and Lent. Many freshwater fish were also of great dietary or economic importance, such as salmon, eel, pike and bream.|$|E
500|$|Fish {{became an}} {{increasingly}} important commodity during Eystein's reign, as more cod was fished in Northern Norway {{and the demand for}} <b>stockfish</b> soared in Europe. As the most suitable port, Bergen became the main trade hub for exporting <b>stockfish,</b> including trade connections with Grimsby in England, while it also served to import much needed goods such as grain and flour. To further the trade, Eystein had fishing booths and a church built in the fishing centre at Vågan in Lofoten in Northern Norway, and he sailed north to Lofoten and Trondenes himself in 1114. He also secured the route along the coast by constructing a port in Agdenes on the mouth of the Trondheimsfjord, as well as smaller beacons along the coast. Eystein's port construction in Agdenes was compared by Theodoric the Monk to that of Augustus Caesar at Brundisium, an association readily reflected by Theodoric's use of the Latinised name form [...] "Augustinus" [...] for Eystein. (Otherwise, Pope Callixtus II calls Eystein [...] "Aistano" [...] in a letter.)|publisher=Diplomatarium Norvegicum|volume=XVII|page=2|language=Norwegian, Latin}} The existence of a now lost port in Agdenes dated to around Eystein's reign has been supported by recent archaeological surveys in the area. Snorri also says that Eystein had several large dry-docks built in Nidaros, and that he had a large ship built which [...] "in size and shape" [...] resembled the great ship Ormen Lange once built by King Olaf Tryggvason. Eystein also improved the shelters in the mountain passes, notably at Hjerkinn in Dovre, to more comfortable houses with permanent supervision.|$|E
500|$|Syzygy tablebases were {{developed}} by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search. [...] This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL table (win-draw-loss) which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e. pawn move or capture). [...] The WDL tables were designed to be {{small enough to fit}} on a solid-state drive for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest win instead of performing a search. Syzygy tablebases are available for all 6 piece endings, and are now supported by many top engines, including Komodo, Deep Fritz, Houdini, and <b>Stockfish.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stockfish</b> {{is popular}} in West Africa, {{where it is}} used in the many soups that {{complement}} the grain staples fufu and garri. Also the main ingredient in the Igbo snack called [...] "Ugba na Okporoko" [...] or [...] "ukazi" [...] amongst the Ohafia people in Abia state in Nigeria. Indeed, in Abia <b>stockfish</b> is quite popular and a regular ingredient used in many local delicacies. Little wonder most importers of [...] "okporoko" [...] are based in the town of Aba in Abia State. Among the Umuahia people, at festive periods, the best staple is the Ukazi soup which must necessarily be very well garnished with okporoko or Cod as it is popularly called. The Kwe people, who are a fishing people of the English-speaking part of Cameroon, use <b>stockfish</b> in flavoring their palm nut or banga, which can be eaten with a cocoyam pudding called kwacoco. The name okporoko for <b>stockfish,</b> among the Igbo of Nigeria refers to the sound the hard fish makes in the pot and literally translates as [...] "that which produces sound in the pot".|$|E
2500|$|The baccalà alla vicentina, {{an ancient}} and {{traditional}} Italian dish native to Vicenza, {{is made from}} <b>stockfish</b> (confusingly not from dried and salted cod, although this is known in standard Italian as baccalà) and is served on or next to polenta. In the Italian region of Basilicata, the so-called baccalà alla lucana is prepared with typical peppers called [...] "cruschi" [...] (dialect word for [...] "crunchy"). Dishes made from <b>stockfish</b> (locally called bakalar) are traditionally eaten on Christmas Eve in Croatia, especially Dalmatia.|$|E
2500|$|The word <b>stockfish</b> is a loan {{word from}} West Frisian stokfisk (stick fish), {{possibly}} {{referring to the}} wooden racks on which <b>stockfish</b> are traditionally dried or because the dried fish resembles a stick. [...] "Stock" [...] may also refer to a wooden yoke or harness on a horse or mule, once used to carry large fish from the sea or after drying/smoking for trade in nearby villages. This etymology {{is consistent with the}} fact that [...] "Stockmaß" [...] is German for the height of a horse at the withers. [...] "Stockfish" [...] and [...] "Stockmaß" [...] therefore refer essentially to the same basic length.|$|E
