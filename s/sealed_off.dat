5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry {{had long since}} been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were <b>sealed</b> <b>off,</b> though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained <b>sealed</b> <b>off</b> with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E

The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are <b>sealed</b> <b>off</b> from the public.|$|E

5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be <b>sealed</b> <b>off</b> immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E

5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had <b>sealed</b> <b>off</b> a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.|$|E

The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers, the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were <b>sealed</b> <b>off.</b> Nevertheless, a small bomb or explosive devise blew up on an empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as workers were cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport.
