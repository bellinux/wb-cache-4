In this paper, ana-lytic, semi-analytic and nite element methods are introduced for electromagnetic modeling of dierent geometries of the {{traction transformer}}. Using these methods, the leakage inductances <b>between</b> <b>windings</b> are calculated and the methods have been validated with the help of a traditional analytic method and experimental data gathered from a typical 4000 kVA dry-type transformer. The analytic method which usually used for electromagnetic modeling of trans-formers with concentric windings, assumes the wind-ings to be constructed of straight wires. This method is fast and suitable for calculating the axial mag-netic eld and leakage inductance <b>between</b> concentric <b>windings.</b> However, in order to increase the accuracy of leakage inductance calculations <b>between</b> pancake <b>windings,</b> a semi-analytic method is proposed.

40|$|Abstract [...] Transformer {{short-circuit}} {{behavior is}} typically represented in electromagnetic transient simulation programs by the inverse of the leakage inductance matrix, {{also known as}} the A-matrix or [A]. The terms of [A] represent the magnetic coupling (flux linkages) <b>between</b> <b>windings,</b> i. e. <b>between</b> coils on the same core leg. In addition to the representation of coupling <b>between</b> <b>windings</b> of the same phase, intra-phase coupling effects can also be included. This paper investigates the sensitivities of results of EMTP-type simulation to intra-phase entries of [A]. A method for obtaining [A] that includes intra-phase coupling is developed and verified by comparing simulation results with laboratory measurements. The percent error between measured and simulated short-circuit currents that result from implementing a full and simplified [A] was quantified. A correlation {{of the size of the}} elements representing intra-phase coupling in [A] with transformer MVA size is investigated and valuable conclusions and recommendations are made...|$|R

40|$|A {{harmonic}} mitigating transformer {{is capable}} of preventing the propagation of a triplen harmonic current from the secondary side of the transformer to the primary side. The transformer is able to achieve this via its zig-zag connected secondary windings. This investigation developed an equivalent circuit model for a harmonic mitigating transformer. The development of the model {{was based on the}} premise that a transformer can be modelled as a network of mutually coupled inductors. The equivalent circuit model was used to evaluate the transformer under ideal and non-ideal coupling conditions. The evaluation revealed that the non-ideal model {{is capable of}} mitigating more that 99 % of the third harmonic current. This result showed that the non-ideal couplings within a harmonic mitigating transformer do not significantly affect its ability to mitigate the third harmonic. Consequently when seeking to optimise the harmonic mitigating transformer the area of focus should be on the couplings <b>between</b> <b>windings</b> on the same core limb rather than on the couplings <b>between</b> <b>windings</b> on adjacent core limbs...|$|R
