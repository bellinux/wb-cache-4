5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the <b>sycamore</b> <b>moth</b> (Acronicta aceris), the maple {{prominent}} (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E
50|$|Mulberry leaves, {{particularly}} those of the white mulberry, are ecologically important as the sole food source of the silkworm (Bombyx mori, named after the mulberry genus Morus), the cocoon of {{which is used to}} make silk. Other Lepidoptera larvae - which include the common emerald, the lime hawk-moth, and the <b>sycamore</b> <b>moth</b> - also sometimes eat the plant.|$|E

50|$|Halysidota harrisii (<b>sycamore</b> tussock <b>moth)</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the family Erebidae. It is found in South-Eastern Canada, the Eastern parts of the United States (but not Florida) and North-Eastern Mexico. The {{wingspan}} is about 50 mm. The moth flies from May to June and from July to August depending on the location.|$|R

This case study {{is the first to}} report a patient who presented with an allergic reaction after exposure to the larvae of the <b>sycamore</b> tussock <b>moth,</b> Halysidota harrisii Walsh, 1864. Methods: Blood was collected from an allergic asthmatic adult (m/ 42 y/o) at 2 hrs &ndash; 2 wks after contact urticaria with associated dyspnea after exposure to the larvae of the <b>sycamore</b> tussock <b>moth,</b> Halysidota harrisii Walsh, 1864. Distributions of blood lymphocytes (CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 8 +CD 60 +, CD 19 +, CD 23 +, CD 16 / 56 +, CD 25, CD 45 RA+, CD 45 RO+), monocytes (CD 1 d+), levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE), and cytokines (IFN-&gamma;, IL- 4, TNF-a) were studied (flow cytometry, nephelometry, UniCAP Total IgE Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay, cytokine ELISA, clinical toxicology). Results: Numbers of CD 4 + T cells, CD 25 + cells, CD 19 + B cells, and CD 1 d+ monocytes decreased (22, 27, 33, 20 %, respectively) one week post reaction, CD 45 RA+ na&iuml;ve T cells decreased at 36 hours (21 %),while CD 8 +CD 60 + T cells and CD 23 + cells decreased 48 hrs (33, 74 %, respectively) post reaction. In contrast, numbers of CD 16 / 56 + NK precursor cells increased (60 %) 12 hrs, then decreased (65 %) 48 hrs post reaction; other lymphocyte subsets were unaffected. Serum IgM, IgG and IgA were within normal range; however, serum IgE demonstrated a bimodal elevation at 2 hrs (15 %) and one week post reaction. Levels of IFN-&gamma;, IL- 4, and TNF-a were not detected in serum pre-exposure (&lt; 1. 0 &ndash; 4. 0 pg/mL). However, high levels of IFN-&gamma; (187 &ndash; 319 pg/mL) and TNF-a (549 &ndash; 749 pg/mL) were detected in serum 24 &ndash; 36 hrs and 3. 5 &ndash; 24 hrs post reaction, respectively. In contrast, levels of IL- 4 were undetected (&lt; 1. 0 pg/mL) in serum at all time points. Conclusions: Exposure to the larvae of the <b>sycamore</b> tussock <b>moth,</b> Halysidota harrisii Walsh, 1864 may result in increased cytokine levels and blood CD 16 / 56 + NK precursor cells.
