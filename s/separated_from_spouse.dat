40|$|Pregnant heroin addicts {{tend to be}} {{younger than}} nonaddicted {{pregnant}} patients, unmarried or <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>spouses,</b> and a disproportionately large number are members of minority ethnic groups. Heroin addiction during pregnancy is associated with several significant medical and obstetrical complications and may result in both acute and chronic abnormalities in neonates. Malnutrition, venereal disease, hepatitis, pulmonary complications, preeclampsia and third-trimester bleeding {{are the most common}} maternal complications, while fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity and withdrawal symptoms affect the fetus and neonate.

5000|$|Climate {{change may}} also {{increase}} the spread of HIV/AIDS. As climate change disasters sweep the globe, more people will become displaced, and be forced to live in close quarters to one another.

Migrants often have poor living conditions, are <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> their <b>spouses</b> and families, perform demanding and dangerous jobs and have limited access to health care. This can all lead to an increased risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.|$|R

40|$|Millions {{of people}} move {{from rural areas}} to urban areas in China to pursue new {{opportunities}} while leaving their spouses and children at rural homes. Little {{is known about the}} impact of migration-related separation on mental health of these rural migrants in urban China. Survey data from a random sample of rural-to-urban migrants (n = 1113, aged 18 - 45) from Wuhan were analyzed. The Domestic Migration Stress Questionnaire (DMSQ), an instrument with four subconstructs, was used to measure migration-related stress. The relationship between spouse/child separation and stress was assessed using survey estimation methods to account for the multi-level sampling design. 16. 46 % of couples were <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> their <b>spouses</b> (spouse-separation only), 25. 81 % of parents were <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> their children (child separation only). Among the participants who married and had children, 5. 97 % were <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> both their <b>spouses</b> and children (double separation). Spouse-separation only and double separation did not scored significantly higher on DMSQ than those with no separation. Compared to parents without child separation, parents with child separation scored significantly higher on DMSQ (mean score = 2. 88, 95 % CI: [2. 81, 2. 95] vs. 2. 60 [2. 53, 2. 67], p <. 05). Stratified analysis by separation type and by gender indicated that the association was stronger for child-separation only and for female participants. Child-separation is an important source of migration-related stress, and the effect is particularly strong for migrant women. Public policies and intervention programs should consider these factors to encourage and facilitate the co-migration of parents with their children to mitigate migration-related stress...|$|R

The PGC points were not significantly variable by age, sex, moving of residence, form of family. However, the PGC points were significantly higher in those who were satisfied with their family relationship, who had hobbies, and who considered themselves as well-being. 3. No significant difference was observed on the PGC points regardless of having their spouse or not, though the PGC points tended to be lower in those who <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> their <b>spouses</b> in less than five years...|$|R

She made trips to her relatives in Bayreuth and the spa at Ems and regularly visited Dresden during the carnival season and Christmas. Christiane Eberhardine continued to participate in representational court life in Dresden whenever her presence was required, the biggest festivities being the state visit of the King of Denmark in 1709 and the wedding of her son in 1719.|$|R
50|$|The Midrash {{explains}} {{the entire story}} as follows: It became known to Miriam and Aaron that Moses had <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> intimacy with Tzipora. They disapproved of this separation because they considered her to be outstandingly righteous, much as a dark-skinned person stands out among light-skinned people - hence the reference to Tzipora as a “Cushite”. This usage of the word Cushite is non-pejorative and is often used in Jewish sources as a term for someone unique and outstanding. In fact, King Saul and even the Jewish People are referred to by the term “Cushite”. Their complaint, therefore, was not about the union between Moses and Tzipora, but about their separation. The only justification they could find for Moses’ celibacy was {{in order to maintain}} his prophetic state. This {{explains the}}ir claim that God spoke not only to Moses but also to them, yet that they had not <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> their <b>spouses.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the nature and extent}} of the associations between demographic variables and acculturative stress of African migrants in Germany with the premise that living in Germany would be stressful for Africans. Data from 85 migrants from the general population and prisons showed that 73. 4 % were males and 26. 6 % females with age ranging from 18 to 46 years. Participants completed the MAQ used in assessing acculturative stress. Results from hierarchical regression analysis showed that: majority of Africans reported racial discrimination, negative situation, a precarious job and a huge volume of daily hassles as predominant problems experienced in Germany. Acculturative stress increased with duration of stay in Germany. Family fragmentation and being <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> one’s <b>spouse</b> was a strong predictor of acculturative stress. Being an economic refugee was also associated with acculturative stress. Recommendations were made in the light of the conclusions made in the study...|$|R
5000|$|The story [...] "The Time Eater" [...] from issue 40 of {{the comic}} [...] "Vampirella", scripted by Jack Butterworth and {{published}} in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards.

Alan Moore's 1983 short story [...] "The Reversible Man" [...] from issue 308 {{of the comic}} [...] "2000AD" [...] told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. Brian K. Vaughan wrote an issue of the ongoing Midnighter series told in reverse chronology. The issue explored {{the fact that the}} character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation. The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that intergenerational support may be required when people <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> their <b>spouse.</b> However, the difference between the younger and older generation 2 ̆ 7 s experience of such intergenerational support at a time of divorce is under-researched. This article examines differences in perceptions of divorced adults and their parents, hereafter referred to as the younger and older generation. The analysis is based on two different sample sets of in-depth interviews conducted in 2008 in Ireland. Findings from the interviews showed that, whereas the older generation believed they provided both emotional and practical support (financial, childcare and housing), the younger generation felt they received and benefited from practical support over and above emotional support. The findings show a striking divergence in perceptions of emotional support between, the two generations. The article contributes to the discussion of the structure and meaning of intergenerational support at a time of divorce and discusses the factors which impact upon the experience of such support...|$|R
