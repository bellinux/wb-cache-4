25|$|Paget-Schroetter {{disease is}} the {{obstruction}} of an upper extremity vein (such as the axillary vein or <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein)</b> by a thrombus. The condition usually comes to light after vigorous exercise and usually presents in younger, otherwise healthy people. Men are affected more than women.|$|E
25|$|Precordial {{monitoring}} of the pulmonary artery is the usual monitoring site, as it combines all the blood returning to the body before {{it goes to the}} lungs, so it is least likely to miss bubbles from a peripheral source, and is most compatible with the Spencer and K-M scales, as heart sounds are clearly audible. Other sites which have been used include the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein,</b> carotid artery, femoral vein and inferior vena cava. Protocols for ultrasonic investigation of decompression bubbles are still in development, and may vary between researchers.|$|E

He presented with lethargy, {{shortness of breath}} 13 months into his follow-up and was diagnosed to have chylopericardium. MR venography and lymphangiography could not demonstrate the site of lymphatic leak. His chyloperciardium was treated with pericardiocentesis and MCT diet. The most likely cause for the chylopericardium was venous occlusion of the <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins</b> with backpressure resulting in a lymphatic leak.

50|$|The {{condition}} {{is named after}} two men. James Paget first proposed the idea of venous thrombosis causing upper extremity pain and swelling, and Leopold von Schrötter later linked the clinical syndrome to thrombosis of the axillary and <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ambesh {{maneuver}} is {{a technique}} that involves the simple external compression of internal jugular vein in supraclavicular fossa to prevent and diagnose misplacement of the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> catheter into the internal jugular vein (IJV). The <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> is a big vessel that drains the blood from the hand, forearm and the upper arm into {{the right side of}} the heart through superior vena cava. The subclavian veins lie just behind the clavicle on each side and therefore known as <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> {{follows the}} subclavian artery and is {{separated}} from the subclavian artery by the insertion of anterior scalene. Thus, the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> lies anterior to the anterior scalene while the subclavian artery lies posterior to the anterior scalene (and anterior to the middle scalene).|$|E
50|$|Maneuver:Ambesh {{maneuver}} {{not only}} prevents misplacement of <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> catheter into the IJV but also provides instant diagnosis of misplaced catheter. Following successful puncture of <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> with a cannula/needle, {{same side of}} IJV is compressed externally by placing a sterile finger in supraclavicular fossa. The guidewire is threaded through the cannula into the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> keeping the compression on. If the operator notices resistance while inserting the guidewire, it means the guidewire is going north into the IJV. The guidewire is removed gently and re-threaded maintaining the pressure in the supraclavicular fossa. After successful insertion of the guidewire, pressure in fossa is released and the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> catheter is railroaded over the guidewire up to the desired length. The guidewire is removed and the catheter is now connected to the transducer and the monitor. The CVP waveform pattern {{as well as its}} value is noted. The ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa is compressed again and any change in CVP value and/or its waveform pattern is noted. If the waveform pattern is lost (becomes straight line) and or CVP value increased by more than 2 cm H2O then it is surely a misplaced <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> catheter into the same side IJV. If no change occurs then this catheter is fine and can be used for CVP monitoring and drug administration. The Ambesh maneuver is quite simple, handy, inexpensive, and instant bedside technique that prevents and diagnoses misplacement of <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> catheter into the IJV The maneuver is now routinely used and recommended by others to avoid the most common misplacement of <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> catheter.|$|E
50|$|Generally, lymph flows {{away from}} the tissues to lymph nodes and {{eventually}} to either the right lymphatic duct or the largest lymph vessel in the body, the thoracic duct. These vessels drain into {{the right and left}} <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|Paget-Schroetter disease, {{also known}} as Paget-von Schrötter disease, {{is a form of}} upper {{extremity}} deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a medical condition in which blood clots form in the deep veins of the arms.

50|$|Pneumothorax: Attempts to {{gain access}} to the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> or jugular vein can injure the lung, {{potentially}} causing a pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large enough, a chest tube might need to be placed. In experienced hands, the incidence of this complication is about 1% when accessing the <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein.</b> When accessing the jugular vein the pneumothorax rate is virtually nonexistent.|$|E
50|$|During <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> {{central line}} placement, the {{catheter}} can be accidentally {{pushed into the}} internal jugular vein {{on the same side}} instead of the superior vena cava. A chest x-ray is performed after insertion to rule out this possibility. The tip of the catheter can also be misdirected into the contralateral (opposite side) <b>subclavian</b> <b>vein</b> in the neck, rather than into the superior vena cava.|$|E

50|$|When an efferent {{lymph vessel}} leaves a lymph node, it may carry lymph to another lymph node by {{becoming}} its afferent lymph vessel or unite with other efferent vessels {{to become a}} lymph trunk. The lymph trunks drain into the lymph ducts, which in turn return lymph to the blood by emptying into the respective <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Venous angle (Pirogoff's angle, Latin: angulus venosus) is the {{junction}} of the internal jugular and <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins</b> at {{both sides of the}} neck. The external and the anterior jugular and the vertebral veins converge toward it. The left venous angle receives lymph from the thoracic duct. The right venous angle receives lymph from the right lymphatic trunk.|$|R

40|$|AbstractVenous occlusions or {{anatomic}} variants are unexpectedly encountered during transvenous pacing lead implantation procedures. A 78 -year-old man, who {{had been}} medically treated for a thoracic and abdominal dissecting aortic aneurysm was referred to our hospital for treatment {{of congestive heart failure}} due to complete atrioventricular block with bradycardia. At the time of the pacemaker implantation, the guidewire for inserting the introducer sheath could not be advanced into the left brachiocephalic vein. A venogram and contrast-enhanced chest multi-detector computed tomography revealed an obstruction of the left brachiocephalic vein at the confluence of the left internal jugular and left <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins,</b> and there was collateral blood circulation. We abandoned introducing the pacemaker lead from the left side, and implanted the pacemaker in his right anterior chest. In this case, the left brachiocephalic vein was occluded due to dilatation and elongation of the aortic arch aneurysm and the deviated left common carotid artery. This case illustrates the importance of the assessment of the patency of the left brachiocephalic vein prior to the central venous approach from the left internal jugular and left <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins</b> in patients with aortic arch aneurysms. <Learning objective: Venous occlusions or anatomic variants are unexpectedly encountered during transvenous pacing lead implantation procedures. Dilatation and elongation of the aortic arch aneurysm and the deviated left common carotid artery can be a cause of a left brachiocephalic vein occlusion.

Complications of this procedure include infection, electrical lead and generator malfunction which will require replacement.|$|R
25|$|The first lymph sacs {{to appear}} are the paired jugular lymph sacs at the {{junction}} of the internal jugular and <b>subclavian</b> <b>veins.</b> From the jugular lymph sacs, lymphatic capillary plexuses spread to the thorax, upper limbs, neck and head.
