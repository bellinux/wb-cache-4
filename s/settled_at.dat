40|$|We examine representative, group-level wage {{settlement}} data {{to augment the}} debate on nominal pay rigidity in Britain. We investigate the characteristics of groups that <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> zero {{and the role of}} within-firm and external influences. Nominal settlement cuts are rare. Zero nominal {{wage settlement}}s are more common, but still relatively unusual, highest during (low-inflation) recessionary periods. Small groups, above all firms under duress, appear most likely to <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> zero. Once a group <b>settles</b> <b>at</b> zero it is unlikely to do so again in the short run.
