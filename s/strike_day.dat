500|$|November 25 was VF-18's final <b>strike</b> <b>day</b> {{as part of}} Intrepids air group. An {{early morning}} fighter sweep and three strikes were {{launched}} against targets on and around Luzon. Cecil Harris flew two sorties: the initial fighter sweep over the island of Luzon itself, and Strike 2C, scheduled to search for enemy cruisers in Balanacan Bay. The fighter sweep was intercepted by over one dozen enemy fighters at Nielson field. In the air battle that ensued, Harris shot down three [...] "Tojos". He took off again around three hours later with Strike 2C. Instead of heading out {{with the rest of}} the flight, however, Harris was scheduled to make a message drop on the Hancock. As he approached the carrier, several enemy planes that had penetrated the task group's defensive perimeter began to attack the ship. Harris swung back to Intrepid just in time to see a [...] "Hamp" [...] (also known as [...] "Zero") headed for his ship. Flying through a barrage of anti-aircraft fire, he pursued and shot down the Japanese fighter just off the bow of Intrepid. Two Zeros flying as part of this kamikaze assault on the US fleet successfully crash-dove into the carrier shortly thereafter, striking within five minutes of one another around 13:00 hours. The bombs they carried punched through the flight deck and into the ship, igniting fierce fires and causing severe damage. Air Group 18 pilots returning from strikes had to land on other carriers or fly out to Leyte Island. Days later, VF-18 was detached from the air group and moved to the Hancock, where they briefly served before being rotated out of the combat zone.|$|E

A session of negotiation with CHI Franciscan on Wednesday 12, 2014 ended at 8 P.M with no resolution. It was frustrating the community and the members of Local 1199NW that their negotiation with the CHI Franciscan Health employers did not come to the agreement. Therefore, the union members had no alternative action but to go on strike and stand up for themselves, their patients, and their community. The workers notified CHI Franciscan one week before the <b>strike</b> <b>day</b> that they intended to strike. According to Taft-Hartley Act, the union members required by law to give the hospital notice to ensure patients are not affected.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} impacts of the four episodes of {{industrial}} action by English junior doctors in early 2016. Design: Descriptive retrospective study of admitted patient care, accident and emergency (A&E) and outpatient activity in English hospitals. Setting: All hospitals across England. Participants: All patients who attended A&E or outpatient appointments, or those who were admitted to hospital during the three week period surrounding {{each of the four}} strikes (January 12 th, February 10 th, March 9 th- 10 th and April 26 th- 27 th, excluding weekends.) Main outcome measures: Raw numbers and percentage changes of outpatient appointments and cancellations, A&E visits, admitted patients and all in-hospital mortality on <b>strike</b> <b>days</b> compared with patient activity on the same weekday in the weeks before and after the strikes. Results: There were 3. 4 million admissions, 27 million outpatient appointments and 3. 4 million A&E attendances over the four 3 -week periods analysed. Across the four <b>strike</b> <b>days,</b> there were 31, 651 fewer admissions (- 9. 1 %), 23, 895 fewer A&E attendances (- 6. 8 %) and 173, 462 fewer outpatient appointments (- 6. 0 %) than expected. Additionally, 101, 109 more outpatient appointments were cancelled by hospitals than expected (+ 52 %). The April 26 th- 27 th strike, where emergency services were also affected, showed the largest impacts on regular service. Mortality did not measurably increase on <b>strike</b> <b>days.</b> Regional analysis showed that services in the Yorkshire and the Humber region were disproportionately more affected by the industrial action. Conclusions: Industrial action by junior doctors during early 2016 caused {{a significant impact on the}} provision of healthcare provided by English hospitals. We also observed regional variations in how these strikes affected providers...|$|R
50|$|The DARES {{statistical}} {{institute of}} the Ministry of Employment counted 6 million <b>strike</b> <b>days</b> (summing up each individual's {{decision to go}} on <b>strike,</b> per <b>day)</b> in 1995, against 1 million the previous year. Among these 6 million strike-days, 4 million were {{in the public sector}} (including France Télécom) and 2 million in the private and semi-public sector (including SNCF, RATP, Air France and Air Inter). In this last sector, the average number of strike-days from 1982 to 1994 had been of 1,1 millions a year (while it was 3.3 millions from 1971 to 1981). Starting in November, the SNCF and the RATP were paralyzed for two months. Despite the inconveniences, public support remained firmly with the strikers. People started hitch-hiking and sharing cars to go to work, using bikes, etc.|$|R

30|$|The aims of {{the present}} work are (1) to locate {{accurately}} the people occupying specific buildings and (2) to identify {{the impact of this}} distribution on probable population loss over four different temporal scenarios for Sylhet City in northeastern Bangladesh. In addition to a daytime and nighttime scenario, weekday, weekly holiday, <b>strike</b> <b>day,</b> and Ramadan scenarios, which have very different population distribution patterns in the city, are also evaluated.|$|E

50|$|London Underground {{employees}} organised by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) {{have had}} a number of disputes with both London Underground and privatised contractors including Metronet and Tube Lines over pay, safety, pensions and job security, leading to travel disruption in the capital. Due to the disruption this causes, the usage of both driverless trains and retired train drivers have been suggested as solutions to keep services running on <b>strike</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the week{{days from}} 2  p.m. to 4  p.m. and in Ramadan days from 6  p.m. to 8  p.m. people are {{least likely to}} be present in either {{commercial}} or residential buildings. That means in these periods most people are in the street or outside the buildings. In Ramadan more than 20  % of the population may be out-of-doors in the evening. During weekly holidays and on <b>strike</b> <b>days</b> this average percentage falls to about 3 – 8  %. In weekday afternoons about 18  % of the populace are outside buildings.|$|R
30|$|There is {{a strong}} {{positive}} relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of people and the potential number of casualties. The distribution of the people varies from daytime to nighttime among different occupancy classes and temporal scenarios in a year. The variation is particularly remarkable for commercial buildings. In residential buildings at least two persons are present during daytime while other residents go to schools, colleges, or work places. Each of the scenarios shows a distinct population distribution throughout the year. The <b>strike</b> <b>day</b> and Ramadan day scenarios show a different distribution than the weekday scenario even if these scenarios cover the weekdays of the year. In a <b>strike</b> <b>day,</b> population distribution fluctuates more in educational institutions than in other occupancy classes. As a consequence more people are found in residential buildings during strikes. Distribution of people also decreases in mixed-use buildings, markets, banks, and other commercial buildings because people {{do not go there}} during a strike except in an emergency. During Ramadan, the daytime population density increases mainly in the commercial buildings such as markets, shops (especially those dealing with clothing and fabrics), tailoring enterprises and so on). Ramadan decreases daytime customers in food shops, restaurants, and nonreligious recreational centers during daytime. The number of people also increases along the street in Ramadan due to the temporary markets that appear in the roadside footpath. There is a change in the work hours of offices and banks, so the amount of people in commercial districts and buildings varies from the levels normally encountered on regular workdays.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} shows that different temporal scenarios {{in a year}} have different losses {{of life in the}} same 2  h period. The loss is 15  % less on both strike days and weekly holidays and 11  % less during a Ramadan day compared favorably to the typical weekday morning scenario. The study result indicates that in some specific time periods the amount of people in the street or outside the buildings increases. Another important factor affecting the large amount of people in the street is the open market (market in the footpath). In the Ramadan day and weekday scenarios about 20  % of the people remains outside the buildings for some specific period of the day and in the <b>strike</b> <b>day</b> and weekly holiday fewer people are outside.|$|E

Triggered by an observation of social behavior of public transport passengers during one of the winter bus drivers ' <b>strike</b> <b>day</b> in the City of Copenhagen, this case study attempts to reveal the extent to which advanced mobile data services are used by the population. This study adds to the growing awareness that the success of establishing Information Society should not be measured by the number of available services to citizens over the wireline and mobile Internet. Drawing on theories of social learning, sensemaking, and ethnographical studies of infrastructure, we are attempting to answer the question âwhy people do not use advanced data services in situations when the use of such services is perceived as important?...|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} is a severe problem in major urban areas due to {{increasing numbers of}} vehicles, reduced road capacity and few investments in public transportation, especially in developing countries. Public transportation has a special role in avoiding congestion and consequent environmental and health impacts but is considered expensive. The objective {{of this paper was}} to analyze the benefits of the São Paulo subway in terms of the air pollution in the city through strikes events, analyzing both the health outcomes and the related economic burden. for the strike events, increases in air pollutant concentrations during the <b>strike</b> <b>day</b> was observed when compared to a similar day in terms of day of the week and meteorological conditions. Increases in mortality were also observed and the associated economic burden calculated. Despite the elevated construction and operation costs of the subway, when environment and social values are considered, cost-benefit analysis results would indicate a worthwhile investment. the consideration of these aspects is essential to sustainable transportation analyses, {{and in the case of}} the São Paulo subway, our analysis clearly demonstrated the important role of this system in the city's environmental, social and economic attributes.

30|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the effect of}} {{population}} changes in four different temporal cycles (weekday, weekly holiday, <b>strike</b> <b>day,</b> and Ramadan) to understand the major variations in population distribution {{over the course of a}} year. In Bangladesh, Sunday to Thursday are considered as weekdays and most of the people usually start for their destination (school, work, and so on) from 8  a.m. on those workdays. The weekly holidays are Friday and Saturday. Government offices and educational institutions are mainly closed during these 2  days, while local shops and some markets remain open. Strike events are very common in Bangladesh due to an unstable political climate. Planned strikes and protest activities occur between dawn and dusk in a particular day designated by a political party as a day for demonstrations. On average, the number of strike days varies from 20 to 30  days in a year. UNDP-Bangladesh (2005) describes in detail the strike scenarios in Bangladesh, and mentions that strikes have strong negative impact on society. For example, strikes disrupt the mobility of people, hamper business activities, and interfere with travel to work, as well as potentially cause the loss of a paycheck, and so on. The other temporal cycle, Ramadan, is a period of 30  days each year when Muslims fast between dawn and dusk. In recognition of the strain this abstinence places on strict participants in Ramadan, office hours usually start later in the morning and end earlier in the afternoon than the rest of the year. In most cases, the government declares a vacation in the educational institutions at all levels during this period.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of the 24 -h doctors ’ strike on 21 June 2012 on {{hospital}} activity in English NHS hospitals. Design: Retrospective descriptive study of inpatient, out-patient and Accident and Emergency (A&E) activity in NHS hospitals over the strike period. Setting: All English NHS hospitals. Participants: Patients admitted to hospital, patients with outpatient appointments and A&E attendances over a three-week period (from 11 to 29 June 2012), excluding weekends and spanning the <b>strike</b> <b>day.</b> Main outcome measures: Numbers and percentage change of inpatient admissions (elective and emergency), day surgery cases, outpatient appointments cancellations, A&E attendances and in-hospital deaths {{on the day of the}} strike compared with patient activity on the Thursday before and the Thursday after the strike week. Results: There were a total of 795, 267 admissions, 5, 602, 971 outpatient appointments, 356, 645 outpatient cancellations (by NHS provider), 4, 470, 208 outpatients seen by medical staff, 986, 322 A&E attendances and 13, 857 in-hospital deaths over the three-week period. Compared with the non-strike period, on the day of the strike, emergency admissions fell by 2. 4 % while the elective admissions decreased by 12. 8 %. There was a 7. 8 % drop in the number of outpatients seen by medical staff on the day of the strike and a 45. 5 % increase in the number of can-celled appointments by NHS hospitals, while A&E attend-ances dropped by 4. 7 %. The impact of the strike across regional Health Authorities in England was varied. The North West Health Authority was affected the most while the least affected Health Authorities were the South West, East of England and South Central. Conclusions: The 24 -h doctors ’ strike in England on 21 June 2012 significantly affected the provision of healthcare by NHS hospitals.
