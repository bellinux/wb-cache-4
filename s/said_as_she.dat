500|$|Shiina is {{a female}} ninja who fights with dual-wielding kodachi and shuriken. She {{is able to}} sense when danger is coming and is a highly capable fighter. Despite her serious demeanor, she has a {{weakness}} for cute things like stuffed animals. She is strict in her training and is very self-critical when she fails, especially to a newcomer like Otonashi. She decides that her weakness is having little concentration. She is shown balancing a broom and other objects with her fingers for long amounts of time. She rarely speaks but will normally remark [...] "how shallow-minded" [...] or [...] "how foolish" [...] ("this is so stupid" [...] in the English dub) whenever the obvious or something stupid is <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> {{did not have a}} name when she arrived in the afterlife, Yuri named her Shiina after her callsign, 'C7' (Shi-nana).|$|E

We need to cover 10 more and 19 more municipalities. Let’s not sit back and relax,” she <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stressed the need to take care of Mother Nature.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or what she was talking about. As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lay dying on the kitchen floor of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E
