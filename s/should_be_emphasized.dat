It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> that in the infinite-dimensional case, the concern is rarely the complete matrices. They are exposed here only to highlight the common thread.

25|$|Strmiska {{argues that}} these two poles could be termed reconstructionism and eclecticism, respectively. Reconstructionists do not {{altogether}} reject innovation in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they {{do believe that the}} source material conveys greater authenticity and thus <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized.</b> They often follow scholarly debates about the nature of such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic Pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.|$|E
25|$|The Néstor Kirchner {{administration}} placed Brazil as {{a foreign}} policy priority and relations with Brazil were considered strategic. This was met with reciprocity in Brazil, as Lula da Silva placed Argentina as the main priority of his foreign policy. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized,</b> that the first foreign visit of Lula da Silva, as president-elect, was to Argentina in December 2002. From the Brazilian perspective, only with this strategic alliance {{would it be possible}} to transform South America into a world power bloc, {{one of the goals of}} Lula da Silva's foreign policy.|$|E

25|$|A recent use {{of equal}} {{protection}} doctrine came in Bush v. Gore (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in Florida {{in the aftermath}} of the 2000 presidential election. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices Souter and Breyer joined the majority of five—but only, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized,</b> for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.|$|E
25|$|While Einstein's {{result is}} the same as Bradley's {{original}} equation except for an extra factor of , it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, {{in the sense that it}} gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

30|$|It <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> {{that the}} overall system reliability, from both {{security}} and adequacy aspects, has been enhanced since the RMR cost (security-related) and the customer damage cost (adequacy-related) are reduced with the transmission reinforcement project advancement.|$|R
500|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized,</b> however, {{that for}} Whitehead God is not {{necessarily}} tied to religion. [...] Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system. [...] His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty {{in the world and}} provided an aim to all entities. [...] Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God. [...] However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. [...] This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the consequent nature. [...] Whitehead's conception of God as a [...] "dipolar" [...] entity has called for fresh theological thinking.|$|E

2500|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> that {{in order}} to {{estimate}} the standard deviation of the mean [...] it is necessary to know the standard deviation of the entire population [...] beforehand. However, in most applications this parameter is unknown. For example, if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory, it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation, but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean.|$|E
2500|$|The point <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> that {{although}} the revolutionary socialists had pulled the charter of Local Seattle and [...] "reorganized" [...] it in April 1906, within a year the moderates had once again achieved primacy — a point emphasized by Harry Ault in his June 1, 1907 column, in which he lamented the [...] "steadily diminished" [...] crowds being drawn by Local Seattle to its regular Sunday evenings propaganda meetings. These meetings had been undercut by the heavily promoted Sunday afternoon sessions of the Mills faction, Ault believed.

2500|$|The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem implies, in particular, {{that the}} {{elements}} [...] themselves are linearly independent.

2500|$|However, the Nazi {{interference}} with sports {{resulted in a}} nationwide boycott of official athletics meetings in Norway {{from the end of}} 1940. When the reorganization of sports life was implemented in November 1940, the Germans, knowing that Hoff was unpopular, kept him out of the spotlight. Egil Reichborn-Kjennerud was installed as leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, while Hoff used the Hird as an arena for his work. In the spring of 1942, it became clear that Reichborn-Kjennerud had failed to deal with the still-ongoing sports boycott, and Hoff became the new leader of the Confederation of Sports. He had a number of grand plans; sports in Norway should be state-led, and the aim was to produce a broad range of athletes rather than a few stars. In addition to the physical dimension, the [...] "spiritual" [...] dimension <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized.</b> He originally received generous funding, but from 1943 Germany lost interest in his projects, and in 1944 the projects were largely disestablished. Hoff protested this decision, and was removed from his position as a result.|$|E
