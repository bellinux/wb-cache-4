2500|$|As {{defined by}} Evershed MR in Re Ellenborough Park [...] Ch 131, an {{easement}} requires {{the existence of}} at least two parties. The party gaining the benefit of the easement is the dominant estate (or dominant tenement), while the party granting the benefit or suffering the burden is the servient estate (or <b>servient</b> <b>tenement).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Prescription {{may also}} be used to end an {{existing}} legal easement. For example, if a <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> (estate) holder were to erect a fence blocking a legally deeded right-of-way easement, the dominant tenement holder would have to act to defend their easement rights during the statutory period or the easement might cease to have legal force, even though it would remain a deeded document. [...] Failure to use an easement leading to loss of the easement is sometimes referred to as [...] "non-user." ...|$|E
50|$|If, in {{the case}} of praedial servitudes, the {{dominant}} and <b>servient</b> <b>tenements</b> are merged, the servitude will be terminated: If the merger was not intended to be permanent, the servitude will revive when the properties are separated again; if the merger was intended to be permanent, the servitude will not revive when the properties are again separated. Praedial servitudes also terminate when the requirements for their constitution can no longer be fulfilled.|$|R
50|$|Section 1(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{states that}} {{easements}} are an interest {{capable of being}} legal, with S52 of the 1925 Act stating that all conveyances will be void unless created by deed. Therefore, for an express legal easement to be formed rather than simply equitable {{it must have been}} created by deed. A legal easement must be registered against both the dominant and <b>servient</b> <b>tenements,</b> if their titles are registered, in order to take effect. The benefit of legal easements pass automatically on the transfer of the dominant tenement or part of the dominant tenement.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} the literature {{relating to the}} decomposition of property into packages of less than full ownership in the United States and United Kingdom. It does not include specialized areas of law such as Oil and Gas Law and Water Law. Ownership of land is commonly divided by geography into parcels, by time into leaseholds and other estates, and by use into dominant and <b>servient</b> <b>tenements.</b> Some of these divisions, such as leaseholds, have received substantial economic attention and developments in the landlord-tenant debate are reviewed here. Other divisions, such as other temporal estates and servitude doctrines, have received only occasional economic analysis. For these topics, suggestions relating to possible economic justifications {{are added to the}} summary of points made in the literature. JEL classification: K 1...|$|R

5000|$|Praedial servitudes are indivisible; {{they are}} {{imposed on the}} whole of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{line with}} the rule of {{vicinity}} (vicinitas), the tenements must be close enough {{to each other for}} the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> to be able reasonably to enhance the use and enjoyment of the dominant tenement.|$|E
50|$|Where land is registered, as is now common, {{there are}} further {{circumstances}} where an equitable easement will arise. Where both the dominant and <b>servient</b> <b>tenements</b> are registered, easements must be registered against both titles {{under the terms}} of the Land Registration Act 1925. Failure to do so will render them easements in equity only, although they will still bind purchasers under rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925. Where the servient land is unregistered, it is likely that the easement will not have to be registered against the dominant title, even if that is itself registered land. This has been disputed, however, and is significant because if legal would bind successors after first registration whereas an equitable easement would require registration as a land charge. Rule 250(1) allows for easements to arise in equity through prescription where the title is registered, but a right arising through prescription would be created as a legal easement and there seems to be no part of this process where the owner of the dominant tenement has a right in equity only.|$|R
50|$|An {{easement}} {{can not be}} recognised {{where it}} the dominant and <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> are under common ownership. However, rights may be recognised as 'quasi-easements', which can then be implied as full easements upon the {{conveyance of the land}} in question.|$|E
50|$|The {{appellant}} (J) appealed {{against a}} decision (2005 1 S.C. 281) that {{a right of}} vehicular access from a public road included a right to park on the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> such vehicles as were reasonably incidental to the enjoyment {{of access to the}} dominant tenement. The respondents (M) owned a property situated between the foot of a steep escarpment and the foreshore. Vehicles could not be driven onto the property. The property once formed part of the lands owned by J and he was the owner of the land between the property and the public road. Since the property had no access to the public road, the rights conveyed by the disposition in 1973 included a right of access from the public road through J's land. The effect of that conveyance was to confer a servitude right of access to the property from the public road for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and a right to stop vehicles on the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> in order to turn, load and unload goods from them and set down and pick up passengers was accessory to the right of vehicular access. M claimed that there was also an accessory right to park vehicles on the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> The sheriff granted declarator that M were entitled to park vehicles on the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> in the exercise of rights accessory to the servitude right of access and pronounced permanent interdict against J. The Court of Session dismissed an appeal. J submitted that it was not possible in the law of Scotland for there to be a servitude of parking; a permanent interdict was unnecessary and its terms were too uncertain to enable J to know what was prohibited by it.|$|E
50|$|A {{servient estate}} (or servient {{premises}} or <b>servient</b> <b>tenement)</b> is contrasted with a dominant estate (or dominant premises). These terms are usually used {{in reference to}} estates or tenements in the law of easements. A dominant estate has {{the benefit of a}} servitude or easement over the servient estate.|$|E
5000|$|An {{equitable}} easement when the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> is unregistered is enforceable against a {{purchaser for value}} only when properly registered {{under the terms of}} the Land Charges Act 1972. Equitable easements arising by virtue of a contract to grant an easement are registerable as either estate contracts or {{equitable easement}}s. Where the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> is registered, the registration of an equitable easement at the Land Registry can take place through mere notice or caution and will then bind purchasers. Alternatively, it will still bind purchasers if it constitutes an [...] "overriding interest". As confirmed in the case of Thatcher v Douglas, section 70(1)(c) of the Land Registration Act and rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925 will operate to ensure that almost all equitable easements constitute overriding interests.|$|E
50|$|As {{defined by}} Evershed MR in Re Ellenborough Park 1956 Ch 131, an {{easement}} requires {{the existence of}} at least two parties. The party gaining the benefit of the easement is the dominant estate (or dominant tenement), while the party granting the benefit or suffering the burden is the servient estate (or <b>servient</b> <b>tenement).</b>|$|E
50|$|I {{think that}} the right claimed goes wholly outside any normal idea of an easement, that is, {{the right of the}} owner or the {{occupier}} of a dominant tenement over a <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> This claim (to which no closely related authority has been referred to me) really amounts to a claim to a joint user of the land by the defendant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{range of}} {{easements}} is primarily restricted by a fourfold test {{laid out in}} Re Ellenborough Park. The homeowners around Ellenborough Park wished to show they had an easement over the communal gardens to claim compensation for its requisition in World War II. Lord Evershed MR agreed because (1) they owned the dominant tenements, (2) their rights to the [...] "servient" [...] tenement (i.e. the park) benefited their land (3) they did not own the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement,</b> and, despite some prior authority suggesting easements could not be for pure pleasure, (4) it was within a recognised class of easements. Most often, easements are rights of way. Many recent cases have also involved car parking, including Moncrieff v Jamieson where the owner of land between the shoreline and a steep escarpment only had access through his neighbour's, and he had, from 1973 become used to parking there. The <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> owner claimed the car parking took away {{his use of the}} land, and so could not be an easement. But the House of Lords held that in the nature of parking (which was not permanent) to which the dominant owner had become accustomed, the right could count as an easement.|$|E
50|$|Praedial servitudes {{are limited}} real rights {{existing}} only {{in respect of}} land. They are vested in successive owners of one piece of land, called the dominant tenement, which derives a benefit from another piece of land, the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement,</b> belonging to someone other than {{the owner of the}} dominant tenement. In other words, praedial servitudes always involve at least two pieces of land, one of which serves the other. They benefit successive owners and are inseparably bound to the land they benefit.|$|E
5000|$|Prescription {{may also}} be used to end an {{existing}} legal easement. For example, if a <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> (estate) holder were to erect a fence blocking a legally deeded right-of-way easement, the dominant tenement holder would have to act to defend their easement rights during the statutory period or the easement might cease to have legal force, even though it would remain a deeded document. Failure to use an easement leading to loss of the easement is sometimes referred to as [...] "non-user." ...|$|E
50|$|Personal and praedial servitudes {{are created}} through {{agreement}} between {{the owner of the}} dominant tenement and the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> The terms of the agreement will provide for the nature, scope and extent of the servitude; the price to be paid by the owner of the dominant tenement as a consideration for the grant of the servitude; and the duration of the servitude. A praedial servitude can be granted in perpetuity, or it may exist for a specified period of time or until the fulfilment of a specified condition.|$|E
5000|$|Easements are {{distinct}} from restrictive covenants {{and the court}} will not allow {{the creation of an}} easement where the right is in substance a restrictive covenant. Showing a restrictive covenant exists requires demonstrating different criteria are met and a restrictive covenant operates only in equity and not at the common law, whereas an easement can operate at either. An instrument that imposes a negative obligation on another tenement will normally be a restrictive covenant, although there are exceptions [...] - [...] the right to light, capable of being an easement, acts to prevent the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> from acting inconsistently with it.|$|E
5000|$|Where a {{right has}} long been enjoyed by a land owner, it may be {{prescribed}} as an easement following a dispute by {{the owner of the}} <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> In order for a right to be prescribed it must meet the criterion of an easement, and the claimant must be able to show the use was not by force, stealth, or by permission, and continued for a period of twenty years. Whilst it is not a requirement that a land owner not be aware of such a use, if the user has {{reason to believe that the}} land owner both knows of and objects to their use, this will prevent prescription taking place. It has been stated that: ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{problematic}} {{characteristic of}} an easement {{is that it}} must be capable of forming a grant by deed. The right must therefore be certain and definite in its purpose, and more importantly, that the courts are willing to recognise it as a right capable of being an easement. Many claimed rights fail this last criterion, for example, rights which require positive action by the owner of a <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> are unlikely to be granted, as are negative rights, which restrict the use of land. Rights which are excessive in nature are equally unlikely to be upheld. In Copeland v Greenhalf a claim to store unlimited vehicles on a neighbour's land failed, with the interference and right claimed being too great to be allowed as an easement.|$|E
5000|$|Servitudes are {{classified}} {{according to whether}} or not they benefit successive owners. Two types are recognised: praedial servitudes and personal servitudes. Whether a servitude should be classified as a personal or a praedial servitude depends on whether it benefits a particular piece of land or a particular person: If the benefit favours land, then, regardless of the identity of the owner at any given point, successive owners will benefit from the interest in the servient land; if the benefit favours a particular person, then, at best, the benefit will exist for the lifetime of that person. Both praedial and personal servitudes are limited real rights, as they burden ownership, and both may be either positive or negative. Positive servitudes confer on the servitude-holder the entitlement [...] "to enter upon the servient proprietor's land to do something positive," [...] to perform a positive act; negative servitudes restrict the entitlements of the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{express grant}} {{of a right}} of access had to be {{construed}} {{in the light of}} the circumstances that existed when it was granted in 1973, but it was not necessary for it to be shown that all the rights that were later claimed as necessary for the comfortable use and enjoyment of the servitude were actually in use at that date. It was sufficient that they might be considered to have been in contemplation at the time of the grant, having regard to what the dominant proprietor might reasonably be expected to do in the exercise of his right to convenient and comfortable use of the property, Ewart v Cochrane (1861) 4 Macq. 117 considered. In the particular and unusual circumstances of the instant case, the rights ancillary to the express grant of a right of access in favour of the dominant tenement included a right to park vehicles on the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement,</b> in so far as that was reasonably incidental to the enjoyment of the dominant tenement.|$|E
40|$|Easement means, a right {{enjoyed by}} the owner of land over the lands of another: such as rights of way, right of light, rights of support, rights to a flow of air or water etc. The {{dominant}} tenement is the land owned by the possessor of the easement, and the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> is the land over which the right is enjoyed. An easement must exist for the accommodation and better enjoyment {{to which it is}} annexed, otherwise it may amount to mere licence. An easement benefits and binds the land itself and therefore countinious despite any change of ownership of either dominant or <b>servient</b> <b>tenement,</b> although it will be extinguished if the two tenemants come into common ownership. An easement can only be enjoyed in respect of land. This means two parcels of land. First there must be a 'dominant tenement' and a 'servient tenement'. Dominant tenement to which the benefit of the easement attaches, and another (<b>servient</b> <b>tenement)</b> which bears the burden of the easement. A positive easement consist of a right to do something on the land of another; a negative easement restrict the use of owner of the serviant tenement may make of his land. An easement may be on land or on the house made on land. The next classification is on easement on the ground, and the other one under the ground. An easement shall be done in accordance with the principle of restrictions. This means that the less burden the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> When there is doubt about the extent of the actual easement shall take what easier the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> The new needs of the dominant estate does not result in the expansion of servitude. In the article is made comparison between The Draft Code of property and other real estate, and The Draft of Civil Code of Serbia...|$|E
40|$|The Law on Fundamentals of Property Relations, prescribes the {{possibility}} of raising two lawsuits to protect the easement. The lawsuit for the establishment, {{the owner of the}} dominant tenement may demand that according to the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement,</b> establish the existence of easements. In another case, the owner of the dominant tenement which unreasonably prevents or obstruct easement with lawsuit to demand termination of acts which prevents or disturbed, while performing easement. In addition to the petitory protection, the right holder of easements, has the right to the protection of possession, and obligation lawsuits for damages caused by the actions of the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> or any third persons, and lawsuit for enforcement of obligations under the contractual relationship of the establishment of easement. The subject of this work is the protection of real easement confessoria lawsuits as follows: Lawsuit to establish easement, actio confessoria publiciana and actio negatoria confessoria...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. Chapter 1 {{investigates the}} {{requirement}} of praedia utilitas. The continuing existence of this requirement is considered desirable and therefore the broad interpretation thereof by van Oven and others is rejected. Their approach involves a disregard of the benefit requirement. Attention is drawn {{to the fact that}} in South African law (unlike Roman law), not only is the natural condition of the dominant tenement taken into account, but also its arrangement. in deciding whether the benefit requirement is complied with. Several criteria for the benefit requirement (from common law, Dutch and South African authors and cases) are discussed. The conclusion is reached that no decisive criterium has yet been found nor is it probable that one will be found. The different criteria have to be weighed up against each other. One has to accept that economic, social and historical considerations, apart from these criteria. can play a part in the decision whether or not an alleged praedial servitude satisfies the benefit requirement. Some of these are briefly discussed. In a supplement Dutch cases on {{the requirement of}} praedia utilitas are discussed. Chapter 2 investigates the requirement of perpetua causa. Three different aspects of this requirement are considered. Some authors deduct from the first part of D 8 2 28 the principle that the possibility of exercising a praedial servitude may not be dependent on an act by the owner or user of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement.</b> This aspect of the requirement is rejected as there is almost no authority for it in South African law and because it is undesirable in terms of legal policy. The second aspect of the requirement demands the eternal capability of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> to provide a benefit to the dominant tenement, whilst the dominant tenement must have a corresponding eternal need in this regard. Different author's views on the relationship between this aspect of the requirement of perpetua causa and the requirement of praedia utilitas, are discussed. The confusion of others concerning the difference between a causa perpetua and a causa continuam is indicated. It is pointed out that the requirement of perpetua causa is not properly founded in common law. In Roman law a causa perpetua was only required for servitudes concerning water, which had to be aqua viva to satisfy this requirement. In South African law aqua viva is not required and therefore the requirement of perpetua causa became obsolete. The position in modern Dutch law is researched. On grounds of legal policy the perpetua causa-requirement is considered undesirable, as it constitutes an arbitrary restriction on socially beneficial real burdens. The abolishment of the requirement will be in accordance with the recent attempts by South African jurists to adopt a more social definition of the concept of ownership. The third aspect of the requirement (that a praedial servitude may not be constituted under a resolutive condition or period fixture), has been abolished long ago. Chapter 3 investigates the requirement of vicinitas. The view is taken that a great distance between the dominant and servient tenements is not per se in conflict with this requirement. The requirement is seen merely as a manifestation of the utilitas-requirement with regard to the distance between the tenements. Support for this viewpoint is found in common law, modern Dutch, English and South African law. The dominant and servient tenements may be any distance apart, provided the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> can properly benefit the dominant tenement. According to D 8 3 7 1, de a 1 i ng with rura 1 servitudes, an intermediate tenement must be subject to an appropriate servitude. The validity of this rule in common law, modern Dutch and South African law is investigated. The position of the owner of the dominant tenement who has the competence to use the intermediate tenement precario, is discussed with reference to English and Dutch cases. The conclusion is reached, on authority and grounds of policy, that the rule in Q 8 3 7 1 should not be followed in South African law. The existence of a praedial servitude is admissible if the servitude, having regard to the factual situation, will probably benefit the dominant tenement, notwithstanding the presence of any unburdened intermediate tenements...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the servient land passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even adverse possessors of the freehold. The benefit of an easement appurtenant to some dominant tenement passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the servient land must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a profit in gross is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person. But when we come to easements in gross, a serious difference of opinion exists on the question {{whether or not they are}} transferable. A large portion of this essay will be devoted to a consideration of this particular problem...|$|E
40|$|At common law, a {{right to}} be {{entitled}} to the natural produce of another person's land - profits a prendre, or simply profits - is capable of being a legal right. It is a legal estate: a kind of right which is capable of binding whoever comes upon the land and is operative outside the ambit of contract; it is independent of who are the owners of the <b>servient</b> <b>tenement</b> and the dominant tenement; {{it is a kind of}} right "binding the whole world". The Marine Fish Culture Ordinance, Cap 353, Laws of Hong Kong, confers upon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation authority to grant a licence whereby a party is given the right to culture fish within the provisions of the Ordinance. Culturing fish without the appropriate licence is an offence under the Ordinance. These two kinds of rights differ at least in that one is a right relating or attaching to land and the other is a right given to a person by statute; one is a legal estate and is independent of the person and the other is a personal right which is granted to a specific person. However, the two are interrelated in that both could relate to fish culture and there may be conflict between them at times. This study compares these two kinds of rights and identifies the areas in which one may affect the other. Discussion is included in this paper concerning situations where the two may be in conflict, and suggestions are made to improve this. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
