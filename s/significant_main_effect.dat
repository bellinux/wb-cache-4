PURPOSE: To {{examine the effects of}} a flame resistant synthetic material base layer on heat stress factors. METHODS: Ten recreationally active males (25 ± 6. 1 yrs, 80. 9 ± 8. 4 kg, 11. 1 ± 5. 3 % fat, 4. 4 ± 0. 6 L·min- 1 VO 2 max) completed two trials of intermittent (50 min walking, 10 min sitting) treadmill walking (2. 5 mph, 4 % grade) over 3 hours in a climate chamber (35 ⁰C, 30 % RH). Participants wore standard WLFF Nomex green pants, yellow shirt with either a 100 % cotton base layer (C) or a flame resistant synthetic material base layer (S), while carrying a 35 lb pack, hard hat, and gloves. Exercise was followed by a 30 minute rest period without pack, hard hat, gloves, or Nomex yellow shirt. Core (Tc) and skin (Tsk) temperature were measured continuously throughout the trial. Skin blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (DTsk) was recorded via laser doppler for two minutes prior to walking, five minutes during each break, and three, five minute periods during the 30 minutes following exercise. Physiological strain index (PSI) was calculated. Water was scripted at 8 ml/kg/hr. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS 22. 0. RESULTS: <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time were found on Tc (p≤ 0. 001) and Tsk (p= 0. 003). No significant trialXtime interactions were found in Tc (p= 0. 077) and Tsk (p= 0. 086). SBF showed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time (p= 0. 001) and a trialXtime interaction (p= 0. 001). <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for time were found on DTsk (p= 0. 001).

Evidence demonstrating that young children's peer interactions are often segregated on the basis of culture and sex was found. Overall, frequency of initiatic,ns was greater within culture and sex than across culture and sex. The failure to find significant effects of culture or sex on negative initiations suggests that the lack of cross-cultural peer interactions is not motivated by hostile intentions. The lack of cross-cultural interactions is discussed in terms of peer familiarity and communication skills.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether incorporating arm movement into bridge exercise changes the electromyographic (EMG) activity of selected trunk muscles. Twenty healthy young men were recruited for this study. EMG data were collected for the rectus abdominis (RA), internal oblique (IO), erector spinae (ES), and multifidus (MF) muscles of the dominant side. During bridging, an experimental procedure was performed with two options: an intervention factor (with and without arm movement) and a bridging factor (on the floor and on a therapeutic ball). There were <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for the intervention factor in the IO and ES and for the bridging factor in the IO. The RA and IO showed significant interaction between the intervention and bridge factors. Furthermore, IO/RA ratio during bridging on the floor (without arm movement, 2. 05 ± 2. 61; with arm movement, 3. 24 ± 3. 42) and bridging on the ball (without arm movement: 2. 95 ± 3. 87; with arm movement: 5. 77 ± 4. 85) showed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for, and <b>significant</b> interaction between the intervention and bridge factors. However, no <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> or interaction were found for the MF/ES ratio. These findings suggest that integrating arm movements during bridge exercises may be used to provide preferential loading to certain trunk muscle groups and that these effects may be better derived by performing bridge exercises on a therapeutic ball...|$|R

5000|$|Park (1990) {{found that}} [...] "only 16 {{empirical}} {{studies have been}} published on groupthink," [...] and concluded that they [...] "resulted in only partial support of his Janis's hypotheses." [...] Park concludes, [...] "despite Janis' claim that group cohesiveness is the major necessary antecedent factor, no research has showed a <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of cohesiveness on groupthink." [...] Park also concludes that research on the interaction between group cohesiveness and leadership style does not support Janis' claim that cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink symptoms. Park presents {{a summary of the}} results of the studies analyzed. According to Park, a study by Huseman and Drive (1979) indicates groupthink occurs in both small and large decision-making groups within businesses. This results partly from group isolation within the business. Manz and Sims (1982) conducted a study showing that autonomous work groups are susceptible to groupthink symptoms in the same manner as decisions making groups within businesses. Fodor and Smith (1982) produced a study revealing that group leaders with high power motivation create atmospheres more susceptible to groupthink. Leaders with high power motivation possess characteristics similar to leaders with a [...] "closed" [...] leadership style—an unwillingness to respect dissenting opinion. The same study indicates that level of group cohesiveness is insignificant in predicting groupthink occurrence. Park summarizes a study performed by Callaway, Marriott, and Esser (1985) in which groups with highly dominant members [...] "made higher quality decisions, exhibited lowered state of anxiety, took more time to reach a decision, and made more statements of disagreement/agreement." [...] Overall, groups with highly dominant members expressed characteristics inhibitory to groupthink. If highly dominant members are considered equivalent to leaders with high power motivation, the results of Callaway, Marriott, and Esser contradict the results of Fodor and Smith. A study by Leana (1985) indicates the interaction between level of group cohesion and leadership style is completely insignificant in predicting groupthink. This finding refutes Janis' claim that the factors of cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink. Park summarizes a study by McCauley (1989) in which structural conditions of the group were found to predict groupthink while situational conditions did not. The structural conditions included group insulation, group homogeneity, and promotional leadership. The situational conditions included group cohesion. These findings refute Janis' claim about group cohesiveness predicting groupthink.|$|E
