500|$|Kennedy's {{campaign}} {{staff was}} disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner. The Chappaquiddick incident {{emerged as a}} more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter. In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin. Kennedy's fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying [...] " [...] we'll see {{who is going to}} whip whose what." [...] Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, <b>saying</b> <b>at</b> Georgetown University: [...] "I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed." [...] However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter. During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled [...] "Where's Mary Jo?" [...] at him. In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.|$|E
