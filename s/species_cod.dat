50|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s were characterised {{by a sudden}} and unexplained {{increase}} in the abundance {{of a number of}} gadoid <b>species</b> (<b>cod,</b> haddock, whiting, etc.), the gadoid outburst. In this period the gadoid species in Scottish waters all produced a series of exceptionally strong year classes which have not been seen repeated in the intervening period. This great abundance, coupled with the price support system that subsidised fishermen when prices fell, contained in the CFP, lead to heavy investment in new boats, equipment and processing capacity in the Scottish whitefish fleet.|$|E
50|$|In the Baltic Sea, cod, herring, and sprat are {{considered}} the most important <b>species.</b> <b>Cod</b> is the top predator while the herring and sprat are recognized primarily as prey. This has been proven by many studies that analyze the stomach contents of such fish, often finding contents that immediately signify predation among the species. Although cod primarily feed on adult sprat, sprat tend to feed on cod before they have been fully developed. The sprat tends to prey on the cod eggs and larvae. Furthermore, sprat and herring {{are considered}} highly competitive for the same resources {{that are available to}} them. This is most present in the two species' vertical migration in the Baltic Sea, where they compete for the limited zooplankton that is available and necessary for their survival.|$|E

40|$|Since 1978 {{large numbers}} of harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) have invaded areas of North Norway in winter and spring. In 1987 and 1988 {{dramatic}} increases occurred both in magnitude and geographic extent of these seal invasions, and {{it is suggested that}} the collapse of the Barents Sea capelin stock in 1985 / 1986 may have been a contributory factor to this. Sampling of stomach contents for food analyses and of teeth for age determinations was carried out from harp seals taken as bycatch in Norwegian gill-net fisheries in 1986 and 1988. It appears that the seal herds comprised both immature and mature animals. The stomach analyses suggested that feeding was opportunistic, with a variety of fish (in particular the gadoid <b>species</b> <b>cod,</b> saithe, haddock and Norway pout, and the pelagic shoaling species herring and capelin) being taken as prey.

40|$|Exploitation {{alters the}} age {{structure}} of fish stocks. Several stock-specific {{studies have suggested}} that changes in the age structure might have consequences for subsequent recruitment, but the evidence is not universal. To investigate how common such effects are among 39 Northeast Atlantic fish stocks, relationships were tested between age structure (spawner mean age, age diversity, and proportion of recruit spawners) and recruitment (number of recruits, sensitivity to environment, and recruitment variability). Significant correlations in the expected direction were observed for a few stocks, but not for the majority; significant correlations in the opposite direction were also found. Meta-analyses combining the stock-level tests revealed that none of the effects were significant overall. However, effects were significant for some <b>species</b> (<b>cod,</b> haddock, and plaice) and indices. The low variability in the age structure might explain the absence of significant effects for individual stocks. Other reasons could be the absence of a biological basis (reproductive characteristics not dependent on age) or the stronger influence of environmental variability than of age structure on recruitment...|$|E
40|$|Data from 682 {{demersal}} trawls between 126 and 738 m {{were made}} on Flemish Cap in summer during the research surveys in the years 1989 - 1994. Despite {{the fact that the}} depth range for all species was not completely covered, analysis of the vertical distribution of the 25 most representative species showed that the fauna is zoned with depth. Distinct faunal assemblages with characteristic catch rates, diversity, and dominant species are found on the shelf (126 - 300 m), upper continental slope (300 - 600 m) and middle continental slope (> 600 m). Catch rates are greatist on the shelf and upper continental slope, as while as diversity is greatest on the middle continental slope. Dominance of the commercial <b>species</b> (<b>Cod,</b> Redfish, American plaice, Greenland halibut) is an important aspect of the community structure. Diversity patterns may be understood in terms of the relationships with predation, competition, environmental heterogeneity, and trophic level. Also the influence of the fisheries in the area can modify this structure.

40|$|Salmon farming {{has grown}} to be a highly {{successful}} sector in Norway. With the emergence of salmon farming commercial attention has also been brought to other farmable <b>species.</b> <b>Cod</b> farming emerged first during the eighties {{but it turned out}} that the innovation system was incapable of creating enough knowledge because there was little interaction between the actors. Today the cod farming sector is once again emerging. The firm structure in the sector is however fragmented. This paper focuses on heterogeneity in the cod farming sector by focussing on the interactive learning processes firms take part in. First by pointing to the environment that firms may interact in. Secondly, by analysing three firms interaction processes with this environment. It applies two ideal typical learning modes. This is learning by doing, using and interacting (the DUI-mode) and learning through science, technology and innovation (the STI-mode). I find that the firms develop different learning processes and accumulate knowledge in along different paths. The first firm is possible developing a lock in. The second is following a first mover dynamics, while the third firm has entered a massive learning phase. Policy implications are made...|$|E
40|$|A bioeconomic {{simulation}} {{model of the}} two interacting fish <b>species</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus) and their fisheries is presented and applied to assess the consequences {{of changes in the}} population dynamics of these important fish stocks in the Barents Sea. In each scenario, the population dynamics of the fish species are changed by an external reduction of the reproductive rates and/or the carrying capacities. The stock sizes and landings of fish are calculated for each fishing period and the net present values of profits from fishing are determined for time periods prior to and after the change in population dynamics. Results show that reduced growth rates or carrying capacities both lead to lower stock levels and consequently to smaller catch sizes. There is only a small short-term economic impact on the fisheries but the long-term consequences are quite pronounced. In some cases, a higher fishing activity in the first few years after the change in population dynamics causes harvest sizes to remain stable despite diminishing stock sizes. This stabilizes the returns from fishing in the short run but veils the apparent negative long-term impact on the fisheries resulting from adversely affected stock dynamics.

40|$|An {{extraction}} {{process for the}} recovery of proteolytic enzymes from the digestive tract of cod (Gadus morha) is described. Processing variables were optimized by employing a rotatable experimental design with computer graphics-assisted response surface methodology (RSM). A simple extraction procedure was developed which effectively isolated both acid and alkaline proteases from cod viscera with recovery yields of 52 % and 30 %, respectively. Further purification and characterization revealed that the crude acid proteases consisted of three types of gastric enzymes designated as acid proteases A, B, and C. Acid protease B was classified as fish pepsin II. Acid proteases A and C possessed properties similar to chymosin and gastricsin, respectively. The partially purified alkaline proteases possessed properties of trypsin-like enzymes and acted on N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (BTEE), a synthetic substrate for chymotrypsin. [...] Utilization of the crude isolated proteases was tested in milk-clotting for cheese making, as well as preparation of protein hydrolysates from under-utilized fish <b>species.</b> <b>Cod</b> pepsin was capable of clotting milk efficiently at low temperatures, which shows its potential use in cold renneting of milk.

40|$|Copepods in {{the genus}} Calanus are usually {{considered}} to be the preferred prey of gadoid larvae in many areas; however, in the Irish Sea, the abundances of these Calanus species are low and highly variable. We use this situation to test whether Calanus species are still actively selected by gadoid larvae in Calanus-poor environments. Diets of Irish Sea cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) were studied from the yolk-sac stage to the juvenile stage. Prey from stomach contents were compared with in situ abundance via an index of prey preference. As expected, all larvae selected copepod nauplii at the onset of feeding. As the larvae developed, their prey preferences changed and varied with <b>species.</b> <b>Cod</b> and whiting showed a similar transition of prey species preference, with a clear preference for Calanus species after metamorphosis, even in this area of low abundance of these Calanus species. The diet composition of haddock differed from that of cod and whiting, as nauplii remained in their diet later into development and there was little preference for individual copepod species detected. The differences in prey selectivity suggested between these gadoids may be attributed to their population variability through the known variability of their preferred prey item...|$|E
