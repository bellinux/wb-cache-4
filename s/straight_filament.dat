We select 4639 halo pairs with masses higher than 10 ^ 14 h^- 1 M_ from the simulations and investigate dark matter distributions between two haloes with ray-tracing simulations. In order to classify filament candidates, we estimate convergence profiles and perform profile fitting.

We find that 35 % of halo pairs possess <b>straight</b> <b>filaments,</b> 4 % of which can directly be detected at S/N≥ 2 with weak lensing. Furthermore, we study statistical properties of haloes at the edges of filaments.

40|$|Cosmic {{filaments}} {{play a role}} of bridges {{along which}} matter and gas accrete onto galaxies to trigger star formation and feed central black holes. Here we explore {{the correlations between the}} intrinsic properties of void galaxies and the linearity R_L of void filaments (degree of filament's straightness). We focus on void regions since the bridge effect of filaments should be most conspicuous in the pristine underdense regions like voids. Analyzing the Millennium-Run semi-analytic galaxy catalogue, we identify void filaments consisting of more than four galaxies (three edges) and calculate the means of central black hole mass, star formation rate, and stellar mass as a function of R_L. It is shown that the void galaxies constituting more <b>straight</b> <b>filaments</b> tend to have higher luminosity, more massive central black holes and higher star formation rate. Among the three properties, the central black hole mass is most strongly correlated with R_L. It is also shown that the dark halos constituting <b>straight</b> <b>filaments</b> tend to have similar masses. Our results suggest that the fuel-supply for central black holes and star formation of void galaxies occurs most efficiently along <b>straight</b> void <b>filaments</b> whose potential wells are generated by similar-mass dark halos.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the electrostatic {{problem of a}} thin, curved, cylindrical conductor, or a conducting filament, and shows that the corresponding linear charge density slowly tends to uniformity as the inverse of the logarithm of a characteristic parameter. An alternative derivation of this result directly based on energy minimization is developed. These results {{are based on a}} general asymptotic analysis of the electric field components and potential near a charge filament in the limit of vanishing diameter. It is found that the divergent parts of the radial and azimuthal electric field components, as well as the electric potential, are determined by the local charge density while the axial component is determined by the local dipole density. For a <b>straight</b> <b>filament,</b> these results reduce to those for conducting needles discussed in the literature. For curved filaments, there is an additional length scale in the problem arising from the finite radius of curvature of the filament. Remarkably, the basic uniformity result survives the added complications, which include an azimuthal variation in the surface charge density of the filament. These uniformity results yield an asymptotic formula for the capacitance of a curved filament that generalizes Maxwell's original result. The examples of a <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> with uniform and linearly varying charge densities, as well as a circular filament with a uniform charge distribution, are treated analytically and found to be in agreement with the results of the general analysis. Numerical calculations illustrating the slow convergence of linear charge distribution to uniformity for an elliptical filament are presented, and an interactive computer program implementing and animating the numerical calculations is provided.

40|$|A {{literature}} {{review of the}} state of the art of HTS AC losses and power devices determined that the subject of low AC loss HTS tapes required additional work and input and that these could be applied to HTS transformers to obtain a device with lowered AC loss compared to using <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> tape. A procedure for manufacturing short lengths of twisted filament tape, with novel matrix alloys, and physically distinct filaments was developed. Two alloys were used for the matrix material and the range of twist pitches was from 4 to 20 mm. Tapes samples with twist pitches of 10 and 8 mm were produced with Ic 2 ̆ 7 s of 40 A. The AC losses were measured at power fi-equencies in fields up to 0. 04 T using a pick-up loop and a lock-in amplifier technique. Control samples of HTS tapes with straight filaments were found to have an AC loss which was predicted very well by the estabhshed equations in the literature. Some twisted filament samples had an AC loss signature that showed a significant lowering of the losses in the range of 0. 01 to 0. 03 T. No <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> samples, however, were found to have lowered losses, including those with novel matrix alloys. Suitable materials for use at liquid nitrogen temperatures that can electrically insulate HTS tapes were investigated. It was found that many commonly available materials can be used in liquid nitrogen, however, the application method and adhesives must be considered.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} constant S of {{the model}} {{is related to the}} material property of the flagellum found from experiment such as the bending modulus A or the twist modulus C. This is done by measuring the response of a straight elastic rod representing the structural organization of the filament to a bending or twisting. This section describes the method used in determining S from the experimental values of A and C. The evaluation of S is done following a similar procedure as done in Ref (1). S from the flexural rigidity To express S in terms of the flexural rigidity, a <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> standing at the origin is considered. The structure of the filament is made to have the same molecular organization as the model. The centerline is chosen to lie along the z-axis. The filament is then bent at different values of curvature κ. For each κ, the elastic energy Eκ of the bent filament is calculated. First Eκ is evaluated using ENM based on the new local configuration (x’, y’, z’) of the bent filament. The new position (x’, y’, z’) can be expressed in terms of the material point (x, y, z) of the <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> by making use of the Frenet-Serret frame (2).

Here the plane of bending is chosen to be the y-z plane. The geometry of the filament centerline can be specified in terms of the Frenet-Serret frame that contains three unit vectors {t, n, b}, which form a right-handed orthonormal triad at any point s along the curve.

40|$|The {{presence}} of abundant neurofibrillary tangles {{in certain areas}} of the brain constitutes one of the defining pathological characteristics of Alzheimer disease.

Also found in tangles is the <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> (SF), a different kind of abnormal filament, about 15 nm wide, that does not exhibit the marked modulation in width shown by the PHF.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{structures}} of flagellar filaments reconstituted from various flagellins with small terminal truncations. Flagellins from Salmonella typhimurium strains SJW 1103 (wild type), SJW 1660, and SJW 1655 were used, which form a left-handed supercoil, the L- and R-type straight forms, respectively. Structure analyses were done by electron cryomicroscopy and helical image reconstruction with a help of x-ray fiber diffraction for determining precise helical symmetries. Truncation of either terminal region, irrespective of the original flagellin species, results in a <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> having a helical symmetry distinct either from the L- or R-type. This filament structure is named Lt-type. Although the local subunit packing is similar in all three types, a close comparison shows that the Lt-type packing is almost identical to the R-type but distinct from the L-type, which demonstrates the strong two-state preference of the subunit interactions. The structure clearly suggests that both termini {{are located in the}} inner tube of the concentric double-tubular structure of the filament core, and their proper interaction is responsible for the correct folding of fairly large terminal regions that form the inner tube.

40|$|The {{focus of}} {{research}} on the neurofibrillary pathology (NFP) of Alzheimer disease has been not only to determine the component forming the paired helical filaments but also to determine whether they result from abnormal processes affecting a single protein. Therefore, although these studies have lead to controversy concerning the respective contribution of components of microtubules and neurofilaments, there has been essentially no consideration of whether other cytoskeletal systems might also be involved and of what are the common features for the incorporated components. Particularly relevant to this issue is our finding that several antisera raised to either skeletal or smooth muscle tropomyosin, a microfilament component, intensely recognize NFP. These antibodies continue to recognize NFP after affinity purification to tropomyosin or paired helical filament fractions. We show that the antibodies do not recognize NFP due to cross-reactivity with the previously identified NFP components related to neurofilaments and microtubules, tau, and MAP 2, or neurofilament proteins because the antisera did not recognize these proteins on immunoblots or were not adsorbable by the proteins. Ultrastructural analysis of the immunoreaction showed that tropomyosin-related epitopes were clustered rather than uniformly distributed along paired helical and <b>straight</b> <b>filaments.</b> Although the distribution suggests that tropomyosin is an NFP-associated protein, its retention by paired helical and <b>straight</b> <b>filaments</b> after detergent extraction indicates that it is an integral component strongly and specifically associated with the filaments characteristic of NFP. These findings indicate that NFP involves the three primary neuronal cytoskeletal filament systems, microtubules, neurofilaments, as well as microfilaments, and therefore that NFP probably results from the reorganization of these normal filaments that interact to comprise the cytomatrix and may continue this interaction under the pathologic condition of Alzheimer's disease to generate novel, abnormal polymers...|$|R
30|$|Given their {{structural}} makeup, filaments {{of different}} polymorphic forms {{can be obtained}} by using different flagellin types from different bacterial strains or by mixing different quantities of flagellin obtained from L-type and R-type <b>straight</b> <b>filaments</b> [23]. However, a filament’s polymorphic configuration depends not only on the flagellin type, it also depends upon environmental conditions (i.e. pH, ionic strength, and temperature) as established in a series of experiments by Kamiya and Asakura [11, 12, 24]. Most of these experiments were performed with wild-type strains of Salmonella, but identical results were obtained with an E. coli K 12 strain [25]. As an example, filaments in 0.1  M KCl buffer expose to a raise in pH from 7 to 9 changes from the normal form to the coil form, which consequentially reduces their end-to-end length by about a factor of nearly 3. The flagellar filament also have an induced dipole moment of 5 [*]×[*] 10 - 24 C⋅m in an electric field of E[*]=[*] 106  V/m [26].

We detect long, filamentary [Fe II] emission delineating the inner edge of the radio emission in the western boundary of the remnant in imaging observations, together with a bright [Fe II] emission clump close to the remnant center. There appears to be faint, diffuse [Fe II] emission between the central clump and the western filamentary emission. The spectroscopic observations determine the expansion velocity of the central clump to be ~ 56 km/s. This is far smaller than the expansion velocity of 3 C 396 obtained from X-ray observations, implying the inhomogeneity of the ambient medium. The electron number density of the [Fe II] emission gas is < 2, 000 cm- 3. The H 2 line emission, on the other hand, lies slightly outside the filamentary [Fe II] emission in the western boundary, and forms a rather <b>straight</b> <b>filament.</b> We suggest that the [Fe II] emission represents dense clumps in the wind material from the red supergiant phase of a Type IIL/b progenitor of 3 C 396 which have been swept up by the supernova remnant shocks.

40|$|Pick's disease, {{a form of}} {{progressive}} senile dementia, is distinguished {{by the presence of}} neuronal inclusions known as Pick's bodies. The Pick's body consists mostly of sparse 10 - 20 -nm straight filaments admixed with other cytoplasmic elements. This ultrastructural study was undertaken to establish which components of the Pick's body share epitopes with the normal neuronal cytoskeleton and with Alzheimer's paired helical filaments. Vibratome sections from postmortem brains of patients afflicted with Pick's disease were immunostained by means of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments, an antiserum to microtubule proteins not cross-reacting with neurofilaments, and an antiserum to Alzheimer's paired helical filaments. All the antibodies have been shown previously to react with Alzheimer's paired helical filaments. The peroxidase-antiperoxidase or indirect immunogold procedure was used for immunostaining. In addition, we used Bodian's silver stain, which has a high affinity for neurofilaments. At the electron-microscopic level the antibodies and Bodian's silver reacted with the straight filaments and some amorphous elements contained within the Pick's body. The following preadsorptions blocked the immunoreaction: neurofilament antibodies with neurofilaments; microtubule antibodies with microtubule protein or a preparation of the microtubule associate protein, tau; antibodies to paired helical filaments with Alzheimer's brain tissue. Treatment of brain tissue containing Pick's bodies with sodium dodecyl sulfate, a solvent of the normal neuronal cytoskeleton, did not dissolve straight 12 -nm filaments. The detergent extracted filaments contained the same isotopes as the Pick's filaments in intact tissue. These results demonstrate that the <b>straight</b> <b>filament</b> components of the Pick's body contain the same neurofilament and microtubule epitopes as the Alzheimer's paired helical filaments and that the filaments share insolubility characteristics {{similar to those of the}} paired helical filaments. It is proposed that these two structures are related and are derived at least in part from altered components of the normal neuronal cytoskeleton...|$|E
50|$|The genus Streptomyces {{includes}} aerobic, Gram-positive, {{filamentous bacteria}} that produce well-developed vegetative hyphae (between 0.5-2.0 µm in diameter) with branches. They form a complex substrate mycelium that aids in scavenging organic compounds from their substrates. Although the mycelia and the aerial hyphae {{that arise from}} them are amotile, mobility is achieved by dispersion of spores. Spore surfaces may be hairy, rugose, smooth, spiny or warty. In some species, aerial hyphae consist of long, <b>straight</b> <b>filaments,</b> which bear 50 or more spores at more or less regular intervals, arranged in whorls (verticils). Each branch of a verticil produces, at its apex, an umbel, which carries from two to several chains of spherical to ellipsoidal, smooth or rugose spores. Some strains form short chains of spores on substrate hyphae. Sclerotia-, pycnidia-, sporangia-, and synnemata-like structures are produced by some strains.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{mobility}} {{is powered}} by rotation of helical flagellar filaments driven by rotary motors. Flagellin isolated from Salmonella Typhimurium SJW 1660 strain, which differs by a point mutation from the wild-type strain, assembles into <b>straight</b> <b>filaments</b> in which flagellin monomers are arranged into left-handed helix. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and osmotic stress methods, we investigated the high-resolution structure of SJW 1660 flagellar filaments as well as intermolecular forces that govern their assembly into dense hexagonal bundle. The scattering data were fitted to high-resolution models, which took into account the atomic structure of the flagellin subunits. The analysis revealed the exact helical arrangement and the super-helical twist of the flagellin subunits within the filaments. Under osmotic stress the filaments formed 2 D hexagonal bundles. Monte-Carlo simulations and continuum theories were {{used to analyze the}} scattering data from hexagonal arrays, revealing how bulk modulus, as well as how the deflection length depends on the applied osmotic stress. Scattering data from aligned flagellar bundles confirmed the predicated structure-factor scattering peak line-shape. Quantitative analysis of the measured equation of state of the bundles revealed the contributions of the electrostatic, hydration, and elastic interactions to the intermolecular interactions associated with bundling of <b>straight</b> semi-flexible flagellar <b>filaments.</b> ...|$|R

The resulting expression describes both the scattered sound field and the entrainment of the incident wave in the velocity field of the vortex...|$|R
