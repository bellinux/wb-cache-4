5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham {{during most}} of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom <b>Serious</b> <b>Fraud</b> Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the <b>Serious</b> <b>Fraud</b> Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E

5|$|Argentine Sergio Rinland {{designed}} the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when Yamaha powered the cars. In the 1992 season the cars (which were updated {{versions of the}} 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner, Ayrton Senna. After {{the end of that}} race the team ran out of funds and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the £6million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into administration. The <b>Serious</b> <b>Fraud</b> Office investigated the case. Landhurst's managing directors were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge. It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. (cf March Engineering, Fondmetal and Andrea Moda Formula). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's receivers in 1993. Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash. The factory was bought by the Carlin DPR GP2 motor racing team in 2006.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{has brought to}} light diffuse opportunistic behaviour and some <b>serious</b> <b>frauds.</b> Because of this trust towards banks, bankers, brokers {{and the stock market}} has collapsed to unprecedented levels and there are so far no signs of recovery. This paper uses survey-based information to document the collapse of trust, show its link to the emergence of frauds in the financial industry and discuss its consequences for the demand of financial instruments, investors portfolios and more generally investors reliance on financial markets. It argues that unless serious changes happen in the behaviour of the financial industry, the move towards safer portfolios and away from ambiguous securities that lack of trust entails, will have adverse effects on the availability and cost of equity financing. Accordingly a number of proposals to restore trust are discussed. Their common feature is to restore trust – a belief – by limiting the scope for opportunistic behaviour through a transfer of power from financial intermediaries to investors. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} comment on some general {{things about the}} state of {{penalties}} not just for fraud in particular, but for white-collar crime in general. There are two simple reasons for this. First, the problem of unsatisfactory penalties for fraud is part of a more general problem of limp or inappropriate penalties for white-collar crime. Second, <b>fraud</b> is a <b>serious</b> part of the problem in almost every area of white-collar crime. In environmental regulation, there are problems with providing false effluent data to regulators; with pharmaceuticals regulation, there have been very serious problems of health authorities being provided with fraudulent data on the safety and efficacy of drugs. Fraud is a major issue in the regulation of companies and securities, prudential regulation (banking, insurance), occupational health and safety and consumer protection. Too often we forget that not only does fraud cost us millions of dollars, fraud also kills. In Australia, we have been woefully neglectful of frauds that put lives at risk. The most <b>serious</b> <b>frauds,</b> particularly of the latter life-threatening sort, are perpetrated by corporations. For this reason, this paper will concentrate o...|$|R

40|$|Criminal {{prosecution}} {{has been used}} with increasing frequency recently {{in connection with a}} variety of business failures and other financial offenses. Indeed, it appears that there are few such offenses that cannot be prosecuted criminally even though they also give rise to civil remedies. While some such offenses seem to be quite <b>serious</b> <b>frauds,</b> others seem to be as minor as getting the accounting rules wrong. Thus, the question addressed in this essay is how to define a business crime and what should be the proper role of criminal prosecution in connection with business offenses. I start with the proposition that we should criminalize conduct only when lesser remedies do not work to deter the offense. I then describe the array of private civil remedies available, ranging from simple compensatory damages to punitive damages to class actions and derivative actions and find that there are few business offenses that cannot be well addressed by these devices. I conclude that as a general matter private civil remedies are much more efficient at addressing business and financial crimes. The expansion of criminal prosecution may be due to some extent to problems with the way civil remedies work in practice, {{but for the most part}} it is difficult to explain except as a result of failure to understand the role of criminal law and to define financial crimes with any precision...|$|R
