40|$|Summary: This article aims to {{identify}} the link between EU electoral rights and national citizenship and to situate these rights in the broader context of EU citizenship. For these purposes, two recent judgments of the European Court of Justice regarding EU elections dated 12 September 2006 are discussed (Spain v United Kingdom and Eman & Sevinger). These judgments establish important principles for {{the election of the}} European Parliament, especially the <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> of recognised electoral rights of EU citizens and the boundaries framing national policies in this respect. They either leave Member States free to apply residence criteria in order to limit the <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> of EU electoral rights or to invoke their own constitutional traditions to extend that scope. This is not to say, however, that the Member States enjoy complete freedom in this respect. The paper concludes that the current fundaments of EU citizenship are weak in EU primary law, in particular in the field of political rights. For this reason, the European elections and, more generally, the European democratic process should be discussed once again at the highest political level...|$|E

Many perpetrators of these atrocities are unlikely to be prosecuted on national level; thus if justice is sought, international law must be utilized. To provide further guidance in this area, the International Law Commission submitted a draft in 1991 of its work on a Code that creates new laws, reiterates existing conventional law, and codifies customary international law. This thesis analyzes individual responsibility and the <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> which crimes are covered, the process of enforcement and in what international court, and under what types of armed conflict the law applies under both existing international law and the ILC Draft of 1991...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to assess the main {{challenges}} {{to the principle of}} free movement of persons in theory and practice in an enlarged European Union. The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of EU citizenship. The <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and {{the current state of the}} principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the European Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This working document addresses these questions along with: 1. Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? 2. What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? 3. To what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm...|$|E

40|$|In her {{influential}} book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt coined,by {{reference to}} Kant, the phrase “the {{right to have}} rights” 1 {{to refer to the}} fundamental right to belong to an organized community. This right is the precondition for being granted any particular set of individual rights at all, and namely rights not only to freedom but also to action and opinion. This constitutes an illuminating approach to the concept of citizenship. First, only the citizen is vested with the privileged status to be a full member of the polity. Second, the citizen alone can act autonomously in the political sense of being his own master. Citizenship, thus,works as a means of both inclusion and exclusion, and only those included are empowered to shape their polity through the democratic process. By the same token, citizenship establishes a bond of affiliation between the polity and the citizens, which fosters social identity. Hence, it is no exaggeration to say that the concept of citizenship epitomizes the modern political ideal of freedom and equality under law. Given that citizenship is of such paramount importance in the national polity, the introduction of a citizenship of the European Union (EU) within the Treaty on EU in 1992 raised many hopes. Since the late 1980 s, the Union was increasingly deemed to suffer from a democratic deficit. 2 This deficit was often attributed to the lack of a European demos sharing a common identity. 3 EU citizenship was, therefore, regarded as the perfect means to placate the rampant legitimacy crisis in the EU. At first, however, the catalogue of Union citizenship rights enshrined in Articles 17 – 21 (after the renumbering at Amsterdam) of the Treaty establishing the European Community was not thought to live up to these expectations. Union citizenship rights’ positive guarantees were at most a reiteration of existing rights of free movement under the restrictive conditions of the common market regime. Grouping those rights under the pompous title of Union citizenship was perceived by some {{as little more than a}} misnomer. Notwithstanding this poor start, things began to change in the early 2000 s, mainly through the intervention of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Thanks to the latter’s case-law, both the <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and the scope ratione materiae of Union citizenship rights have gradually been broadened...|$|E

40|$|State {{immunity}} {{under international}} law extends to protect some individuals from criminal prosecution before national courts. This thesis aims to identify which individuals are immune from prosecution before the English courts, for what conduct, and for what period. The justifications for immunity are examined, {{and the extent of}} immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and immunity <b>ratione</b> materiae are explored. This thesis argues that immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> is only narrowly available to high state officials, and that the immunity accorded, by consent, to special missions is sufficient to cover other official visits. In Pinochet (No 3) all seven judges agreed: 1. An ex-head of state is immune from prosecution for murder and conspiracy to murder alleged to have been committed in the forum state. 2. All state officials no matter how minor are entitled to continuing immunity This thesis analyses state practice in arresting or prosecuting foreign state officials, and argues that both of these statements are incorrect. This thesis argues that immunity does not attach to conduct alone, for a person to have continuing immunity ratione materiae they must have had immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae.</b> The forum state must have agreed to the official being present on its territory, and agreed to the purpose of the visit. Those officials present on the territory of a foreign state with the consent of that state who have immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> have continuing immunity ratione materiae only for official conduct, acta jure imperii. This does not extend to acts of violence. Finally the development of the regime for the prosecution and punishment of international crimes by national courts is considered. The conflict with immunity is examined, and a possible reconciliation between the two principles is suggested by using the complementarity principle in the statute of the International Criminal Court.

40|$|To date, investor-state tribunals {{have been}} preoccupied {{with a range}} of issues {{revolving}} around the territorial application (territoriality) of international investment agreements (IIAs). The importance, as well as the various forms such issues take, has recently been highlighted in the decision of the Singapore High Court (SGHC) in Laos v. Sanum. In this case, the SGHC was asked by Laos to set aside an earlier arbitral award (in Sanum v. Laos), filed by a Macanese legal entity and rendered under the China-Laos bilateral investment treaty (BIT). In approaching the matter, the SGHC set aside the award {{on the grounds that the}} China-Laos BIT did not extend to Macao. This decision has provoked mixed feelings, as it may weigh heavily against the territorial application of Chinese IIAs to Hong Kong and Macao. At the same time, from an academic perspective, the decision provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the territorial elements inherent to jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> as this pertains to international investment law. Within this setting, this article seeks to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing future investor-state arbitration disputes under IIAs where similar territorial application issues may arise. This article is nevertheless limited to issues of jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae.</b> Therefore, the territorial nexus of investments, particularly as it pertains to cases involving sovereign bonds, is not addressed in this article. In addition, this article does not intend to address territorial issues connected to the so-called nationality planning and treaty shopping techniques as well as the various approaches followed in piercing the corporate veil of foreign investors. To be more precise, while this article deals with issues of jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> in general, it mainly focuses on the nationality of legal entities to the extent it relates to the notion of territory...|$|R
50|$|Immunity from {{prosecution}} is {{a doctrine of}} international law that allows an accused to avoid prosecution for criminal offences. Immunities are of two types. The first is functional immunity, or immunity ratione materiae. This is an immunity granted to people who perform certain functions of state. The second is personal immunity, or immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae.</b> This is an immunity granted to certain officials because of the office they hold, rather than {{in relation to the}} act they have committed.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between State immunity and diplomatic immunity {{has always been}} a rather complex one. The two concepts undoubtedly have a common juridical background {{in the form of the}} concepts of sovereignty, independence and dignity. 1 On the other hand, recent developments in both fields have seen a move towards a more functional-based approach. Thus, in relation to diplomatic immunity, the dominant theoretical basis is that of functional necessity. 2 As regards State immunity, recent developments in both international law 3 and, more particularly, in UK law 4, from absolute to restrictive State immunity, have resulted in a more functionally orientated approach, that is, a shift of emphasis in matters of State immunity from immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> to immunity <b>ratione</b> materiae. 5 Now two recent cases in the United Kingdom have raised the possibility that, in the case of diplomats at least, the two concepts may be combined to provide a double immunity for diplomatic agents against civil suit. More controversially, the cases have raised the possibility of a third type of protection based upon immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> in what could be said to amount to a modified act of State doctrine. The cases in question are Propend Finance Pty Ltd. v. Alan Sing and The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police 6 and Re P (Diplomatic Immunity: Jurisdiction). ...|$|R

For the purpose of this article, the broader notion of jurisdiction including all three areas is applied. ...|$|R

This paper addressed three reasons explaining why international legal scholars are so inclined (or tempted) to defend the heterogeneity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> of international lawmaking processes. There are surely other explanations, which are left for further research and discussion. The three factors examined here should, however, suffice to make us realize how amenable we are towards te idea of the heterogeneity of international lawmaking and help us rein in that powerful temptation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the history and current state of state official immunity in international criminal law. First, I define the most relevant legal concepts. These include: (a) individual criminal responsibility; (b) international criminal law; (c) criminal jurisdiction; (d) the distinction between state immunity, diplomatic immunity, and immunity of state senior state officials; (e) imunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and immunity <b>ratione</b> materiae; and (f) state officials. Given the distinictions between national and international fora, different sets of legal issues concerning immunity arise before them. I thus deal with the two types of immunity seperately. In so doing, I present and analyze specific court descisions supporting or rejecting immunity. I argue that the case law and doctrine indicate that a number of conceptual questions remain unresolved...|$|R

Within this variety of legal regimes the concept of immunity does not have uniform application, and conflicts between the regimes as such are obvious. The rejection of immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> in the legal regimes composed by international tribunals is {{an exception to the}} general rule applicable in the regime of domestic {{criminal law}}s.

This analysis is further subdivided into two parts: firstly, as {{to the nature of the}} issues that could be brought before the PCIJ; and secondly, as to the extent that the PCIJ could deviate from, or "reformulate", the question put to it.

50|$|The ICJ {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} the objection on 25 March 1947, voting fifteen-to-one, with Igor Daxner—Albania's designated ad hoc judge—being the sole dissenter. The majority held that Albania had voluntarily submitted to {{the jurisdiction of the}} International Court. Specifically, two successive pieces of correspondence were held to have established Albania's informal submission to the Court's jurisdiction: the British transmission of the application to Albania, followed by the Albanian letter to the Court. These documents established jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and <b>ratione</b> materiae. An important factor in this decision {{was the fact that the}} Albanian letter had not been produced by Albania's Agent, but by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. In a separate opinion, while concurring with the majority that Albania had voluntarily submitted to the Court's jurisdiction, Judges Basdevant, Álvarez, Winiarski, Zoričić, de Visscher, Badawi, and Krylov argued that the Security Council's Article 36 recommendation did not place the case within the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.|$|R
40|$|Supervisor: Prof. Marise CremonaAward date: 1 September 2012 The {{main subject}} of the thesis focuses {{on the concept of}} {{jurisdiction}} and its limits, with special attention put to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The first half of the work delivers the broad theoretical approach concerning types of jurisdictions and the notion of forum shopping. As far as the Court of Justice of the European Union is concerned, not only it describes its jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> <b>ratione</b> materiae, and defines its exclusivity, especially in the dimension of external relations of the EU, but it also presents the possible conflicting or complementary judicial regimes. Thus, the most important stress is given to the problem of overlapping jurisdiction in the context of international relations of the EU and the principle of the autonomy of the EU legal order. The second half of the work is dedicated to the practical example of the mixed agreement -United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - which has particular effects on the area of the competences of the EU and on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court. The Swordfish dispute and the MOX Plant dispute, taken as examples, bring relevant input, especially to the case of jurisdictional conflicts in front of mixed agreements. To sum-up, the thesis contributes to the delineation of the jurisdictional competence of the European Court of Justice as a mechanism that functions in very autonomous legal regime of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|Turkey's {{obligations}} under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees are confined to European refugees. However, when certain conditions are met, Turkey grants temporary stay to non-European refugees {{with a view to}} enabling them to resettle in a third state. The task of finding resettlement places falls to UNHCR Turkey, which presupposes that the refugees concerned are eligible for refugee status under UNHCR's mandate. This arrangement means that non-European refugees are subject to two different eligibility procedures. A series of recent judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, including, in particular, D. and others v. Turkey and Abdolkhani and Karimnia, highlight the plight of non-European refugees in Turkey, the relationship between UNHCR and Turkey, and the practice of dual track refugee status determination: one undertaken by the domestic authorities and a parallel procedure undertaken by UNHCR.

40|$|In Belgium, {{as in many}} European jurisdictions, {{marriage}} and registered partnership are subject to different legal rules. In this contribution, it is analysed whether the difference in treatment between these relationship regimes is still justified. Registered partnership is not conceived uniformly throughout Europe. This {{is reflected in the}} judgements of the European Court of Justice and the European Union law concerning registered partnership and marriage, which often differentiate according to the type of registered partnership concerned. Although the concept of registered partnership is increasingly acknowledged on a European level and included in European legislation, the interpretation of registered partnership is left to national law. All types of registered partnership do however enjoy protection under the European Convention of Human Rights. As regards the Belgian registered partnership, the regulatory regimes for {{marriage and}} wettelijke samenwoning/cohabitation légale should remain different. However, a threefold reform seems appropriate in order to upgrade the current wettelijke samenwoning to a full relationship regime, not equal to marriage, but an alternative to marriage of equal value. In this respect, it is recommended to assimilate the field of application <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> of the wettelijke samenwoning to that of marriage, to revaluate its primary regime, and to introduce an optional partnership property regime. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the Immunities of State officials, which arise under International law, from foreign {{criminal}} jurisdiction. The first goal of this thesis is to determine whether, and if so, under which conditions and in which cases can one sovereign State exercise its criminal jurisdiction over an official of another sovereign State. The second goal, closely attached to the first finding, is to determine whether, and if so, under which conditions and in which cases would such officials be protected and covered by the immunity and in which cases such immunity applies. The main task of this thesis is to analyse {{the current state of}} the application of immunities of State officials within the foreign criminal jurisdiction. These immunities are with regard to their different purpose and functions recognized in two diverse types - immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and immunity <b>ratione</b> materiae. The first chapter put emphasis on the criminal jurisdiction of foreign State in general and on its extraterritorial forms in particular. The exercise of such jurisdiction in some cases enables to prosecute and punish an official of a foreign State, who happens to be a criminal.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} state officials are subject to prosecution in foreign domestic courts for international crimes. We consider the different types of immunity that international law accords to state officials, the reasons for the conferment of this immunity and whether they apply in cases in which it is alleged that the official has committed an international crime. We argue that personal immunity (immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae)</b> continues to apply even where prosecution is sought for international crimes. Also we consider that instead of a single category of personal immunity there are in fact two types of such immunity and that one type extends beyond senior officials such as the Head of State and Head of Government. Most of the article deals with functional immunity (immunity ratione materiae). We take the view that this type of immunity does not apply in the case of domestic prosecution of foreign officials for most international crimes. However, we reject the traditional arguments which have been put forward by scholars and courts in support of this view. Instead we consider the key to understanding when functional immunity is available lies in examining how jurisdiction is conferred on domestic courts. © EJIL 2011; all rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The International Law Commission {{held its}} sixty-fifth session in Geneva from May 6 to June 7 and from July 8 to August 9, 2013. The Commission devoted {{most of the}} sixty-fifth session to {{discussing}} three topics: immunity of state officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction; subsequent agreements and subsequent practice {{in relation to the}} interpretation of treaties; and protection of persons in the event of disasters. Notably, the Commission adopted three draft articles and commentary identifying three senior governmental officials as entitled to immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> from foreign criminal jurisdiction – heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers – for their public or private acts, an immunity that ceases once they leave office. Work also continued on four other topics already on the Commission’s current program of work (identification of customary international law, provisional application of treaties, the obligation to extradite or prosecute, and the most-favored-nation clause), while new topics on protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts and on protection of the atmosphere were added to the program. At the prior (sixty-fourth) session, the Commission had adopted thirty-two draft articles, together with commentaries, on the topic of expulsion of aliens, and is awaiting the comments and observations of governments on those draft articles to be submitted by 2014.

40|$|European Union {{citizenship}} {{was established}} by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992. Intended to fall within the exclusive prerogative of the Member States, {{it soon became clear}} that the autonomy of Member States to determine matters relating to nationality would be restricted by the ever-expansive reach of the European Court of Justice. As such, the European Court of Justice transformed the law on citizenship in the 2010 case of Rottmann where measures affecting or depriving the rights conferred and protected by the European Union were held to fall within the <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> materiae of European Union law. While Rottmann affirmed the law as to the deprivation of European Union citizenship, it left unanswered the question whether the acquisition of nationality also falls within the scope of European Union law. This paper aims to identify and analyse the law arising post-Rottmann to determine whether the acquisition of nationality could fall within the scope of European Union law.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{projected}} Arab Court of Justice (ACJ) as a regional court, expected to be created within the League of Arab States system. Chapter one deals mainly with {{the basic structure of}} the League of Arab States itself, its membership, its organs, the settlement of disputes, and the reasons that are delaying the creation of the ACJ and the role it will be expected to play in settling inter-Arab disputes. In the second chapter comprehensive information on the function of the judicial power in Islamic Shariah is presented, including the status of judges in Islam, their appointment, qualifications, independence and other issues related to them. Chapter three concentrates on the organisation of the projected ACJ, comparing its draft Statute with the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other regional international courts. The chapter will also show how far the Arab draftsmen have been influenced by principles and rules of Islamic Shariah, especially in matters relating to the qualification of judges. Furthermore, the chapter will discuss other points related to the organisation of the bench such as nomination of candidates, system of election, constituting chambers, appointing ad hoc judges etc. The fourth chapter explains in detail at the level of theory as well as of practice the role of Islamic Shariah as a source to be applied by the projected ACJ. The chapter points to the need to discuss the origins and fundamental conceptions of Islamic Shariah as a law capable to be applied by the projected ACJ. Chapter five continues with a discussion of the jurisdiction of the ACJ, and makes detailed reference to the concepts of jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> <b>ratione</b> materiae and the function of the ACJ to give advisory opinions. The thesis considers whether the Arab drafters have developed the above terms or have simply adopted them as they exist in the Statute of the International Court of Justice.

40|$|Abstract: The European Union {{suffers from}} an empty formalistic {{reading of the}} {{principle}} of equality when dealing with situations where different legal orders legitimately compete, aspiring to regulate the condition of the same persons in the same circumstances. Consequently, equality before the law is not safeguarded in the Union, and a radical reform of the procedural reading {{of the principle of}} equality is required. Most importantly, to live up to being a true principle of EU law, equality in the EU needs to acquire a substantive component which is entirely missing at the moment. This paper looks at the procedural vistas informing the ECJ‘s attempts to address the EU‘s fundamental problems through the redefinition of the <b>scope</b> <b>ratione</b> materiae of EU law following the introduction of Union citizenship, only to find the outcomes of such efforts inadequate and potentially dangerous {{for the rule of law}} in Europe. It is suggested that a substantive approach to equality could be employed instead, and that the idea of respect, lying just as equality itself, at the core of the notion of citizenship Ã¢â¬ and the law as such Ã¢â¬ could supply the missing core of the equality principle, providing the much-needed cure for some crucial deficiencies of EU law as it currently stands. citizenship; federalism; nationality; sovereignty; competences; European citizenship; European law; German Constitutional Court; non-discrimination; reverse discrimination...|$|R

Furthermore, foreigners without a fixed abode in Holland fell into this category.

Furthermore, important land-use cases, and conflicts between local governments fell under its jurisdiction, as did legal actions in connection with Possession (as opposed to Property actions). The last category was transferred to the original jurisdiction of the Hoge Raad after 1582, as was the original jurisdiction over cases of maritime law, and the grant of middelen van herstel en gunst (certain legal actions like e.g. the Cession of property by a debtor to his creditor). Unfortunately, when the Hoge Raad received its Instruction from the States-General in 1582 the Instruction of the Hof was not changed {{at the same time to}} reflect the transfer of competences in these respects. The Hof therefore continued hearing cases that formally belonged to the Hoge Raad which caused some competition between the two courts. Only in 1660 did the States of Holland resolve that in possession cases each court had to inform the other of such cases to make some coordination possible.|$|R
50|$|Applications by {{individuals}} against contracting states, {{alleging that the}} state violates their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, {{can be made by}} any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the Court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative. Once registered with the Court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of ratione materiae, ratione temporis or <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the Court, or with another procedure of international investigation. If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a Chamber of the Court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case. The Chamber of the Court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the Chamber of the Court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.|$|R
40|$|PhDThe World Bank {{produces}} sample bidding {{documents for}} use by its member countries to prepare tender forms and contract conditions for Bankfinanced civil engineering construction contracts. The contract conditions provide for arbitration of disputes and parties to a contract may choose {{to submit to the}} International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) which was established by members of the World Bank for the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states. The objectives of the Thesis are to (i) examine the legality of generally submitting disputes in international civil engineering contracts to ICSID arbitration, (ii) provide an analysis of ICSID as an international arbitral institution and (iii) discuss the legal aspects of submission of disputes to ICSID arbitration in breach of the Convention that established ICSID. Chapters One, Two and Three are devoted to describing the importance of civil engineering works to economic growth and arbitration as a method of resolution of disputes. An analysis is made of the fundamentals and complexity of the arbitral process and the interfacing between legal systems, national laws and international law in international arbitrations. Chapter Four traces the genesis of ICSID and Chapter Five examines critically the salient features of ICSID arbitration, which according to the Thesis are not all exclusive to ICSID arbitration. Chapters Six and Seven analyse in depth ICSID jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and <b>ratione</b> materiae. Chapter Eight argues that disputes in freestanding international civil engineering contracts are not investment disputes and that submission to ICSID is in breach of the Convention. Chapters Nine and Ten discuss the legitimate role of ICSID in developing rules of international economic law and conclude by recommending that ICSID should not detract from that role by becoming just another arbitral institution in. the business of arbitration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReasoning {{refers to}} the {{application}} of the rule, once interpreted, to the facts of the cause established by the Court and to the deduction of the conclusion of an infringement or non-infringement – in the respective case – of the rule invoked. The order of the examination of the questions – classical according to the opinion of a French judge – is the following: the competence of the Court, the admission of the petition, a good substantiation of the demand. The competence can be denied for incompatibility ratione materiae, if the litigation is outside the material domain of application of the Convention, <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> if the defendant State {{is not part of the}} Convention or if the defendant is not the State or State-related; finally, ratione temporis, if the defendant State did not ratify the Convention or the pertinent protocol at the date when the facts were committed. The issue of the incompetence ratione loci is out of the question. Certainly, we can mention that renunciation exists and it triggers the disappearance of the case from the Court's roll; yet, the priority of this situation over that of incompetence is not solved as clearly as via the French administrative jurisprudence. Actually, the competence-related issues are dealt with by the Convention organs, the Commission and then the Court, as admission issues, which the State solves with the help of some preliminary exceptions or which the Court solves ex officio. Finally, it is essential that the European Court of Human Rights must defend the persons against the abusive violation of their rights by States, without condemning them systematically and a priori. And after 50 years of jurisprudence, we consider that, neither systematic, nor dogmatic, the reasoning of the Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg tends to evolve towards a pragmatic syncretism, which seems to us to be an acceptable possible approach...|$|R
5000|$|In the Instructions {{that were}} drawn up since 1462 the {{jurisdiction}} of the court as a tribunal of first instance was defined according to people who fell under its jurisdiction (<b>ratione</b> <b>personae)</b> and subject matters (ratione materiae) under its jurisdiction. In the category of people fell privileged persons like noblemen, Church officials and government officials, and [...] "defenseless" [...] people like women, clergymen, and widows and orphans, who deserved the special protection of the Count. Furthermore, foreigners without a fixed abode in Holland fell into this category. As to subject matter for the original jurisdiction of the court: all matters of concern to the Count, like his feudal Fees and domains, his rights (like Mint and High justice), and offices in his gift (read for [...] "Count" [...] after 1572 the States of Holland and Zeeland, who had already de facto taken over his sovereignty).
