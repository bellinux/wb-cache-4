The thickness of the two <b>sublayers</b> was expressed in terms of a factor called the <b>sublayering</b> ratio.

Identical <b>sublayers</b> are separated by thin impermeable barriers. A linear stability analysis is performed, and dispersion relations are obtained directly and explicitly for two- and three-layer configurations. A systematic numerical procedure is devised to compute the dispersion relation for an arbitrary number of <b>sublayers,</b> but from this {{it is possible to}} guess the correct analytical form of the dispersion relation for general cases. Neutral stability curves are found to organise themselves into natural groups of N members when there are N <b>sublayers.</b> When the disturbance wavenumber, k, is large, each member of any group lies within an O(k- 1) distance of all other members, but within an O(1) distance of other groups. When the number of <b>sublayers</b> is large, the system tends towards one with a critical Darcy-Rayleigh number of 12 and a critical wavenumber of zero; this is the well-known property of a single porous layer with constant heat flux boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} present paper is to investigate the onset of convection in a horizontal layer heated from below which consists of distinct porous <b>sublayers</b> which are separated by solid heat-conducting partitions. Each of the porous <b>sublayers</b> are identical as are the solid partitions. The present analysis employs linearised stability theory and a dispersion relation is derived from which neutral curves may be computed.

We attempt to give a comprehensive physical understanding of the effect of the number of layer, the relative thickness of the partitions and the conductivity ratio on the onset of convection and the form taken by the onset modes.
