50|$|A {{somewhat}} different arrangement of heliostats {{in a field}} is used at experimental <b>solar</b> <b>furnaces,</b> {{such as the one}} at Odeillo, in France. All the heliostat mirrors send accurately parallel beams of light into a large paraboloidal reflector which brings them to a precise focus. The mirrors have to be located close enough to the axis of the paraboloid to reflect sunlight into it along lines parallel to the axis, so the field of heliostats has to be narrow. A closed loop control system is used. Sensors determine if any of the heliostats is slightly misaligned. If so, they send signals to correct it.|$|R

We present the daily power obtained at the output of the optical fibre, the power supply is estimated to be 25 W at the end. Then we show that the energy transported is diffused until the enclosure then disperse inside it, this energy is absorbed by the receiver.

40|$|Abstract. Oxide {{nanomaterials}} {{have been}} prepared by two processes using <b>solar</b> <b>furnaces</b> (specially usefull when the melting point of the material is high) : the vaporization-condensation in solar reactors leading to nanophases and the splat-cooling from the melt leading to nanostructured materials.

Oxide nanophases {{have been prepared}} by this way and characterized by X-ray diffraction and High Resolution Electron Microscopy. Some examples are shown (ZnO, y-Fe 203, yttria doped zirconia). The second method is called "splat cooling "; it leads to nanomaterials (stripes or rough powders depending on the viscosity of the melt) which can be amorphous or nanostructured (depending on the composition).

40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{material}} processing scenarios will feature prominently in future interplanetary exploration- in situ production using locally available materials in lunar or planetary landings and high performance structural materials which {{carve out a}} set of properties for uniquely hostile space environments. To be competitive, high performance materials must typically offer orders of magnitude improvements in thermal conductivity or insulation, deliver high strength-to-weight ratios, or provide superior durability (low corrosion and/or ablative character, e. g. in heat shields). The space-related environmental parameters of high radiation flux, low weight and superior reliability limits many typical aerospace materials to a short list comprising high performance alloys, nanocomposites and thin-layer metal laminates (Al-Cu, Al-Ag) with typical dimensions less than the Frank-Reed-type dislocation source. Extremely light weight carbon-carbon composites and car on aerogels will be presented as novel examples which define broadened material parameters, particularly owing to their extreme thermal insulation (R- 32 - 64) and low densities (less than 0. 01 g/cc) approaching that of air itself. Even with these low weight payload additions, rocket thrust limits and transport costs will always place a premium on assembling as much structural and life support resources upon interplanetary, lunar or asteroid arrival.

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the most {{promising}} renewable sources. It is environmentally friendly, plentiful and easy to utilize. Energy plays a pivotal role in socio-economic development by raising standard of living. A detailed and accurate knowledge of the solar radiation is essential for the optimum design and study of solar energy conversion system. The paper is to assess the applicability of solar energy utilization for Kebbi (latitude = 12. 47 ° N and longitude = 4. 3 ºE) for the period of fifteen years. The global and diffuse solar radiation was analyzed using the data obtained from Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) for Kebbi (1990 - 2005). In general, measurements of the global solar radiation and sunshine hours data are utilised, but for many applications diffuse and direct fractions are also needed. The diffuse solar radiation was maxima during the months of July and August and as well as minima during the months of November, December and January. The result obtained shows the variation of Direct and Diffuse component of solar radiation in summer and winter months. The percentage of diffuse solar radiation contribution to global solar radiation is low during winter when the sky remains bright and clear. Hence, the presence of direct solar radiation in February, March and April which are 30. 96 MJ/m/day, 32. 60 MJ/m/day and 31. 87 MJ/m/day, will be very useful for utilizing it for solar concentrators, solar cookers and <b>solar</b> <b>furnaces</b> and other <b>solar</b> devices...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Solar</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{are used}} {{worldwide}} to conduct experiments {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of solar–chemical processes {{with the aid of}} concentrated sunlight, or to qualify high temperature-resistant components. In recent years, high-flux solar simulators (HFSSs) based on short-arc xenon lamps are more frequently used. The emitted spectrum is very similar to natural sunlight but with dangerous portions of ultraviolet light as well. Due to special benefits of solar simulators the increase of construction activity for HFSS can be observed worldwide. Hence, it is quite important to protect employees against serious injuries caused by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in a range of 100  nm to 400  nm. Methods: The UV measurements were made at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Cologne and Paul-Scherrer-Institute (PSI), Switzerland, during normal operations of the HFSS, with a high-precision UV-A/B radiometer using different experiment setups at different power levels. Thus, the measurement results represent UV emissions which are typical when operating a HFSS. Therefore, the biological effects on people exposed to UVR was investigated systematically to identify the existing hazard potential. Results: It {{should be noted that the}} permissible workplace exposure limits for UV emissions significantly exceeded after a few seconds. One critical value was strongly exceeded by a factor of 770. Conclusion: The prevention of emissions must first and foremost be carried out by structural measures. Furthermore, unambiguous protocols have to be defined and compliance must be monitored. For short-term activities in the hazard area, measures for the protection of eyes and skin must be taken...|$|R
