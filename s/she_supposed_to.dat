5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be {{a daughter of}} the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Conway had {{not been}} twenty-four hours in the house before she {{discovered}} there was an obstacle {{in the way of}} her search that she had not foreseen. She had dusted the drawing-room and dining-room, and then went {{to the door of the}} room which <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the library. She found it locked. At dinner she asked the other housemaid what the room opposite the dining-room was, and where was the key.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yump," [...] said Father. He still smiled strangely. He {{pointed at}} the table between the twin beds. On the table was a little brown, dusty book. Mother gazed at it dazedly. Her step was feeble as she tottered between the beds, picked up the book, opened it. It was the New Testament which she had had since girlhood, which she had carried all through their hike, which <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be in their rooms back at the Star Hotel.|$|E
60|$|So many persons being {{absent from}} their seats, {{the group of}} old women was clearly visible to Annie and Lawrence, and Aunt Patsy also could easily see them. Whenever her head, in its ceaseless moving from side to side, allowed her eyes to fall upon the two white visitors, her ardor and fervency increased, {{and she seemed to}} be expressing a pious {{gratitude}} that Miss Annie and he, whom <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be her husband, were still together in peace and safety.|$|E

60|$|Agatha {{made out}} that a swarm of urchins were huddled {{together}} in a helpless mass along {{one side of the}} horrible place. The sergeant was haranguing them, while another man, whom <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the petty officer, pulled them to their feet one by one. A good deal of his labor was wasted, for the Scarrowmania was rolling viciously, and as soon as a few were placed upright half of them collapsed again. Wyllard glanced towards the boys compassionately.|$|E
60|$|When she {{recovered}} consciousness {{she found}} {{that she was being}} carried on a horse before her captor, and that the air was full of a red glare, which <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> arise from a burning house. On the chief, who carried her, perceiving that she had recovered her senses, he called to one of his followers, who immediately rode up, bringing a horse upon which a side-saddle had been placed. To this Ethel was transposed, and in another minute was galloping along by the side of her captor.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's change of manners. She had long seen it. He evidently tried to please her: he was gallant, he was attentive, he was something like what he had been to her cousins: he wanted, <b>she</b> <b>supposed,</b> <b>to</b> cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace--she could not be convinced that he had not, for Miss Crawford, complaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a friend.|$|E

6000|$|... "You needn't trouble, thank you. I {{think you}} won't deny that I can help myself {{and that it}} isn't {{the first time in}} my dreadful life that I've somehow managed it." [...] Save for this allusion to her dreadful life they talked there, Maisie noted, as if they were only rather {{superficial}} friends; a special effect that she had often wondered at before in the midst of what <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be intimacies. This effect was augmented by the almost casual manner in which her ladyship went on: [...] "I dare say I shall go abroad." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{answer was}} that he had never taken any part in politics--had never been or desired to be in Parliament or in the County Council, and was not even a J.P., nor had he done {{anything}} for his country during the war. Nor was he a sportsman. He was simply a country gentleman, and every morning he took a ride or walk, mainly <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> give him a better appetite for his luncheon. And he was a good landlord to his tenants and he was respected by everybody and no one had ever said a word against him.|$|E
6000|$|They {{would have}} been more so but for the Queen's tact. She soon saw that she was {{overwhelming}} the girl, and that time must be given for her to become accustomed to the idea. So, saying tenderly something about rest, she lay quietly, leaving Cis, as <b>she</b> <b>supposed,</b> <b>to</b> sleep. This, however, was impossible to the girl, except in snatches which made her have to prove to herself again and again that it was not all a dream. The last of these wakenings was by daylight, as full as the heavy curtains would admit, and she looked up into a face that was watching her with such tender wistfulness that it drew from her perforce the word [...] "Mother." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hush, my dear," [...] {{said that}} old lady, looking round alarmed at her daughter. [...] "SPEAK FRENCH." [...] And she {{straightway}} began nervously {{to make a}} speech which <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be in that language, but which was as much like French as Iroquois. The whole secret was out: you could {{read it in the}} grandmother's face, who was doing all she could to keep from crying, and looked as frightened as she dared to look. The two elder ladies had settled between them {{that there was going to}} be a general English slaughter that day, and had brought the children with them, so that they might all be murdered in company.|$|E
6000|$|When {{her parents}} {{informed}} my mistress of their resolution, she replied, [...] "Sadhu-it is well!" [...] She {{was not like}} most young women, who hate {{nothing so much as}} a man whom their seniors order them to love. She bowed her head and promised obedience, although, as she afterwards told her mother, she could hardly look at her intended, on account of his prodigious ugliness. But presently the hunchback's wit surmounted her disgust. She was grateful to him for his attention to her father and mother; she esteemed him for his moral and religious conduct; she pitied him for his misfortunes, and she finished with forgetting his face, legs, and back in her admiration of what <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} such {{precaution}} be used?--Though {{it is not}} to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> feel at all?--She has done with her son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!" ...|$|E

60|$|In {{another moment}} Hawtrey sprang {{up on the}} platform, and she felt his arms about her. That brought the blood to her face, but she felt none of the thrill she had expected. Indeed, she was subconsciously {{sensible}} of a certain shrinking from his embrace. Then, and she fancied he must have lifted her bodily down, she stood beside the track with Mrs. Hastings, a man whom <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the latter's husband, Winifred, and Wyllard about her. Another man was also standing close by, apparently waiting until they noticed him. He was flecked with mire all over, his skin coat was very dilapidated, and Agatha fancied that his boots had never been cleaned. His hair, which had evidently been very badly cut, straggled {{out from under his}} old fur cap.|$|E

60|$|The same {{officer who}} had brought the {{invitation}} from his lady to Eveline, now stepped forward, as <b>she</b> <b>supposed,</b> <b>to</b> assist her from her palfrey; {{but it was in}} reality to lead it by the bridle-rein into the paved hall itself, and up to a raised platform, or dais, at the upper end of which she was at length permitted to dismount. Two matrons of advanced years, and four young women of gentle birth, educated by the bounty of Ermengarde, attended with reverence the arrival of her kinswoman. Eveline would have inquired of them for her grand-aunt, but the matrons with much respect laid their fingers on their mouths, as if to enjoin her silence; a gesture which, united to the singularity of her reception in other respects, still farther excited her curiosity to see her venerable relative.|$|E
