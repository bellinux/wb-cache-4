5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Gempylus serpens) is {{a species}} of fish in the {{monotypic}} genus Gempylus, belonging to the family Gempylidae (which is also referred to generally as [...] "snake mackerels").

50|$|Some {{mackerel}} species migrate vertically.

5000|$|The escolar, Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, {{a species}} of fish in the family Gempylidae, is found in deep (200 - 885 m) {{tropical}} and temperate waters around the world. It {{is also known as}} <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> walu walu (Hawaiian, also seen written waloo), and is sometimes fraudulently sold as [...] "butterfish" [...] or [...] "white tuna", a matter aggravated by potential health problems related to consumption of escolar.|$|E
40|$|<b>Snake</b> <b>mackerels</b> form {{by-catch}} in {{deep sea}} trawls and gillnets {{with an annual}} average production of 106 t during 2004 - 2006 in Tuticorin area. Fishery occurred almost round the year with peak during November - March. Fishery and biology of the dominant species, Neoepinnula orientalis was monitored during 2004 - 2005. Peak spawning and recruitment of the species was during December - March period. Growth parameters, L∝ and K are estimated as 31. 6 cm and 0. 68 /year respectively. K value indicates that fish growth is relatively slow. Natural mortality estimate (M) is 1. 38, total mortality (Z) 1. 59 and fishing mortality (F) 0. 21. The exploitation ratio (E) is low being 0. 132. These estimates indicate that the stock is at its early stage of exploitation and have large scope for future commercial exploitation. As a preliminary step in this direction, the extent of stock abundance, biomass and distribution of the stock needs to be assessed. Being a slow growing species in cold habitat, considerably long time is required for stock multiplication. These factors {{have to be taken}} into consideration while planning for exploitation of <b>snake</b> <b>mackerels</b> in future...|$|R

50|$|Orange roughy are {{generally}} sluggish and demersal; they form aggregations {{with a natural}} population density of up to 2.5 fish per m2, now reduced to about 1.0 per m2. These aggregations form in and around geologic structures, such as undersea canyons and seamounts, where water movement and mixing is high, ensuring dense prey concentrations. The aggregations are not necessarily for spawning or feeding; the fish are thought to cycle through metabolic phases (active or feeding and inactive or resting) and seek areas with ideal hydrologic conditions to congregate during each phase. They lose almost all pigmentation while inactive, when they are very approachable. Predators include large, deep-roving sharks, cutthroat eels, merluccid hakes, and <b>snake</b> <b>mackerels.</b>|$|R
50|$|King George whiting, {{especially}} juveniles, {{are known}} to be common prey for a number of larger inshore fishes and wading birds.

50|$|The oilfish, Ruvettus pretiosus, is {{a species}} of <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> with a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution in tropical and temperate oceans.

5000|$|Bathysoma lutkeni ("Lutkens Deep Body") is an extinct lamprid {{from the}} Danian epoch of Sweden, {{and is the}} second oldest lamprid known, after Nardovelifer of Campanian/Maastrichtian Italy.

Later, it was described as being a basal <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel.</b> [...] Eventually, anatomical similarities with the Turkmenids were noted, and B. lutkeni is now regarded as an extremely basal lamprid.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{relatively}} small size, the {{sharpnose sevengill shark}} is considered a top predator in the ecosystem it inhabits. At the Great Meteor Seamount in the eastern Atlantic, this species feeds primarily on teleosts and cephalopods, {{and to a lesser}} extent on small cartilaginous fishes. Off Tunisia, crustaceans are the second-most common prey taken after teleosts. Off Australia, this species consumes mostly teleosts, with smaller individuals taking mainly Lepidorhynchus denticulatus and larger individuals taking increasing numbers of <b>snake</b> <b>mackerels</b> and cutlassfishes. It is a strong-swimming species, with feeding and activity level increasing at night. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the sharpnose sevengill shark include nematodes in the genera Anisakis and Contracaecum, and the cestode Crossobothrium dohrnii.|$|R

This species feeds on squid, pelagic crustaceans, and bony fishes such as lanternfishes, flying fishes, sauries, and mackerel. It is in turn preyed upon by tuna and marlin. Reproduction is oviparous, with females producing 300,000 to 1,000,000 eggs. Spawning occurs year-round; spawning areas are known to exist in the Caribbean Sea and off the coast of Florida. Males reach sexual maturity at 43 cm long and females at 50 cm long. As the fish mature and move into deeper water where there is less available light, they lose the cone cells in their eyes in favor of rod cells.|$|R
50|$|Slimeheads are pelagic spawners; that is, {{spawning}} aggregations {{are formed}} {{and the fish}} release eggs and sperm en masse directly into the water. Evidence of oceanodromy (seasonal migration) is seen in some species. The fertilized eggs (and later the larvae) are planktonic, floating with the currents until the larvae develop the strength to determine their own way. Only the economically important species have had their reproduction studied in any detail; the larvae and juveniles of Darwin's slimehead are pelagic and frequent rather shallow waters near the coast, whereas in orange roughy, the early life stages are apparently confined to deeper water (around 200 m). Slimeheads are very slow-growing and long-lived fish; the orange roughy ranks among the longest-lived animals known, with a maximum reported age of 149 years (however, this age is disputed). Predators of slimeheads are not well known, but include large deep-roving sharks, cutthroat eels, merluccid hakes, and <b>snake</b> <b>mackerels.</b>|$|R
