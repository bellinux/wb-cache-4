5|$|The son of William and Elizabeth (née Best) Ponsford, Bill Ponsford {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North on 19 October 1900. His father was a postman whose family had emigrated from Devon to Bendigo, Victoria, to work in the mines during the 1850s gold rush. His mother was also born in the goldfields, at Guildford, before moving to Melbourne with her father, a Crown Lands bailiff. Ponsford grew up on Newry St in Fitzroy North, and {{attended}} the nearby Alfred Crescent School, which <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> the Edinburgh Gardens.|$|E
5|$|To the south, HMS Bellerophon was {{in serious}} trouble as the huge {{broadside}} of Orient pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from Tonnant as the foremast collapsed as well. Orient had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. Orients captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> his father. The most southerly British ship, Majestic, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun Tonnant, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged Majestic to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between Tonnant and the next in line, Heureux, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of Leander abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded Culloden off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting Peuple Souverain and opening a fierce raking fire on Franklin and Orient.|$|E

500|$|Saint-Just {{saved his}} dignity at the lectern {{but not his}} life. Rising in his support, Robespierre {{sputtered}} and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried to sway the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just, still on the platform, remained unmoved and [...] "looked on contemptuously" [...] at the scene. His confidence seemed validated when troops from the Paris Commune under Hanriot arrived to liberate them, but within hours the entire group was confined to the Hôtel de Ville. When soldiers finally broke inside, {{a number of the}} defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide; Saint-Just <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> Lebas who shot himself in the head. Any contemplation of his own suicide is unclear, but he alone emerged unruffled from the wild, violent final arrest – among the captured, [...] "only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk." [...] Robespierre, Saint-Just and twenty of their allies were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride. At a last formality of identification, he gestured to a copy of the Constitution of 1793 and said, [...] "I am the one who made that." ...|$|E

500|$|Written by Howard Zahniser—who {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} at age 58 four months before the bill was signed into law— the {{legislation}} authorized the United States Congress to set aside a total of 9 million acres in selected areas in the national forests, national parks, national wildlife refuges, and other federal lands as units to be kept permanently unchanged by humans. It also provided for more acreage to be designated as wilderness for preservation. In defining wilderness, Zahniser invoked Marshall and his contemporaries, stating that [...] "in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, [...] is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." [...] The act's signing was the most important event in the history of The Wilderness Society; members Mardy Murie and Alice Zahniser <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> Johnson as he signed the legislation. [...] With the Wilderness Act, the United States guaranteed permanent protection of wild and scenic natural areas for future generations. [...] The Society's most prestigious honor, the Robert Marshall Award, is named in Marshall's honor; its first recipient was Sigurd F. Olson in 1981.|$|E
500|$|From {{his early}} {{adulthood}} until his death, White was a Freemason {{and served as}} Grand Master {{of the state of}} West Virginia in 1875. In that capacity, he laid the cornerstone of the capitol building at Wheeling. Prior to his relocation to Wheeling, he was also Master of the Clinton Lodge of Masons in Romney. On October 26, 1899, he gave an address according to Grand Lodge ritual at the cornerstone laying ceremony of the new school in Wellsburg. White attended the 100th anniversary of the interment of George Washington on December 14, 1899 and was chosen by the Grand Lodge of Virginia as the chief Grand Marshal of the Masonic ceremonies while attending the observance. He and his staff had full charge of the procession and all matters of the celebration. A reproduction of Washington's funeral services were held at Mount Vernon, and White served as a commander of the occasion, where he <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> President William McKinley during his address to those in attendance. Prior to the anniversary, in November 1899, the National Christian Association published sheets in the anti-secret society publication Christian Cynosure in which they denied Washington's Freemasonry affiliations. White released a statement in which he remarked: [...] "This attack is the meanest thing I ever saw in a Christian publication." [...] He further went on to illustrate a historic narrative citing the dates of Washington's Masonic activities and affiliations.|$|E
500|$|Turan cited Ball's lack of {{constraint}} {{when writing}} {{the film as}} the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone. McCarthy said the script was [...] "as fresh and distinctive" [...] as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue [...] "tart" [...] and said the characters—Carolyn excepted—were [...] "deeply drawn". One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked [...] "hoary Freudianism". Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a [...] "wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy". He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with [...] "unexpected nuance". Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense. McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating [...] "ironic counterpoint" [...] to the story. Hentzi concluded that American Beauty was [...] "vital but uneven"; he felt the film's examination of [...] "the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives" [...] was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> [...] "the most enduring literary treatments" [...] of the theme, such as Lolita. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were [...] "hackneyed". McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a [...] "starting point" [...] from which to tell its [...] "subtle and acutely judged tale". Maslin agreed; she said that while it [...] "takes aim at targets that are none too fresh", and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own [...] "corrosive novelty". Ebert awarded American Beauty four stars out of four, and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex, and surprising, concluding it was [...] "a hell of a picture".|$|E
