500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. Although {{it does not follow}} a substantial plot, it features outfits and scenes inspired by The Sound of Music. Stefani and her Harajuku Girls are often dancing in front of fields of flowers and a background of key-like symbols composed of two G's placed back to back. In a scene mimicking The Sound of Music, Stefani portrays Maria von Trapp while the dancers, dressed in pajamas, portray her children and jump on a bed. In another scene, Stefani uses curtains to create sailor suits for the Harajuku Girls. Stefani also appears as a nun and an orchestra conductor. One scene uses smoke to create the illusion that Stefani is a submerged escape artist searching for a key. <b>She</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> key, a symbol of [...] "the sweet escape", from her mouth as an allusion to performances by escapologist Harry Houdini. The song's title is often visualized by a colorful sign that reads [...] "wind it up". Another video was produced in 3-D, but this version was never released. After seeing the video, Jimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, decided to work with James Cameron to produce other 3-D music presentations.|$|E
6000|$|PROSERPINE (fretfully). It's {{well you}} and I are not ladies and gentlemen: I'd {{talk to you}} pretty {{straight}} if Mr. Marchbanks wasn't here.

6000|$|LADY CICELY (horrified). Stop. No. You must NEVER pull a coat at the skirts, Captain Brassbound: it spoils the sit of it. Allow me. (<b>She</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> lappels of {{his coat}} vigorously forward) Put back your shoulders. (He frowns, but obeys.) That's better. (She buttons the top button.) Now button the rest from the top down. DOES it catch you at all under the arm? ...|$|E

25|$|According to hitman-turned-informant Charles Crimaldi, {{one time}} DeStefano made his wife Anita take {{his gun and}} put {{the end of the}} barrel in her mouth, then demanded that <b>she</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger. When <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger and the gun didn't go off, DeStefano began to laugh and told her that he had removed the bullets. He would tell this story over and over again to his mob {{associates}} for amusement.|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> {{curtains}} {{of the bed}} so as to hide the sick man's [...] face, that the actor may change his mask unseen.

6000|$|... 'Yes; {{it was so}} droll to go {{running about}} en chemise, like {{the girl in the}} tale of the 'Midsummer Eve,' where <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> Saint Johns-wort flower, and has her wish to hear all the creatures talk. I liked it much, and Yvon slept so like the {{dormouse}} that he never heard me creep in and out. It was hard to bring much water, but the poor cabbages were so glad, and Mother Lobineau felt that all had not forgotten her.|$|E

It is the mother of the Rev. F. Hugby, as proud of her son in his white choker as Cornelia of her jewels at Rome. That is old Hugby bringing up the rear with the Prayer-books, and Betsy Hugby the old maid, his daughter,--old Hugby, Haberdasher and Church-warden.|$|E

Her last episode was episode 42.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{eyes filled}} suddenly, {{and a short}} shower of tears rolled down <b>the</b> broad cheeks. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> shawl close about her. The Marquis leaned {{slightly}} over in his saddle, and said-- ...|$|R
