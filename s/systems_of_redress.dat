40|$|Redress {{procedures}} {{are important for}} basic fairness. In addition, they can help address principal-agent problems {{in the implementation of}} social policies and provide information to policy makers regarding policy design. To function effectively, a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> requires a well-designed and inter-linked supply <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> procedures as well as, especially if rights consciousness is not well-developed in a society, a set of organizations that stimulate and aggregate demand for redress. On the supply side, this paper identifies three kinds <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> procedures: administrative venues within government agencies, independent institutions outside government departments, and courts. On the demand side, the key institutions are nongovernmental organizations/civil society organizations and the news media, both of which require a receptive political and economic climate to function effectively. Overall, procedures for redressing grievances and complaints regarding basic service delivery are under-developed in many countries, and deserve further analysis, piloting, and support.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of the}} ‘ombuds watchers’. These are groups of dissatisfied users of public service ombuds schemes who engage in legal protest against the current <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> for citizen-state complaints. Through the lens of legal consciousness scholarship we propose a framework that conceptualizes the collectivized protest of the ombuds watchers. Based on an empirical dataset, our analysis has shown that the ombuds watchers meet each of the defining characteristics of dissenting collectivism and demonstrates the existence of forms of legal consciousness which present ‘opportunities to build alternative imaginaries and institutions’ (Morgan and Kutch 2015, p. 567). Our case study provides an insight into the potential for dissenting collectives to challenge the hegemonic structures of state law, {{while at the same time}} emphasising the continuing power of legal ideology in shaping popular understandings of justice.

40|$|This article {{advances}} {{an argument}} that private enforcement of European Union (EU) rights has largely been stunted due {{to a series of}} blocking tactics by Member States, enabled through a form of tacitic subservience of the Court of Justice of the European Union to these States. Currently, State Liability is neither an effective <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> under tortious liability, nor a genuine enforcement mechanism in domestic law. By enabling collective redress in State Liability, we present an argument, missing explicitly in current literature, that both as a viable remedy through the (UK’s modified) tort of breach of statutory duty, and through granting effective redress through action by the EU Commission, State Liability will become the mechanism for corrective justice the Court of Justice envisaged in 1991.

They remembered the termination policies of his Republican predecessors and demanded a clear policy proving that self-determination had arrived. The president-elect requested that native leaders compile a document briefing him on policy, their desires and solutions, needs, and priorities. From January to February, 1969 a task force met and prepared the document, which would become {{the basis of the}} Special Recommendations on Indian Affairs delivered by Nixon on 8 July 1970. After completion of the report, the task force which was composed of [...] "many of the best known Indian leaders in the country," [...] including Hatch one of only six women on the task force, met in Washington, DC in November 1969 to present their ideas. On 10 November, they met with Vice President Spiro Agnew and on 12 November, they presented the statement to Congress. Their recommendations were that Indians needed to be involved in their own governance, be consulted, be allowed to design and implement processes, and be able to express their grievances and propose legislative and policy solutions. They asked for their sovereignty to be respected, for state governors to be required to honor treaties and federal statutes, and they asked for Congress to establish a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> so that if federal programs, which were designed for the benefit of Native Americans, were not in fact benefiting them, there would be mechanisms to obtain justice.|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} primary EU {{competition}} law, the new Damages Directive 2014 / 104 /EU aims {{to provide all}} victims of competition law violations with a right to compensation. This includes consumers who often suffer harm {{at the very end}} of the supply chain. This article analyses the impact of this Directive on consumer redress. Thereby, it identifies a tension built into the Directive between the public interest in enhancing the respect of competition law, on the one hand, and the private interest in compensating the victims of anti-competitive conduct, on the other hand. By concentrating the right to claim damages on the — direct or indirect — purchaser who ultimately had to pay the overcharge, the Directive runs the risk that infringers of competition law will escape private enforcement actions in cases where this overcharge was passed down to final consumers who, especially in mass damage cases, will not have sufficient incentives to bring individual damage claims to the courts. This problem is aggravated by the fact that the Damages Directive itself does not provide for any collective redress mechanisms. Rather, in 2013, the Commission decided to address that issue only through adopting the non-binding Collective Redress Recommendation. Thereby, the Commission recommends avoiding all the features that make up the so-called ‘toxic cocktail’ of US class actions. Yet past experience and most recent reforms in some Member States seem to indicate that pure <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> opt-in collective <b>redress</b> mechanisms will not significantly contribute to private enforcement of competition law. Indeed, for the time being, experimenting with different national systems is the best approach to identifying the best <b>system</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>redress</b> for competition law cases...|$|R

This study analyses the <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>redress</b> for breach <b>of</b> competition law in the area of antitrust in the EU. Starting with an overview of the relevant national and EU legislation in this area, it discusses the question of an EU-wide specific system for collective redress in antitrust and the legal basis for a legislative initiative at EU level.

40|$|In {{the area}} of mass litigation, {{little is known about}} the needs of the {{individual}} victim and to what extent these needs are satisfied through the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>redress.</b> Are we really helping tort victims through procedures of mass litigation? In response to this question we conducted two studies that focused on the needs of the individual victim in mass litigation contexts. The main results and valuable insights from these studies are presented and compared in this article. We conclude that although the damages have derived from vastly different origins, it is remarkable that some of the needs are rather comparable. Money is not the only need of victims. Sometimes it is not even the primary reason for victims to litigate. Both groups of victims express the need for recognition, taking responsibility, prevention, and information. Moreover, we have found that these victims experience feelings of solidarity, have altruistic needs in multiple forms, and could experience an overwhelming feeling of empowerment in joining a mass litigation process...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{examines}} {{the intersection of}} two recent trends in aggregate litigation in the United States and Europe. In the United States, Congress and the U. S. Supreme Court have significantly restricted {{the utility of the}} class action mechanism, leaving many American plaintiffs with legitimate claims without recourse in the United States. Simultaneously, the European Union and its Member States have considered and implemented new mechanisms to facilitate the resolution of mass claims. The Netherlands employs a particularly useful aggregate litigation system. As a result of these two trends, this Note argues that Americans with securities fraud claims, who find themselves shut out of American courts, should seek redress in the Netherlands under the Dutch Settlement Act. This Note posits that American courts are likely to give res judicata effect to such judgments, and, barring a preemptive trans-European <b>system</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>redress,</b> the Netherlands is a viable alternative to U.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} highly topical subject of {{regulation}} surrounding commercial practices. This examination is divided into four chapters. The first chapter looks at the notion of commercial practices by considering both the linguistic and legal definition of the term, and the importance of the regulation is proved. The second chapter deals with the question of division of law into its public and private counterparts. The discussion of the consequences of this division are crucial for a better analysis of the actual implementation of the EU Directive 2005 / 29 /CE on unfair commercial practices. In the third chapter, the scope of application of this Directive is analysed and the main principles of regulation are described. The final section focuses on the Czech law on unfair commercial practices. In this segment, the text of the provisions of the Czech Code of Consumer Protection is compared to the Directive, and the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>redress</b> and sanctions in the Code of Consumer Protection is critically analysed. The legal regulation of "promotional events", during which the ban of unfair commercial practices is often breached, is placed under scrutiny.

40|$|Following {{considerable}} public pressure, in 1989, the Hong Kong government followed {{many other}} countries and established an Ombudsman. The establishment of the post has {{to be seen in}} the context of the political awakening of Hong Kong and demands for a more accountable and client-oriented public service. Previously, complaints of maladministration in Hong Kong were dealt with under a diffuse and fragmentary system which lacked effective powers. Effective legal action against the government for maladministration is also severely constrained by a number of factors. This article traces the growth of the Ombudsman concept and jurisdiction in Western countries over the last few decades and outlines the structure and jurisdiction of the Ombudsman's office in Hong Kong by way of comparison. The effectiveness of the Hong Kong Ombudsman is then evaluated by a detailed analysis of his achievements over the last ten years in combating maladministration, and his role in three high profile cases. These cases also elucidate some of the limitations inherent in the Ombudsman's role. Lastly the future of the Ombudsman in Hong Kong is explored. It is concluded that the Office of Ombudsman has scored initial success in Hong Kong public administration, and has enhanced government efficiency as well as satisfying public needs and filling a major gap in the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> public <b>redress.</b> However, problems <b>of</b> continuing resources and mapping out a sustainable ethos remain.

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study which {{examines}} {{the influences of}} the availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> procedures on the decisions of consumers to purchase online. Availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> procedures in this concept is when consumers have access to uncomplicated complaint procedures that offer timely resolution and effective compensation and handling. Previous {{research has shown that}} many factors such as product price, availability, merchant reputation and integrity, consumer attitude, perceived convenience, enjoyment and pleasure, and service quality influence the decisions of consumers to purchase on line. This study focuses on the availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> procedures on the decisions of consumers to purchase online and the importance role <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> in that process. Data was collected initially in face-to-face interviews with both consumers, who buy online, and merchants who sell online. Then Focus Group discussions with consumers were conducted to further understand and confirmed the findings emerged from the interview process. The research shows that price was always the first and most significant influence in consumers’ decisions to purchase online. Likewise, consumers also make decisions about online purchasing because of product availability and the range of product choices available to them. Consumers are also sensitive to shipping fees when deciding to purchase online. It also shows that any delay or longer delivery time also influences consumers’ decisions in switching back to offline purchasing. Lastly, consumers choose to purchase online because they enjoy the fun and excitement during the process of online purchasing. A model showing the influence of these factors was created, adding the effects of the availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> on those decisions. This research shows that the availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> does not always influence consumers in making decisions to purchase online. If most transactions are fulfilled according to the consumer’s expectations, then consumers have little, if any, concern with redress. Sometimes factors such as merchant reputation, low risk transactions, guaranteed purchase fulfilment, product price and availability, enjoyable online purchasing experience, shipping cost and delivery time seem to be a more important influence on consumers in their decisions to purchase online.  This research concludes that the availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> can and does indirectly influence consumer confidence and trust ix in online purchasing and therefore impacts on their decision to purchase, if and only if, one of these three circumstances happens: 1. When problems occur in online purchasing process and subsequently consumers require an immediate access to a complaint handling system; 2. When risk is perceived to be present in the purchasing process then the availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> policy and/or procedures is required by consumers to guarantee that they are well protected from financial loss; and 3. When redress initiatives are offered that allow consumers to assess the merchant’s accountability in offering satisfactory online purchasing fulfilment...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the dual nature {{of the right of}} {{revolution}} as both a natural law and as positive law is found in the American revolutionary context. Although the American Declaration of Independence invoked the natural law right of revolution, natural law was not the sole justification for American independence. English constitutional doctrine also supported the colonists’ actions, at least up to a point. By the 1760s, English law recognized what William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England called “the law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> against public oppression.” Like the natural law’s right of revolution, this constitutional law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> justified the people resisting the sovereign. This law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> arose from a contract between the people and the king to preserve the public welfare. This original contract was “a central dogma in English and British constitutional law” since “time immemorial.” The Declaration’s long list of grievances declared that this bargain had been breached.|$|R
50|$|The law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> had limits {{like the}} right of {{revolution}} under natural law. The law <b>of</b> <b>redress,</b> {{like the right}} of revolution, was not an individual right. It belonged to {{the community as a}} whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract. It was not a means of first resort, or response to trivial or casual errors of government. Blackstone’s Commentaries suggested that using the law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> would be “extraordinary,” for example applying if the king broke the original contract, violated “the fundamental laws,” or abandoned the kingdom. During the Stamp Act crisis of the 1760s the Massachusetts Provincial Congress considered resistance to the king justified if freedom came under attack from “the hand of oppression” and “the merciless feet of tyranny.” A decade later the “indictment” of George III in the Declaration of Independence sought to end his sovereign reign over the colonies because he violated the original constitutional contract.|$|R
