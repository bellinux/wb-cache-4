5|$|Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373 (1976), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that a <b>state</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the right to}} assess a tax on the {{property}} of a Native American (Indian) living on tribal land absent a specific Congressional grant of authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} a case against a white man. The new constitution of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage. While the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have legal segregation, it excluded black children from public schools {{as a matter of}} custom.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The <b>state</b> <b>did</b> little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use old New England Route4 through Massachusetts and Vermont {{all the way to}} the Canadian border. Apparently New York <b>State</b> <b>did</b> not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an official seal, the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E
5|$|The Greenback ticket {{received}} 305,997 {{votes and}} no electoral votes, compared to 4,446,158 for the winner, Republican James A. Garfield, and 4,444,260 for Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock. The party was strongest in the West and South, {{but in no}} <b>state</b> <b>did</b> Weaver receive more than 12% of the vote, and his nationwide total was just 3%. That figure represented an improvement over the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was a disappointment.|$|E

Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.|$|R
50|$|The non-recognition of {{particular}} acts of a <b>state</b> <b>does</b> not normally effect {{the recognition of}} the state itself. For example, the international rejection of the occupation {{of particular}} territory by a recognised <b>state</b> <b>does</b> not imply non-recognition of the state itself, nor a rejection of a change of government by illegal means.|$|R
5|$|Until 2004, New Jersey {{permitted}} in-state wineries {{to directly}} ship products to in-state customers. The <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not allow out-of-state producers to ship to New Jersey residents or permit New Jersey wineries to ship to out-of-state customers. This practice was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 {{in a case}} from Michigan. New Jersey's statute was subsequently struck down by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 because such limitations were held to violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Washington adopted its seal {{during the}} state {{constitutional}} convention on August 21, 1889, {{months prior to}} official admission as a U.S. state on November 11, 1889. While the young <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have an official flag, a military flag displaying a gold profile of George Washington, the state's namesake, on blue bunting was used across the state {{at the turn of}} the 20th century and was first carried by the Washington Volunteer Infantry during the Philippine–American War in 1899. Another popular design was a purple or green flag bearing the state seal in gold.|$|E
5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball <b>State</b> <b>did</b> not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E

5|$|After Mindaugas' death, the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not {{disintegrate}} and Treniota {{took over}} the title of Grand Duke. However, his power was fragile; he was challenged by Tautvilas, who had not forgotten his own claims to power. Tautvilas was also assassinated by Treniota. However, just a year later, in 1264, Treniota was killed by Mindaugas' former servants. His son Vaišvilkas and his brother-in-law Shvarn from Volhynia {{took over the}} control in Lithuania. Daumantas was forced to flee to Pskov, was baptized Timofei, ruled successfully from 1266 to 1299 and even became a saint. In 1265 Vaišvilkas, as a Christian, reconciled with the Livonian Order and, without support from Lithuania, the rebellions among the Balts that had been fueled by Treniota began to subside. In 1267 he returned to a monastic life and transferred the Grand Duchy to Shvarn.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E

5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have the {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
5|$|The final {{piece of}} the Relief Route {{associated}} with US 113 was the Puncheon Run Connector, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the Relief Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover {{in favor of the}} sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the MilfordDover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US113 at US13 in Dover.|$|E
5|$|Under Section 8, the Secretary of State {{could pass}} a {{statutory}} instrument setting out {{the rules and}} limits surrounding compensation for the employee's dismissal after making a protected disclosure; until this is done, Section 9 provided interim remedies, which {{were the same as}} in other cases of unfair dismissal. The Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>did</b> pass such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed under Section 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Under Section 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting under Section 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|After {{their first}} round bye, Tennessee faced Mississippi State again. Instead of Tennessee {{starting}} quickly, however, the Bulldogs did, taking a 9–2 lead. At this point though, the Vols went {{on one of}} their runs, this time a 15–2 one. <b>State</b> <b>did</b> not recover from this, and Tennessee advanced to the semi-finals, 88–60. Catchings had a double-double by halftime. In the semi-finals, UT met Vanderbilt for the third time, with an even better performance than the previous two. Catchings again had a double-double by halftime and the team shot 6 of 7 from beyond the three point line, as they advanced to the championship 106–45. The SEC Championship was against Alabama, who had played within seven points of the Lady Vols in their previous match-up. Alabama used the same, slow style they had previously employed, and at the break were only down by three. Tennessee was able to slowly up the lead to ten during the first ten minutes of the second period, eventually reaching a fourteen-point lead, before Alabama started a comeback, cutting the lead to five with just over forty seconds remaining. Alabama was able to score the five points, but Tennessee made their foul shots, and won the title, 67–63. After the game, Holdsclaw was named the tournament's most outstanding player. UT was now 33–0, with the NCAA tournament coming up next.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, when Wisconsin {{initially}} numbered its highway system, {{the route}} of what later became US141 followed two separate state highways: WIS17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS57 at the state line.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with PA 97 to replace the section in Pennsylvania. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the United States Numbered Highways system. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. When the US 140 designation was retired on January 1, 1979, it was replaced by MD 140 from Baltimore to Westminster, and Maryland and Pennsylvania coordinated to have matching routes 97 {{on both sides of the}} state line between Westminster and Gettysburg. The northern terminus of PA 97 was located at the US 15 interchange, while the stretch of the former US 140 north into Gettysburg became unnumbered Baltimore Pike. With this change, the US 140 signs were removed from the square in downtown Gettysburg, and no signs directing motorists to PA 97 were put in their place. This move hurt businesses in the Littlestown area as motorists were unable to get to them without a marked route. The <b>state</b> <b>did</b> put signs directing motorists to PA 97 at the US 15 interchange and at the intersection of US 15 Business and Baltimore Street; however, signs for PA 97 were not placed in the square due to opposition from local officials in Gettysburg who did not want sign clutter in the square. The stretch of Baltimore Pike from the bypass to US 15 Business became State Route 2035 by 1989. PA 97 and the adjacent portion of Baltimore Pike were widened through the US 15 interchange in 2000.|$|E
