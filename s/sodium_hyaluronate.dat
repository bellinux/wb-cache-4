25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine.|$|E

Methods: Full-thickness chondral defects were created in a non-weight bearing area by using a handle 2. 7 -mm drill bit, in the right knees of 33 Sprague–Dawley rats. Each specimen then underwent micro-fracture using a needle. Two weeks after surgery, 3 groups were randomly formed among the rats (n =  33). In Group 1, 0. 2  mL of sterile saline solution (0. 9 %) was injected. In Group 2, 0. 2  mL HA with a mean molecular weight of 1. 2  Mda was injected. In Group 3, 0. 2  mL of HA–CS–NAG compound (<b>hyaluronate,</b> <b>sodium</b> chondroitin sulfate, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine) was injected. The injections were applied on the 14 th, the 21 st and the 28 th postoperative days. All rats were sacrificed on the 42 nd postoperative day. Histological analysis of the repair tissue was performed for each specimen by two blinded observers using Wakitani scoring system. Results: There was significantly improved repair tissue in both Group 3 and Group 2 when compared with Group 1. Group 3 showed statistically significant improvement in terms of ‘cell morphology’ and ‘integration of donor with host’ when compared to Group 2 (p <  0. 001).

Case report: A 60 -year-old female {{was referred to}} our hospital for treatment of vision loss due to corneal opacification, etiology was unknown. Slit lamp examination showed dense opacification in corneal stroma. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed on her left eye. She was treated with topical applications of 1. 5 % levofloxacin, 0. 5 % cefmenoxime, 0. 1 % betamethasone, 0. 1 % <b>hyaluronate</b> <b>sodium,</b> and 3 % aciclovir after penetrating keratoplasty. Delayed epithelialization of the donor graft was observed at day 4 post-transplantation. Because of the concern that levofloxacin induced corneal epithelialization delay, 1. 5 % levofloxacin was changed to 0. 3 % tosufloxacin. At day 6 post-transplantation, deposits on the epithelial defect of the donor graft were observed. Tosufloxacin was suspected to {{be the cause of}} deposits, and tosufloxacin eye drop was discontinued. The deposits decreased gradually and completely disappeared by 5  months post-transplantation. Conclusion: Topical tosufloxacin treatment has the risk of precipitation on compromised corneas such as corneal grafts with epithelial defect after penetrating keratoplasty.

METHODS: Totally 140 cases(140 eyes) of dry eye were divided into three categories according to eye symptoms. First category: 60 cases(60 eyes) with meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD) were divided into A 1 group(palpebralis margin treatment group) and B 1 group(control group); Second category: 50 cases(50 eyes) with corneal epithelium damage(corneal fluorescence staining FL Score≥ 5) were divided into A 2 group(bandage contact lens group) and B 2 group(control group); Third category: 30 cases(30 eyes) with low Schirmer test(Schirmer Ⅰ≤ 5 mm) were divided into A 3 group(lacrimal punctum plug group) and B 3 group(control group). Both former categories treated by 1 g/L fluorometholone eye drops and 1 g/L <b>hyaluronate</b> <b>sodium</b> eye drops, but received limbus palpebralis cleaning, oral doxycycline in A 1 group and bandage contact lens in A 2 group else. The third category was treated by 10 g/L cyclosporine A and carbomer eye gel, but lacrimal punctum plug in A 3 group before received the drug treatment. Two weeks follow up, each case was examined by subjective symptom, cornea fluorescence colouration test, tear break-up time(BUT), and Schirmer test Ⅰ(SⅠt) in the treatment groups(A 1,A 2,A 3) and the control groups(B 1,B 2,B 3), the results pre- and post-treatment were compared.

5000|$|Arthroscopy {{involves}} {{the introduction of}} an arthroscope (a very thin, flexible camera) into the joint via single cannula (as opposed to arthrocentesis which usually involves 2 cannulae and no arthroscope), allowing the joint space to be visualized on a monitor and explored by the surgeon. Arthroscopy is also used in other joints and the technique is similar to laparoscopy. The cannula is inserted via a small incision {{just in front of}} the ear. The arthroscope has a built in capacity to pump in or suck out saline. Arthroscopy may be intended as a purely diagnostic procedure, or it may be employed in combination with surgical interventions within the joint, in which case a second [...] "working" [...] cannula is also inserted into the joint. Examples include release of adhesions (e.g. by blunt dissection or with a laser) or release of the disc. Biopsies or disc reduction can also be carried out during arthroscopy. Arthroscopy is usually carried out under general anesthesia. Arthroscopy has advantages over arthrocentesis in that it allows for detection of problems inside the joint such as perforation or synovitis.

50|$|TMJ arthrocentesis {{refers to}} lavage (flushing out) {{of the upper}} joint space (where most of the {{translation}} movement takes place) with saline via the introduction of cannulae. It is theorized that the hydraulic pressure generated within the joint combined with external manipulation is capable of releasing adhesions or the anchored disc phenomenon and leads to an improvement in the movement ("lysis and lavage"). It is also suggested that undesirable contents within the synovial fluid of the joint can be washed out, such as microscopic debris (from breakdown of the articular surfaces) and pain mediators (enzymes and prostaglandins), {{and there is also}} stimulation of the synovial membrane to restore its normal lubricating function. It was initially used to treat acute closed lock, however it has since come to be used chronic closed lock, chronic anterior displaced disc with reduction, and degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis). In acute closed lock, it is theorized that the upper joint space is inflated from its normally collapsed state during this procedure, and this extra space frees up the articular disc which returns to its correct position. This is the least invasive, and easiest to carry out of the surgical options. It can be carried out under local anesthetic (and for this reason is cheaper than arthroscopy, although it may also carried out under general anesthetic) and has minimal complications. Although {{it has been suggested that}} arthrocentesis decreases pain, increases maximal incisal opening and has prolonged effects, when the procedure was investigated by a systematic review, the impact on pain was comparable to arthroscopy and the results are unstable. The review concluded by suggesting that arthrocentesis only be used for TMD within well designed randomized controlled trial (i.e. for the purposes of further research and not for routine management). Arthrocentesis may be combined with injection of <b>sodium</b> <b>hyaluronate</b> into the joint at the end of the lavage with the aim to improve lubrication within the joint.|$|E
