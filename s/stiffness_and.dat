5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} <b>stiffness</b> <b>and</b> resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E

Two teleoperated grasping tasks—size <b>and</b> <b>stiffness</b> discrimination—were studied to investigate how changes in system parameters influence human capabilities. The device characteristics altered were teleoperator <b>stiffness</b> (size <b>and</b> <b>stiffness</b> discrimination) <b>and</b> teleoperator damping (size discrimination only). It was found that neither teleoperator stiffness nor teleoperator damping influenced size discrimination. Also, teleoperator stiffness did not influence stiffness discrimination. Furthermore, teleoperated performance was compared with direct interaction using bare hands or with the fingers in a bracket. Size discrimination performance was equivalent for these three conditions, but stiffness discrimination performance was lower for teleoperation than for direct interaction.

5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased <b>stiffness</b> <b>and</b> slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer <b>stiffness</b> <b>and</b> rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin {{are critical}} components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, <b>stiffness</b> <b>and</b> damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, <b>stiffness,</b> <b>and</b> tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, <b>stiffness,</b> <b>and</b> flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck <b>stiffness</b> <b>and</b> pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{which allows the}} vessel engineer to more accurately evaluate the flexibility and stresses in vessel nozzles within the time and expense parameters associated with the normal design process. In a critical process piping system design, the vessel design engineer first calculates nozzle stiffnesses for inclusion of the nozzle spring constants in the piping system analysis.

In an earlier paper “Improving the Accuracy of Piping programs When Analyzing Closely Coupled Equipment, ” the wide divergence in nozzle <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>and</b> stresses computed by the available formula approaches was illustrated. Additionally, it was shown that it is desirable to use the Finite Element approach to better assess both the <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>and</b> the stresses in vessel nozzles.

40|$|We {{used the}} {{acceleration}} {{at the onset}} of a force step to estimate the force experienced by the receiver. This requires information about the apparent mass of the system, which, for the fly’s receiver, seems remarkably constant, clustering around 5 ng in wild-type flies and mechanosensory mutants [S 1]. By fixing the mass to this value, we neglect individual mass variations. We note that most of the parameters used to describe the receiver’s mechanics are indepen-dent of mass: po, z, X 0, KGS=KN, the extent of nonlinearity, the com-pleteness of adaptation, and the single-channel gating energy. With our approach of force estimation, the only parameters that scale with mass are external force, <b>stiffnesses,</b> <b>and</b> F 0, whereby ratios be-tween forces (or <b>stiffnesses)</b> <b>and</b> mass can be directly assessed from the data.
