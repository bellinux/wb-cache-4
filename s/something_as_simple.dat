25|$|The {{conventions}} {{for professional}} artists working in private {{are much less}} defined, especially as the models are often friends or family. However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards {{in order to make}} models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.|$|E
25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E
25|$|This {{can occur}} {{even if the}} subject is not {{conscious}} of the priming stimulus. An example of this was done by Bargh et al. in 1996. Subjects were implicitly primed with words related to the stereotype of elderly people (example: Florida, forgetful, wrinkle). While the words did not explicitly mention speed or slowness, those who were primed with these words walked more slowly upon exiting the testing booth {{than those who were}} primed with neutral stimuli. Similar effects were found with rude and polite stimuli: those primed with rude words were more likely to interrupt an investigator than those primed with neutral words, and those primed with polite words were the least likely to interrupt.

5000|$|Noica's {{philosophy}} is also {{concerned with the}} problem of reason and the problem of the individual. He redefines reason as [...] "the conscience of the becoming in-to being". The philosopher wanted to save the individual from [...] "the tyranny of the general", to give to the individual an [...] "ontological dignity". He was deeply disturbed by the image of the individual <b>as</b> a <b>simple</b> instance of <b>something</b> general, <b>as</b> a <b>simple</b> particular case of a general rule. But he also intended to maintain the reality of the general natures, not wanting to reduce them to mere collections or classes of individuals. Thus, he rejected both Platonic realism, and nominalism of all kinds. Instead of choosing between nominalism and realism, he proposes a third version, which insists on the solidarity existent between the individual and the general, linked by their determinations. His triangle I-D-G forms thus an irreducible unity, reminiscent of Peirce's triad.|$|R
500|$|Lead artist Arnold Tsang recounted {{that the}} body size, {{as well as the}} running pose of a character, were both {{characteristics}} that were considered during character design in order to make each one identifiable. Tracer, for instance, has a wild running animation, in addition to a unique trail of blue light, which follows behind her. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku commented that her jump animation appears [...] "hyper-exaggerated and kinda goofy looking". This {{is a result of the}} smear frame, combined with squash and stretch animation techniques, implemented in Overwatch. With respect to Tracer, Blizzard senior animator David Gibson pointed out frames from her jump animation, stating, [...] "we're trying to just push it a little further than normal. <b>Something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as stretching the torso out, having her hang [...] just a little bit longer than normal.

Will Leitch of New York magazine said, [...] "The Office kind of needed this sort of shake-up, even if it’s <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as another room to put all our characters in." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V.

500|$|Valve {{aimed for}} a November 1997 release {{to compete with}} Quake II. By September 1997, the team found that while they had built a number of {{innovative}} aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion. The company postponed the release and reworked every level. They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game, and then spent a month iterating on the level. When {{the rest of the}} team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as [...] "Die Hard meets Evil Dead", they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, the level had a number of interesting things happen in it and all when the player came into near proximity of the event, rather than based on time elements, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level had means to respond to any player action, even for <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.|$|E
40|$|The UK has {{something}} to celebrate, at least if one believes the tabloid headlines. It seems that it has moved from the {{back to the front}} of the queue to agree a trade deal with the United States. On the surface, a trade deal would be a good idea. The UK must now prepare to negotiate such deals with many countries, to replace those from which it will be excluded when it leaves the European Union (EU). (1) Failure to agree them risks defaulting to World Trade Organisation regulations, which would be severely damaging. Tariffs would make many British goods more expensive and it may be impossible to trade some of the services that are now a major source of the United Kingdom’s foreign earnings. More important are non-tariff barriers, such regulations and standards that allow the European single market to work, even if often mocked by Eurosceptics. Worst of all are quotas, which limit the amount of goods that overseas markets will import. Although, in theory, the UK is entitled to a share of the EU’s quotas for international trade, in practice, negotiating this is fiendishly difficult. A recent worked example using <b>something</b> <b>as</b> seemingly <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> lamb and mutton quotas showed that this could take years to resolve, (2) confirming that confident assurances about Brexit do not survive contact with reality. It is easy to see how the British government might be attracted by any offer of a swift and simple trade deal with the United States. </p...|$|R

40|$|From {{earliest}} times, {{human societies}} have faced {{the challenge of}} supplying adequate quality and quantities of drinking water. Whether limited by arid environments or urbanization, provision of clean drinking water is a prerequisite of any enduring society, {{but it is a}} daunting task for drinking water is a multi-faceted resource. Drinking water is most obviously a physical resource, one of the few truly essential requirements for life. Drinking water is also a cultural resource, of religious significance in many societies. A social resource, access to water reveals much about membership in society. A political resource, the provision of water to citizens can serve important communication purposes. And finally, when scarce, water can become an economic resource. As recent conflicts in developing countries make clear, managing and mediating these many facets of drinking water is no easy matter. Understanding a society 2 ̆ 7 s ability to provide clean drinking water to its citizens, examining how it recognizes the different natures of this vital resource, provides a unique prism on the society 2 ̆ 7 s organization, equity, and view of itself. In seeking to understand better how societies manage such a critical resource, this article considers three questions. How have different societies thought about drinking water? How have different societies managed access to drinking water? And how have these changed over time? These questions are, of course, interrelated. How we think of water, whether as a sacred gift or a good for sale, both influences and is influenced by how we manage access to drinking water. While not an obvious issue to us in 21 st century America, management of drinking water as a resource - who gets it, when they get it, and how much they get - matters a great deal. Written for a symposium celebrating the scholarship of Carol Rose, this article synthesizes research to date from an ongoing book project on the history of drinking water. Using a case study approach, we journey on a wide-ranging geographical and historical tour, briefly exploring drinking water management in societies across five continents, from 5, 000 years ago up through today. Along the route, we find that <b>something</b> <b>as</b> seemingly <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> drinking water washes clear a society 2 ̆ 7 s views toward the role of government, norms, and the market...|$|R
