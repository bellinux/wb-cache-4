5|$|Over {{longer periods}} of time, new series of transits will start and old series will end. Unlike the <b>saros</b> series for lunar eclipses, it is {{possible}} for a transit series to restart after a hiatus. The transit series also vary much more in length than the <b>saros</b> series.|$|E
5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The <b>saros</b> is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A <b>saros</b> lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A <b>saros</b> series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A <b>saros</b> series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a <b>saros.</b> Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, <b>saros</b> cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. <b>Saros</b> cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the <b>saros,</b> which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E

5|$|The {{motion of}} the Moon can be {{measured}} accurately, and is noticeably more complex {{than that of the}} planets. The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called <b>Saros</b> cycle. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.|$|E
5|$|The table {{contains}} {{the date and}} time of the greatest eclipse (in dynamical time, {{which in this case}} is the time when the axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest to the centre of Earth; this is in Universal Time). The number of the <b>saros</b> series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, annular, partial or hybrid). For total and annular eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or annular eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Csák laid siege Buda in June 1311, and Ladislaus Kán {{declined}} {{to assist the}} king. Charles sent an army to invade Matthew Csák's domains in September, but it achieved nothing. In the same year, Ugrin Csák died, enabling Charles to take possession of the deceased lord's domains, which were situated between Požega in Slavonia and Temesvár (present-day Timișoara in Romania). The burghers of Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia) assassinated Amadeus Aba in September 1311. Charles's envoys arbitrated an agreement between Aba's sons and the town, which also prescribed that the Abas withdraw from two counties and allow the noblemen inhabiting their domains to freely join Charles. However, the Abas soon entered into an alliance with Matthew Csák against the king. The united forces of the Abas and Matthew Csák besieged Kassa, but Charles routed them in the Battle of Rozgony (now Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15June 1312. Almost half of the noblemen who had served Amadeus Aba fought on Charles's side in the battle. In July, Charles captured the Abas' many fortresses in Abaúj, Torna and <b>Sáros</b> counties, including Füzér, Regéc, and Munkács (now Mukacheve in Ukraine). Thereafter he waged war against Matthew Csák, capturing Nagyszombat (now Trnava in Slovakia) in 1313 and Visegrád in 1315, {{but was unable to}} win a decisive victory.|$|E

25|$|Each <b>saros</b> series {{starts with}} a partial eclipse (Sun first enters {{the end of the}} node), and each {{successive}} <b>saros</b> the path of the Moon is shifted either northward (when near the descending node) or southward (when near the ascending node) {{due to the fact that}} the <b>saros</b> is not an exact integer of draconic months (about one hour short). At some point, eclipses are no longer possible and the series terminates (Sun leaves the beginning of the node). Arbitrary dates were established by compilers of eclipse statistics. These extreme dates are 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. <b>Saros</b> series, of course, went on before and will continue after these dates. Since the first eclipse of 2000 BCE was not the first in its <b>saros,</b> it is necessary to extend the <b>saros</b> series numbers backwards beyond 0 to negative numbers to accommodate eclipses occurring in the years following 2000 BCE. The <b>saros</b> -13 is the first <b>saros</b> to appear in these data. For solar eclipses the statistics for the complete <b>saros</b> series within the era between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE are given in this article's references. It takes between 1226 and 1550 years for the members of a <b>saros</b> series to traverse the Earth's surface from north to south (or vice versa). These extremes allow from 69 to 87 eclipses in each series (most series have 71 or 72 eclipses). From 39 to 59 (mostly about 43) eclipses in a given series will be central (that is, total, annular, or hybrid annular-total).

25|$|As {{an example}} of a single <b>saros</b> series, this table gives the dates of some of the 72 lunar eclipses for <b>saros</b> series 138.

In each successive <b>saros,</b> the Moon's orbital path is shifted northward with respect to the Earth's shadow, with the first total eclipse occurring in 1950.
