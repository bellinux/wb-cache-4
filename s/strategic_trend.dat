40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of founder {{professional}} education background on {{the adoption of the}} open-science technology management strategy by a sample of 512 young biotechnology firms. One major finding of the paper is that after controlling for founder prior work experience and other organizational and environmental factors, biotechnology firms with proportionally more Ph. D. -holding entrepreneurs on the founding team have higher probability to adopt open science. A second note-worthy finding is that founder professional education background can mitigate the constraint of organizational environment on strategy. While a crowded technological niche provides a more challenging environment for firms to implement open science due to higher scooping risks, the deterring effect of such a high-risk environment is smaller among firms founded by proportionally more Ph. D. -holding entrepreneurs. I also found that the link between entrepreneurial professional education background and open science is stronger in a less favorable institutional environment for open science. The finding is consistent with and complements the growing body of work emphasizing the importance of entrepreneurial background in developing knowledge about new venture strategy and structure. It suggests that demographic changes in educational background of entrepreneurs in an organizational field may bring exogenous shocks to and shift the <b>strategic</b> <b>trend</b> in an organizational field.

Inclusive education of children with learning disabilities is a new <b>strategic</b> <b>trend</b> of educational policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan, significantly addressing fundamental education. This article considers the possibility of involving the schoolchildren with learning disabilities in educational process and the necessity to secure favorable environment and support for the children with learning disabilities in accordance with the Law “On Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan” and State Program of Education Development in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011 – 2012. The trend of maximum possible involvement of children with special needs in common general education institutions determines the educational culture dynamics in many countries of the world.

Centralized purchasing can bring advantages, such as increasing {{the efficiency of the}} purchasing process, but also disadvantages, such as the possibility of oligopoly by suppliers, generated by imperfect competition, and a diminished response to the most decentralized units. This theme {{was the subject of a}} reflection meeting, which aimed to promote a debate on the national framework aspects of this process, challenges of implementation for hospital medicines and suggestions for improvement of this process. The main ideas generated for a successful centralized purchasing indicate that the central purchasing entity should be dynamic and facilitator, should ensuring equity, safety, accessibility and quality of drugs. There should be better planning and rigorous procurement of drugs, and an integrated information system that allows sharing and networking among the central purchasing and the various health institutions, fostering a proximity policy, should be created. Professionals should be trained in the necessary technical procedures for the completion of the acquisition of drugs, and hospital pharmacists should be included as consultants in the development of specific procedures of centralized procurement, according to the hospital’s needs. Finally, this entire process must be followed by constant monitoring through an annual assessment of the economic and financial feasibility. The benefits of the activity performed annually should adequately quantify the quality and efficiency gains that demonstrate the financial impact achieved in scope of the reduction of expense in the National Health Service...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to study}} the role of network into open {{innovation}} route, viewed as key <b>strategic</b> <b>trend.</b> The description of a “thematic network”, formed by a partnership involved in a cultural heritage exploitation project, identifies those integration competencies {{that need to be}} generated and/or expanded in the main activities (diagnosis, conservation, storage, fruition). Their knowledge and development can help to prescribe appropriate behaviours to each network’s actor. They often encourage their partners through information exchanges and the dissemination of best practices, since the boundaries between them are porous. Briefly, this study shows that network-based approach is evolving toward a new physiognomy that gives value to open innovation model. With regard to the empirical check, it studied a thematic network, so called MIP (Transitional Metals in Paper). It dealt with the exchange of knowledge in the fields of development of technologies and solutions assessment for preservation of the European paper-based cultural heritage that is affected with corrosion caused by transitional metals. The empirical evidence involved board of network’s participants through semi-structured interviews conducted with project’s participants, who possess detailed knowledge on the development of preservation method and the new competencies. So, activities, roles, resources and configuration selected are identified and reviewed. The interaction between autonomous subjects exalts the innovative capacity and the ability to use and to diffuse accumulated competence. It allows a jointed growth of the complementary resources necessary to a whole network value systems viewed as a temporary association of firms to develop, test, deliver solutions/applications. Thus, to develop innovative knowledge/competence, they must identify external sources of distinctive resources. In coherence to the above, “thematic network” may be effectively expressed with the metaphor of complex network, where the potential energy generated by different sources must be put in circle and addressed towards specific solutions/applications. The value produced by the “thematic networks” depends on the integration of the individual competencies rather than on the management of every single organization. In fact, each one of actors analysed to forge new alliances and to respond more efficiently to market changes, interacts with various third parties during the innovation process to create a circuit of knowledge and trust resource. Therefore, lessons learned by open innovation route is that approaching a problem from "outside of own black box" will yield creative platform/architecture as there is a large source of untapped competencies globally available...|$|E

40|$|Guest editorial: This {{special issue}} has been drawn from papers that were {{published}} {{as part of the}} Second European Conference on Management of Technology (EuroMOT) which was held at Aston Business School (Birmingham, UK) 10 - 12 September 2006. This was the official European conference for the International Association for Management of Technology (IAMOT); the overall theme of the conference was “Technology and global integration. ” There were many high-calibre papers submitted to the conference and published in the associated proceedings (Bennett et al., 2006). The streams of interest that emerged from these submissions were the importance of: technology strategy, innovation, process technologies, managing change, national policies and systems, research and development, supply chain technology, service and operational technology, education and training, small company incubation, technology transfer, virtual operations, technology in developing countries, partnership and alliance, and financing and investment. This special issue focuses upon the streams of interest that accentuate the importance of collaboration between different organisations. Such organisations vary greatly in character; for instance, they may be large or small, publicly or privately owned, and operate in manufacturing or service sectors. Despite these varying characteristics they all have something in common; they all stress the importance of inter-organisational collaboration as a critical success factor for their organisation. In today's global economy it is essential that organisations decide what their core competencies are what those of complementing organisations are. Core competences should be developed to become a bases of differentiation, leverage and competitive advantage, whilst those that are less mature should be outsourced to other organisations that can claim to have had more recognition and success in that particular core competence (Porter, 2001). This <b>strategic</b> <b>trend</b> can be observed throughout advanced economies and is growing strongly. If a posteriori reasoning is applied here it follows that organisations could continue to become more specialised in fewer areas whilst simultaneously becoming more dependent upon other organisations for critical parts of their operations. Such actions seem to fly in the face of rational business strategy and so the question must be asked: why are organisations developing this way? The answer could lie in the recent changes in endogenous and exogenous factors of the organisation; the former emphasising resource-based issues in the short-term, and strategic positioning in the long-term whilst the later emphasises transaction costs in the short-term and acquisition of new skills and knowledge in the long-term. For a harmonious balance of these forces to prevail requires organisations to firstly declare a shared meta-strategy, then to put some cross-organisational processes into place which have their routine operations automated as far as possible. A rolling business plan would review, assess and reposition each organisation within this meta-strategy according to how well they have contributed (Binder and Clegg, 2006). The important common issue here is that an increasing number of businesses today are gaining direct benefit from increasing their levels of inter-organisational collaboration. Such collaboration has largely been possible due to recent technological advances which can make organisational structures more agile (e. g. the extended or the virtual enterprise), organisational infra-structure more connected, and the sharing of real-time information an operational reality. This special issue consists of research papers that have explored the above phenomenon in some way. For instance, the role of government intervention, the use of internet-based technologies, the role of research and development organisations, the changing relationships between start-ups and established firms, the importance of cross-company communities of practice, the practice of networking, the front-loading of large-scale projects, innovation and the probabilistic uncertainties that organisations experience are explored in these papers. The cases cited in these papers are limited as they have a Eurocentric focus. However, it is hoped that readers of this special issue will gain a valuable insight into the increasing importance of collaborative practices via these studies...|$|E
