5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint,</b> which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (<b>shoulder)</b> <b>joint</b> between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the initial effect of local vibration on the stability of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints</b> by applying local vibration to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints.</b> [Subjects and Methods] For the test, the subjects held a FlexBar with one hand, at about 10 cm from one end, and performed the oscillation movement with the shoulder at 90 ° flexion and the elbow in the full-extension position in scaption; the vibration stimulus was set to 5 Hz. Then, the subjects underwent the Upper Quarter Y Balance Test to evaluate the stability of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints.</b> [Results] The moving distances in the left, right, and upper directions after the oscillation movement were increased significantly compared with the results before the oscillation movement. [Conclusion] A vibration stimulus is effec-tive as an exercise method to increase the stability of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

25|$|Shoulder (Glenohumeral joint) (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or <b>shoulder,</b> <b>joint.</b> The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E

25|$|The biceps is {{a muscle}} {{in the upper}} arm with two heads, called the short head and the long head, which {{converge}} into a single mass. It {{is one of the}} three muscles in the anterior compartment of the arm, the others being the brachialis muscle and the coracobrachialis muscle, with which the biceps shares a nerve supply. Both heads of the biceps arise from the scapula in the shoulder, and the muscle attaches to the radius (bone), in the forearm. Specifically, the short head of the biceps originates from the coracoid process {{at the top of the}} scapula. The long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle just above the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint.</b> From here, the long head has a tendon that passes up along the intertubercular groove of the humerus into the joint capsule of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint.</b> The tendon of the short head runs adjacent to the tendon of the coracobrachialis and likewise attaches to the coracoid process.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E

25|$|The legs of tetrapods, {{the main}} group of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates, have internal bones, with externally attached muscles for movement, {{and the basic}} form has three key joints: the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint,</b> the knee joint, and the ankle joint, at which the foot is attached. Within this theme there is much variation in form. An alternative form of vertebrate 'leg' to the tetrapod leg is the fins found on amphibious fish.

25|$|Tendon {{transfers}} are {{prescribed for}} young, active cuff-tear patients who experience weakness and decreased range of motion, but little pain. The technique {{is not considered}} appropriate for older people, or those with pre-operative stiffness or nerve injuries. People diagnosed with glenohumeral arthritis and rotator cuff anthropathy often undergo hemiarthroplasty, which entails replacement of the humerus portion of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint.</b> Elderly patients with recurring cuff tears and degenerative glenohumeral arthritis sometimes receive total shoulder arthroplasty (replacement). Another surgery, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, is effective for others.|$|E
25|$|Originally, this {{definition}} {{said that the}} elbow joint must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it {{near the top of}} the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.|$|E

50|$|Spinal {{flexibility}} is another challenge since the spine is effectively {{a stack of}} limited-motion ball joints. There is no simple combination of external single-axis hinges that can easily match {{the full range of}} motion of the human spine. A chain of external ball joints behind the spine can perform a close approximation, though it is again the parallel-bar length problem. Leaning forward from the waist, the suit <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints</b> would press down into the wearer's body. Leaning back from the waist, the suit <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints</b> would lift off the wearer's body.

25|$|Several {{contrary}} {{claims have}} been made against that the flight capabilities of Confuciusornis. The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In Senter's {{of the position of}} the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint,</b> a normal upstroke would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that {{due to the lack of}} a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the Musculus pectoralis minor could not serve as a M. supracoracoideus lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a foramen triosseum. This, coupled with a limited upstroke caused by a lateral position of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint,</b> would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors therefore proposed that Confuciusornis used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like a squirrel. Daniel Hembree however, while acknowledging that tree climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25° relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the antitrochanter in the hip joint. Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that Confuciusornis climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees Confuciusornis as capable of flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.|$|E
25|$|The <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> is {{the most}} {{frequently}} dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four muscles of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle and teres major muscles arise and exist in the shoulder region itself. The deltoid muscle covers the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> on three sides, arising from the front upper third of the clavicle, the acromion, and {{the spine of the}} scapula, and travelling to insert on the deltoid tubercle of the humerus. Contraction of each part of the deltoid assists in different movements of the shoulder - flexion (clavicular part), abduction (middle part) and extension (scapular part). The teres major attaches to the outer part {{of the back of the}} scapula, beneath the teres minor, and attaches to the upper part of the humerus. It helps with medial rotation of the humerus.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{positioning}} and sleeve type bracing on passive position sense of <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints</b> of healthy untrained subjects. Method: A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints</b> of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive neoprene sleeve type of brace at two different start positions (45 ˚ internal rotation, 75 ˚external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0. 5 /̊s. The angular displacements from the target angles {{at the end of the}} reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores. Results: The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0. 99 (0. 06)) was significantly (p, 0. 001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher at the 45 ˚ internal rotation start position than at the 75 ˚ external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p. 0. 05) interaction between brace application and start position. Conclusion: Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of <b>shoulder</b> <b>joints.</b> Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle of ichthyosaurs {{is not much}} modified from its original condition. Some basal forms show a hatchet- or crescent-shaped shoulder blade or scapula; derived forms have an elongated blade positioned on a broader base. The scapula is not fused with the coracoid into a scapulocoracoid, indicating that the forces exerted on the {{shoulder girdle}} were moderate. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> is positioned {{on the border between}} the scapula and the coracoid. Both coracoids are fused on their common midline. The coracoid shape is very variable, but usually it is rather low. The upper part of the shoulder girdle is formed by two long and slender clavicles, crowned by a central interclavicular bone that is large and triangular with basal forms, small and T-shaped in Jurassic species. Breast bones or sterna are absent.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint,</b> along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
25|$|Active {{treatments}} are light repetitive exercises that work {{the area to}} maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck.

When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>joint</b> by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery. Rosenfeld found that doing active exercises as often as once every waken hour during one month after trauma decreases the need for sick leave three years after trauma from 25% to 5.7%.|$|E
