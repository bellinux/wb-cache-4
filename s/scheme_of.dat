5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract.

The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the question <b>of</b> which zero-dimensional <b>schemes</b> deform to {{a collection of}} distinct points; equivalently, we ask which Artinian k-algebras deform to a product of fields.

Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes.

The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in {{the separation of powers}} on the government.|$|E

All three airports opened on 4 May 1963, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Services were at first operated by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). At first the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo in combination with flights to Alta and Kirkenes—from 1964 also to Tromsø.
