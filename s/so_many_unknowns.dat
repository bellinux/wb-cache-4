2500|$|When adopted {{children}} grow into young adults, many {{worry about their}} health. For many {{adopted children}}, their adoptive families are given little to none of their medical history, especially if the adoption was international. This can be {{due to lack of}} information {{on the part of the}} biological family, type of adoption or circumstance in which the adoptee was found (for example being left at an orphanage in a foreign country). Simple trips to the doctor or dentist, for something as small as a check up, can bring about great worry because there is <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> to ones health when the person is adopted. Anxiety over lack of medical history may become worse for those who are seeking to get married and start a family. If one of the parents is unaware of medical history, having a child becomes much more difficult. The risks of being unable to conceive, or the child being born with certain health issues are higher because parental medical history is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Because of Piñeiro's {{volatile}} performance {{before the}} 2009 season, critics were {{split on the}} deal, with most wondering whether his sinkerball {{would continue to be}} effective in 2010. Taking the sinkerball as starting point, Fangraph's Dave Allen thought, [...] "the price was solid." [...] Baseball Prospectus's Christina Kahrl pointed out the different starters that failed after leaving Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan's guiding hand. [...] "There are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> that it makes the proposition that he'll deliver on this deal seem dubious", concluding [...] "this just doesn't seem like it'll go well." [...] Meanwhile, ESPN's Rob Neyer said quality was not so important as quantity: Piñeiro would be worth the contract if he would just pitch 200 innings per season.|$|E
50|$|If the {{hydrosphere}} exists, estimates in a {{paper from}} 2013 put its depth at around 5 kilometers below the surface. Whether this layer exists or not depends on the presence or otherwise of perchlorates, and clathrates, and it also depends on the total inventory of water on Mars, <b>so</b> there are <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> in the models. They used {{an estimate of the}} total inventory of less than 500m GEL (Global Equivalent Layer), and doubled the required thickness of the cryosphere, which leaves less water available for the hydrosphere than in previous models.

That night, Littlefoot finds the Rainbow Faces and asks them if the meteorite he saw really was a Stone of Cold Fire. They admit that while it wasn't, his effort to search for it was what really mattered, and reiterate that there are <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> to be discovered [...] "beyond the Mysterious Beyond". Littlefoot is then momentarily distracted, and when he turns around, he finds that the Rainbow Faces have disappeared in a pillar of light. As his friends find him, an inspired Littlefoot reflects that there are <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> and that such unknowns make life wonderful.|$|R
50|$|Quantum decoherence, on {{the other}} hand (in {{combination}} with the consistent histories approach), recovers classical behaviour at the macroscopic level. The formal mathematics of this approach allows us to demonstrate, finally, that is impossible (or rather, massively improbable) for a macroscopic Schrödinger's cat to exist for longer than a minuscule time (related to the macroscopic energy dissipation time by a factor involving the square of Planck's constant) in a quantum superposition of its |alive> and |dead> states. Even for a cat otherwise isolated {{from the rest of the}} Universe, and even with no observer present, there are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> in the quantum state of the whole cat, that the relevant mathematics determine that only the normally observed classical states of the cat are at all probable, except over the very shortest of timescales. This reasoning is developed formally within measurement theory, and applies to any macroscopic, non-super cooled measuring device, whether or not there is an observer to watch it.|$|E

5000|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} {{at the outset that}} the history of rumba is filled with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>unknowns,</b> contradictions, conjectures and myths which have, over time been taken as fact, that any definitive history of the genre is probably impossible to reconstruct. Even elders who were present at historic junctures in rumba’s development will often disagree over the critical details of its history. David Peñalosa Enslaved Africans were first brought in Cuba in the 16th century by the early Spanish settlers. Due to the significance of sugar as an export during the late 18th and early 19th century, even greater numbers of people from Africa were enslaved, brought to Cuba, and forced to work on the sugar plantations. Where large populations of enslaved Africans lived, African religion, dance, and drumming were clandestinely preserved through the generations. Cultural retention among the Bantu, Yoruba, Fon (Arará), and Efik (Abakuá) had the most significant impact in western Cuba, where rumba was born. The consistent interaction of Africans and Europeans on the island brought about what today is known as Afro-Cuban culture. This is a process known as transculturation, an idea that Cuban scholar Fernando Ortiz brought to the forefront in cultural studies like Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar. Cuban transculturation melds Spanish culture with African cultures, as with the seamless merging found in rumba. Ortiz saw transculturation as a positive social force: [...] "consecrating the need for mutual understanding on an objective grounding of truth to move toward achieving the definitive integrity of the nation." ...|$|E

40|$|From a {{clinical}} perspective, epithelial ovarian cancer {{is something of}} an enigma. Despite improvements in aggressive debulking surgery and the initial good response of patients to platinum-based chemotherapies, there has been little improvement in the survival rates for over three decades. About 65 % of women with epithelial ovarian cancer will die within five years of their diagnosis [1]. Early-stage ovarian cancers are often asymptomatic and the recognised signs and symptoms, even of late-stage disease, are vague. Consequently, most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and it seems unlikely that symptoms alone could help to improve the proportion of tumours that are diagnosed at earlier, more treatable stages. Unfortunately, there are no effective biomarkers that can identify early-stage disease and no reliable prognostic markers for predicting clinical response and guiding treatment regimes. Furthermore, there remains intense debate about the cellular origins, precursor lesions, and histological classification of the disease. With <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>unknowns,</b> it is perhaps not surprising that progress in reducing mortality in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer has been so limited...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} my lecture is Australian-Japanese {{relations}} {{since the end}} of the Second World War, but I’m keen to explore these relations in the context of ideas, efforts and practical results in relation to collaborative and other efforts towards regionalism in the Asia Pacific. My general argument is that, on the one hand, Australian-Japanese relations have developed with a strength that would have been hard to imagine in 1945, and with an important focus on regional growth and security. The incremental steps taken may have been small and at a steady pace but, given the legacy of deep scars resulting from the Second World War and given the limitations on the defence aspects of Japan’s postwar involvement in regional affairs (ie the self defence requirement of the Constitution and the practice of spending not more than one per cent of Gross National Product on defence), these have been very successfully negotiated steps. On the other hand, there are some opportunities for greater joint leadership in the region which may or may not be realized. The incremental steps took place in difficult and changing circumstances; and what I would like to do now is remind us of how many unknowns attached to what might happen in Australian- Japan relationships after the Second World War, partly because there were <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>unknowns</b> about how the post-war international order would settle, and partly because Australian-Japanese relations started from such a desperately low point. I will try to walk through some of the key features of different periods, as I see the periodisation logically falling out after the war, and draw some thoughts together in relation to more recent initiatives on regional and bilateral co-operation. My training is as a historian, and that shapes the way this lecture works, and for most of my career I have been an Australian historian of international relations, looking particularly at Australia’s changing role in world affairs, and that is also likely to show in what follows－possibly at the expense of greater detail from Japanese perspectives. But I hope you will understand that, and also the limitations involved in trying to paint with a broad brush on a huge historical canvas...|$|E
