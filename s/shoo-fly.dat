In {{order to avoid}} interfering with train service, a <b>shoo-fly</b> track was constructed {{to the east of}} the original line, while a new crossing free line was constructed upon the original right of way. The SIRT continued to lose money even as it rebuilt stations between Jefferson Avenue and New Dorp almost into the 1970s. The closing of Bethlehem Steel in 1960, and of U.S. Gypsum in 1972 led to a dramatic decline in rail traffic via the Arthur Kill Bridge; however, there still was enough traffic in the 1970s to keep car floats reasonably busy.|$|E

50|$|In 1933, the {{original}} station was razed {{as part of}} a grade elimination project that was occurring along the Montauk, Atlantic, and Babylon Branches throughout the mid-20th century. Prior to this, a temporary station was relocated on a <b>shoo-fly</b> north of the former station on August 10, 1932, then moved to another one south of the former station on August 31 of the same year. The third elevated center-island structure that exists today was opened north of the former location on February 7, 1933, and although the wye was removed as part of the reconstruction, it remained on many maps well into the late-20th Century, and continues to be shown on some in the present.|$|E
50|$|Nicandra is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plants in the}} nightshade family containing the single species Nicandra physalodes. It is known by the common names apple-of-Peru and <b>shoo-fly</b> plant. It is thought originally to have been native to Peru (known elsewhere as an introduced species and sometimes as a weed) and is found nowadays as a ruderal species in tropical, subtropical and, to a lesser extent, temperate areas all over the world. It has also long been cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers and curious fruits (the latter sometimes dried for use in floral design) and has been adopted into the traditional medicine of countries far-removed from its original home.|$|E
5000|$|In 1870, the Oregon State Legislature {{allocated}} {{funds for}} the construction of locks {{on the west side of}} the falls. By 1873 the locks were complete. Steamers could now move directly from Portland all the way to the Corvallis, with no portage. Towns based on the portage, like Canemah, started to fade in importance. During the 1870s, three or four more steamboats were built at Canemah, and these were the last to be built above the falls: the <b>Shoo-Fly</b> (Another steamboat on the Columbia River built three years later was named Don't Bother Me), Alice, and McMinnville (1877), and the smaller Carrie Norton (1878). [...] By 1892, the name Canemah had been almost forgotten and the area came to be known as simply another part of Oregon City. [...] Canemah is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.|$|E
5000|$|Crandall is {{credited}} for inventing the <b>Shoo-fly</b> {{design of the}} rocking horse in 1859 and in 1861 he was issued a patent for a spring-loaded rocking horse. Both designs differed from the traditional bow rocker and were quite popular until the 1880 Marqua safety stand. Maqua's design was seen with disdain by purists. As a young man, after making a hobby horse nearly {{the size of a}} pony, he gave it to a boy who was to later become King Edward VII. The popularity of these larger toy horses affected adults also as author Nathaniel P. Willis wrote about it in Health and Happiness on Horseback. Actor Joseph Jefferson rode across the stage of what became the Winter Garden theatre on a Crandall designed horse. Benjamin P. Jr. was described as the [...] "self-styled 'inventor of the hobby horse'" [...] and was issued a patent for an improved model of combined rocking horse and swing in 1873.However, Jesse had patented what he called a hobby horse as shown in his 1859 patent application illustration.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson {{was trained}} at the New England Conservatory and then studied in London. His career began as an {{interesting}} public school teacher {{in his hometown of}} Jacksonville, Florida. Travelling to New York, he began his show business career along with his brother and Bob Cole. As a songwriting team, they wrote works such as The Evolution of Ragtime (1903). Among the earliest works by the group, this was a suite of six songs of [...] "Negro" [...] music. They produced two successful Broadway operettas with casts of black actors: <b>Shoo-Fly</b> Regiment of 1906 and The Red Moon of 1908. Johnson also performed in them. He played a Tuskegee soldier that enlists in the Spanish-American War in The Shoo Fly Regiment and portrayed African American Plunk Green opposite Abbie Mitchell’s Minnehaha, a mixed Indian/black woman, in The Red Moon. [...] These performances went beyond theatre. Rosamund, alongside his brother and Cole, evoked a political presence in their inclusion of other races in their musicals. [...] In The Red Moon, Cole and Johnson broke racial lines as they included a love scene between Rosamund’s Green and Mitchell’s Minnehaha. This spotlight on Native Americans was so well received that Rosamund was inducted as a ‘sub-chief’ into the Iroquois tribe of Montreal’s Caugnawago Reservation.|$|E
40|$|Os grupos 3 e 4 de anastomose (AG- 3 e AG- 4) do fungo Rhizoctonia solani são importantes grupos associados à batata no mundo. No Brasil, o AG- 3 é relatado afetando principalmente batata e fumo. Já o AG- 4 causa perdas consideráveis em culturas de importância econômica, como a soja, o feijão e o amendoim, podendo ocorrer também em hortaliças como o espinafre, o pimentão, o brócolis, o tomate, a batata e frutíferas como o melão. Recentemente foi constatada, em Brasília-DF, a associação de R. solani a plantas invasoras em áreas de cultivo de batata. Entretanto, não há informação a respeito da etiologia do patógeno bem como do papel de espécies invasoras como outras hospedeiras no ciclo do patógeno. Objetivou-se com esse estudo caracterizar isolados de R. solani obtidos de batata e de outras três espécies de plantas invasoras associadas a áreas de cultivo da cultura: juá-de-capote [Nicandra physaloides (L.) Pers., Solanaceae], beldroega (Portulaca oleracea L., Portulacaceae), e caruru (Amaranthus deflexus L., Amaranthaceae). Foi confirmada a hipótese de que os isolados obtidos de R. solani de beldroega, caruru e juá-de-capote pertencem ao grupo 4 de anastomose e são patogênicos à batata, exceto o isolado de beldroega. Estes isolados apresentaram patogenicidade cruzada às três espécies e também patogênicos à maria-pretinha (Solanum americanum Mill.), uma outra espécie de Solanaceae invasora. A classificação dos isolados no grupo AG- 4 HGI ou no grupo AG- 4 HGIII (isolado de caruru) foi confirmada através de características culturais e moleculares (seqüenciamento da região ITS- 5. 8 S do rDNA). Os resultados deste trabalho trazem implicações importantes para o manejo das podridões radiculares de Rhizoctonia em batata. The {{anastomosis}} groups 3 and 4 (AG- 3 and AG- 4) of {{the fungus}} Rhizoctonia solani are important groups associated with potatoes worldwide. In Brazil, the AG- 3 is reported affecting mainly potatoes and tobacco. The AG- 4 cause considerable losses in crops of economic importance, such as soybean, beans and peanuts {{and may also}} occur in vegetables such as spinach, pepper, broccoli, tomatoes, potatoes and fruit such as melons. The association of R. solani with invasive plants was recently established in potato production areas from Brasília, DF. However, there is no information about the etiology of the pathogen {{as well as the}} role of invasive species as alternative hosts in the life cycle of the pathogen. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize isolates of R. solani obtained from potatoes and three other invasive plant species associated with areas of potato production: <b>Shoo-fly</b> plant [Nicandra physaloides (L.) Pers., Solanaceae], pigweed (Portulaca oleracea L., Portulacaceae), and low-amaranth (Amaranthus deflexus L., Amaranthaceae). It was confirmed the hypothesis that the R. solani isolates obtained from pigweed, low-amaranth and <b>Shoo-fly</b> plant belong to the anastomosis group 4 and, except for the isolate from pigweed, are pathogenic to potatoes. These isolates were cross pathogencic to all the three weed species tested and also to American nightshade (Solanum americanum Mill.), another Solanaceae invasive of potato fields. The placement of the isolates in the group AG- 4 HGI or in the group AG- 4 HGIII (isolate from caruru) was confirmed by cultural and molecular characteristics (sequencing of the ITS- 5. 8 S region of rDNA). The results of this study provide important implications for the management of the Rhizoctonia root rot in potatoes...|$|E
