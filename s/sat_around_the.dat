500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who all <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} veiled accusations made {{against him in}} the Public Ledger, Kent {{determined}} to clear his name, and accompanied by a witness went to see John Moore. [...] The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had drawn up for the ghost to answer. [...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E
2500|$|A padded [...] {{circular}} bourrelet (or rondel) evolved, which <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> head, whilst the cornette {{became much}} longer, and gradually more scarf-like in shape, until by the 1430s {{it was usually}} straight at the sides and square-ended. Especially in Italy, the cornette was sometimes dispensed with, leaving just an un-flared tubular patte fixed to the bourrelet all round and hanging down {{to one side of}} the head. Reed (see refs) calls these sack hats.|$|E

60|$|All <b>sat</b> down <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fire, {{for further}} sleep {{was out of}} the question. Thus an hour went by, but nothing came to disturb them.|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> glumly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table, {{some of them}} hardly {{eating at}} all. The only one {{who seemed to be}} enjoying himself was Captain Franco.|$|R
2500|$|Adele later {{collaborated with}} famed {{musician}} and producer Dan Wilson to write [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{which was one}} of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar. The two <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: [...] "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school." [...] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible. He added [...] "We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan." [...] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio. The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who was {{the first}} bride who came to this house, Captain Jim?" [...] Anne asked, as they <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{fireplace}} after supper.|$|E
60|$|As {{the ship}} sped {{back toward the}} moon base they <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table in the dining room, sipping hot coffee and thinking, not saying very much.|$|E
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> upon <b>the</b> benches, or {{leaning against}} the wall, {{and stared at the}} ruined laces with various emotions, the keenest being regret for the loss of so much {{beautiful}} handwork and sympathy for Mildred Leighton.|$|R
50|$|Magda later {{recalled}} {{the significance of}} McHale’s return from his formative visit to America laden with imagery culled from American sources. “We all <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> floor for hours and looked through this unbelievable trunk of materials,” she said.|$|R
60|$|I {{collected}} old George, who very decently {{volunteered to}} stagger along with me, and we hopped into a taxi. We <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> police-station {{for a bit}} on a wooden bench {{in a sort of}} ante-room, and presently a policeman appeared, leading in Cyril.|$|R
60|$|However, he was {{not much}} disturbed, and the boys <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camp for an hour, waiting for Shep to return. Then they {{prepared}} dinner, and while eating talked about the sports still to come.|$|E
60|$|Eagerly {{the boys}} rowed {{up to the}} spot where the muskrats had <b>sat.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> rocks the clear water was churned up into mud. But on the surface floated the two bodies of the creatures.|$|E
60|$|All {{thoughts}} of sleep were {{now out of}} the question, and the three <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> tiny campfire, discussing the situation. With the first streak of dawn Barringford set to work skinning the buffalo, and Dave assisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're ready," [...] Margaret Duffe answered. The Council members <b>sat</b> alertly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table. At the far end, Reinhart and Dixon watched uneasily {{as the big}} Pole removed {{papers from}} his {{briefcase}} and carefully examined them.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{we found}} the meat gloriously done, and Jerry waiting, anxious. We <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> grass, and got hunks of it on our tin plates. Maximilian Jones, always made tender-hearted by drink, cried some because George Washington couldn't be there to enjoy the day. 'There was a man I love, Billy,' he says, weeping on my shoulder. 'Poor George! To think he's gone, and missed the fireworks. A little more salt, please, Jerry.' ...|$|R
5000|$|When first cast in The Wire, Pierce and his castmates {{doubted the}} show {{would be a}} hit: [...] "I {{remember}} the first time we all <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> and watched <b>the</b> pilot. We all turned to each other and said, 'Man, I don't think this shit is going anywhere.'" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the last}} buggy had driven away, Felicity set {{a batch of}} bread, {{and the rest of}} us <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> back porch steps in the cat's light and ate cherries, {{shooting}} the stones at each other. Cecily was in quest of information.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} our story {{was at an}} end the supper was served, and never did two boys make a heartier meal than did Phil and I. As we all <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table Mr. Henshaw asked us many questions, and made {{numerous}} notes of our answers.|$|E
60|$|It {{was long}} after midnight before the {{conversation}} {{in relation to}} the proposed trip to Africa came to an end. Mrs. Rover insisted that the boys should eat something, and they <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table discussing the viands and the two letters at the same time.|$|E
60|$|Then all {{the little}} meadow people and forest folks <b>sat</b> down <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Smiling Pool to wait. They watched the smoke roll up until it hid the face of jolly, round, red Mr. Sun. Their hearts almost stood still with fear as they saw the fierce, angry, red flames leap {{into the air and}} climb tall trees {{on the edge of the}} Green Forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab {{and gave}} {{the name of an}} hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too. So far it was all plain sailing. He hadn't the remotest notion that anyone was on to him. Well, he just <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> hotel lounge, reading the papers and so on, till it was time for dinner. He didn't hurry any over that either.|$|R
50|$|When Professor Bohr {{returned}} to Denmark {{after the war}} he contacted us to discuss his visions concerning the future of his Institute. We <b>sat,</b> rather moved, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> only drawing available: a layout plan of the Institute on which the routes of the German guards were indicated in red ink, one dot for each step.|$|R
60|$|When night came on {{they put}} some fresh logs {{on the fire}} and cooked another meal of venison steak. Then, later on, they <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> blaze, talking and eating nuts and apples. The tramp slept on soundly and they left him where he was, even when they retired.|$|E
60|$|It was Stephen's {{intention}} {{to return to}} Portsmouth on the following morning, and the friends <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camp-fire until a late hour that evening. Walter had many messages to send {{to his mother and}} Master McCleary, and if the messenger remembered them all his memory must have been prodigious.|$|E
60|$|None {{could answer}} that question. They <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cage, {{brooding}} over the problem, until the Monkey fell asleep. Seeing this, the Canary tucked her head under her wing and also slept, and the Tin Owl and the Brown Bear did not disturb them until morning came {{and it was}} broad daylight.|$|E
40|$|Hill-climbing {{has been}} shown to be more {{effective}} than exhaustive search in solving satisfiability problems. Also, it has been used either by itself or in combination with other methods to solve the most difficult region of SAT, the phase transition. We show that hill-climbing also finds <b>SAT</b> problems difficult <b>around</b> <b>the</b> phase transition. It too follows an easyhard-eays transition...|$|R
60|$|The show farmer {{had taken}} his folk to church, but we {{friendly}} slipped through his gates and reached the silent, spick-and-span house, with its trim barn, and a vast mound of copper-coloured wheat, piled in the sun between two mounds of golden chaff. Every one thumbed a sample of it and passed judgment--it must have been worth a few hundred golden sovereigns as it lay, out on <b>the</b> veldt--and we <b>sat</b> <b>around,</b> on <b>the</b> farm machinery, and, in the hush that a shut-up house always imposes, we seemed to hear the lavish earth getting ready for new harvests. There was no true wind, but a push, as it were, of the whole crystal atmosphere.|$|R
6000|$|We talked {{pictures}} steadily till it {{was time}} to dress for dinner. At least, they did. I just sort of <b>sat</b> <b>around.</b> Presently <b>the</b> subject of picture-robberies came up. Somebody mentioned the [...] "Monna Lisa," [...] and then I happened to remember seeing something in the evening paper, as I was coming down in the train, about some fellow somewhere having had a valuable painting pinched by burglars the night before. It was the first time I had had a chance of breaking into the conversation with any effect, and I meant {{to make the most of}} it. The paper was in the pocket of my overcoat in the hall. I went and fetched it.|$|R
60|$|Then {{all hands}} <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> tent {{to prevent any}} one from {{awakening}} the old man without good and sufficient cause, until sunrise, when word was passed {{from one to another}} that orders had been given to load all tents on the baggage-wagons, for the army was to move within an hour.|$|E
60|$|But {{in truth}} this chief, with the {{wonderful}} sagacity natural to Indians, had observed matters which totally escaped the young braves, and, like a wily old fox, he {{waited to see}} which cub would prove the keenest. Not one of them, however, noted anything unusual. They <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fire, ate their meat and parched corn, and chatted volubly.|$|E
60|$|Supper was had, {{and the boy}} {{hunters and}} Tommy <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camp fire for two hours, {{discussing}} the situation and planning {{what they would do}} for the days to come. It was decided to pay a visit to the lake {{for the remainder of the}} supplies two days later---after they had hunted and taken pictures and rested up a little.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{very long}} Doña Rita and Blunt rejoined {{us and we}} <b>sat</b> down <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table; but before we could begin to talk a {{dramatically}} sudden ring {{at the front door}} stilled our incipient animation. Doña Rita looked at us all in turn, with surprise and, as it were, with suspicion. “How did he know I was here?” she whispered after looking at the card which was brought to her. [...] She passed it to Blunt, who passed it to Mills, who made a faint grimace, dropped it on the table-cloth, and only whispered to me, “A journalist from Paris.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Marlene Dietrich, who was Richter's friend, {{wrote in}} her autobiography, Marlene: [...] "One evening <b>the</b> {{audience}} <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> him on <b>the</b> stage. While he was playing a piece, a woman directly behind him collapsed and died on the spot. She was carried out of the hall. I was deeply impressed by this incident and thought to myself: “What an enviable fate, to die while Richter is playing! What a strong feeling for the music this woman must have had when she breathed out her life!” But Richter did not share this opinion, he was shaken".|$|R
5000|$|Visit of Gabriel Beranger 1779In 1779 {{the artist}} Gabriel Beranger {{travelled}} throughout Ireland {{to paint the}} 'antiquities’ of Ireland for the Hibernian Antiquarian Society. On his travels he passed through Tulsk and Rathcroghan. He noted that on May Day he witnessed a scene ‘peculiar to this locality’:It was that of ‘driving in all the black cattle from the surrounding plains to the great fort Mound, and bleeding them {{for the benefit of}} their health, while crowds of country people, having brought turf for firing, <b>sat</b> <b>around</b> and cooked <b>the</b> blood mixed with oaten meal, and when they could be procured, onions or scallions.’From A Memoir of Gabriel Beranger, available online; https://archive.org/details/memoirgabrielbe01wildgoog ...|$|R
