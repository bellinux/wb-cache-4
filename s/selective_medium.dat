25|$|The second {{high-throughput}} {{approach is}} the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on <b>selective</b> <b>medium</b> the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach.|$|E
25|$|Although theoretically, any living cell {{might be}} used as the {{background}} to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast S. cerevisiae has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms. Yeast cells often {{do not have the same}} post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on <b>selective</b> <b>medium</b> to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this <b>selective</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
40|$|A <b>selective</b> {{motility}} <b>medium</b> {{was used}} as a secondary <b>selective</b> enrichment <b>medium</b> to examine specimens naturally contaminated with salmonellae. The medium, incubated at 37 degrees C, was inoculated from either selenite brilliant green sulfa enrichment broth or Müller-Kauffman tetrathionate broth, both of which had been incubated at 42 degrees C.

Tetrathionate broth, when used singly, was significantly better than selenite brilliant green sulfa broth, which detected 55 % of positive specimens at both 24 and 48 h.

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} type of {{infection}} present, an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly {{and sent to the}} laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzyme-based tests. A Gram stain is first performed to guide the way, which should show typical gram-positive bacteria, cocci, in clusters. Second, the isolate is cultured on mannitol salt agar, which is a <b>selective</b> <b>medium</b> with 7–9% NaCl that allows S. aureus to grow, producing yellow-colored colonies as a result of mannitol fermentation and subsequent drop in the medium's pH.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} made by cell culture that involves fusing myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells immunized with the desired antigen. Rabbit B-cells {{can be used}} to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a <b>selective</b> <b>medium</b> in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the de novo purine synthesis pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to aminopterin (a folic acid analogue, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the recovery of}} yeasts from clinical specimens cultured on routine bacteriological media to the recovery of yeast from specimens cultured on a <b>selective</b> fungal <b>medium</b> (Sabouraud agar). The use of Sabouraud agar was especially important in cases of mixed cultures, since in such cases yeast was recovered on bacteriological media from only 50 % of 44 yeast-positive pus specimens and from 22. 5 % of 22 yeast-positive throat specimens. The use of a <b>selective</b> fungal <b>medium</b> is therefore necessary to ensure the detection of yeast in specimens containing a mixture of bacteria and yeasts. As a result, clinicians must request yeast isolation when clinically indicated, and the microbiological laboratory must add a <b>selective</b> fungal <b>medium</b> when clinically significant yeasts {{are likely to be}} encountered.

2500|$|Membrane {{filtration}} is {{the method}} of choice {{for the analysis of}} fecal coliforms in water. [...] Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 micrometre). [...] The microorganisms present in the water remain on the filter surface. [...] The filter is placed in a sterile petri dish with a <b>selective</b> <b>medium,</b> growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while other non--target organisms is suppressed. [...] Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the initial inoculum size can be determined. [...] Typically sample volumes of 100 ml will be used for water testing and filtered, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony density range of 20 to 60 colonies per filter. [...] Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a [...] "countable" [...] membrane. The filter is placed on a petri dish containing M-FC agar and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F). [...] This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth. [...] As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the aniline dye in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{recovery}} of yeast from clinical specimens cultured on routine bacteriological media was compared with recovery on a <b>selective</b> fungal <b>medium.</b> Overgrowing of bacteria in mixed bacterial and yeast specimens was suppressing the yeast growth on bacteriological media. Totally 229 pus specimens used for evaluating of bacteriological and fungal selective media. The specimens were cultured on bacteriologic media (blood and chocolate agar) {{as well as}} on Sabouraud agar containing Chloramphenicol (50 mg l) to inhibit bacterial growth. 1 Finally the yeast growth was reported semi-quantitatively as light, moderate, or heavy and the results analyzed using SPSS software. The number of specimens yielding yeast growth in bacterial and sabouraud agar was compared using Chi-square test. Using Sabouraud agar particularly in cases of mixed infections was very useful for recovering of yeast, because yeast was only recovered from 29. 3 % of 41 yeast-positive pus specimens (Chi-square = 7. 74, P = 0. 005) and also from 24 % of 25 yeast-positive throat specimens (Chi-square = 11. 09,val P = 0. 00008) using bacteriologic cultures. Using <b>selective</b> fungal <b>medium</b> for culturing of specimens containingval a mixture of bacteria and yeasts is very helpful and necessary for accurate detection of yeasts. Clinicians must request yeast isolation when clinical manifestatation of patient showed probable yeast infection and in this case the microbiological laboratory must add a <b>selective</b> fungal <b>medium</b> to isolate yeast etiological agents. In clinical studies of yeast infections, {{it is also important to}} use selective fungal cultures...|$|R
