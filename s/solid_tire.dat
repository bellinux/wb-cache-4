40|$|Abstract — In {{this study}} a new {{approach}} in heating system for pyrolysis technology to the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> wastes has been developed. A fixed-bed fire-tube heating pyrolysis reactor system has been designed and fabricated considering all of the process parameters. The <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> wastes were pyrolysed in the reactor under N 2 atmosphere. The highest liquid product yield was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 475 oC for feed size of 4 cm 3 and vapor residence time of 5 sec. The tire pyrolysis liquids have been characterized including fuel properties, elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1 H-NMR, GC-MS analysis and distillation. The fuel properties of the pyrolytic liquids encourage their use as replacements for conventional liquid fuels. The analytical results of the 475 oC liquids showed that the tire-derived liquids are a complex mixture of C 5 –C 16 organic compounds, {{with a lot of}} high value light hydrocarbon limonene, single ring alkyl-aromatics and long-chain hydrocarbons.

40|$|It is {{advantageous}} to use small scale {{testing in the}} design phase of tires due to the costs and uncontrollable environmental conditions of outdoor testing. Therefore a laboratory abrasion and skid tester is used to obtain more insight in the contact of a tread compound with the road for dry conditions. In the experimental setup a small <b>solid</b> <b>tire,</b> with adjustable slip angle, is pressed on an abrasive corundum disk. The present friction between the abrasive disk and <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> drives the tire and the resulting forces are measured with a triaxial force sensor. Several experiments under different normal loads, slip angles and velocities of the disk are conducted. To explain observed phenomena of lateral force measurements for a free rolling tire under a number of slip angles a FE model is used. The relevant parts of the setup are modeled in Abaqus and the steady state performance of the small tire under different slip angles is evaluated. It is shown that the present turnslip, which has great impact on the slip velocity field at {{the trailing edge of}} the contact area, is captured well with the model. Furthermore the calculated cornering stiffnesses are in good agreement with the experiments...|$|E
40|$|Loadstar(pvt) Ltd {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{industrial}} tire, wheel and track manufacturers in Sri Lanka which started as a small company and became the number one <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> exporter in the world today. This study was carried out to identify the growth of the company as a result of efficient acquisition and assimilation of technology in line with business strategies. Measuring instruments were designed to assess acquisition of technology knowledge in products and processes as well as the growth stage of acquired technologies and its transfer status to Loadstar. In addition, study focused on assessing acquisition of capabilities such as Design Engineering, R&D, Production and Selling and Servicing. Furthermore, balanced scorecard management tool was used to study the behavior of key business parameters such as Turnover growth, Internal growth in product and technologies, Level of customer satisfaction and growth in employment and training. Literature survey shows the analysis of technology based development of a manufacturing company mainly requires proper understanding of technology components. It also indicates that successful acquisition of identified technologies heavily relies on the level of acquiring core capabilities as well as supporting capabilities. Concepts such as "Technology ball" and "Technology based development of a firm" indicate the acquisition of knowledge and level of technology transfer with time respectively. Study revealed that Loadstar has successfully acquired process technology capabilities from its inception and moved on to acquiring R&D capabilities, especially in material development and bias ply pneumatic tire design after 1998. It was also found that Loadstar's capability in <b>Solid</b> <b>tire</b> product development is quite low,' even though it carries the considerable market share compared to pneumatic tires. Further, study revealed that Loadstar lacks Selling and servicing capability which {{is one of the}} core capabilities to add value to the product. Based on analysis and conclusions, it is recommended that Loadstar need to strengthen its R&D in <b>Solid</b> <b>tire</b> products, as well as company should boost its involvement of innovation and development of radical technologies in its all product groups. Further, process technology should be strengthened by improving work facilitation and modification capabilities. In addition, company should focus on acquiring Selling and Servicing capabilities to work closely with customers to add more value to the product...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe first {{small scale}} {{commercial}} tire waste pyrolysis plant has been installed by the Radiant Renewable Energy (RRE) Ltd. at Gazipur, Dhaka for reducing liquid fuel crisis in Bangladesh. The plant has two pyrolysis unit, {{each of them}} consists of a horizontal axis rotary type batch mode reactor with a recycling capacity of 4. 5 tons/run. <b>Solid</b> <b>tire</b> wastes in half/whole size are feed into the reactor chamber, operating at 420 oC with a light over-pressure of 0. 03 bar. The reactor is heated externally by burning product pyrolysis liquids for first three hours and by burning product pyro-gas for rest five hours. The products distribution at optimum reactor operating condition were found oil: 45 wt%, char: 35 wt%, and gases: 10 wt%, {{in addition to the}} steel cords: 10 wt% of <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> waste. The product liquids have been found to have a high gross calorific value (GCV) of around 44 MJ/kg, which would encourage their use as replacements for conventional liquid fuels. Pyrolytic char may be used as a solid fuel, activated carbon, priters ink etc. Pyrolysis gas contains high concentrations of methane, ethane, butadiene and other hydrocarbon gases with a GCV of approximately 37 MJ/m 3, a value sufficient to provide the energy required by the tire pyrolysis process. However, the presented plant should be followed some recommended pionts for better operation and its further extension, and also for our sincere corner to safe environment. The plant can be run only under continuous monitoring and consultancy support of a tire pyrolysis specialist team because of new technology and waste material concern...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of wheelchair mass, solid vs. pneumatic tires and tire pressure on physical strain and wheelchair propulsion technique. 11 Able-bodied participants performed 14 submaximal exercise blocks on a treadmill with a fixed speed (1. 11 m/s) within 3 weeks to determine the effect of tire pressure (100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % of the recommended value), wheelchair mass (0 kg, 5 kg, or 10 kg extra) and tire type (pneumatic vs. solid). All test conditions (except pneumatic vs. solid) were performed with and without instrumented measurement wheels. Outcome measures were power output (PO), physical strain (heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO 2), gross mechanical efficiency (ME)) and propulsion technique (timing, force application). At 25 % tire pressure PO and subsequently VO 2 were higher compared to 100 % tire pressure. Furthermore, a higher tire pressure led to a longer cycle time and contact angle and subsequently lower push frequency. Extra mass did not lead to an increase in PO, physical strain or propulsion technique. Solid tires led to a higher PO and physical strain. The <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> effect was amplified by increased mass (tire x mass interaction). In contrast to extra mass, tire pressure and tire type have an effect on PO, physical strain or propulsion technique of steady-state wheelchair propulsion. As expected, it is important to optimize tire pressure and tire type. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
