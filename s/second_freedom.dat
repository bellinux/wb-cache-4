60|$|The {{first of}} these is the {{principle}} of freedom of speech; the <b>second,</b> <b>freedom</b> of writing; and the third, universality of information. In the civilized State every one must be free to know, knowledge must be patent and at hand, and any one must be free to discuss, write, suggest and persuade. These freedoms must be guarded as sacred things. It is not in the untutored nature of man to respect any of these freedoms; it is not in the bureaucratic habit of mind. Indeed, the desire to suppress opinions adverse to our own is almost instinctive in human nature. It is an instinct we have to conquer. Fair play in discussion is sustained by a cultivated respect, by a correction of natural instinct; men need to be trained to be jealous of obscurantism, of unfair argument, of authoritative interference with opinion when that opinion is against them. In England such a jealousy does already largely exist, it has been cultivated with us since the seventeenth century at least; America, it seemed to me during my short visit to the States, has somewhat retrograded from its former British standard in this respect, there is a crude majority tyranny in the matter of publication, an un-English disposition to boycott libraries, books, authors and publications upon petty issues, a growing disposition to discriminate in the mails against unpopular views. These interferences with open statement and discussion are decivilizing forces.|$|E

50|$|Fifth freedom {{traffic rights}} are sought by {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the <b>second</b> <b>freedom.</b> Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing traffic rights too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth freedom traffic rights stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth freedom traffic rights, while sixth freedom traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|E

Anchorage was still used by some Chinese and Taiwanese airlines for flights to the U.S. and Toronto until the 2000s. Flights between Europe and South Africa often stopped at Ilha do Sal (Sal Island), off the coast of Senegal, due to many African nations refusing to allow South African flights to overfly their territory during the Apartheid regime.

50|$|The {{first freedom}} {{is the right}} to fly over a foreign country without landing. It grants the {{privilege}} to fly over the territory of a treaty country without landing. Member states of the International Air Services Transit Agreement grant this freedom (as well as the <b>second</b> <b>freedom)</b> to other member states, subject to the transiting aircraft using designated air routes. As of the summer of 2007, 129 countries were parties to this treaty, including such large ones as the United States of America, India, and Australia. However, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China never joined, and Canada left the treaty in 1988. These large and strategically located non-IASTA-member states prefer to maintain tighter control over foreign airlines' overflight of their airspace, and negotiate transit agreements with other countries on a case-by-case basis. Since the end of the Cold War, first freedom rights are almost completely universal. Most countries require prior notification before an overflight, and may charge substantial fees for the privilege.|$|E
50|$|In Street Tuner, {{there was}} a solo {{champion}} like in the Grand Sport class. Murillo Racing's Eric Foss and Jeff Mosing competed {{for the majority of}} the season together - with two wins at Daytona and Virginia International Raceway - but Mosing missed the Laguna Seca event due to back spasms. Thus, Foss won the championship by eight points ahead of Team Sahlen driver Wayne Nonnamaker, who did not win a race but finished in second place on four occasions. Mosing finished in third place in the championship, a further three points in arrears. The most wins were taken by Compass360 Racing pairing Ryan Eversley and Kyle Gimple, who won three races during the season - including the last two races - but their other performances were only good enough for ninth in the drivers' championship. Randy Pobst and Andrew Carbonell took back-to-back victories for Freedom Autosport at Sebring and Laguna Seca, while other race victories were taken by Chad Gilsinger and Michael Valiante at Kansas, Canadian duo Remo Ruscitti and Adam Isman on home soil at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Cody Ellsworth and Corey Lewis at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Terry Borcheller and Mike LaMarra at Road America. A <b>second</b> <b>Freedom</b> Autosport car was able to win at Lime Rock, when Tom Long shared a car with Liam Dwyer - a staff sergeant with the United States Marines - who was racing with a prosthesis on his left leg after losing it when he stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan, three years prior.|$|E
5000|$|IASTA allows {{each member}} country to charge foreign {{airlines}} [...] "reasonable" [...] fees for using its airports (which is applicable, presumably, {{only to the}} <b>second</b> <b>freedom)</b> and [...] "facilities"; according to IATA, such fees should not be higher than those charged to domestic airlines engaged in similar international services. Such fees indeed are commonly charged merely {{for the privilege of}} the overflight of a country's national territory, when no airport usage is involved. (Although {{it should be noted that}} overflights might still be using services of a country's Air Traffic Control Centers). For example, the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S., an IASTA signatory, charges the so-called en route fees, of $58.45 (US$60.08 beginning 1 January 2018) per 100 nmi km, of great circle distance from point of entry of an aircraft into the U.S.-controlled airspace to the point of its exit from this airspace. In addition, a lower fee—the oceanic fee—is charged ($23.15 per 100 nmi km; $24.77 beginning 1 January 2018) for flying over the international waters where air traffic is controlled by the U.S., which includes sections of Atlantic & Arctic Oceans and much of the northern Pacific Ocean. Countries that are not signatories of the IASTA charge overflight fees as well; among them, Russia, is known for charging high fees, especially on the transarctic routes between North America and Asia, which cross Siberia. In 2008, Russia temporarily denied Lufthansa Cargo permission to overfly its airspace with cargo ostensibly due to [...] "delayed payments for its flyover rights". European airlines pay Russia €300 million a year for flyover permissions.|$|E

During the New Order authoritarian make press system so {{consequently}} the press is curbed. In contrast, the Reformation reconanced as democratic future, including in terms of press freedom. The purpose of this research are: First, to explain the freedom of the press before the era of the Reformation by Act No. 21 of 1982 on the Principles of the Press and its amendment. Second, to explain the freedom of the press after the Reformation era by Act No. 40 of 1999 on the Press. Third, to explain {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the press before and after the Reformation. From this research, there are three things that concluded. First, freedom of the press before the era of the Reformation by Act No. 21 of 1982 on the Principles of the Press and amendments if traced the articles are shackles for the life of the press, the press is required to issue a license issue this license that can be used to control the editorial contents and banning. <b>Second,</b> <b>freedom</b> of the press after the Reformation era by Act No. 40 of 1999 concerning the Press is to guarantee freedom of the press, because there is no silencing and banning. Third, before the Reformation era Indonesian press called Pancasila press with a free and responsible goals. However, there is no freedom, so no complaints as a result of the deviation of the freedom of the press. However, due to the strict control of the Government of the press lost their identity to carry out its functions independently. Freedom of the press after the Reformation era is done on a national responsibility without limitation license renewal. Disadvantages of the press after the Reformation era is freedom takes precedence over its responsibilities while the excess press after a press Reformation era became an independent institution. Suggestions writer, first to guarantee press freedom ideally built on a foundation of community interest media managers, and the interests of the target service. Secondly, with regard to the interests of community framework is advisable actualization national press freedom, not only will meet the interests unilaterally, either interest manager (source), and the top of the fulfillment of the target interest (public media). The press must be responsive to public situations, because the powerlessness of the public to appreciate his opinion to press leaders should act as a facilitator to be able to appreciate what is desired. Third, freedom of the press after the Reformation era should be retained but remained on its responsibilities so as not to be excessive...|$|E
40|$|On 2 September 1958 at the Barn at Liopetri EOKA fought one of {{its most}} epic battles. The humble barn was dubbed “A New Inn at Gravid”. Regarding the four heroes of the battle, Andreas Karyos, Elias Papakyriakou, Photis Pittas and Chrislos Samaras, EOKA loader Dhigenis wrote in his Memoirs: “It is very {{difficult}} for me lo distin­guish among these four brave young men and say who was the bravest of the brave. At the moment they all competed to see who was to die the bravest”. The facts related to the bailie of the Barn and the heroic deaths of the four young men are as follows: On the night of 30 August the four freedom fighters went to Liopetri to train the local EOKA members in ambush-related issues. At 2. 00 a. m. on 1 st September military vehicles appeared near the village. The fighters made an attempt to leave the village but were unable to do so {{because of the presence of}} soldiers. They then decided to drive through the vice in which they were hold. In the attempt they exchanged fire with British soldiers but were forced to return to Liopetri. At about 3, 00 a. m. they took refuge in the barn belonging to Panayiotis Kallis. There followed a curfew and interrogations of all the inhabitants who until 3 : 00 a. m. were held behind barbed wire. The barn was searched but without result. At 1. 00 a. m. on 2 nd September the British returned following information received, surrounded the barn and demanded from the owner to be told where the four fighters were hiding. The owner and his family gave no information despite the torture to which they were subjected. The British called on the fighters to surrender but received no reply. Using the owner for cover, they then fired inside the barn, but once again they received no reply. Using the owner for cover, they then fired inside the barn, but once again they received no reply. On the morning of 2 nd September another curfew was imposed and the barn owner was once again subjected to torture. The four men fired on a posse of soldiers drawing near the barn. The British then asked for reinforcements that were not long in arriving. The shooting continued and the fighters were called upon to surrender. A small interruption followed followed and the shooting resumed with even greater intensity. Several soldiers were wounded. The British threw bombs and hand grenades but to no avail. One of the fighters ran out of the barn shouting but was gunned down by a British soldier. The remaining fighters continued lo shoot injuring a soldier and a captain. In a new exchange of fire a <b>second</b> <b>freedom</b> fighter was killed. A group of soldiers climbed on to the roof of the barn, where the opened a hole and threw down petrol-soaked rags. The rags caught fire but this soon went out. While the battle continued with automatic weapons and hand grenades, an English helicopter dropped firebombs and the barn was immediately set alight. The two fighters immediately ran out only to be gunned down by the soldiers. The heroic deaths of the four EOKA fighters touched the entire Cypriot people and caused world-wide admiration. Immediately after Cyprus became independent, the place of their sacrifice, in which statues were set up honouring the four men, became a shrine of national pilgrimage. The barn and the courtyard surrounding it are now a Monument to the magnificence of their heroism and self-sacrifice. Born in the village of Avgorou, Famagusta District, on 16 July 1926. After graduating from the village primary school, he later studied theology, accounting, English and Greek literature. He was an officer of PEK and a founder member of SEK, PEON and the religious association of his village. In January 1955 he joined Gregoris Afxentiou. He organised and headed the EOKA struggle in Avgorou. On 1 st April 1955 he took part in the operation to cut the electric wires near Avgorou and received severe burns. He was arrested several times for his action and after his team's attack on Achna police station, he was placed on the wanted list. He was arrested in November 1956 and incarcerated at Pyla Detention Centre, from where he escaped on 12 March 1958. He continued his action as deputy sector commander m the Kokkinochoria area. He was known for his faith in God and his country. The following words are an indication of the purity of his patriotism: "I love our island of Cyprus, with its ancient civilisation, my heart beats for it and at its altar I will lay down my life itself, if I have to". It is worth mentioning that Andreas's brother, George Karyos, also died fighting the British in a battle on 28 October 1958. Their mother, Flourentza bade farewell to her second child in an improvised couplet: "In forty days two sons for Cyprus did I give To see my country free I only hope to live". Born in the village of Lythrangomi, Famagusta District, on 25 January 1938. After graduating from the village primary school he attended Famagusta Gymnasium. While still a fifth form schoolboy he joined EOKA and acted as a member of the strike forces, participating in bombing attacks. He was on the wanted list before leaving high school. In March 1957 he took charge of the sub-sector of Assia and the surrounding villages where he was extremely active. One of his actions was to seize French automatic guns from men of the French detachment that had intervened at Suez. When in the summer of 1958 the Turks organised systematic attacks on Greek property, he set up civil militia groups among the Greek-Cypriots in the local villages and put an end to the raids. On 13 July 1958 on his personal instructions, the fighters of Assia blew up the water pump, the buildings and water reservoirs, which were used to provide water to the British troops billeted at Vatyli police station. On 31 July 1958 he was intercepted by a British patrol and was wounded in the leg. Despite his injuries he managed to escape. His action continued until 2,September 1958, when he died in a heroic attempt to exit from the Barn at Liopetri. Born in the village of Frenaros on 28 February 1935. He graduated from the village primary school, Famagusta Gymnasium and Morphou Teachers' College. While at college he joined EOKA. He served as teacher at Achna primary school and was active in the fields of organisation, combat and information. The British put him on the wanted list on 18 October 1956. As a wanted man he contributed greatly to the EOKA struggle in the villages of Lysi, Vatyli and Assia. He was arrested on 10 January 1957 and tortured mercilessly in Famagusta prison. With blood spat out as a result of the torture he painted the image of liberty on his cell wall. An eloquent record of his suffering can be found in his personal journal in which he wrote down his experiences. He was locked up at Kokkinotrimithia Detention Centre and later at Pyla from where he escaped with other freedom fighters on 12 March 1958. He continued his action as sub-sector commander in the Lysi area. He was involved in widespread and effective action. This greatly perturbed the British who imposed a two-week curfew and carried out intensive searches, but to no avail. On 2 September 1958 he fell in action fighting for a free Cyprus in the glorious battle of the Barn at Liopetri. Born in Liopetri village on 12 February 1925. He attended primary school up to the fourth form. His love for learning, religion and patriotism led him to learn a great deal from reading religious books and Greek History. He was a chanter at the village church. He was the founder of the Liopetri branch of OXEN (YMCA) and guided religious developments in the surrounding villages. In 1954 he joined a secret organisation, which was planning an armed uprising against colonial rule. In January 1955 he joined up with Gregoris Afxentiou. He worked to recruit EOKA members. In early March 1955 the first members of EOKA Liopetri took the oath of allegiance at his house. On 1 st April he took part in the attack at Dhekelia headed by Afxentiou. On that very day he was placed on the wanted list and until his death there was a reward of 5000 pounds on his head. Throughout this period he developed action in the villages of Liopetri, Limnia, Ayios Sergios, Avgorou, Ormidia, Peristeronopigi, Gaidouras, Pyrga and Prastio. He fell at Liopetri Barn fighting for the ideals in which he believed from his earliest youth. 1) The Liopetri Barn immediately after the historic battle of 2 September 1958 Above: A view from the front Below: A view from the back The bodies of the heroes are in circles 2) The body of Andreas Karyos riddled with holes from bullets and bayonets 3) The body of Elias Papakyriakou riddled with holes from bullets and bayonets 4) The body of Photis Pittas riddled with bullets after his dramatic exit from the barn 5) Christos Samaras died with a smile on his lips. 6) The historic barn and part of the front courtyard as they are today 7) The bush of the four fighters in the interior of the barn 8) The restoration of the Barn and the surrounding courtyard into a single Monunent was done at the initiative of the “Council of Historic Memory of the ΕΟΚA Struggle 1955 - 1959 ” in co-operation with the community of Liopetri.
