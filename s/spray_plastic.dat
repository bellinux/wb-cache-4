40|$|AbstractEnvironmental {{issues are}} {{becoming}} increasingly important in the domestic, business and public sectors. Due to population growth and growing number of megacities, Green Public Procurements concepts is also becoming an increasing trend in the road infrastructure sector. This study assessed {{the environmental impacts of}} road markings considering the whole life cycle from manufacturing to disposal. For the correctness of the study, an external expert panel reviewed the assessment. By using the LCA-Methodology based on DIN ISO 14040 and 14044, an objective comparison of the following line markings was performed: Solvent-borne paint; Water-based paint; Thermoplastic and Thermo Spray Plastic; Cold Plastic and Cold <b>Spray</b> <b>Plastic.</b> Typical material formulations in characteristic application scenarios have been modelled using the data of corresponding official approval test certificates held by a major local manufacturer of all evaluated technologies. Empirical data was used to determine a typical service life of the various road marking systems at a typical average daily traffic of 10, 000 – 15, 000 vehicles per day. The life cycle assessment results, i. e. considering the whole life cycle from manufacturing to disposal, showed that a global warming potential reduction of more than 50 % can be achieved by a more durable road marking system. The study concluded that in order to access the actual environmental impact of road markings, a lifetime evaluation including, for instance, production, application, transport, service life, and disposal must be taken into consideration...|$|E

This research was conducted in December until February 2010 and held at the experimental garden of the Faculty of Agriculture University Muhammadiyah of Malang, with an altitude ± 550 meters from sea level with a total rainfall 1. 388 mm. The tools used in this study is an analytical balance, oven, mixer, stationery, paper millimeters, measuring cups, hand <b>spray,</b> <b>plastic</b> bucket, and shove camera. Materials used in this study was 6 months old growth damar extracted from the seed production area of RPH Kedungrejo BKPH Pujon, plant growth regulators (IAA, IBA GA 3, Atonik) and distilled water. This research was conducted using a randimized block design (RAK) factorial, consisting of two factors with three replications. Factors I is a kind of plant growth regulators (Z), consisting of 4 levels, namely : Z 1 (IAA 0, 3 mg/l), Z 2 (IBA 0, 2 mg/l), Z 3 (GA 3 0, 4 mg/l), and Z 4 (Atonik 0, 2 mg/l). The second factor is the frequency of (F), consisting of 3 levels, namely : F 1 (the frequency of 1 time), F 2 (frequency of 2 time/) and F 3 (frequency of 3 time). Variables observed high increase of seedling, stem diameter, leaf number, length of root, root number, fresh weight and dry weight. From the observation results showed that of growth regulators GA 3 0, 4 mg/l and the frequency of 2 time (Z 3 F 2) gave the best results compared with other treatments for all variable including the addition of observation height, stem diameter, leaf number, length root, root number, fresh weight and seedling dry weight resin...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{subtraction}} and normalization of IR spectra (MSN-IR) {{was developed and}} successfully applied to extract mathematically the pure paint spectrum from the spectrum of paint coat on different bases, both acquired by the Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) technique.

The utility and performance of the method proposed were tested by examination of five different paints <b>sprayed</b> on <b>plastic</b> (polyester) foil and on fabric materials (cotton). It was found that the numerical algorithm applied is able – in contrast to other mathematical approaches conventionally used for the same aim – to reconstruct a pure paint IR spectrum effectively without a loss of chemical information provided. The approach allows the physical separation of a paint from a base to be avoided, hence a time and work-load of analysis to be considerably reduced.

Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are <b>sprayed</b> into <b>plastic</b> bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick cooking spray or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister. Once these solvents or gases are inhaled, the extensive capillary surface of the lungs rapidly absorb the solvent or gas, and blood levels peak rapidly. The intoxication effects occur so quickly {{that the effects of}} inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs. Some harm reduction experts encourage glue sniffers to use paper bags rather than thin plastic bags, because plastic bags greatly increase the risk of suffocation, as plastic bags are more likely to stick to the users' nose and mouth while she or he is intoxicated.|$|R

All lettuce samples from spray beds were positive for E. coli, however, no statistical difference (p > 0. 05) was detected between lettuces grown in open spray or covered spray beds. The results from the field experiment were also compared to a laboratory experiment which used submersion of lettuce in wastewater of known E. coli concentration as a surrogate method to assess contamination following irrigation. The microbial quality of spray bed lettuces was {{not significantly different from}} submersed lettuce when irrigated with wastewater containing 1, 299. 7 E. coli MPN/ 100 mL (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Current {{treatment}} regimens for inhalation injury {{are mainly}} supportive {{and rely on}} self-regeneration processes for recovery. Cell therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is increasingly being investigated {{for the treatment of}} inhalation injury. Human amniotic MSCs (hAMSCs) were used in this study due to their potential use in inflammatory and fibrotic conditions of the lung. This study aimed at demonstrating that hAMSCs can be atomized with high viability, for the purpose of achieving a more uniform distribution of cells throughout the lung. Another aim {{of this study was to}} set ground for future application to healthy and diseased lungs by demonstrating that hAMSCs were able to survive after being sprayed onto substrates with different stiffness. Methods: Two methods of atomization were evaluated, and the LMA MAD 780 device was selected for atomizing hAMSCs for optimized delivery. To mimic the stiffness of healthy and diseased lungs, gelatin gel (10 % w/v) and tissue culture plastic were used as preliminary models. Poly-l-lysine (PLL) and collagen I coatings were used as substrates on which the hAMSCs were cultured after being sprayed. Results: The feasibility of atomizing hAMSCs was demonstrated with high cell viability (81 +/- 3. 1 % and 79 +/- 11. 6 % for cells <b>sprayed</b> onto <b>plastic</b> and gelatin, respectively, compared with 85 +/- 4. 8 % for control/non-sprayed cells) that was unaffected by the different stiffness of substrates. The presence of the collagen I coating on which the sprayed cells were cultured yielded higher cell proliferation compared with both PLL and no coating. The morphology of sprayed cells was minimally compromised in the presence of the collagen I coating. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that hAMSCs are able to survive after being sprayed onto substrates with different stiffness, especially in the presence of collagen I. Further studies may advance the effectiveness of cell therapy for lung regeneration...|$|R

The bottom of the bowl contained a piece of filter paper and approximately 3  cm of water to keep the bullfrog hydrated. We applied about 4  ml of each treatment solution by spraying onto the entire dorsal surface of each bullfrog using a hand-held <b>plastic</b> <b>spray</b> bottle.
