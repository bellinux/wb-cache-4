50|$|Climbing skins are strips that {{attach to}} the bottom of nordic, alpine touring or randonnée skis to help while {{ascending}} backcountry slopes. They are designed to be removed for skiing downhill. They are typically attached to the skis via a loop on the <b>ski</b> <b>tip,</b> a hook on the tail, and adhesive on the base of the skin. They are called skins because they resemble sealskin, from which the first ski skins were made. They are typically made from nylon or mohair or a combination thereof, and are designed to let the ski slide forward on snow but not backward. They are usually narrower than the ski to allow the ski edges to get a grip. Some ski resorts permit skinning.|$|E
50|$|His next design used a C-shaped {{piece that}} fit over {{the toe of}} the boot, {{eliminating}} the plate. The toe of a contemporary ski boot is essentially hemispherical, so the single clip kept the boot centred and, by riding {{over the top of}} it, pressed down onto the ski. Under a pure sideways release scenario, the clip would rotate to allow the boot to exit. However, if the force was also to the front, {{as in the case of}} the <b>ski</b> <b>tip</b> catching a tree root or front of a mogul, the pivot would be too close to the line of motion to allow easy rotation. To address this, the entire body of the binding was also pivoted. In this sort of release scenario, the binding as a whole would rotate, and eventually the force would be far enough to the side that the clip would be forced sideways.|$|E
5000|$|During the warm-up for the 1.4 {{kilometre}} classic sprint on 17 February in the 2010 Olympics she skied off-course, down a bank, into a 3 m (10 ft) deep gully {{where she}} crashed on rocks breaking both ski poles, a <b>ski</b> <b>tip,</b> and sustained four broken ribs {{along with a}} pneumothorax. The start time for her qualifying round was pushed back, but she collapsed in pain after qualifying and was taken to hospital to be x-rayed. The x-rays failed to show the rib fractures. Thus, {{she returned to the}} course and, despite the agonizing pain, won her quarterfinal and just got through the semifinal as a lucky loser. During the semifinal, one of the broken ribs pierced her lung, collapsing it. Despite this and the excruciating pain, she finished third to win the bronze medal in the final, the first individual Winter Olympic medal for Slovenia in 16 years. She earned the highest praise from other skiers, staff and the media for her amazing bravery as she attended the medal giving ceremony with a tube in her chest to relieve pneumothorax. She said at the press conference afterward [...] "Today, this is not a bronze. This is a gold with little diamonds on it".|$|E
50|$|In {{the tail}} pivot, e.g., to the left, little turning steps are {{done to the}} left while keeping the tails of the skis {{together}} in place. Repeat the following two steps until the required amount of turn is reached: step {{the front of the}} left ski to the left with its tail in place, bring the right ski to the left <b>ski.</b> The <b>tip</b> pivot is similar, done while keeping the <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> in place while moving the tails.|$|R
5000|$|The V-style, {{sometimes}} called the Graf-Boklöv technique, remains the sport's most recent significant technique change, with the <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> spread outwards in a highly aerodynamic [...] "V" [...] shape. It became the predominant jumping technique following the Däscher/parallel style, which was last used in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Colorado, Wegeman {{was on the}} {{national}} championships ski team at the University of Denver. After college he became a ski instructor for the US Army Mountain and Cold Weather Training Company. In the early 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles, California, and hosted the television series <b>Ski</b> <b>Tips.</b> At the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, {{he served as a}} technical advisor.|$|R
50|$|He {{presented}} <b>Ski</b> <b>Tips</b> (ITV), a <b>skiing</b> magazine programme {{produced and}} directed by Stuart Nimmo, for several years before Steggall produced the last series. He fronted the series Conquer the Arctic (TWI/Channel 4). He was the reporter on a Channel 4 documentary about Shane Warne. He produced UcanDOit, a series of films about grassroots sport for Sky. He has also produced several programmes about golf for Sky {{and is working on}} a documentary {{about the history of the}} Professional Footballers' Association.|$|R
50|$|The {{snowplough}} turn, {{also known}} as a wedge turn or the pizza slice, is a downhill skiing braking and turning technique taught to beginners. The front <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> of the <b>skis</b> are together and the tails wide apart, with the knees rolled inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of the skis speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible. To turn, weight is shifted from the downhill, outside-of-the-turn ski to the uphill, inside-of-the-turn ski. As the turn is completed, the old uphill, inside ski then becomes the new downhill, outside ski.|$|R
50|$|Water skiing {{was invented}} in 1922 when Ralph Samuelson used a pair of boards as skis and a clothesline as a towrope on Lake Pepin in Lake City, Minnesota. Samuelson experimented with {{different}} positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> up and poking {{out of the water}} at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of 20 mph. Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Steve Collins used a {{modified}} {{variation of the}} V-style, or [...] "delta style", with the <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> held together in front instead of at the rear. Collins was the youngest winner of a World Cup event {{at the age of}} fifteen, but his technique never caught on. During this era, any technique aside from the parallel style was considered inappropriate by FIS judges. Although it enabled much longer jumps - up to ten per cent more than the parallel style - judges made it an issue to award poor marks to those who used it.|$|R
50|$|Early {{photographic}} evidence, of {{a purpose}} built twin <b>tip</b> <b>ski,</b> is discernible in director Arnold Fanck’s 1931 film Der weisse Rausch (The White Ecstasy). In a comedic scene, while wearing twin <b>tip</b> <b>skis,</b> actor Walter Riml plays a novice skier inadvertently performing {{a series of}} 360s on snow, all the while reading a book on how to ski.|$|R
5000|$|The Invader showcased a {{new concept}} that {{inspired}} {{a new way of}} riding {{in and out of the}} park. The Invader's progressive [...] "Butter Zone" [...] construction featured a thinner ski in front and behind the boot that allowed the rider to lean forwards or backwards to playfully [...] "butter" [...] around in most any condition. Buttering is the act of spinning around on ones tips or tails, picture butter being spread on toast. The <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> or tails act as a slippery pivot point. Buttering opened up a new world of technical tricks. People began buttering off of jumps and onto rails and even using the technique to continue tricks after they landed them, a similar concept of reverting on a skateboard.|$|R
5000|$|Kidd {{moved to}} Steamboat Springs, Colorado, in 1970, {{and ever since}} has been {{strongly}} identified with the Steamboat Ski & Resort Corporation, where he serves as its Director of Skiing. 2014 will mark his 44th year on the job at Steamboat Ski Resort. As ambassador not just for Steamboat, but for the American West and the sport of skiing, Kidd is instantly recognizable by his Stetson cowboy hat. During ski season, skiers and snowboarders can join Kidd for a daily free, on-mountain clinic (when he is in town) at 1 PM {{at the top of}} the Steamboat gondola. When you [...] "ski with Billy Kidd" [...] down the Heavenly Daze intermediate run, you'll get <b>ski</b> <b>tips,</b> and learn about what it's like to ski in the Olympics.|$|R
50|$|While <b>ski</b> pole <b>tips</b> are {{generally}} not made of carbide, since {{they do not need}} to be especially hard even to break through layers of ice, rollerski tips usually are. Roller skiing emulates cross country skiing and is used by many skiers to train during warm weather months.|$|R
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the <b>ski</b> <b>tips</b> too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|R
5000|$|Equipment for the Downhill is {{different}} from the alpine events that are lower-speed. Skis are 30% longer than those used in slalom, for more stability at high speed. They usually have rounded, low-profile tips rather than pointed <b>tips.</b> <b>Ski</b> poles are bent so as to curve around the body as the racer stays in a [...] "tuck position" [...] and may have aerodynamic, cone-shaped baskets. As in other alpine disciplines, Downhill racers wear skin-tight suits to minimize drag, and helmets are mandatory.|$|R
5000|$|The first mass {{produced}} twin-tip ski (modest {{rise in the}} tail) was the Olin Mark IV Comp {{introduced in}} 1974. The first company to successfully market a twin-tip ski to ski switch and [...] "Air Carve" [...] was the Salomon Group, with their 1080 ski in 1998. LINE skis [...] also evolved from twin <b>tip</b> <b>ski</b> boards and inspired the newschool freeskiing movement and ultimately helped give rise to independent ski companies Armada, 4FRNT, and Ninthward, all of which specialized {{in the design of}} twin-tip skis.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the <b>ski.</b> A <b>tipping</b> point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|R
40|$|I am a great {{devotee of}} cross country skiing, so tuning in on these events during the Winter Olympics {{is one of}} my {{favorite}} pastimes. In the 2010 Olympics, the final of the women’s 30 K Classic Race was a real cliff hanger and a joy to behold. It had been forecast (and this certainly is a forecast in the sense that it would be readily verifiable on a short timescale) that the battle for the Gold would be between one of the Norwegian and one of the Polish competitors. This turned out to be a very accurate forecast. They were neck-and-neck (or <b>ski</b> tip-to-ski <b>tip)</b> for the last 200 m, with the lead switching back and forth by centimeters. In the end the Polish contestant inched (or “centimetered”) out the Norwegian, and it was declared a photo finish. This event brought to mind some of the issues surrounding the topic of uncertainty and how people cope with it in relation to decision making. One of the interesting things about uncertainty is its absolute necessity for the entertainment value of competitive sporting events. If the outcomes were not uncertain, there would be no competitive sporting events. The uncertainty provides the drama that makes events so compelling. This is well understood. However, th...|$|R
50|$|Jon Olsson is a {{professional}} freeskier and alpine ski racer, born in Mora, Sweden (17 August 1982). Olsson started {{his career as a}} ski racer but at age 16 he switched his race <b>skis</b> for twin <b>tips</b> and quit <b>ski</b> racing. Eight years later, after a 50 000 SEK (5826.22 USD) bet with fellow skier Jens Byggmark, Olsson started ski racing again with the goal of the bets being {{to make it to the}} Olympics in 2014. He now competes in both freestyle and ski racing. Olsson is known for his invention of several new double flips, including a D-spin 720 into a flatspin 540 (DJ flip), a switch double rodeo 1080 (hexo flip), a double flatspin 900 (kangaroo flip), and a switch cork 720 to flatspin 540 (the tornado).|$|R
5000|$|In 1975 the {{torsion box}} ski {{construction}} design is patented. The patent is referenced by Kästle, Salomon, Rottefella, and Madshus. In 1993 Elan introduced the Elan SCX. Skis {{with a much}} wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn. Cross-country techniques use different styles of turns; edging is not as important, and skis have little sidecut. For many years, alpine skis were shaped similarly to cross-country, simply shorter and wider, but the Elan SCX introduced a radial sidecut design that dramatically improved performance. Other companies quickly followed suit, and it was realized in retrospect that [...] ""It turns out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong," [...] admitted one Austrian ski designer." [...] Line Skis the first free-ski focused ski company inspired the newschool freeskiing movement with their twin <b>tip</b> <b>ski</b> boards in 1995. The first company to successfully market and mass-produce a Twin-tip ski to ski switch (skiing backwards) was the Salomon Group, with their 1080 ski in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Many ski vendors allow {{selection}} of skis by turning radius. For a racing slalom ski, {{this can be}} as low as 12 metres and for Super-G it is normally 33 metres.Sidecut {{is the extent to}} which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arcing, hourglass-like curve that runs along a <b>ski’s</b> edges from <b>tip</b> to tail. This curve dictates how skis turn: the deeper the curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with less sidecut have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The sidecut radius is the radial measurement of the curve that matches the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, or skiboard. For instance, with a radial sidecut, a circle with a particular radius will perfectly fit the curvature of the sidecut. This particular radius is the given specification from the manufacturer. However, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. Mathematical functions, such as a parabola or a clothoid, are often used to describe the curvature of a sidecut. Also, multiple radii are stitched together in a piecewise fashion as well.|$|R
50|$|Eric Pollard {{was happy}} with the {{creation}} of The 130 and it became his implicit pro model. Not until 2007 did Pollard get a ski named after him. The EP Pro is a cornucopia of innovative features. First, they have Early Rise. Early Rise is describing the way the camber of the ski is reversed near the tip and tail. The skis have conventional upturned tips, but they are made higher off the snow by the actual flex of the ski being turned up gradually as it goes from binding to <b>tip.</b> This makes <b>skiing</b> forwards and backwards in deeper snow much easier to control. Another aspect of the EP Pro that helps the skiers control in the powder is the Early Taper. Traditional ski designs make the widest part of the <b>ski</b> at the <b>tip,</b> making it {{the last part of the}} ski to touch the snow before it upturns to the tip. Early Taper brings the fattest part of the ski back toward the boot and away from the tip. This gives more control and quick response from the ski in the deep powder, making turns more creative and free, rather than relying on the harsh curve of the side-cut to whip you into a turn.|$|R
