5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which <b>suddenly</b> <b>his</b> head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, {{collapsed}} in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July, the {{squadron}} {{moved to a}} satellite airfield at Rochford in the county of Essex. The following day, he became operational. The Battle of Britain was slowly escalating and air fighting increased {{with a series of}} German air attacks against British shipping in the English Channel, a phase of the battle termed Kanalkampf by the Luftwaffe. Finucane's first scramble came on 25 July 1940. Flying Spitfire N3128 code YT-W, he took off at 08:45. The Spitfire was worn, having served in combat since April. It developed a glycol leak whilst climbing and the cockpit filled with escaping vapour from the cooling liquid condensing on the hot engine. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>his</b> radio transmission failed. Still, he managed a wheels-up landing at Rochford. 65 Squadron was in action again at 12:20 and engaged enemy aircraft but suffered no losses.|$|E
25|$|McDonald's {{first-class}} career ended fairly <b>suddenly.</b> <b>His</b> form {{dipped in}} 1930, though he still {{took more than}} 100 wickets, but in 1931, he lost form almost entirely, taking just 26 wickets all season and being {{left out of the}} county team for half the matches. At the end of the season, {{he went back to the}} Lancashire League with Bacup.|$|E

25|$|Two events marred Bunyan's {{life during}} the later 1670s. Firstly he became {{embroiled in a}} scandal {{concerning}} a young woman called Agnes Beaumont. When going to preach in Gamlingay in 1674 he allowed Beaumont, {{a member of the}} Bedford Meeting, to ride pillion on his horse, much to the anger of her father, who then died <b>suddenly.</b> <b>His</b> daughter was initially suspected of poisoning him, though the coroner found he had died of natural causes. And then in 1676-7 he underwent a second term of imprisonment, probably for refusing to attend the parish church. This second imprisonment lasted six months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>his</b> servant, Sancho Panza, climbs hurriedly {{through the}} window. In pursuit are several angry {{women from the}} market from whom he has stolen bread and a chicken. Awakened by the commotion, Don Quixote sends the women away. Don Quixote tells Sancho that he is {{determined}} to seek adventures as a knight-errant, all the while searching for his beloved Dulcinea. He shows him the pasteboard helmet, which, with one sweep from his sword, becomes a shapeless mass on the floor. Antonina suggests that he should use a shaving basin instead, which would make a splendid helmet. Don Quixote enthusiastically agrees and, placing it on his head, orders Sancho to bring him his armour, sword and spear, and to make ready his horse, Rocinante.|$|E

2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years. It was sad {{as it was the}} first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then <b>suddenly,</b> <b>his</b> health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of my trip. Very annoying." ...|$|E
