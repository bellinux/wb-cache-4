500|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent bank bailouts, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Capuano berated the bank CEOs for their practices, saying at one point: [...] "You {{come to us}} today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa and telling us, 'We're <b>sorry,</b> <b>we</b> didn't mean it, we won't do it again, trust us.' Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks {{and they say the}} same thing." [...] Capuano's speech was included in the 2010 documentary film Inside Job, described by director Charles H. Ferguson as being about [...] "the systemic corruption of the United States by the financial services industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's {{performance}} {{was greeted with}} applause from both sets of supporters as Phil Thompson led his team up to the Royal Box to receive the Charity Shield. Paisley was delighted with the manner of his team's win and quipped, [...] "I am just <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> didn't get two points for it!" [...] He praised the Wembley surface and said of McDermott's first goal [...] " [...] captured what {{we are looking for}} – the run, the control and the finish were perfect." [...] Arsenal manager Terry Neill described the match as a [...] "great advertisement for football" [...] and felt his side contributed greatly in periods. Of his opponents, he said: [...] "Liverpool are a smashing side and I don't expect to meet anyone better this season." [...] Indeed, Liverpool went on to retain the First Division title, withstanding pressure from Manchester United and ending their league campaign on 60 points. Arsenal finished three places behind in fourth, and reached the finals of the FA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, only to end the season empty-handed.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{featuring}} the alien rebels incinerating {{a group of}} Russian alien abductees was filmed without actual Russian cars. Picture car coordination Nigel Habgood noted, [...] "I couldn't get real Russian cars, so I decided to get creative and go seriously European. We burned a couple Saabs, and a BMW 2002. I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> couldn't get any Yugos." [...] For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees, the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies. Carter later noted that it's [...] "harder than it looks to create a charred, dead body." [...] The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch: construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full-scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to ease up the shots. The tagline for this episode is [...] "Resist or Serve". The tagline was later used for The X-Files game, [...] {{as well as the}} official book covering the fifth season of the show. The list of victims viewed by Scully in her hospital room was made up of X-Files staffers.|$|E

2500|$|As a four-year-old, Holy Bull won the Olympic Handicap easily but {{was pulled}} {{up during the}} Donn Handicap. Subsequent {{examinations}} showed a bowed tendon but no permanent injury. [...] "If he wasn't Holy Bull, I'd {{bring him back to}} the races next year", said Croll. [...] "I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> couldn't finish the year with him. He would have gone out in a blaze of glory. He has courage and class. I'm going to miss him. Everybody's going to miss him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, The Walrus was {{required}} to shut down its unpaid internship programme after the Ontario Ministry of Labour declared that its longstanding practice of not paying interns was in contravention of the Employment Standards Act. The magazine issued a statement justifying its practice of using unpaid labour, saying [...] "We have been training future leaders in media and development for ten years, and we are extremely <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> are {{no longer able to}} provide these opportunities, which have assisted many young Ontarians—and Canadians—in bridging the gap from university to paid work and in, many cases, on to stellar careers." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a press conference, Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard of the VPD {{apologized to}} the victims' families, saying [...] "I wish {{from the bottom of}} my heart that we would have caught him sooner. I wish that, the several {{agencies}} involved, that we could have done better in so many ways. I wish that all the mistakes that were made, we could undo. And I wish that more lives would have been saved. So on my behalf and behalf of the Vancouver Police Department and all the men and women that worked on this investigation, I would say to the families how <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> all are for your losses and because we did not catch this monster sooner." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johnston's father Graham {{once again}} issued a new plea to the kidnappers to free his son. In an open letter, the senior Johnston {{addressed}} his son's kidnappers, {{telling them to}} [...] "please think about what this is doing to my family." [...] Again, he asked the kidnappers to [...] "please let my son go now, today." [...] Addressing his son, {{he said that the}} family [...] "wanted you to know how distressed and <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> all are that you were taken," [...] adding that despite warnings from his son that being kidnapped was a possibility, [...] "when it came, it was still a considerable shock." [...] He ended the open letter by saying that [...] "all our heartfelt warmest fondest love is sent to you from all your family and in the fervent hope that you will be released unharmed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chambers' {{attorney}} {{claimed that}} Chambers was used [...] "as a pawn {{in a struggle}} over control and adult businesses." [...] Chambers' arrest came {{three days before the}} Board of Supervisors were to vote on a proposed ordinance to eliminate police permits for adult bookstores and theaters. In the wake of her arrest, the Board stripped police of their power to license the city's adult theaters. [...] "The O'Farrell was packed the day after we were arrested," [...] Chambers said later. [...] "And they put the mayor's phone number up on the marquee -- 'Call Mayor Dianne Feinstein'...I'm in jail with my fur coat and nothing else on, and [...] want to take pictures. I took a mug shot with every cop in the place, and they're going, 'I'm really <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> had to do this.' And the next night they were all back enjoying the show".|$|E
2500|$|Steely Dan's lyrical {{subjects}} are diverse, {{but in their}} basic approach they often create fictional personae that participate in a narrative or situation. The duo have said that in retrospect, most of their albums have a 'feel' of either Los Angeles or New York City, the two main cities where Becker and Fagen lived and worked. Characters appear in their songs that evoke these cities. Steely Dan's lyrics are often puzzling to the listener, with {{the true meaning of}} the song [...] "uncoded" [...] through repeated listening, and a richer understanding of the references within the lyrics. For example, in the song [...] "Everyone's Gone to the Movies," [...] the line [...] "I know you're used to 16 or more, <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> only have eight" [...] refers not to the count of some article, but to eight-millimeter film, which was lower quality than 16mm or larger formats, underscoring the illicitness of Mr. Lapage's movie parties.|$|E

2500|$|According to Mr. Bungle themselves, Kiedis {{had never}} met or spoken to anyone {{involved}} with the band aside from Mike Patton. Patton stated to The A.V. Club, [...] "Our agent {{was in the process}} of booking these festivals, and it was becoming apparent that we'd landed some pretty good ones—one in France, another one in Holland, some big-name festivals. Turns out someone's holding a grudge! We were booted off several bills, specifically because Anthony Kiedis did not want us on the bill. He threatened to pull the Chili Peppers if Mr. Bungle was on the bill." [...] In a separate interview, he also clarified that [...] "the rest of the band doesn't care. It's something to do with Anthony." [...] Mr. Bungle's guitarist Trey Spruance added, [...] "We were booked, months in advance, to do eleven festival dates in Europe. Come Summer, we get a call from the three biggest of those festivals, all of them the same day, saying that we can't play, because the headlining band retains the right to hire and fire whomever they wish. We found out it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so our manager called their manager to find out what the hell was going on, and their manager was very apologetic, and said, 'We're really <b>sorry,</b> <b>we</b> want you to know this doesn't reflect the management's position, or the band's for that matter, it's Anthony Kiedis who wants this.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1921 George Mallory and Guy Bullock {{had reached}} an unnamed col between Pumori and Lingtren and Mallory {{reported}} on {{looking down on}} the Western Cwm [...] "However, we have seen this Western Glacier and are not <b>sorry</b> <b>we</b> have not to go up it. It is terribly steep and broken." [...] Shipton and Bryant reached the same point on 9 August 1935 but, despite waiting several hours, mist prevented any view of the Cwm. They again reached the col on 11 August and on this occasion the mist cleared after many hours {{and they were able to}} get the first photograph of the Khumbu Icefall leading up to the Western Cwm. Bryant wrote [...] "A westerly spur of Nuptse curled round to the north thus squeezing the glacier of the upper basin into a narrow lip over which it poured in a gigantic ice-fall, a wild tumble of contorted ice, to the Khumbu Glacier 2,000 feet below. The cwm itself must be an amazing place, completely ringed in as it is, except for that narrow entrance, by a mountain wall nowhere less than 25,000 feet high." [...] Shipton reported how the Sherpas became quite excited as they recognised landmarks in their homeland, the Solu Khumbu. He said of the route up the icefall and cwm [...] "it did not look impossible, and I should very much like to have the opportunity one day of exploring it".|$|E
2500|$|Singer Mike Patton {{was known}} {{to have had a}} bad {{relationship}} with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis, beginning when Kiedis saw Patton performing with Faith No More and accused him of imitating his style. California was scheduled to be released on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Kiedis had Mr. Bungle removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe; as the headlining act at the festivals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear. According to the band members themselves, Kiedis had never met or spoken to anyone involved with Mr. Bungle aside from Mike Patton. Patton explained to The A.V. Club, [...] "Our agent {{was in the process of}} booking these festivals, and it was becoming apparent that we'd landed some pretty good ones—one in France, another one in Holland, some big-name festivals.
