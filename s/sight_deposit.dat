This implies that the net gain for the state, abstracting from operational costs, would be 0.71 % of GDP. Using 2015 GDP, this would make CHF 4.6 billions. This number is not insignificant, but it should be put in perspective by comparing it to recent SNB profits (CHF 24.5 billion in 2016) and to SNB profits that would occur in a period of high interest rates.|$|E
30|$|For {{leverage}} and {{the interest}} rate spread, only the cyclical component was statistically significant. An increase in cyclical leverage (interest rate spread) leads to an increase (decrease) in {{the probability of a}} banking crisis. The findings appear reasonable: a strong short-run increase in leverage and a cyclical decline in the interest rate spread are indicators for overexpansion, with fierce competition in the banking sector, and are typical of the euphoria paving the way to a bubble. The change in trend GDP (10 % significance) and in expected inflation (5 % significance) reduce the probability of a banking crisis. These results were in line with our a priori expectations. An increase in trend growth indicates that loans become less risky and the incomplete adjustment of bank (<b>sight)</b> <b>deposit</b> rates to inflation. There is no direct significant effect of the trend component of leverage on the probability of a banking crisis, but there is an indirect impact resulting from the relationship between the variability of the cyclical component and the trend component of leverage. Indeed, the application of an EGARCH model provided a statistically highly significant effect of trend leverage on the variance of the cyclical leverage component. This function was estimated as the mean of 50, 000 Monte Carlo replications simulating the effect of the trend component of leverage on the probability of a banking crisis. This function is finally multiplied by the estimated GDP loss of a banking crisis {{in order to get the}} function displayed in Fig.  1.

40|$|The covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIP) condition is widely known and taught in academia. Since the Great Financial Crisis, sustained {{violations of the}} CIP condition have occurred, pointing to arbitrage opportunities. Pinnington and Shamloo (2016) investigated these deviations for the foreign currency cross-currency basis (basis) against Swiss franc, {{with a focus on}} the first half of 2015. The objective of this paper consisted of analyzing violations from CIP between January 2011 and December 2016 for the US dollar, Euro and British sterling basis against Swiss franc and whether changes in the basis could have been anticipated with implied FX volatilities. A focus was laid on the negative deviations, signifying that the {{interest rate}} earned over the synthetic replication is higher than over the direct investment. Therefore, the cross-currency bases from 4 January to 30 December 2016 for the maturities of one-, two-, three- and six-month were analyzed, which led to a data sample per currency and tenor of n= 1515. First of all, the data set was investigated for violations of the CIP condition. As the cross-currency basis was hardly never zero, a CIP trading range of 10 basis points above and 10 basis points below zero was determined to differentiate minor from substantial violations. In a second step, the changes in the basis were scatter plotted against the changes in implied FX volatilities. The analysis revealed that CIP violations occurred during the covered period. The US dollar cross-currency basis exhibited the most negative CIP violations of all currency bases analyzed. It was found that the Euro bases showed more positive than negative violations, whereas positive and negative violations were approximately balanced for the British sterling. Generally, the shorter the tenor, the more negative deviations were observed. The cross-currency basis tended to decrease one month {{before the end of the}} year. This was detected for most tenors and currencies under analysis. The highest R 2 observed from the scatter plots stood at 0. 0586. It was concluded that the CIP violations offered substantial arbitrage opportunities. Generally, the cross-currency bases corrected around one month before year-ends and the shorter the tenor, the more pronounced the correction tended to occur. Furthermore, interest rate shocks or sudden changes in central bank policies were followed by a sharp correction of the basis which recovered within one month. Lastly, no evidence was found that changes in bases can be anticipated by changes in implied FX volatility. Banks and financial institutions with ample balance sheet capacities should investigate if they want to take advantage of CIP violations, as they offer a possibility to increase their profits. With the acceptance of interest rate risk, the profits could be further increased as Swiss banks can borrow foreign currency from their clients and deposit the Swiss francs on the <b>sight</b> <b>deposit</b> at the Swiss National Bank. But before engaging in CIP arbitrage transactions, banks should calculate the resulting capital costs thoroughly, to evaluate whether the risk-free profits outweigh the capital costs involved...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{relatively}} high levels of inflation in the 1970 ’s and early 1980 ’s, lowering {{the rate of inflation}} became a stated goal of many central banks from {{the first part of the}} 1980 ’s and onwards. Even so, having an explicit target for the level of inflation as a monetary policy has a more recent history, and when Norway adopted an explicit inflation target on the 29. Mars 2001, it was only about ten years after the first country (New Zealand). However, during the 1990 ’s several countries, with both developed and developing economies, and high and low rates of inflation, adopted explicit inflation targets. Therefore a lot of experience and knowledge was gained, which undoubtedly helped Norway designing their specific inflation targeting monetary policy. Norway chose a long-term annul rate of inflation of 2. 5 %, which balances the trade-off of making the zero boundary limit for the nominal interest rate binding, and the cost of having a too high rate of inflation. But more importantly it was in line with what their major trading partners that had already adopted an explicit inflation. The target horizon Norway chose, which later has been revised twice, was too reach the inflation target rate around two years, which the prevailing literature at the time though to be enough time for the central banks short term interest rate to work on the economy, and also give the central bank enough time to make small adjustments in their short term interest rate, thereby not jeopardizing financial stability. The latter point was, besides achieving a stable rate of inflation, the mandate given to Norges Bank by the Norwegian Government. Even though inflation targeting has become increasingly popular over the last 15 years, there is no general consensus as to the effect inflation targeting has had on the countries that have implemented it. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2001) conducts a comparison of countries that have an explicit inflation target on one hand, and industrial countries that do not have an explicit target on the other hand, and concludes that although the adoption of an inflation target has been a success at lowering the rate of inflation, either prior to the adoption, or after, these countries have not been able to out-perform the control group of non-inflation targeting countries. Bernanke et al. (1999) and Corbo and Schmidt-Hebbel (2000) on the other hand argue that countries that have adopted an inflation target have been able to lower the sacrifice ratio between output and inflation, and also lower the output volatility. Although there is no general consensus to the effect inflation targeting has had on the countries that have adopted it, there is broader agreement of what elements that need to be in place an inflation target to work properly. Mishkin (2004) outlines the following five elements as being the key characteristic of inflation targeting: Forward-looking medium-term target for the rate of inflation, price stability as the ultimate long-term goal for monetary policy, increased commitment for transparency by publishing plans and objectives, a strategy that emphasises information, and increased accountability for the monetary authorities. As mentioned, since the early 1980 ’s lowering the rate of inflation had received high priority from Norges Bank, and following the Governmental decree that was issued on the 5. Of May 1992, which stated that Norges Bank should aim at keeping the exchange rates stable and at about the current levels vis-à-vis major European currencies, they implicitly also got a target for the rate of inflation. The main objective of this thesis has been to analyse whether adopting an explicit inflation target has been an improvement in Norwegian monetary policy, or if it has just made the policies already in place, and clearly understood by the public, explicit, with no effects on the rate and volatility of inflation or people’s expectations. The main empirical findings have been that adopting an inflation target by the Norwegian Government have had very limited effects, when measured in terms of variances, on inflation, ambiguous effects on the exchange rates, and a slight reduction in output volatility, although there are several elements of uncertainty associated with the last result. However, by making the monetary policy more explicit the Norwegian Government has made Norges Bank more accountable for its actions, as it has been easier to measure their performance ex-post, and it has also improved the communication between Norges Bank and the market through publications and a more understandable target. This can be seen from the correlations between the <b>sight</b> <b>deposit</b> rate and the 3 -, 5 - and 10 -year Government bonds, and between the <b>sight</b> <b>deposit</b> rate and bank deposits and loans, which have increased quite considerably, arguably meaning that market expectations have become more in line with those of Norges Bank. The above results show that adopting an inflation target, as mentioned, has not caused Norges Bank to focus too strongly on reaching the explicit rate of inflation causing excessive fluctuations in other key variables, which have been argued by several economists to be a major disadvantage of having an explicit target for the rate of inflation. This can probably be contributed to the fact that Norges Bank has a flexible approach to inflation targeting, implying that they pay attention to other variables when setting their monetary instrument, although reaching the inflation target is the overriding goal in the case of a conflict. So, even though we have developed the perspective that adopting an explicit inflation target by the Norwegian Government has not been a large revolution compared to the way monetary policy was previously conducted in Norway, it has certainly improved the communication between Norges Bank and the market, making market expectations more in line with those of Norges Bank, and it has also made it easier to judge the performance of Norges Bank and thus making them more responsible for their actions.

40|$|An {{interest}} rate policy is symmetrical if the nominal {{interest rate}} response to equally large positive and negative deviations from the inflation target are of identical magnitude but with opposite signs. The governor of Norges Bank (NoB, The Norwegian central bank), Svein Gjedrem, stated in 1999 that good monetary policy includes a symmetrical interest rate: “Over time {{it is important that}} the interest rate is set symmetrically. Such symmetry is necessary to sustain the expectations of nominal stability” (Gjedrem, 1999). Figure 1. Norges Bank’s expectation of the <b>sight</b> <b>deposit</b> rate in the baseline scenario with fan chart. Per cent. Quarterly figures. 04 Q 1 – 08 Q 4. Source: Norges Bank, Inflation Report 3 / 2005. Norges Bank began its inflation targeting policy about two years after Gjedrem made this statement. The governor has not spoken in terms of a symmetrical interest rate during the period of inflation targeting. Implicitly however, NoB has communicated a symmetrical property of the interest rate by the use of fan charts (see Figure 1). The purpose of the fan chart is threefold: it should provide a forecast of the most likely outcome of the economy. The most likely outcome is represented by the thick black line at the centre of the projections. Second, it should convey the degree of uncertainty surrounding the most likely outcome. The degree of uncertainty is represented by the width of the fans. Lastly, it should provide information on the balance of this uncertainty. The spread around the most likely outcome should indicate the risks related to the level of uncertainty. As illustrated in Figure 1, the risks of an interest rate lower than the most likely outcome is equal to the risk of an interest rate higher than the most likely outcome. The balance of risk is symmetrical. The optimality of a symmetrical interest rate is based on a simplified model of the economy, often referred to as the linear-quadratic framework. There is however reason to question if the linear-quadratic framework serves as a good model. If any of the assumptions underlying this framework is changed, it will directly impact interest rate setting and a symmetrical interest rate is no longer optimal. The expressed view of a symmetrical interest rate makes thus a tight restriction on monetary policy. The purpose of this thesis is twofold: it will demonstrate why the property of a symmetrical interest rate / symmetrical fan charts makes a tight restriction on monetary policy. Second, it will test if one of the necessary restrictions for a symmetrical interest rate to be optimal can be rejected on Norwegian data. The thesis proceeds as follows. The first chapter begins by addressing the questions of what monetary policy is, which variables the central bank wants to stabilise and how it can achieve its goals by using the interest rate as its instrument. With respect to the change towards inflation targeting, the economic rationale when choosing a precise inflation target and a production target, is discussed. This discussion makes the foundation of the economic model derived at the end of the chapter. The model is based on the linear-quadratic framework. The purpose of the first chapter is to illustrate how the linear-quadratic framework leads to an optimal symmetrical interest rate. The second chapter questions the symmetrical interest rate as an optimal result. It thoroughly analyses how altering some of the assumptions made in chapter one impacts the interest rate setting. Specifically, it is the shape of the loss function, the shape of the aggregate supply curve, whether shocks are additive only and the credit channel that are discussed. The third chapter tests if one of the necessary conditions for a symmetrical interest rate to optimal, the linear aggregate supply curve, can be rejected on Norwegian data. The supply curve is taken from one of NoB’s economic models. It will be shown that linearity of the supply curve cannot be rejected. The supply curve has however poor empirical properties, suggesting that the lack of evidence of non-linearity not necessarily is evidence of linearity. Another explanation could be that the model is poorly specified. Estimation is done using Eviews 5. 1...|$|E

The basic {{idea behind the}} initiative is that, once <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> are outside of banks’ balance sheets, the financing of banks should come from more “responsible” investment decisions. This {{is likely to be}} true for equity or long-term debt. But some alternative sources of financing may not be more “responsible” and some other may make banks more prone to crises. First, there might be an increase in savings deposits: since the opportunity cost of holding <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> increases, there would be a shift towards savings deposits. Second, there might be a shift towards <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> in euros. These deposits would not be part of sovereign money and would keep yielding a positive interest rate (once we exit the current liquidity trap). These accounts are already available in many Swiss banks, so that the switch would be easy.

In our sample, we do not find the underestimation effect to be applicable as actual deposit withdrawal rates are in most cases lower than the regulatorily specified rate. However, we find the lending effect to be at work: Savings banks with low shares of loans to non-banks do not transform <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> into illiquid assets as intensively as savings banks with high shares of non-bank loans.

40|$|Norges Bank {{has been}} {{delegated}} {{the task of}} contributing to a steady growth of the Norwegian economy by keeping inflation low and stable. The goal {{is to keep the}} yearly growth in consumer prices at 2. 5 percent in the medium run, balancing the inflation path with the overall capacity utilization whenever there is a conflict between the two, which corresponds to flexible inflation targeting. The main instrument for doing this is the <b>sight</b> <b>deposit</b> rate (foliorenten) on commercial banks' overnight deposits in Norges Bank, which affects money market rates through banks' marginal funding costs. The policy rate decisions are based on analyses done with NEMO (the Norwegian Economy Model), as well as on general assessments {{about the state of the}} economy. NEMO is a large New Keynesian DSGE model representing the Norwegian mainland economy in a simplified and stylized manner. Uncertainty about the true structure of the economy is always an issue, and it is by no means certain that NEMO is the best possible description of it. A way to accommodate this uncertainty is to set the interest rate in a robust manner, meaning that monetary policy achieves a satisfactory level of macroeconomic stabilization also when the economy is highly different from the NEMO economy. Such policies that work well across a wide range of structural models are robust to model uncertainty. However, robustness comes at the cost of optimality. Optimal policy is fine-tuned to the dynamics of a specific model, and does not perform well for completely different economies, as intuition suggests and many analyses show. A policy reaction function utilizing less model-specific information performs better on average across models, but naturally worse in each separate model, yet not substantially worse, as my results show. Such a restricted information rule is called a simple interest rate rule and is said to be robust if it performs well across a large variety of models. Simple rules are commonly used by central banks in the conduct of monetary policy, of which there is thorough proof. Janet Yellen in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System indicated that she uses "the Taylor rule" to provide her with " a rough sense of whether or not the funds rate is at a reasonable level". The popularity of simple interest rate rules is due to their applicability and the way they are intuitive and communicative to the general public, but most of all their robustness properties. Norges Bank also uses simple rules to cross-check the policy derived from NEMO, among other the above-mentioned Taylor rule. The actual performance of these rules in the Norwegian economy has not been properly investigated, and little work has been done on robust simple rules is a good representation. A large share of the international literature has however found that the Taylor rule performs quite poorly, and in particular it appears not to be hard-hitting enough. This calls for a better robust rule for the Norwegian economy, which is the goal of my work to find. By analyzing the properties and performance of a number of different policy rules, I seek a rule tailored to the Norwegian economy that yields a satisfactory outcome in a variety of models. I use five different models for the Norwegian economy, with NEMO as the benchmark model: two extensions of NEMO - "Credit NEMO" with a credit market incorporated, and a backward-looking version "Policy NEMO" - as well as a small open model economy, the "Leitemo-Gali-Monacelli" (LGM) model, and a slightly modified version of the macroeconometric model "Norwegian Aggregated Model" (NAM) by Bårdsen and Nymoen, which is a model in "the Norwegian tradition" similar to KVARTS used by the Statistics Norway and RIMINI previously used by Norges Bank. NAM differs substantially from the other four, and drives much of the results in this thesis, which gives sound justifications for including it in the set of models. All of the models prescribe highly divergent reaction functions for the nominal interest rate, and therefore constitute a good and wide-ranging base for robustness analyses. I mostly base my work on the paper by Taylor and Wieland (2009) on robust simple interest rate rules. As they do, I first find the optimal coefficients in three specifications of a simple interest rate rule in each seperate model: one rule where the nominal interest rate responds only to inflation fluctuations and the output gap; one where the lagged interest rate is added in order to allow for more gradual adjustments, and one with the lagged output gap as well. The optimization procedure is done in MatLab with the software Dynare and a search algorithm developed Junior Mai for internal use in Norges Bank. My results show that since the optimized rules are fine-tuned to the dynamics of the rule-generating model, they yield remarkably less stability in the competing models. In particular miserable is the rule with only two variables from the LGM model applied in NAM, generating instability. There is also a strong conflict between the prescribed three variable rules in CN and NAM. In order to improve the achievement of the simple rules, I look at "Bayesian rules" where an average of the outcomes in the models is optimized in order to find the interest rate rule that best stabilizes this "model-mean". The Bayesian rules are more robust as they reduce the variability in each model compared to the first-best rule from another model. They also perform well in the models that they have not been optimized over, NEMO and Policy NEMO. Robustness properties are evaluated using the relative increase in loss in a model stemming from the interchange of two policy rules translated into variability of inflation, a measure called Implied Inflation variability Premium (IIP). My results show a large dispersion of IIPs in the models, with the Bayesian rules naturally generating the lowest average IIP. In particular low IIPs are yielded by the rules where the relative importance of NAM in the optimization is tuned down. I find that rules that respond to last period's rate, inflation deviations from target and the current output gap is the most robust class of rules. Another robustness tool used is fault tolerance (FT), where the relative increase in loss resulting from gradually varying the optimal value of a coefficient in a policy rule is displayed in a graph. FT is both used to measure to which extent a rule is robust towards small changes in the parameters, and how much a model is tolerant to different policies. The three-parameter interest rate rules is proved to be the most robust, and are hence the best to insure against model uncertainty with. NEMO and Policy NEMO are the most fault tolerant models, closely followed by CN, and NAM is the least tolerant. At the end of the thesis I present what I refer to as "the Golden Interest Rule" (GIR), which is the rule that do best on average across the models. Through evaluating IIPs and FT of the different optimized rules, I found the properties of the best-performing rules, and tried several combinations of the parameter values that appeared to be optimal. GIR is as expected, a three-parameter rule that allows for a moderate degree of interest rate smoothing, yet not too much due to NAM. The long run responses to economic disturbances are substantially above the original Taylor rule, in particular three to inflation deviations from target and one and a half to GDP movements from trend. These strong reactions give sufficient stabilization of the real economy in all models considered...|$|E

On the other hand, the sovereign money reform will entail clear costs for the Swiss economy and will create potential risks and instability.

Pushing banks to look for alternatives to <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> is potentially destabilizing. There is a clear destabilizing impact of the reform, even though it is difficult to evaluate this quantitatively.

30|$|There are {{two reasons}} for why doing so is interesting.

30|$|The {{sovereign}} money initiative will {{be submitted}} to the Swiss people in 2018. This paper reviews the arguments behind the initiative and discusses its potential impact. I argue that several arguments are inconsistent with empirical evidence or with economic logic. In particular, controlling <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> neither stabilizes credit nor avoids financial crises. Also, assuming that deposits at the central bank are not a liability has implications for fiscal and monetary policy, and Benes and Kumhof (The Chicago Plan Revisited, 2012) do not provide support for the reform as they do not analyze the proposed Swiss monetary reform and their closed-economy model does not fit the Swiss economy. Then, using a simple model with monopolistically competitive banks, the paper assesses quantitatively the impact of removing <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> from commercial banks’ balance sheets. Even {{though there is a}} gain for the state, the overall impact is negative, especially because depositors would face a negative return. Moreover, the initiative goes much beyond what would be the equivalent of full reserve requirement and would impose severe constraints on monetary policy; it would weaken financial stability rather than reinforce it; and it would threaten the trust in the Swiss monetary system. Finally, there is high uncertainty both on the details of the reform and on its impact.|$|R

It is likely to keep changing in the near future, and the liquidity services of demand deposits will most likely drop. 8 With a decline in the demand for transaction money, the potential revenue for the central bank, one of the main arguments for reform, would also shrink. The development of new forms of e-money will also require a different analysis. However, at this stage, we ignore what form of e-money will be widely used. An important question is whether central banks will issue e-currency in the future. Here, we need to distinguish between two different cases. First, central banks could offer e-currency directly to non-banks in addition to the existing system. This is the option currently considered by some central banks. It {{remains to be seen if}} there would be a demand for such a product. 9 The second case is where e-currency would replace all <b>sight</b> <b>deposits,</b> i.e., it would be compulsory to use central bank e-money instead of <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> at commercial banks. The latter system would be similar to a sovereign money system.|$|R
30|$|To have an {{assessment}} {{in a period}} of positive interest rates, I consider data for the 1993 – 2006 period. I find that the overall impact of the reform is negative and annually represents −[*] 0.4 % of GDP. First, seigniorage of the central bank increases, while tax payments by banks decline. Consolidating the SNB and the government, the state gains by 0.7 % of GDP. However, depositors would be the main losers (1 % of GDP) since they no longer receive a return on their <b>sight</b> <b>deposits.</b> Banks would naturally also lose (0.15 % of GDP).|$|R
3000|$|However, {{there is}} a group of people that only accepts the first {{perspective}} and rejects the second one, which is obviously incorrect (see more on this below). 11 It is therefore claimed that banks create money “out of thin air” (aus dem nichts) and claimed or given the impression that banks can freely decide how many loans and deposits to issue. In this context, the sovereign money supporters find this freedom unacceptable and consequently believe that the central bank should control <b>sight</b> <b>deposits.</b> But this belief is based on the incorrect view of “monetary mysticism.” [...]...|$|R
3000|$|The {{objective}} is to analyze the revenue impact for the state, i.e., government and central bank, for banks and for depositors. Three key aspects will influence the analysis. First, {{an important aspect of}} the reform is that the SNB would not pay any interest on reserves so that <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> would no longer yield any interest. This implies that the opportunity cost of holding money is higher, which has been shown to lower welfare. 26 Moreover, this will decrease money demand M 1. Let m 1 represent M 1 in proportion of GDP: m 1 [*]=[*]M 1 /PY, and let m 1 [...]...|$|R
40|$|In the U. S. {{business}} cycle, {{a monetary}} aggregate consisting predominantly of <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> strongly leads output, time deposits strongly lag output, and a monetary aggregate consisting of {{both types of}} deposits tends to be coincident with the cycle. Such movements are observed {{both before and after}} the 1979 monetary policy change. Similar dynamics are obtained in a model with multi-stage production and purchase-size heterogeneity when agents optimally choose their mix of cash, checkable, and time deposits used in transactions. The causality in the model runs from real activity to money, rather than the other way around. ...|$|R
30|$|Before the {{foundation}} of Swiss National Bank in 1907, banknotes were issued by private banks in Switzerland. Thus, all components of M 1, except coins, were issues by private banks under a regime of free banking. Under such circumstances, {{an increase in the}} money supply may occur at the extensive margin through {{an increase in the number}} of banks or at the intensive margin through an increase in the money supply by existing banks. Moreover, the years since the creation of the Swiss franc as a national currency in 1850 witnessed a strong change in the composition of the M 1. In 1851, approximately 87 % of M 1 were coins and the rest was shared by banknotes and <b>sight</b> <b>deposits.</b> In 1906, the share of <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> increased to 74 % and that of coins shrank to 7 % (Baltensperger and Kugler 2015 a, 2015 b, Chapter III. 1). This development is mirrored on the one hand by an increase in the number of banks from 520 in 1851 to 610 in 1880, a level which remained largely constant thereafter. On the other hand and more importantly, the aggregate bank balance sheet total was six times larger in 1906 than in 1851. Switzerland thus underwent a substantial change in financial structure and a rapid development of banking during this period which needs to be taken into account in analyzing money demand and monetary dynamics.|$|R
30|$|The {{sovereign}} money {{reform is}} obviously {{related to the}} proposals for full reserve banking and to the “Chicago plan,” where commercial banks are imposed a 100 % reserve requirement on deposits. Sovereign money is similar to full reserve coverage, but it goes one step further as it gives full control of <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> by the central bank. 3 Moreover, the initiative goes much further than the concept of sovereign money. It would introduce constraints on monetary policy and would imply that SNB liabilities are no longer matched by its assets. It would also impose restrictions on minimum holding periods for non-monetary financial assets such as savings deposits.|$|R
30|$|The reform {{implies that}} all <b>sight</b> <b>deposits</b> {{are no longer}} on the balance sheets of {{commercial}} banks. This may imply lower funding for banks. If this is the case, in the first stage of the reform, the SNB lends the funds to banks. More specifically, let H be the monetary base before the reform, which is made of banknotes and of banks’ reserves at the central bank. With the reform, banks would transfer deposits in M 1 to the SNB and are likely to reduce their initial reserves. 25 This is the quantity of funds that is no longer available to banks for their lending or investment activities. If the SNB lends the equivalent amount to banks, their total resources are unchanged.|$|R
