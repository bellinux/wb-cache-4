A {{design of a}} two-dimensional acoustic metacage with subwavelength thickness which can shield acoustic waves from all directions while allowing steady fluid flow is presented in this paper. The structure is designed based on acoustic gradient-index metasurfaces composed of open channels and shunted Helmholtz resonators. The strong parallel momentum on the metacage surface rejects in-plane sound at an arbitrary angle of incidence which leads to low sound transmission through the metacage. The performance of the proposed metacage is verified by numerical simulations and measurements on a three-dimensional printed prototype. The acoustic metacage has potential applications in sound insulation where steady fluid flow is necessary or advantageous...|$|E

The shield consists of an array of small diameter rods aligned nearly parallel to the entrance flow with small gaps between the rods for boundary layer suction. Results show that at the lowest test Reynolds number (based on rod diameter) of 52, 000 the noise shield reduced the test section noise by about 60 percent (or 8 db attenuation) but no attenuation was measured for the higher range of test reynolds numbers from 73, 000 to 190, 000. These results are below expectations based on data reported elsewhere on a flat <b>sound</b> <b>shield</b> model. The smaller attenuation from the present tests is attributed to insufficient suction at the gaps to prevent feedback of vacuum manifold noise into the shielded test flow and to insufficient suction to prevent transition of the rod boundary layers to turbulent flow at the higher Reynolds numbers.

With one and two row(s) of holes, high frequency specific features in the transmission coefficient are explained in terms of a coupling of incident waves with both Fabry-Perot oscillations inside the junctions and induced surface acoustic waves between the homogeneous part of the plate and the row of holes. With two rows of holes, low frequency peaks and dips appear in the transmission spectrum. The choice of the distance between the two rows of holes allows the realization of a broadband low frequency acoustic shielding with attenuation over 99 % for symmetric waves in a wide low frequency range and over 90 % for antisymmetric ones.

40|$|The locally {{resonant}} {{material is}} a composite made with statistically distributed locally resonant unit. It can completely block the elastic wave in certain frequency ranges. It provides a new and promising method for noise and vibration control. In this research, theoretical and experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to characterize the nature of such materials. In theoretical investigation, a new approach was developed to calculate the effective mass density for a sphere-type locally resonant unit, which has a hard sphere core, a soft shell layer surrounding, and a stiff host medium. The composite was developed as low-frequency <b>sound</b> <b>shielding</b> material. Different from the model in the original paper, which was based on wave propagation theory, the new approach was based on the vibration theory. The natural frequency of local resonance unit was calculated and then the composite behavior under harmonic load was investigated. It was shown that the effective mass density of the composite could turn to negative and infinite at the frequency close to resonance. In order to examine the influence of important parameters on the resonant frequency and effective mass density, parameter study has been carried out. It was found that a thicker soft layer with smaller modules could lead to lower resonant frequency. The predictions of wave spectral gap from the new approach and from the model in the literature approach were almost identical. A new membrane-type of locally resonant unit was fabricated and tested. It was consisted of hard circular plate adhered on the soft membrane that fixed in a rigid frame. It exhibited completely sound transmission gap. An analytical model was developed based on the wave propagation theory to describe the low-frequency effective mass per unit area for the composite material. The model provided a direct explanation of nature of the system and an accurate method to calculate effective mass per unit area of such a system. It was shown that the effective mass per unit area could turn to negative at certain frequency ranges, which led to complete sound attenuation. In order to measure the sound transmission gap position and verify the theoretical model, experimental work has been carried out. It was found that the theoretical predictions agreed well with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Microstructured {{materials}} {{are used in}} material science and engineering to attain desired material properties. Acoustic meta{{materials are}} a rapidly growing area in this field of engineered materials that use deep subwavelength microstructures to attain exotic acoustic properties unavailable in nature. These properties, such as negative acoustic index, allow unprecedented capabilities such as sub-diffraction limit resolution, which {{have the potential to}} greatly improve existing technologies like high intensity focused ultrasound, <b>sound</b> <b>shielding,</b> and ultrasonic imaging, as well as create the entirely new ones like acoustic cloaking and energy trapping. Two acoustic material properties were pursued in this dissertation, anisotropic density and negative acoustic index. Anisotropic density in a fluid acoustic metamaterial was pursued for use in a 2 D acoustic hyperlens. Originally developed to image sub-diffraction limit electromagnetic information in the far-field, the theory behind the hyperlens imaging method in acoustics is presented and the performance is shown to be directly related to the density anisotropy magnitude. An acoustic metamaterial composed of alternating deep subwavelength layers of air and brass is then shown theoretically and numerically to attain the necessary density anisotropy, with a three order of magnitude difference in component amplitudes. Experiments using a 2 D cylindrical acoustic hyperlens constructed from this metamaterial confirm {{a significant portion of the}} evanescent components are converted into propagating components at the lens exit, resulting in far-field acoustic imaging of information far below the diffraction limit. Development of a negative acoustic index fluid metamaterial was motivated by the reversed wave phenomena leading to a perfect lens. Negative bulk modulus and density are shown in simulations to result from the combination of Helmholtz and rod-spring resonators, which creates a band in the power ultrasound frequency range with negative real acoustic index components. Following a several design changes to accommodate the available experimental facilities, samples of this metamaterial were tested and indeed found to attain a negative real component of acoustic index. However, intrinsic loss and design restrictions led to a small real to imaginary index component ratio, severely limiting the application prospects of this metamaterial. Work on active acoustic metamaterials to overcome these and other problems follows, with simulations indicating piezoelectric elements in water may be used as gain elements to amplify damped waves or as direct replacements for passive resonators that both combat loss and broaden the bandwidth of anomalous properties...|$|E

A 45 % reduction in the tunnel free stream root mean square pressure level was measured within the shielded region for this gap width when the boundary layers on the rods were laminar.

Measurements indicated that for a Reynolds number of 1. 5 x 10 to the 9 th power the noise in the shielded region was significantly reduced, but only when the flow is mostly laminar on the rods. Actual nozzle input noise measured on the nozzle centerline before reflection at the shield walls was attenuated only slightly even when the rod boundary layer were laminar. At a lower Reynolds number, nozzle input noise at noise levels in the shield were still too high for application to a quiet tunnel. At Reynolds numbers above 2. 0 x 10 the the 7 th power per meter, measured noise levels were generally higher than nozzle input levels, probably due to transition in the rod boundary layers. The small attenuation of nozzle input noise at intermediate Reynolds numbers for laminar rod layers at the acoustic origins is apparently due to high frequencies of noise...|$|R
