5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even <b>so,</b> <b>pure</b> native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickelâ€“iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is <b>so</b> <b>pure</b> it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an awful lot of people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

Codeine have hit upon a formula <b>so</b> <b>pure</b> and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, explaining that [...] "There's not a lot going on here, but songs such as [...] "Realize" [...] and [...] "Hard to Find" [...] are hardly nothing." [...] and that tracks such as [...] "W." [...] allow Codeine to achieve [...] "both earthly aggression and unearthly calm." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin, reviewed the single [...] "Realize", stating that the song [...] "inches along as if Codeine's still wondering whether it's worth the effort".

[...] Writer Stacy McKee deemed Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with [...] "the undeniably handsome - and totally charming" [...] Denny. Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him. I love their relationship because it's <b>so</b> <b>pure</b> and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "is Izzie bad for doing it?

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and <b>so</b> <b>pure</b> and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

[...] was perfection. Perfection!" [...] Christopher Hahn, General Director of the Pittsburgh Opera, observed: [...] "It's very unusual for a young child to have a voice that sounded so rich and developed." [...] "I thought she was just lovely, sweetly compelling". Hahn particularly praised Evancho's phrasing. Composer Tim Janis commented that Evancho [...] "takes a classical piece and makes it friendly and accessible. ... Her voice is <b>so</b> <b>pure</b> and natural, there's no flaw in it. People say 'I can hear her potential coming,' but no, it's here, it's now." [...] Claudia Benack, Assistant Professor of musical theatre at Carnegie Mellon University, said that Evancho [...] "has an unusually adult feel for the repertoire. ... She sings to the important part of the phrase, and then backs off. That's instinctual. ... She takes breaths sometimes where an adult would not, but that's just because she's young and little. ... She sings from the healthy part of her voice." [...] Jia Tolentino of The New Yorker later called Evancho's YouTube audition for AGT [...] "supernaturally blissful", and commented that she delivered [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] with [...] "graceful phrasing, a controlled, slow vibrato, and a tone that resonates impersonally, like a bell." [...] Critic Tim Page, however, wrote that Evancho [...] "has many years of work ahead of her before she becomes any sort of musician." [...] Doctor Clark Rosen, director of the University of Pittsburgh Voice Center, noted that Evancho's talent is made possible by how her brain coordinates her body for singing.|$|E
500|$|Ramones was {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records and received glowing reviews. In May, John Rockwell of the New York Times published a rave review, saying: [...] "What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. [...] conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself." [...] Rockwell noted: [...] "the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock <b>so</b> <b>pure</b> that other associations get left behind." [...] Nick Kent favourably commented in the NME: [...] "This record poses {{a direct threat to}} any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi...". Critic Robert Christgau in The Village Voice gave the album a positive review, specifically writing about the album's themes and sound quality. In July, Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone wrote in 1976 that the album was similar to early rock and roll, and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity. In August, Creem dubbed The Ramones as [...] "The most radical album of the past six years", saying: [...] " [...] is so strikingly different, so brazenly out of touch with prevailing modes as to constitute a bold swipe at the status quo." [...] Reviewer Gene Sculatti saw it as [...] "a rock 'n' roll reactionary's manifesto" [...] "a sharp wedge between the stale ends of a contemporary music scene bloated with graying superstars and overripe for takeover." [...] Critic Joe S. Harrington declared that the album was a huge landmark for music history, proclaiming that [...] " [...] split the history of rock 'n' roll in half." [...] Theunis Bates, a writer for Time, summed the album up with: [...] "Ramones stripped rock back to its basic elements... lyrics are very simple, boiled-down declarations of teen lust and need." [...] Bates also said that it [...] "is the ultimate punk statement." [...] Charles M. Young of Rolling Stone regarded Ramones as [...] "one of the funniest rock records ever made and, if punk continues to gain momentum, a historic turning point." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when sheâ€™s around him.

Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E
