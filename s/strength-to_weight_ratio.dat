Aluminium {{silicon carbide}} {{particulate}} composites have wide ranging applications in automobile, aerospace and military industries {{because of their}} attractive properties such as high <b>strength-to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> high wear resistance, high temperature stability etc. From the machining point of view, these {{are one of the}} most difficult-to-machine materials, primarily due to the presence of SiC reinforcements causing an excessive wear of cutting tools during machining. On the other hand aluminium- graphite composites are widely used in tribological applications because of their excellent antifriction properties, wear resistance and antiseizure characteristics. Investigations have been carried out in this work to assess the machinability of aluminium matrix composites containing both SiC and graphite particulates as reinforcements. Turning experiments have been conducted on Aluminium-Graphite-Silicon Carbide hybrid composites using Carbide and PCD tool inserts to determine the flank wear.

40|$|Recently the {{air craft}} and {{military}} industries widely {{have been using}} aluminium alloys particularly because of their fine strength to weight ratio. However in compare with steels they represent welding difficulties and also lower ductility. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine the effects of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters, which are the tool rotation speed, Welding speed, Too tilt angle. The Micro hardness and mechanical properties of butt joint Aluminum Alloy (Al 5083) sheets of thickness 4 mm. The microstructure examinations and mechanical test results indicated that the joint properties were significantly affected by FSW parameters. Due to high strength, good welding properties, increased wear and corrosion resistance and high <b>strength-to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> Aluminium 5083 is widely used in Ship building, Rail cars, Vehicle bodies, Tip truck bodies, Pressure vessels. Friction Stir Welding is an emerging solid state joining process in which the material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non- consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and tool profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect to tool rotational speed (rpm), welding speed (mm/min) and Tool tilt angle (degrees) on 5083 Aluminium Alloy Plates of thickness 4 mm.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCarbon fiber is {{extensively}} used in aircraft {{components and}} structures, where its superior <b>strength-to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> far exceeds {{that of any}} metal. Thirty percent of all carbon fiber {{is used in the}} aerospace industry. The purpose of this research was to determine the influence of material properties on the impact response of a laminate, whereby specimens were fabricated and cured under a vacuum and high temperature using three types of pre-impregnated (prepreg), carbon fibers, namely unidirectional fiber, plain weave woven fiber, and non-crimp fiber. Each carbon fiber panel, usually known for its low-impact properties, with respective type of prepregs, of 16 plies underwent impact testing using a low-velocity impactor and visual damage inspection by C-scan in order to measure the damage area and depth, before and after impact testing. These panels were treated with UV exposure and moisture conditioning for 20 days each. Water contact angles were taken into consideration to determine the hydrophobicity and hydrophillicity of the respective prepreg material. Experimental results and damage analysis show that UV exposure and moisture conditioning showcased the variation in impact response and behavior, such as load-carrying capacity, absorbed energy, and impact energy of the carbon fiber panels. This study illustrates that non-crimp carbon fiber laminates were far more superior relative to load capacity than woven and unidirectional laminates, with the NCF-AS laminate exhibiting the highest load capacity of 17, 244 lb/in (pre-UV) with only 0. 89 % decrease after UV exposure. This same laminate also had a 1. 54 % decrease in sustaining impact and 31. 4 % increase in wettability of the panel. Moreover, the study shows how symmetric and asymmetric stacking sequences affect the impact behavior of non-crimp fiber laminates. These results may be useful for expanding the capacity of carbon fiber, lowering costs, and growing new markets, thus turning carbon fiber into a viable commercial product...|$|E
40|$|The Unites States {{predicted}} 60 % {{growth in}} energy demand by 2030 makes {{oil and natural}} gas primary target fuels for energy generation. The fact that the peak of oil production from shallow wells (< 5000 m) is about to be reached, thereby pushing the {{oil and natural gas}} industry into deeper wells. However, drilling to depths greater than 5000 m requires increasing the <b>strength-to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of the drill pipe materials. Grade UD- 165 is one of the ultra- high yield strength carbon steels developed for ultra deep drilling (UDD) activities. Drilling UDD wells exposes the drill pipes to Cl{sup -}, HCO{sub 3 }{sup -}/CO{sub 3 }{sup 2 -}, and H{sub 2 }S-containig corrosive environments (i. e., sour environments) at higher pressures and temperatures compared to those found in conventional wells. Because of the lack of synergism within the service environment, operational stresses can result in catastrophic brittle failures characteristic for environmentally assisted cracking (EAC). Approximately 75 % of all drill string failures are caused by fatigue or corrosion fatigue. Since there is no literature data on the corrosion fatigue performance of UD- 165 in sour environments, research was initiated to better clarify the fatigue crack growth (FCGR) behavior of this alloy in UDD environments. The FCGR behavior of ultra-strength carbon steel, grade UD- 165, was investigated by monitoring crack growth rate in deaerated 5 %NaCl solution buffered with NaHCO{sub 3 }/Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and in contact with H{sub 2 }S. The partial pressure of H{sub 2 }S (p{sub H 2 S}) was 0. 83 kPa and pH of the solution was adjusted by NaOH to 12. The fatigue experiments were performed at 20 and 85 C in an autoclave with surface investigations augmented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. In this study, research focused on surface analyses supported by the fatigue crack growth rate measurements. Fig. 1 shows an SEM micrograph of the crack that propagated from the notch in the solution at 20 C. Accumulation of the corrosion products is visible along the crack. The EDX chemical analysis near the crack tip found iron, sulfur and oxygen in the passive layer. The surface of the sample after the fatigue test in the sour environment at 85 {sup o}, Fig. 2, C looks different from that fatigued surface at 20 C. The crack propagates across the passive film that covers the surface fairly uniformly. Some spallation of the passive film is observed near the notch. The EDX chemical analysis of the passive film near the crack tip identified mainly iron, carbon and oxygen. It appears that temperature plays a very important role in formation of the passive film. This may be associated with different solubility of H{sub 2 }S in the solution, which will be further studied...|$|E

Of the few researchers who have used a direct method, the participants who were recruited were invariably younger adults. To date, there has been no research performed to examine how older adults perceive weight-ratios, using direct estimation or any other technique.

We collected seeds of five tree species of Gutian Mountain in the fall of 2006, sowed them in the spring of 2007 and grew the tree seedlings under the treatments. We periodically investigated traits of growth, biomass and allocation for three years. Important findings Nitrogen significantly promoted growth in height, stem basal diameter and biomass of Elaeocarpus glabripetalus, Liquidambar formosana and Schima superba, but only increased branch and leaf biomass of Pinus massoniana and branch biomass of Cyclobalanopsis glauca. After two years of treatment, nitrogen increased leaf <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of E. glabripetalus and S. superba and increased branch <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of L. formosana and C. glauca. With three years, nitrogen increased stem <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of E. glabripetalus, L. formosana and S. superba and branch <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of C. glauca and P. massoniana. The increase of the aboveground <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> is at the cost of decreased underground <b>weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> Nitrogen reduced the root <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of E. glabripetalus, L. formosana, S. superba and C. glauca. Reducing precipitation by 30 % had no significant effects on growth...|$|R
