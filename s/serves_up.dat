5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce <b>serves</b> <b>up</b> black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{still had}} {{problems}} with the film's narrative. The staff of TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining, it [...] "offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution."

500|$|Los Angeles Times {{reviewer}} Kenneth Turan {{felt that}} it was difficult {{to make sense of the}} film, saying that it relied too heavily on the series' mythology.

500|$|... "Can't B Good" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

Donning a red dress and singing from beside a grand piano, her performance in that event garnered positive reviews from critics. Elysa Gardner of USA Today lauded Clarkson's performance and ranked {{it as one of}} the three best performances, writing, [...] "The pre-performance clip of a girlish-looking Clarkson emphasized how little Kelly has matured. The girl most likely to escape the American Idol stigma was in fine, creamy voice, and kept the Mariah-esque riffing to a minimum." [...] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times considered Clarkson's performance as one of the highlights in the event and described her performance as a [...] "thin-skinned rendition [...] in which her whole being seemed involved." [...] Yahoo! Music praised Clarkson's rendition of the song, calling it [...] "perfectly fine" [...] despite the saying that it was [...] "a little reminiscent of those many mediocre, superficial ballads trotted out on 'Idol.'"

500|$|Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic viewed that track, {{along with}} [...] "All of the Lights" [...] and [...] "Power" [...] have [...] "a certain zest of life" [...] to them, adding {{that all three}} tracks were [...] "beautiful". He also commented that [...] "it is great to see that Kanye is still able to have plenty of fun without losing any of his creativity." [...] Dan Vidal of URB commented [...] "sonically, the joy comes from the triumphant, {{painstaking}} arrangement that undoubtedly went into the production". The Washington Posts Chris Richards mused that [...] "the drums come avalanching on Lost in the World", calling it [...] "the grand finale this album deserves." [...] He continued that [...] "West <b>serves</b> <b>up</b> high drama at a breakneck tempo, with pining melodies crying out for a redemptive moment. But there's no final act of contrition. West is too 'lost in this plastic life.'" [...] Cole Mathew of Slant Magazine described the track as [...] "Kanye's much-anticipated reworking of Bon Iver's [...] "Woods" [...] from his classic EP", and wrote that [...] "it's astounding how he takes the strangest sample on the album and crafts it into a defiantly giddy dance number, complete with tribal drumming in the verses and group choruses that sound massive. It's a mad stroke of brilliance to take Justin Vernon's solitary ode to alienation {{and use it as}} the centerpiece of a catchy, communal reverie. It's experimental, to be sure, but it's also the closest the album comes to pure pop indulgence." [...] The song peaked on the South Korea Gaon Chart at position 104.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{weighted}} mean rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, Cheek to Cheek received an average score of 64, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 12 reviews. MTV News's Gil Kaufman praised the album, calling Bennett and Gaga [...] "a match made in heaven". He {{added that the}} singers were able to [...] "flawlessly" [...] merge their unique vocals, that was reflected in their in-studio rapport, and thus onto the songs on Cheek to Cheek. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian awarded the album with {{four out of five}} stars, claiming that [...] "Gaga is a wonder". She also praised that [...] "Cheek to Cheek reveals the considerable warmth and depth of her voice". The Times critic Will Hodgkinson praised the album giving it a rating of four out of five stars. He added that Gaga could have been a [...] "habitué of Upper Manhattan piano bars and supper clubs.. as Stefani Germanotta, classy singer of standards". Jazz critic Marc Myers reviewed the album for The Wall Street Journal, claiming that [...] "the biggest surprise on the album is Gaga's solo vocal on 'Lush Life', a difficult song that has troubled even the most seasoned jazz-pop singers, including Frank Sinatra. Her lower register is warm and her phrasing is heartfelt." [...] In his favorable review, Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich wrote that [...] "Cheek to Cheek <b>serves</b> <b>up</b> the real thing, start to finish... Both singers revel in swing rhythm, eager to buoy from one offbeat to the next and the next. They achieve considerable energy. But it's when things slow down that you can hear what these artists are capable of as interpreters, alone and together." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Thomas Sutcliffe for The Independent writes that: [...] "while flight is the sustaining theme, the film never soars. The characterisation is Cluedo with pretensions, and the dialogue suspends the actors in that ungainly, undignified dangle which you associate with stage flying, the wires robbing them of all powers of independent movement." [...] While {{he describes the}} scene which culminates the lesbian storyline as [...] "radiant" [...] and [...] "beautifully acted by Vanessa Redgrave and Dorothy Tutin", he opines of the acting in general that [...] "for the most part, these people are simply Winterson's puppets, jerked around by the symbolic demands of the plot." [...] He deems Kidron's directing [...] "a kind of surrender, dutifully supplying visual equivalents for Winterson's sterile symmetries but despairing of any greater vivacity", and is particularly critical of Winterson's screenplay, noting that: [...] "everything unrolls at the same stately pace, a religious procession bearing the reliquaries of Winterson's prose. It's as though the author thinks every word is infinitely precious. She's right, though perhaps {{not in the way}} she imagines." [...] Variety′s David Rooney agrees the film's coming-out scene is a [...] "potential jewel" [...] and [...] "captivatingly played", however, in line with Sutcliffe's criticisms, opines that the film's pacing means that [...] "the scene is lobbed in and robbed of its impact". He summarises the film as [...] "a willfully theatrical, sporadically magical romantic comedy embracing three barely compatible narrative strands, not one of which ever gets full flight clearance". Rooney deems the film [...] "Damaged beyond repair by a mannered scripting style and evident recutting", and opines that [...] "Jeanette Winterson's preposterous dialogue and comic mistiming <b>serves</b> <b>up</b> more misses than hits". Of the film's major themes, he writes that: [...] "Questions about the line between truth and falsehood, genuine and fake, are too flimsily voiced to mean much. Likewise, the intro of race issues in the closing voiceover only makes the haphazard mix even more lumpy".|$|E
