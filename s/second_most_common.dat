5|$|English (American English) is the {{de facto}} {{national}} language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> language and the most widely taught second language.

5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, {{largely due to the}} introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.|$|E
50|$|Professional decks {{will use}} higher tape speeds, with 15 and 30 inches per <b>second</b> being <b>most</b> <b>common,</b> while lower tape speeds are usually used for smaller {{recorders}} and cassette players, {{in order to}} save space where fidelity is not as critical as in professional recorders. By providing a range of tape speeds, users can trade-off recording time against signal quality with higher tape speeds providing greater frequency response.|$|R

5|$|Apatosaurus was the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus {{may have}} been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Supersaurus has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. Apatosaurus fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of Apatosaurus ajax are known {{exclusively}} from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, {{the most common cause of}} death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic.

50|$|Vaughan Fire and Rescue Service's biggest {{division}} is the Operations Division. The Operations Division is the division {{that is responsible}} for responding to emergency calls. VFRS's total average response time to emergencies is six minutes and 19 <b>seconds.</b> The <b>most</b> <b>common</b> emergency call that VFRS responds to are medical calls (36% of calls in 2015 were medical calls), but VFRS also assists the York Regional Police department with calls, especially calls to car accidents. VFRS also responds to a large number of false alarms, with 24% of calls in 2015 being false alarms. VFRS primarily deals with rural scenarios in the north and urban in the south part of the city.|$|R
5|$|PD is the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's {{disease and}} affects approximately seven million people globally and {{one million people}} in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{could offer}} only petrol engines until 1953. The most common ones were the Hercules engines made {{domestically}} under licence by SAT and Tampella. The SAT-made engine {{was called the}} Sisu AMG or SA5, and the engine made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> engine was the Cadillac V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX, which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe. Some Bedford petrol engines were used in Defence Forces lorries in the 1960s and Ford V8 engines were used for fire engines. The first diesel Vanajas were powered by Saurer and Kämper engines. The vast majority of diesel engines were supplied by Leyland and AEC. A few Vanajas were equipped with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader 510E. In some cases, the engine {{was provided by the}} customer; one Vanaja was powered by a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine.|$|E
25|$|Because {{unsaturated}} alanes are oxygen- and moisture-sensitive, {{they are}} most often prepared for immediate use without isolation. However, the method of preparation determines {{the configuration of the}} intermediate unsaturated alane, which {{is directly related to the}} configuration of the product (transfer of the alkenyl group occurs with retention of configuration). Thus, an understanding of available hydroalumination methods is important for the study of reactions of unsaturated alanes. This <b>second</b> describes the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> methods of hydroalumination, and subsequent chemical reactions that the resulting alkenylalanes may undergo.|$|R
40|$|HIV/AIDS was the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> {{population}} {{concern of}} Governments in 2009, with 87 per cent considering it {{a major concern}} (box 2).

Other major population concerns in developed countries were HIV/AIDS, low fertility and a relatively small or declining number of persons of working age. In developing countries, 90 per cent of the Governments considered HIV/AIDS as a major concern. High infant and child mortality and high maternal mortality were the <b>second</b> and third <b>most</b> <b>common</b> concerns in developing countries after HIV/AIDS.

5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of these pressures, the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet {{off the coast of}} California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the <b>second</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{lightning}} flash {{rates are}} {{proving to be}} an early indicator of intensifying storms capable of producing tornadoes, damaging winds and hail. Most of this lightning is in the cloud, where the naked eye can not see it. Recent global observations of thunderstorms from space indicate that giant electrical storms (supercells and convective complexes) with flash rates {{on the order of}} 1 flash per <b>second</b> are <b>most</b> <b>common</b> over the land masses of the America sub-tropics and equatorial Congo Basin. Within the United States, the average tornado warning lead time on a national basis is about 11 min.

5000|$|The <b>second</b> (and <b>most</b> <b>common)</b> {{way to run}} a {{round robin}} is to have four drivers (or as many as there are lanes) start at a time, and rotate through all the lanes, before being {{replaced}} by the next set of drivers. This is known as a [...] "heat" [...] or [...] "consi". Often a small amount of practice time (usually 30 seconds) will be given to the drivers {{prior to the start of}} each heat. If there are an odd number of drivers such that they are not wholly divisible into the number of lanes, one of two measures is taken: either a heat is run with one or more positions unfilled, or a heat is run with extra drivers, with a [...] "sit-out" [...] position. After all drivers have run their heat, placement is determined by total laps completed.|$|R

30|$|Bivalves {{were the}} <b>second</b> group <b>most</b> <b>common</b> (17.2 %). Bivalves present a wide {{geographic}} distribution, availability {{in different types}} of aquatic environments, possibility of breeding in aquacultures and are adequate for studies with caged organisms (Viarengo et al. 2007). Other bioindicator organisms, such as crabs, shrimps, worms and planarians were occasionally used. Additionally, two studies applied cell cultures of mammals’ fibroblasts (V 79 line) and human lymphocytes to assess water quality. Cell cultures are a useful tool in environmental evaluation, being an alternative methodology due to its easy manipulation and sensibility when exposed to physical and chemical agents; in addition, it presents good reproducibility (Rogero et al. 2003; Zegura et al. 2009). Despite the wide use in other countries (Leme and Marin-Morales 2009), the biomarkers analysis in plants to assess water quality is still unusual in Brazil since only six studies {{were found in the}} present review.|$|R
