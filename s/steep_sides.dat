5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|The steep {{walls of}} the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its <b>steep</b> <b>sides,</b> there are {{many parts of the}} gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied {{a position in}} the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the eastern Taurus Mountains. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had crossed to begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against using it for the return as well; nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident of his ability and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused to heed any advice, seeking to reap the glory for this expedition alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to size classification, icebergs {{can be classified}} {{on the basis of}} their shape. The two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular. Tabular icebergs have <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> and a flat top, much like a plateau, with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1. This type of iceberg, also known as an ice island, can be quite large, as in the case of Pobeda Ice Island. Antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf, such as the Ross Ice Shelf or Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, are typically tabular. The largest icebergs in the world are formed this way.|$|E

25|$|The Benedictine Abbey of Saint-André {{occupied}} a strategic position on Mount Andaon {{within sight of}} the town of Avignon which lay {{on the other side of}} the Rhone. Mount Andaon is a rocky outcrop with <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> to the north and the east that rises 50m above the floodplain of the Rhone. Prior to the 1770s the river flowed next to the base of the eastern side of the mount. The plateau at the top covers an area of around 3.5hectare and extends for 220m in an east-west direction and 160m north-south. The top is not flat but rises from south to north by 24m. The abbey was built at the eastern end of the plateau; the western end was occupied by a small village.|$|E
25|$|The Ganj-i-sawai, captained by one Muhammad Ibrahim, was a fearsome opponent, {{mounting}} eighty {{guns and}} a musket-armed guard of four hundred, {{as well as}} six hundred other passengers. But the opening volley evened the odds, as Every's lucky broadside shot his enemy's mainmast by the board. With the Ganj-i-sawai unable to escape, the Fancy drew alongside. For a moment, a volley of Indian musket fire prevented the pirates from clambering aboard, {{but one of the}} Ganj-i-sawai's powerful cannons exploded, instantly killing many and demoralizing the Indian crew, who ran below deck or fought to put out the spreading fires. Every's men took advantage of the confusion, quickly scaling the Ganj-i-sawai's <b>steep</b> <b>sides.</b> The crew of the Pearl, initially fearful of attacking the Ganj-i-sawai, now took heart and joined Every's crew on Indian ship's deck. A ferocious hand-to-hand battle now ensued, lasting two to three hours.|$|E
25|$|European rock {{drawings}} and cave paintings reveal that moose have been hunted since the Stone Age. Excavations in Alby, Sweden, {{adjacent to the}} Stora Alvaret have yielded moose antlers in wooden hut remains from 6000BCE, indicating {{some of the earliest}} moose hunting in northern Europe. In northern Scandinavia one can still find remains of trapping pits used for hunting moose. These pits, which can be up to 4×7m wide and 2m deep, would have been camouflaged with branches and leaves. They would have had <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> lined with planks, making it impossible for the moose to escape once it fell in. The pits are normally found in large groups, crossing the moose's regular paths and stretching over several kilometers. Remains of wooden fences designed to guide the animals toward the pits have been found in bogs and peat. In Norway, an early example of these trapping devices has been dated to around 3,700BC. Trapping elk in pits is an extremely effective hunting method, and as early as the 16thcentury the Norwegian government tried to restrict their use. Nevertheless, the method was in use until the 19thcentury.|$|E

25|$|On 22 January, Japanese {{artillery}} began {{firing on}} the 2/12th's position, {{but it was}} unable {{to prevent them from}} taking Prothero II. Meanwhile, a small patrol from the 2/2nd Pioneers began exploiting the area to the north-east of Prothero II and subsequently managed to install itself in a position on the eastern extremity of Kankiryo Saddle. To the south, the 2/9th carried out reconnaissance around the area in front of their position around Green Sniper's Pimple, and located several Japanese bunkers. Deciding on an indirect approach, an Australian patrol was sent to the flanks and under the cover of heavy artillery, they scaled the <b>steep</b> <b>sides</b> of McCaughey's Knoll to take the position with the element of surprise. Earlier, the 2/10th had taken several attempts to secure Cam's Hill, including an unsuccessful assault on the Japanese rear with a flanking move through the Faria River. Throughout the night, the Japanese launched several unsuccessful counter-attack attempts, but these were repelled and on 24 January, the 2/9th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions continued to converge, squeezing the Japanese defenders between them. As a result, the Japanese were forced to abandon positions around the top of the Faria River and the Kankiryo Saddle and they began to withdraw to Crater Hill. The following day, patrols from the 2/10th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions determined that the Japanese were digging in on that position, and throughout the day the 2/9th attempted to outflank the position, attacking from behind while the 2/10th and 2/12th assaulted frontally from the south. These proved unsuccessful and during 26 January, the 2/9th sent two companies across Kankiryo Saddle, securing the 4100 feature before coming under heavy fire from the Japanese on Crater Hill, where they had dug-in strong defences along several sharp ridges.|$|E
