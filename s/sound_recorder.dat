5|$|Jackson {{explored}} {{a variety}} of music genres, including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write his songs on paper and instead dictated into a <b>sound</b> <b>recorder.</b> When composing music, he preferred to beatbox and imitate instruments vocally rather than use instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows 8.1; PC Settings was {{expanded}} to include options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools {{were added to the}} Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number of additional stock apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, <b>Sound</b> <b>Recorder,</b> Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is enabled by default within Windows To Go environments.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{being the}} first of his friends to begin work on a feature, Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard had their feature-film debuts {{distributed}} before Rivette in what the French press called New Wave cinema. Rivette later compared the New Wave to impressionist painting; the availability of paint in tubes, which allowed artists to paint outdoors, was similar to technological advancements enabling filmmakers to shoot in the streets. Technical innovations such as faster film stock and the portable Nagra <b>sound</b> <b>recorder</b> became available after the director finished Paris Belongs to Us.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic tape <b>sound</b> <b>recorder,</b> the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders. Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|E
25|$|Though the backmasking {{controversy}} {{peaked in}} the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more {{widespread in the}} United States during the following decade, with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s. At the same time, the development of sound editing software with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio, which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder. The <b>Sound</b> <b>Recorder</b> utility, included with Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows XP, allows one-click audio reversal, as does popular open source sound editing software Audacity. Following {{the growth of the}} Internet, backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.|$|E

2500|$|Buckley's death shocked many of {{his friends}} and relatives.

2500|$|Nintendo 3DS Sound is a {{built-in}} music player and <b>sound</b> <b>recorder.</b> Supported filename extensions include MP3 audio with [...]mp3 and AAC audio with [...]mp4, [...]m4a, or [...]3GP. Audio files {{can be played}} from an SD card, with visualizations displayed on the upper screen. Music can be played while the console is closed, using the system's headphone jack. A set of sound manipulation options are available, {{as well as several}} audio filters. Ten-second voice recordings can be also be recorded and edited. These can then be shared throughout other applications such as Swapnote. There is also a StreetPass function built-into the app, where users exchange song data to make a compatibility chart between them.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Switzerland, {{including}} at Nyon near Lake Geneva and at Godard's home in Rolle. Godard worked with minimal equipment and a small crew, including Aragno, Godard's assistant Jean-Paul Battaggia and a [...] "young man who ensures that the actors and props don't go missing and no passersby wander into the frame." [...] All the equipment fit into a single van and included two 3D cameras, a handheld camera which Godard operated, a <b>sound</b> <b>recorder</b> and an umbrella. Godard said that he prefers working with small crews instead of larger ones [...] "as there are for American films where {{they are allowed to}} have forty people. Because, if there are fewer of them, they feel too lonely." [...] The film's footage was shot over a four-year period.|$|E
