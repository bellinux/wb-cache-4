5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though not as much as the grey <b>sharpnose</b> shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian <b>sharpnose</b> shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|E
5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, tunas, and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and <b>sharpnose</b> sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not place {{it close to}} any other member of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the <b>sharpnose</b> sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E

5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark forms large aggregations {{segregated}} by sex, {{with the}} males generally found {{deeper than the}} females. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, including sea catfish, croakers, jacks, and grunts. Shrimp, crabs, and squid are secondary food sources, while adults are also capable of taking young <b>sharpnose</b> sharks (Rhizoprionodon), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and stingrays (Dasyatis). Opportunistic in habits, the dietary composition of this shark generally reflects what is most available in its environment; off northern Brazil, the most important prey species are the croakers Macrodon ancylodon and Stellifer naso. Juveniles consume {{a wider variety of}} prey than adults. In turn, the smalltail shark may potentially be preyed upon by larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and <b>sharpnose</b> sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
50|$|The Rainbow sardine (Dussumieria acuta), {{also known}} as Common sprat, Dwarf round herring, Rainbow herring, and <b>Sharpnosed</b> sprat , is a bony fish {{important}} to aquaculture and commercial fisheries.|$|R
40|$|EnA {{specimen}} of <b>sharpnosed</b> skate Dipturus oxyrinchus (Linnaeus, 1758) presenting snout and tail abnormalities was captured off the Syrian coast. It is an adult female with a shortened and rounded snout, lack of second dorsal fin and a reduced and rounded caudal fin. This abnormal specimen {{is described in}} the present note, and it appears that both snout and tail abnormalities did not affect their development and they reached similar parameters and swimming activities than the normal ones...|$|R
5|$|The {{litter size}} ranges {{from one to}} eight, with two to five being typical, {{increasing}} with female size. In Omanese waters, females on average outnumber males in a litter by more than 2:1, and all-female litters are not uncommon. Similar but less extreme sex imbalances have also been reported from litters of milk sharks off Senegal and eastern India. The reason for this imbalance is unknown, {{and it has not}} been observed in related species such as the Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> shark (R. terraenovae). Gestation of the embryos takes around a year and proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, lasting two months to an embryonic length of , the embryo relies on yolk for sustenance and gas exchange occurs across its surface integument and possibly also the yolk sac. During the second phase, which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of , the external gill filaments develop and the yolk sac begins to be resorbed, the embyo ingesting histotroph (a nutritious substance secreted by the mother) in the meantime. In the third phase, lasting six to eight months, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the fetus receives nourishment until birth.|$|E
25|$|The broadnose sevengill shark is {{also known}} as sevengill shark or simply sevengill and was {{formerly}} known as cow shark and mud shark; it is called sevengill due to its seven gill slits. Because of this, it was listed along with the <b>sharpnose</b> sevengill shark by Guinness World Records as having the most gill slits. It is similar to the <b>sharpnose</b> sevengill shark but the latter has a pointed snout and lacks spots on its dorsal surface. The sevengill species are also related to ancient sharks as fossils from the Jurassic Period (200 to 145 million years ago) also had seven gills.|$|E

2500|$|The City of Lubbock has {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a major reservoir that would [...] impound waters of the North Fork northeast of Post, creating a reservoir roughly 60% of the size of Lake Alan Henry, another city reservoir that impounds waters of the Double Mountain Fork. The proposed Post Reservoir is a key feature in the 2012 State Water Plan for the Llano Estacado Regional Water Planning Area, which encompasses 21 counties on the high plains of the Llano Estacado. [...] The construction of this controversial reservoir would likely lead to the extinction of two rare species of prairie fish - the smalleye shiner and the <b>sharpnose</b> shiner.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> sharks can {{be found}} {{as far north as}} New Brunswick, Canada, to as far south as the {{southern}} Gulf of Mexico. Reports of specimens from Brazil are likely being confused with the Brazilian <b>sharpnose</b> shark. Atlantic <b>sharpnose</b> sharks prefer to live in warmer shallow coastal waters.
