40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of mechanical soft reduction of steel billets with liquid core on the internal quality of billets, casting and soft reduction experiments were carried out.

Critical challenges on DSA <b>hole</b> <b>shrink</b> and multiplication include critical dimension uniformity (CDU) and placement errors. In this study we will demonstrate {{the impact of the}} conventional lithography step and variations in the template shape on the pattern placement and CDU of the DSA holes. We will focus on the formation of singlets (i. e. contact <b>hole</b> <b>shrink),</b> and doublets. Conventional lithography techniques (ArF or EUV) are used to create a pre-pattern that guides the phase separation process. After surface modification, a polystyrene-b-methyl methacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) is deposited in the templates and annealed at elevated temperature. Annealing results in a phase separation of the polymer into cylindrical patterns (Figure 1). After removing the minority block (in this case PMMA), this pattern is transferred in an underlying SiN layer for pattern placement and CDU characterization. The higher resolution of EUV enables template shape control. This is expected to give a pattern placement improvement. In addition, the templates can be pre-shaped to more commensurate shapes than ellipses (e. g. in peanuts), which is expected to further reduce placement errors. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|A Fermi {{accelerator}} is a billiard with oscillating walls. A leaky accelerator {{interacts with}} {{an environment of}} an ideal gas at equilibrium by exchange of particles through a small hole on its boundary. Such interaction may heat the gas: we estimate the net energy flow through the hole {{under the assumption that}} the particles inside the billiard do not collide with each other and remain in the accelerator for sufficiently long time. The heat production is found to depend strongly on the type of the Fermi accelerator. An ergodic accelerator, i. e. one which has a single ergodic component, produces a weaker energy flow than a multi-component accelerator. Specifically, in the ergodic case the energy gain is independent of the hole size, whereas in the multi-component case the energy flow may be significantly increased by <b>shrinking</b> the <b>hole</b> size.

40|$|The {{basal area}} (Cu-Cu grid) of the cuprate superconductors not only tends to <b>shrink</b> on <b>hole</b> doping, as {{expected}} from single electron quantum chemistry, but exhibits also an electronically incompressible "hump'' around optimum doping n_opt = 0. 16. The hump collapses near critical doping n_crit = 0. 19. We analyze {{the origin of}} the hump in terms of a classical liquid of interacting incompressible particles in a container with antiferromagnetic walls. Oxygen holes interacting with the wall form singlets, protect themselves against other holes by an incompressible "spin fence'', and thus interact also with the lattice. Occupation of the CuO_ 2 lattice with holes must therefore follow a non-double-occupant constraint also for the oxygen cage enclosing the copper hole. Closest packing of self-protecting singlets is found to occur around critical doping; closest packing of paired self-protecting singlets around optimum doping. These singlet-states are bosonic, but are not magnetic polarons. Comment: reviewed version, 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
