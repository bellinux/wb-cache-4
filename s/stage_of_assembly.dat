Currently in the automotive industry, flexibility and adaptability of assembly systems are mainly considered as the capability to assemble a family of products. The notion of assembly system flexibility, as understood from the point of view of error compensation by upstream processes, has not been widely researched. This paper presents a systematic method of flexible/adaptive assembly system evaluation, based on its ability to compensate for part dimensional variability caused by upstream processes. This allows for the expansion of the present design for manufacturability approaches by applying multivariate analysis and fixture diagnostic techniques.

40|$|Abstract—A {{persistent}} {{challenge in}} evolutionary robotics is {{the transfer of}} evolved morphologies from simulation to reality, especially when these morphologies comprise complex geometry with embedded active elements. Here we present a process that automatically evolves target structures based on functional requirements and plans the error-free assembly of these structures from {{a large number of}} active components. Evolution is conducted by minimizing the strain energy in a structure due to prescribed loading conditions. Thereafter, assembly is planned by sampling the space of all possible paths to the target structure and following those that leave the most options open. Each sample begins with the final completed structure and removes one accessible component at a time until the existing substructure is recovered. Thus, at least one path to a complete target structure is guaranteed at every <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>assembly.</b> Automating the entire process represents a step towards an interactive evolutionary design and fabrication paradigm, similar to that seen in nature.

40|$|AbstractDengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped flavivirus with a positive-sense RNA genome {{transmitted}} by Aedes mosquitoes, causing {{the most important}} arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans. Relatively few cis-acting RNA regulatory elements have been described in the DENV coding-region. Here, by introducing silent mutations into a DENV- 2 infectious clone, we identify the conserved capsid-coding region 1 (CCR 1), an RNA sequence element that regulates viral replication in mammalian cells and {{to a greater extent}} in Ae. albopictus mosquito cells. These defects were confirmed in vivo, resulting in decreased replication in Ae. aegypti mosquito bodies and dissemination to the salivary glands. Furthermore, CCR 1 does not regulate translation, RNA synthesis or virion retention but likely modulates assembly, as mutations resulted in the release of non-infectious viral particles from both cell types. Understanding the role of CCR 1 could help characterize the poorly-defined <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>assembly</b> in the DENV life cycle and uncover novel anti-viral targets...|$|E

In this paper we {{address the problem of}} gravitational stability of assemblies of frictionless rigid bodies. Solution methods to the problems of determining if an assembly is stable, and finding a stable orientation for a given assembly are proposed. The solution methods for the two problems compute constrained motions of individual parts that decrease gravitational potential energy, in order to determine stability and search for stable orientations. Linear programming is used to obtain numerical solutions. The problem of finding a stable orientation is formulated as a maximin problem. The solution to this problem is the first general method for automatically determining stable orientations. The program to solve the two problems takes as input a geometric model of the assembly and information related to [...] ...|$|E
