5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final <b>structural</b> <b>process</b> is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{invisible}} college is a key focus of scientific communication research with many studies on this topic in the literature. However, while such studies have contributed {{to an understanding of}} the invisible college, they have not adequately explained the interaction of social and <b>structural</b> <b>processes</b> in this phenomenon. As a consequence, past research has described the invisible college differently based on researchers’ perspectives, resulting in misinterpretations or inconsistent definitions of the relevant social and <b>structural</b> <b>processes.</b> Information science and related disciplines have focused on the <b>structural</b> <b>processes</b> that lead to scholarly products or works while placing less emphasis on the social processes. To advance understanding of the invisible college and its dimensions (including both social <b>processes</b> and <b>structural</b> <b>processes),</b> a proposed model (Modern Invisible College Model, MICM) has been built based on the history of the invisible college and Lievrouw’s (1989) distinction between social and <b>structural</b> <b>processes.</b> The present study focuses on the social processes of informal communication between scholars via social media, rather than on the <b>structural</b> <b>processes</b> that lead to scholarly products or works. A developed survey and an employed quantitative research method were applied for data collection. The research population involved 77 scholars from the Institute of Public Administration (IPA), in Saudi Arabia. Descriptive statistics, frequency and percentage were conducted for each statement. Means and standard deviations were calculated. The results indicate that the majority of participants heavily use social media for scientific communication purposes. Also, the results confirm that scholars consider social media to be an effective and appropriate tool for scientific communication. Seven factors were found in the findings to have positive correlations with uses and gratifications theory and the use of social media. This research contributes to and benefits scholars, reference groups (i. e., the invisible college itself), and institutions, and provides insight about the systematic development of indices for the use of informal communication channels...|$|R

Differential scanning calorimetry method has shown that this alloy crystallizes in one stage, in temperature range from room temperature up to 700 °C. <b>Structural</b> relaxation <b>process</b> was investigated by sensitive dilatation method in nonisothermal and isothermal conditions. It {{has been shown that}} <b>structural</b> relaxation <b>process</b> occurs in two stages by measuring thermal expansion at constant temperatures of t 1 = 420 °C, t 2 = 440 °C and t 3 = 460 °C.

The second stage of <b>structural</b> relaxation <b>process</b> is characterized by linear dependence of isothermal expansion upon the square root of process time. These results imply that the first stage of <b>structural</b> relaxation <b>process</b> is a rapid kinetic process, while the second stage of <b>structural</b> relaxation <b>process</b> is a slow diffusion process.

This is accomplished through dedicating time and effort to developing (by consensus) a procedural structure for any discussion prior to beginning the actual discussion.
