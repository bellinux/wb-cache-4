40|$|A widely {{accepted}} regulatory mechanism in maintaining hormone homeostasis involves negative or positive feedback control of biosynthetic genes through signal transduction pathways triggered by hormones. For brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis, the antagonistic relationship between signaling and biosynthetic pathways {{has been well}} characterized. We have identified a transcriptional regulator, RAV-Like 1, which activates both a BR receptor gene (BRI 1) and BR <b>synthetic</b> <b>genes</b> (D 2, D 11 and BRD 1). RAVL 1 possesses a B 3 DNA binding domain that exhibits differential affinity for E-box elements in the promoters of BRI 1, D 2, D 11 and BRD 1. Semi-dwarfism and BR-insensitive phenotypes are exhibited by ravl 1 mutants. Genetic {{studies have demonstrated that}} expression alteration of BRI 1 and BR <b>synthetic</b> <b>genes</b> by RAVL 1 results in changes in BR sensitivity. BZR 1 is a negative regulator involved in BR feedback mechanisms. To examine the relationship between RAVL 1 and BZR 1, expression of the common target gene BRD 1 was examined using a transient transcription assay. The suppression of BRD 1 by BZR 1 is epistatic to activation by RAVL 1. More importantly, RAVL 1 is not subject to BR feedback regulation. Taken together, this data indicates that RAVL 1 is involved in maintaining the basal activity of BRI 1 and BR <b>synthetic</b> <b>genes,</b> which ensures that the basal levels of the hormone are produced.

50|$|In sexually-reproducing species, most {{genes are}} present in two copies (which can be {{different}} alleles or not), {{each of which has}} a 50% chance of being inherited.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the distribution of cobalamin (coenzyme B(12)) synthetic ability and cobalamin-dependent metabolism among enteric bacteria. Most species of enteric bacteria tested synthesize cobalamin under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and ferment glycerol in a cobalamin-dependent fashion. The group of species including Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium cannot ferment glycerol. E. coli strains cannot synthesize cobalamin de novo, and Salmonella spp. synthesize cobalamin only under anaerobic conditions. In addition, the cobalamin <b>synthetic</b> <b>genes</b> of Salmonella spp. (cob) show a regulatory pattern {{different from that of}} other enteric taxa tested. We propose that the cobalamin <b>synthetic</b> <b>genes,</b> as well as genes providing cobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase, were lost by a common ancestor of E. coli and Salmonella spp. and were reintroduced as a single fragment into the Salmonella lineage from an exogenous source. Consistent with this hypothesis, the S. typhimurium cob genes do not hybridize with the genomes of other enteric species.
