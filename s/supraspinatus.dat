5|$|At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Brazil {{finished}} 4th in the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle, in a relay {{composed by}} Bruno Fratus, Marcelo Chierighini, Matheus Santana and João de Lucca. César Cielo didn't {{swim in the}} final – despite being {{a participant in the}} championship, he was suffering with shoulder pain. According to the doctor of the Brazilian Aquatic Sports Confederation (CBDA), Gustavo Magliocca, Cielo had an inflammation of the <b>supraspinatus</b> tendon. The injury is considered common in the athletes, and it was being treated with physiotherapy. Due to the problem, in the Men's 50 metre butterfly, Cielo struggled though the heats and the semifinals, but slumped to 6th in the final. On August 5, Cielo left the competition due to the increase of his injury.|$|E
25|$|The tendons of the rotator cuff, not the muscles, {{are most}} {{commonly}} involved, {{and of the}} four, the <b>supraspinatus</b> is most frequently affected, as it passes below the acromion. The role of the <b>supraspinatus</b> is to resist downward motion. The <b>supraspinatus</b> resists downward motion while the shoulder is relaxed as well as when carrying weight. Such a tear usually occurs at its point of insertion onto the humeral head at the greater tubercle. Even though the <b>supraspinatus</b> is the most commonly injured muscle of the four muscles in the rotator cuff, the other three muscles that comprise the rotator cuff, the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, may also be injured.|$|E
25|$|Rehabilitation {{after surgery}} {{consists}} of three stages. First, the arm is immobilized so that the muscle can heal. Second, when appropriate, a therapist assists with passive exercises to regain range of motion. Third, the arm is gradually exercised actively, with a goal of regaining and enhancing strength. Yoshitsugu Takeda {{and his team have}} recently studied rotator cuff injuries and rehab exercises that target the <b>supraspinatus.</b> As mentioned earlier, the <b>supraspinatus</b> muscle is the muscle and tendon within the rotator cuff that is most often injured. In order to rehab the <b>supraspinatus</b> and combat future injuries in the rotator cuff, Takeda’s team has concluded that the empty can and full can exercises are most effective at isolating and strengthening the <b>supraspinatus.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most {{morphological}} {{changes and}} injuries are sustained to the <b>supraspinatus</b> tendon. Traumatic rotator cuff changes are often located antero-superior, meanwhile degenerative changes more likely are supero-posterior.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in pennation angle following full-thickness tendon tears {{will result in}} a change to the PCSA of the <b>supraspinatus</b> and infraspinutus muscles. This would reduce the force producing capacity of these muscles. However, partial tendon tears, which did not result in a change to pennation in any of the rotator cuff muscles, may not impair the force producing properties of the muscles. Azizi’s observations on variable gearing in pennate muscles further suggests tendon tears will affect the AGR of the <b>supraspinatus</b> and infraspinutus. The greater pennation angle could result in an increased AGR.|$|E
25|$|While using MRI, true lesions at the rotator {{interval}} region {{between the}} parts of the <b>supraspinatus</b> and subscapularis are all but impossible to distinguish from normal synovium and capsule.|$|E
25|$|The supraspinous fossa, {{the smaller}} of the two, is concave, smooth, and broader at its {{vertebral}} than at its humeral end; its medial two-thirds give origin to the <b>Supraspinatus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} {{comprises}} four pennate muscles, the <b>supraspinatus,</b> infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor, and their accompanying tendons. These muscles form a cuff around the glenohumeral joint and function to stabilize and manipulate the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder {{problems}} including pain {{are common}} problems, and {{can relate to}} any of the structures within the shoulder. The primary cause of shoulder pain is a rotator cuff tear. The <b>supraspinatus</b> is most commonly involved in a rotator cuff tear.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of the <b>supraspinatus</b> fossa and {{the upper part of the}} infraspinatous fossa, but {{especially}} the former, are usually so thin in humans as to be semitransparent; occasionally the bone is found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles are separated only by fibrous tissue.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} suggest patch grafts {{ought to}} be applied to irreparable rotator cuff tears. Though this practice lessens pain, muscle strength is not fully recovered. The abovementioned human rotator cuff study correlates pennation angle with tear length in the <b>supraspinatus</b> muscle. Therefore, a patch graft may not resolve the length change necessary to restore pennation angle; retraction of the torn tendon may lessen the post-tear pennation angle and restore muscle strength to a greater extent.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that no single physical examination test distinguishes reliably between bursitis, partial-thickness, and full-thickness tears. On the contrary, a combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For impingement, these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign in which the examiner medially rotates the patient's flexed arm, forcing the <b>supraspinatus</b> tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} is an {{anatomical}} term {{given to the}} group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the <b>supraspinatus,</b> infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches {{to the head of the}} humerus. Together, these keep the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the humeral head caused by the pull of the deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The infraspinatus and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{shoulder}} injuries to cricketers is a result of fielding. Overuse of the shoulder when throwing repeatedly during fielding in a cricket game can lead to problems such as tendinitis in the biceps, a tear of the <b>supraspinatus</b> tendon or even degenerative changes to the rotator cuff which could result in a surgery to fix the tear. Impingement, a syndrome that occurs when the rotator cuff muscles are inflamed or irritated, is a major injury risk that can develop amongst bowlers. A 2001–2002 study focused on identifying a workload threshold that would avoid an increased risk in shoulder injuries. The study found that bowlers who produced an average of 123–188 deliveries per week were less likely to face injury whereas bowlers who averaged below 123 deliveries or above 188 deliveries per week were at a greater risk of causing injury.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, <b>supraspinatus,</b> and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{study on}} human cadaveric {{shoulders}} suggests tendon tears {{may affect the}} pennation angle of the rotator cuff muscles. Researchers compared pennation angle between a control group and tear groups comprising either partial or complete-thickness tendon tears. Via dissection of ten injured and ten non-injured cadeveric shoulders, the study discovered a correlation between tendon tear size {{and an increase in}} pennation angle among two of the rotator cuff muscles. Pennation angle remained unaffected across all rotator cuff muscles in the partial tendon tear group, suggesting a threshold tear size must be exceeded to produce any changes in pennation angle. Full-thickness tendon tears did not affect the pennation angle of the subscapularis or teres minor muscles. However, a correlation between full-thickness rotator cuff tear size and the pennation angle of the supraspnatus and infraspinatus muscles was evident. The length of the full-thickness tendon tear strongly correlated with an increase in the pennation angle of the <b>supraspinatus</b> muscle. In addition, a moderately strong association between the area of the full-thickness tear and the resulting increase in pennation angle of the infraspinatus was visible.|$|E

2500|$|The cuff is {{responsible}} for stabilizing the glenohumeral joint, abducting, externally rotating, and internally rotating the humerus. [...] When shoulder trauma occurs, these functions can be compromised. [...] Because individuals are highly dependent on the shoulder for many activities, overuse of the muscles can lead to tears, the vast majority again occurring in the <b>supraspinatus</b> tendon.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "rotator cuff" [...] {{refers to}} a group of four tendons that blend {{together}} as they attach to {{the upper end of the}} arm bone (humerus). Normally these tendons transmit the force of muscles originating on the shoulder Blase (scapula) to the arm providing motion and stability. The most commonly affected tendon is that of the <b>supraspinatus</b> muscle.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{injury is}} less {{frequent}} than chronic disease, but may follow bouts of forcefully raising the arm against resistance, as occurs in weightlifting, for example. [...] In addition, falling forcefully {{on the shoulder}} can cause acute symptoms. [...] These traumatic tears predominantly affect the <b>supraspinatus</b> tendon or the rotator interval and symptoms include severe pain that radiates through the arm, and limited range of motion, specifically during abduction of the shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|The four tendons {{of these}} muscles {{converge}} {{to form the}} rotator cuff tendon. [...] This tendon, along with the articular capsule, the coracohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral ligament complex, blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities. [...] The infraspinatus and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions, while the <b>supraspinatus</b> and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon {{at the entrance of}} the bicipital groove.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} glenohumeral joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. [...] It is a {{ball and socket joint}} that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. [...] The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the {{shoulder joint}} and contribute to the shoulder's stability. The muscles of the rotator cuff are <b>supraspinatus,</b> subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head.|$|E
2500|$|A gentle, passive range-of-motion {{program should}} be started to help prevent {{stiffness}} and maintain range of motion during this resting period. Exercises, for the anterior, inferior, and posterior shoulder, {{should be part of}} this program. Codman exercises (giant, pudding-stirring), to [...] "permit the patient to abduct the arm by gravity, the <b>supraspinatus</b> remains relaxed, and no fulcrum is required" [...] are widely used. The use of NSAIDs, hot and cold packs, and physical therapy modalities, such as ultrasound, phonophoresis, or iontophoresis, can be instituted during this stretching period, if effective. [...] Corticosteroid injections are recommended two to three months apart with a maximum of three injections. Multiple injections (four or more) have been shown to compromise the results of rotator cuff surgery which result in weakening of the tendon. However, before any rotator cuff strengthening can be started, the shoulder must have a full range of motion.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the <b>supraspinatus</b> and infraspinatus. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{etiology}} of subluxation in post-stroke patients is unclear but {{appears to be}} caused by weakness of the musculature supporting the shoulder joint. [...] The shoulder {{is one of the most}} mobile joints in the body. [...] To provide a high level of mobility the shoulder sacrifices ligamentous stability and as a result relies on the surrounding musculature (i.e., rotator cuff muscles, latissimus dorsi, and deltoid) for much of its support. [...] This is in contrast to other less mobile joints such as the knee and hip, which have a significant amount of support from the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments. [...] If a stroke damages the upper motor neurons controlling muscles of the upper limb, weakness and paralysis, followed by spasticity occurs in a somewhat predictable pattern. [...] The muscles supporting the shoulder joint, particularly the <b>supraspinatus</b> and posterior deltoid become flaccid and can no longer offer adequate support leading to a downward and outward movement of arm at the shoulder joint causing tension on the relatively weak joint capsule. [...] Other factors have also been cited as contributing to subluxation such as pulling on the hemiplegic arm and improper positioning.|$|E
2500|$|From {{this type}} of {{research}} it has been inferred that whiplash symptoms might not always have any pathological (injury) explanation. [...] However, over the last decade, academic surgeons in the UK and US have sought to unravel the whiplash enigma. [...] A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the [...] "missing link" [...] in whiplash injuries is the trapezius muscle which may be damaged through eccentric muscle contraction during the whiplash mechanism described above and below. [...] Another study suggested that [...] "shneck pain" [...] was in the nearby <b>supraspinatus</b> muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident. [...] Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement {{during the day and}} night time. [...] All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck. [...] Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.|$|E
