40|$|In October 1998, the San Antonio River Tunnel project {{experienced}} {{its largest}} flood to date. During that event the Removable <b>Splitter</b> <b>Wall</b> (RSW) vortex suppression device was damaged: The lower two panels apparently vibrated and broke due to fatigue. The RSW {{was comprised of}} nine 25 -ft long, by 6 -ft high and I 1 -in thick panels. Each panel was constructed of reinforced concrete with a C-channel framing the each edge. According to Corps of Engineers staff, structural engineers have determined that the failures, each at approximately the third points, were characteristic of a fatigue failure (Photo 1). From Photo 2 of the panels being lifted from the inlet shaft, the panels broke approximately 9 feet from the downstream end. The points of failure were also reported {{to coincide with the}} lifting holes for the panels. Halff Associates, Inc.; US Army Corps of Engineer...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{mechanical system}} in advanced hypersonic engines is the panel-edge seal system that seals {{gaps between the}} articulating horizontal engine panels and the adjacent engine <b>splitter</b> <b>walls.</b> Significant advancements in seal technology are required to meet the extreme demands placed on the seals, including the simultaneous requirements of low leakage, conformable, high temperature, high pressure, sliding operation. In this investigation, the seal concept design and development of two new seal classes that show promise of meeting these demands will be presented. These seals include the ceramic wafer seal and the braided ceramic rope seal. Presented are key elements of leakage flow models {{for each of these}} seal types. Flow models such as these help designers to predict performance-robbing parasitic losses past the seals, and estimate purge coolant flow rates. Comparisons are made between measured and predicted leakage rates over a wide range of engine simulated temperatures and pressures, showing good agreement...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{mechanical system}} in advanced hypersonic engines is the panel-edge seal system that seals {{gaps between the}} articulating engine panels and the adjacent engine <b>splitter</b> <b>walls.</b> Significant advancements in seal technology are required to meet the extreme demands placed on the seals, including the simultaneous requirements of low leakage, conformable, high temperature, high pressure, sliding operation. In this investigation, the design, development, analytical and experimental evaluation of a new ceramic wafer seal that shows promise of meeting these demands will be addressed. A high temperature seal test fixture was designed and fabricated to measure static seal leakage performance under engine simulated conditions. Ceramic wafer seal leakage rates are presented for engine-simulated air pressure differentials (up to 100 psi), and temperature (up to 1350 F), sealing both flat and distorted wall conditions, where distortions can be as large as 0. 15 inches in only an 18 inch span. Seal leakage rates are low, meeting an industry-established tentative leakage limit for all combinations of temperature, pressure and wall conditions considered. A seal leakage model developed from externally-pressurized gas film bearing theory is also presented. Predicted leakage rates agree favorably with the measured data for nearly all conditions of temperature and pressure. Discrepancies noted at high engine pressure and temperature are attributed to thermally-induced, non-uniform changes in {{the size and shape}} of the leakage gap condition. The challenging thermal environment the seal must operate in places considerable demands on the seal concept and material selection. Of the many high temperature materials considered in the design, ceramics were the only materials that met the many challenging seal material design requirements. Of the aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, and silicon nitride ceramics considered in the material ranking scheme developed herein, the silicon nitride class of ceramics ranked the highest because of their high temperature strength; resistance to the intense heating rates; resistance to hydrogen damage; and good structural properties. Baseline seal feasibility has been established through the research conducted in this investigation. Recommendations for future work are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:This paper proposes new {{shorter and}} {{efficient}} designs {{by means of}} laboratory experimentation as compared to USBR type VI stilling basin models. The models are tested on 4 cm x 4 cm square opening (d = 4 cm) for Froude number (Fr) = 6. 83 with a diverging side walls at a slope of 1 V: 0. 8 H. Appurtenances of several shapes and sizes like <b>splitter</b> block, impact <b>wall,</b> baffle blocks, intermediate sill, and end sills are tested in the laboratory at different locations. It {{has been found that}} a row of wedge shaped block quite is helpful in spreading the jet of water in a shorter length of basin with diverging side walls, resulting into better and more energy dissipation. It was found that the length of stilling basin models can be reduced (12. 9 d to 10. 9 d) i. e. by more than 15 % as compared to USBR impact type VI stilling basin model...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the noise generation mechanisms is prerequisite to reducing aircraft jet noise. A computationally intensive large eddy simulation (LES) can help directly predict the noise. For this purpose, the Ansys-Fluent LES tool is evaluated for its modeling accuracy and computational cost. A satisfactory computational methodology is developed first by studying a canonical problem. A mixing layer at a Reynolds number of 720 is simulated using LES in two- and three-dimensions without the <b>splitter</b> plate <b>walls</b> and is studied extensively to gain insights of the flow physics. The effects of inflow-forcing and the buffer-zone at the domain exit incorporated in 2 -D LES are investigated. The flow is damped in the buffer zone without explicitly introducing the damping terms and {{is found to be}} satisfactory for the current work. The instabilities of the 2 -D mixing layer are captured well using random inflow-forcing. The buffer-zone is found to help the prediction of the Reynolds stresses near the exit boundary. The sensitivity of the 2 -D results to timestep, sampling time and grid is also studied. The 2 -D grid is, then, optimized to construct a mesh for 3 -D LES. The deficiencies of Fluentâ€™s in-built vortex method (VM) algorithm to force perturbations in 3 -D are discussed. An adapted VM algorithm is implemented and is found to predict the three-dimensional instabilities of the mixing layer well. The energy spectrum of the LES computations indicate that the second-order-accurate bounded central differencing scheme, used in the present study, is adequate for modeling turbulent flows. The computational resources to perform a realistic jet simulation are also estimated. ...|$|R
40|$|The Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop brought {{together}} an international community of computational fluid dynamicists {{as a step}} in defining {{the state of the}} art in computational aeroelasticity. This workshop's technical focus was prediction of unsteady pressure distributions resulting from forced motion, benchmarking the results first using unforced system data. The most challenging aspects of the physics were identified as capturing oscillatory shock behavior, dynamic shock-induced separated flow and tunnel wall boundary layer influences. The majority of the participants used unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes codes. These codes were exercised at transonic Mach numbers for three configurations and comparisons were made with existing experimental data. Substantial variations were observed among the computational solutions as well as differences relative to the experimental data. Contributing issues to these differences include wall effects and wall modeling, non-standardized convergence criteria, inclusion of static aeroelastic deflection, methodology for oscillatory solutions, post-processing methods. Contributing issues pertaining principally to the experimental data sets include the position of the model relative to the tunnel <b>wall,</b> <b>splitter</b> plate size, wind tunnel expansion slot configuration, spacing and location of pressure instrumentation, and data processing methods...|$|R
40|$|The steady, {{asymmetric}} and {{two-dimensional flow}} of viscous, incompressible micropolar fluid through a rectangular channel with a <b>splitter</b> (parallel to <b>walls)</b> was formulated and simulated numerically. The plane Poiseuille flow was considered far from {{upstream and downstream}} of the splitter. The geometric parameter that controls the position of splitter was defined as splitter position parameter. A numerical scheme that comprises a fourth order method followed by special finite-difference method was used to solve the boundary value problem. This numerical scheme transforms the governing equations to system of finite difference equations which we have solved by SOR iterative method. Moreover, the results obtained were further refined and upgraded by the Richardson extrapolation method. The results were compared on different grid sizes {{as well as with}} the existing results for symmetric flow of Newtonian fluids. The comparisons were satisfactory. The microrotation effects on the splitter plate were significantly high as compared to other locations of the channel. This highest value for the asymmetric channel was higher in magnitude as compared to for the symmetric one. Furthermore, the proclivity of rotation of aciculate elements of the fluid about their centroids rises if either the Reynolds' number increases or/and the distance between the upper and splitter plates decreases...|$|R
