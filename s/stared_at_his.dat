Over the preceding weeks, the WWF aired vignettes of Backlund training for this match. Hart won the match, capitalizing after Backlund mistakenly believed he had won and helped Hart to his feet. Backlund [...] "snapped" [...] after Hart repeatedly tried to offer a sportsmanlike handshake following the match. He slapped Hart {{in the face and}} locked him in the crossface chickenwing submission hold, while screaming hysterically. After finally releasing the hold, Backlund <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hands in apparent shock. Backlund then started to regularly [...] "snap" [...] in similar fashion during his matches, viciously attacking his opponent with the crossface chickenwing and refusing to release it after the opponent submitted. He would then seemingly snap back to normal and appear horrified by what he had done.|$|E
