These enzymes are present from prokaryotes to humans, and their glycoconjugate products are often vital for survival of the organism. Many glycosyltransferases found in fungal pathogens such as Cryptococcus neoformans do not exist in mammalian systems, making them attractive potential targets for <b>selectively</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>agents.</b> In this article, we present the features of this diverse class of enzymes, and review the fungal glycosyltransferases {{that are involved in}} synthesis of the cell wall, the cryptococcal capsule, glycoproteins and glycolipids. We specifically focus on enzymes that have been identified or studied in C. neoformans, and we consider future directions for research on glycosyltransferases {{in the context of this}} opportunistic pathogen...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{methodology}} to evaluate if there is a relation between two code characteristics. The methodology is based on relative risk, an epidemiology formula used to analyze the effect of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> in developing diseases. We present a metaphor in which the disease is changeability decay, measured at method level, and the <b>toxic</b> <b>agent</b> is a source code characteristic considered harmful. However, the formula assesses the strength of the relation between any <b>toxic</b> <b>agent</b> and any disease. We apply the methodology to explore cloning as a <b>toxic</b> <b>agent</b> that increases the risk of changeability decay. Cloning is a good agent to analyze given that although there is some evidence of maintainability issues caused by clones, we do not know which clones are harmful, or to what extent. We compare cloning with other possible 'toxic agents', like having high complexity or having high fan-in. We also use the technique to evaluate which clone characteristics (like clone size) may indicate harmful clones, by testing such characteristics as <b>toxic</b> <b>agents.</b> We found that cloning is one of the method characteristics that affects the least changeability decay, and that none of the clone characteristics analyzed are related with changeability decay...|$|R

Methods: Com-pounds identified in the screen were further analyzed by use of yeast and vertebrate cell-based and in vitro assays to distinguish between topoisomerase I and II poisons. Results: Of the more than 85 000 compounds screened, 126 were se-lectively toxic to yeast deficient in DNA double-strand break repair.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether {{the lack of}} knowledge of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> in households is a risk factor for individual unintentional childhood poisoning. Methods: The case group (n = 25) was composed of caregivers of children under 60 months of age who underwent accidental oral poisoning and were treated at two reference hospitals in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, and recorded in the Toxicology Information Center database. The control group (n = 25) was composed of caregivers of children matched for sex, age, and presence in their homes of the same <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> found in the case group, who sought emergency medical care at the same hospitals, but for other reasons. A structured questionnaire was administered to verify the following questions: sociodemographic data, clinical history, behavioral antecedents of caregivers, storage of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents,</b> history of previous poisoning accidents. Results: The children’s mean age was 31. 8 months (± 0. 97) and mean height was 93 cm (± 11). Families, in both groups, were aware of the <b>toxic</b> action of <b>agents</b> available in their homes; however, caregivers in the control group were twice as likely to have such knowledge compared to the case group. Distraction was 15 times more likely to occur among caregivers of children who underwent poisoning compared to the control group. Storage of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> below 150 cm was approximately 17 times more likely to occur in the group of children who underwent poisoning compared to children in the control group. Conclusions: Lack of knowledge of the <b>toxic</b> action of <b>agents</b> stored in households is not a risk factor for childhood poisoning. The attributable risks described in this study indicated that the elimination of other factors, such as distraction and storage below 150 cm, would lead to the prevention of 13 and 19 % of poisonings in childhood, respectively...|$|R
