50|$|Avro was not {{the only}} company to see the {{potential}} for a DC-3 replacement, and by this point work on the 748's direct competitor, the Fokker F27 Friendship turboprop, was well advanced. Avro therefore decided to compete by producing a more rugged design with better short-field performance, allowing it to operate from smaller airports and those with rough surfaces. This was accomplished with a long, high lift wing and a unique single <b>slot</b> <b>flap</b> with a hinged flap tab at the trailing edge. The wing was mounted low on the fuselage with dihedral from the root, allowing good overall ground clearance and easy mounting of strong durable landing gear. Other features of the 748 included an internal engine starting system, and systems and structures that were designed to be easy to inspect and repair in the field with limited equipment. The 748 {{was one of the first}} medium-sized aircraft to use fail-safe design principles in the structure, instead of the then common safe-life principles. Because of these features, the 748 quickly became popular (and still is today) with a variety of airlines operating in remote areas thanks to its ability to haul payloads of over 10,000 lbs in and out of short rough fields with little to no ground service equipment.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics is used to provide a proof of concept for controlled flow separation using thermal wall interactions with the velocity boundary layer. A 3 D case study is presented, using a transition modeling Shear Stress Transport turbulence model. The highly loaded single <b>slot</b> <b>flap</b> airfoil was chosen to be representative for a light aircraft and the flow conditions were modeled after a typical landing speed. In the baseline case, adiabatic walls were considered while in the separation control case, the top surface of the flaps was heated to 500 K. This heating lead to flow separation on the flaps and a significant alteration of the flow pattern across {{all the elements of}} the wing. The findings indicate that this control method has potential, with implications in both aeronautical as well as sports and civil engineering applications...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the LMAL 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of a NACA 23021 airfoil with a double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> having a chord 32 percent of the airfoil chord (0. 32 c) to determine the aerodynamic section characteristics with the flaps deflected at various positions. The effects of moving the fore flap and rear flap as a unit and of deflecting or removing the lower lip of the slot were also determined. Three positions were selected for the fore flap and at each position the maximum lift of the airfoil was obtained with the rear flap at the maximum deflection used at that fore-flap position. The section lift of the airfoil increased as the fore flap was extended and maximum lift was obtained with the fore flap deflected 30 deg in the most extended position. This arrangement provided a maximum section lift coefficient of 3. 31, which was higher than the value obtained with either a 0. 2566 c or a 0. 40 c single-slotted-flap arrangement and 0. 25 less than the value obtained with a 0. 4 c double-slotted-flap arrangement on the same airfoil. The values of the profile-drag coefficient obtained with the 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> were larger than those for the 0. 2566 c or 0. 40 c single <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> for section lift coefficients between 1. 0 and approximately 2. 7. At all values of the section lift coefficient above 1. 0, the 0. 40 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> had a lower profile drag than the 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap.</b> At various values of the maximum section lift coefficient produced by various flap defections, the 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> gave negative section pitching-moment coefficients that were higher than those of other <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> on the same airfoil. The 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> gave approximately the same maximum section lift coefficient as, but higher profile-drag coefficients over the entire lift range than, a similar arrangement of a 0. 30 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> on an NACA 23012 airfoil...|$|R

The usual effect of power in increasing the directional stability was also shown. Deflection of the single <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> produced negative dihedral effect, but increased the directional stability.

The results showed that the changes in lift and drag due to changes in flap span for both rectangular and tapered wings having partial-span <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> were similar to those for corresponding wings having partial-span split or plain flaps. For the two wings tested, higher values of maximum lift were obtained with center-section <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> than with tip-section <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> of the same size. The highest values of lift-drag ratio at maximum lift for the rectangular wing were obtained with center-section flaps and, for the tapered wing, with tip-section flaps.
