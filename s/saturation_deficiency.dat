40|$|A year-long {{data set}} {{measuring}} dissolved nutrient, particulate nutrient, and dissolved lignin phenol concentrations in several temperate Pacific Northwest rivers, shows {{a strong correlation}} between river discharge rates and nutrient concentrations during significant storm events following a long dry period. Furthermore, dissolved lignin concentrations increase with river discharge during autumn and winter storms; systematic changes to C/V, S/V, and Ad/Al (v) ratios indicate a mobilization of relatively more woody/gymnosperm-derived and degraded material during storm events. Results from this study suggest that a shallow nutrient-rich pool of particulate matter accumulates in watersheds during long dry periods; this nutrient-rich particulate matter degrades in surface soils, creating a pool of accumulated dissolved nutrients in surface soils during periods of soil-saturation deficiency. Surface runoff during autumn and winter storms mobilizes the nutrient-rich particulate pool, whereas dissolved nutrients are mobilized from soils once the soil <b>saturation</b> <b>deficiency</b> is alleviated. This pool of shallow soil nutrients, secondary to a deep soil pool sustaining base flow conditions, is exhausted with successive winter storms; by spring there is little to no response in river nutrient concentrations and a dilution of dissolved lignin concentrations with increased rainfall and river flow. ...|$|E
40|$|Water-loss in Paradesmus {{gracilis}} {{depends upon}} temperature and humidity, and {{is directly related}} to <b>saturation</b> <b>deficiency.</b> There is no evidence of any 'critical point' to indicate an epicuticular wax layer. Water is readily lost and taken up through the cuticle, the effect of the spiracles and of excretion being negligible. Despite great sensitivity to desiccation, there is nevertheless some degree of impermeability. The cuticle is in many ways similar to that of an insect: it is composed of a 'cuti-culin ' epicuticle, a 'tanned ' chitinous exocuticle, and a laminated endocuticle of two optically distinguishable layers. The outer endocuticle is strongly calcified. The cuticle is penetrated by pore canals and the ducts of dermal glands. The latter are concerned with the production of exo- and endocuticle, and the secretion of the poly-phenols which tan the protein of the exocuticle. The double hardening is probably a specialized condition of millipedes. Transpiration is almost quadrupled by extraction with hot, but not cold chloro-form, as the exocuticle is impregnated with lipoids which reduce permeability. These are secreted by epidermal and dermal gland cells, and pass up the pore canals an...|$|E
40|$|To the Editor, Celiac disease (CD) is {{associated}} with autoimmune disorders and immune deficits, such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [1]. CVID is a heterogeneous group of deficient antibody production diagnosed by well- stated criteria [2]. It may display infectious diarrhea [3] and its association with CD has been controversial, since villous atrophy {{may not always be}} improved by a gluten-free diet (GFD). This aspect has been clarified by Biagi et al who pointed out the possibility that the only suitable tool is the response to GFD [4]. Both CD and CVID show a family inheritance and inducible co-stimulator (ICOS, a genetic polymorphisms invoked for CD) has a crucial role in altered lymphocyte maturation characterizing CVID [5]. Nevertheless, the presence of CD in first-degree relatives of patients affected by CVID has never been detected. Therefore, we believe it is of interest to report the case of a 30 -year young male patient with CD whose sister suffered from CVID. Admitted to our Unit for acute diarrhea and fever, his family history revealed a sister affected by CVID, treated with periodic immunoglobulin replacement. Empiric rehydration and antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin 250 mg x 2 /day) induced rapid disappearance of symptoms. Laboratory tests excluded humoral immune deficiency, but showed folate, B 12 vitamin, iron and transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>deficiency.</b> So, we performed the anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium assay (positive) and upper endoscopy with distal duodenum histology (Marsh grade 3 A CD). A GFD was initiated and six months later laboratory and duodenal histology became normal. Accordingly, we believe that this case could stimulate a better knowledge of the topic. The principal point is the possibility that CD and CVID association may be observed not only in the same subject, but even in two different first-degree relatives. Moreover, it emphasizes some other points. Firstly, patients with CVID could be screened for infectious, immunological causes of gastrointestinal symptoms and CD. In the presence of malabsorption and absence of intestinal infections, a distal duodenal biopsy should be performed. On the other hand, in first-degree relatives of patients with CVID, in the presence of either atypical clinical signs of CD and features of malabsorption, the search for anti-transglutaminase antibodies could be useful. This approach may be interesting to detect inheritance patterns between CD and CVID in a large series of patients...|$|E
30|$|The {{results for}} the site ‘Swamp’ follow the {{previous}} observations. The pre-dawn water potentials indicate obvious differences according to the more or less stressful seasons. The values however, which always show a clear distance from the diagonal line, reflect much more favourable water availability than at the other sites. In August 2001 {{it is clear that}} the pre-dawn water potential remains fairly constant (1.1 ± 0.03  MPa), despite the fact that the samples apply different high values of the midday water potential. This is an indication of a soil-water supply independent of evaporation processes and atmospheric <b>saturation</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> The results for June 2002, the ‘drought’, still reflect an availability of soil water (no record exceeds the value of − 5.0  MPa), but distinguish between sample trees with a more or less favourable water access among the group.|$|R
40|$|Since {{atmospheric}} moisture {{is known}} to be an important factor of climate influencing the life processes of insects, it seemed worth whileinvestigating further some {{of the ways in which}} it affects development. The question as to the best method of representing this factor is still anunsettled one, although from theoretical considerations and. some evidence, it appears that saturation deficit should most nearly satisfy therequirements. The insect studied was the "confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Duval, chosen largely because of its suitability for experimental purposes. On account of the magnitude of the experiment, this part of the study deals only with the egg stage. A technique was devised in accordance with the requirements of the experiment. At each of four temperatures, six different <b>saturation</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were maintained. In each of the twentyfourconditions there were placed fifteen lots of ten eggs each, or 3600 egg. s studied in 360 separate lots. [ [...] . ...|$|R
