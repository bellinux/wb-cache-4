5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved slowly to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{organized}} into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, {{the origins of}} the 1999Odisha cyclone {{can be traced back to}} an area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on October21. Despite <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered a more favorable environment in the South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00UTC on 23October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the Gulf of Thailand, causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00UTC the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00UTC on 25October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550km (340mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as BOB03. With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30UTC on 25October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325km (200mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.|$|E

25|$|Wishstone {{contained}} {{a great deal}} of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate).

25|$|Declining productivity, a high fixed {{exchange}} rate between the ruble and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons {{that led to the}} crisis. The economic cost of the first war in Chechnya, estimated at $5.5billion (not including the rebuilding of the ruined Chechen economy), also contributed to the crisis. In the first half of 1997, the Russian economy showed <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> improvement. However, soon after this, the problems began to gradually intensify.|$|E
25|$|Many linguists, however, tend {{to favor}} the theory that {{speakers}} of Dravidian languages spread southwards and eastwards through the Indian subcontinent, {{based on the fact}} that the southern Dravidian languages show <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> contact with linguistic groups which the northern Dravidian languages do not. Proto-Dravidian is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian and Proto-South Dravidian around 1500 BCE, although some linguists have argued that the degree of differentiation between the sub-families points to an earlier split.|$|E

25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} is {{the cause}} of pernicious anemia, an anemic disease that was usually fatal and had unknown etiology when it was first described in medicine. The cure, and B12, were discovered by accident. George Whipple had been doing experiments in which he induced anemia in dogs by bleeding them, and then fed them various foods to observe which diets allowed them fastest recovery from the anemia produced. In the process, he discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to most rapidly cure the anemia of blood loss. Thus, he hypothesized that liver ingestion might treat pernicious anemia. He tried this and reported <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> success in 1920.|$|E
