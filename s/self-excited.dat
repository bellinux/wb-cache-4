5000|$|In 1866, he {{was among}} the first to make a <b>self-excited</b> dynamo. Other contenders were Charles Wheatstone and Werner von Siemens. He also invented {{compound}} winding for dynamos.|$|E
50|$|A <b>self-excited</b> dynamo with {{insufficient}} residual {{magnetic field}} in the metal frame {{will not be able}} to produce any current in the rotor, regardless of what speed the rotor spins. This situation can also occur in modern <b>self-excited</b> portable generators, and is resolved for both types of generators in a similar manner, by applying a brief direct current battery charge to the output terminals of the stopped generator. The battery energizes the windings just enough to imprint the residual field, to enable building up the current. This is referred to as flashing the field.|$|E
50|$|From a {{computational}} {{point of}} view, attractors can be naturally regarded as <b>self-excited</b> attractors orhidden attractors. <b>Self-excited</b> attractors can be localized numerically by standard computational procedures, in which after a transient sequence, a trajectory starting {{from a point}} on an unstable manifold in a small neighborhood of an unstable equilibrium reaches an attractor (like classical attractors in the Van der Pol, Belousov-Zhabotinsky, Lorenz, and many other dynamical systems).In contrast, the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria, so the hidden attractor cannot be localized by standard computational procedures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-excited</b> {{generators}} must {{be started}} without any external load attached. An external load will continuously drain off the buildup voltage {{and prevent the}} generator from reaching its proper operating voltage.|$|E
50|$|To operate, an {{induction}} generator must be excited with a leading voltage; {{this is usually}} done by connection to an electrical grid, or sometimes they are <b>self-excited</b> by using phase correcting capacitors.|$|E
50|$|Classical attractors in the {{well-known}} dynamical systems of Van der Pol, Beluosov-Zhabotinsky, Lorenz, Rössler, Chua {{and many others}} are <b>self-excited</b> attractors and can be obtained numerically, with relative ease, by standard computational procedures described above.|$|E
5000|$|An {{induction}} generator usually draws its excitation power from an electrical grid; sometimes, however, they are <b>self-excited</b> by using phase-correcting capacitors.

5000|$|Søren Hjorth (born October 13, 1801 in Vesterbygaard at Kalundborg in {{the west}} of Zealand (Denmark) died August 28, 1870 in Copenhagen [...] ) was a Danish railway pioneer and inventor. Before Werner von Siemens, he {{discovered}} the dynamo-electric principle in 1854 and received the first patent for a <b>self-excited</b> dynamo.|$|E
50|$|In the {{prototype}} of the single-pole electric starter, both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. In essence, the concept is that instead of permanent magnets, two opposed electromagnets induce the magnetic field around the rotor. He formulated {{the concept of the}} <b>self-excited</b> dynamo about 1861, six years before Siemens and Wheatstone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-excited</b> {{direct current}} dynamos {{commonly}} have {{a combination of}} series and parallel (shunt) field windings which are directly supplied power by the rotor through the commutator in a regenerative manner. They are started and operated {{in a manner similar}} to modern portable alternating current electric generators, which are not used with other generators on an electric grid.|$|E
50|$|Both {{types of}} <b>self-excited</b> generator, {{which have been}} {{attached}} to a large external load while it was stationary, {{will not be able}} to build up voltage even if the residual field is present. The load acts as an energy sink and continuously drains away the small rotor current produced by the residual field, preventing magnetic field buildup in the field coil.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interaction}} of the adhesion forces has nonlinear features which {{are related to the}} creep value and strongly depends on the wheel-rail zone condition and track geometry (when driving on a curve section of the track). In many modern mechanical systems torsional structural deformability plays an important role. Often the study of railway vehicle dynamics using the rigid multibody methods without torsionally deformable elements are used [...] This approach does not allow to analyse <b>self-excited</b> vibrations which have an important influence on the wheel-rail longitudinal interaction.A dynamic modelling of the electrical drive systems coupled with elements of a driven machine [...] or vehicle is particularly important when the purpose of such modelling is to obtain an information about the transient phenomena of system operation, like a run-up, run-down and loss of adhesion in the wheel-rail zone. The modelling of an electromechanical interaction between the electric driving motor and the machine as well as to an influence of the <b>self-excited</b> torsional vibrations in the drive system.|$|E
5000|$|Murthy holds four patents {{concerning}} the <b>self-excited</b> induction generator, Micro Hydel Applications and a novel-braking scheme. He has also transferred technology of <b>self-excited</b> and grid connected induction generators to industry for low-and medium-power generation under standalone or grid connected mode using energy {{sources such as}} wind, wave, small hydro, biomass, and fossil fuels. Specifically he designed the first indigenous 55 kW Wind electric generator for Kirloskar Elec. [...] in 1987 which was installed in field. He developed 150 kW generator for wave energy which was installed near Trivandrum. He has transferred technology on a novel generator for portable gensets to industry. The indigenous technology developed by him under a DST funded project was used to install 5 Pico hydel stand alone power plants in Karnataka. He has completed over 100 industry sponsored research and constancy projects dealing with electrical machines, drives, and energy systems. He was instrumental in establishing up tp date energy audit and energy conservation facilities at IIT under World Bank funding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-excited</b> attractors can be {{localized}} numerically by {{the standard}} computational procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory, started from a point of unstable manifold in a neighborhood of equilibrium, reaches a state of oscillation therefore one can easily identify it. Here It is essential to consider numerical localization procedures in forward and backward time, since computation in backward time may localize also an unstable oscillation.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} {{excitation}} {{consists of a}} smaller direct-current (DC) generator fixed on the same shaft with the alternator. The DC generator generates {{a small amount of}} electricity just enough to excite the field coils of the connected alternator to generate electricity. A variation of this system is a type of alternator which uses direct current from the battery for excitation, after which the alternator is <b>self-excited.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{generators}} with {{field coils}} are <b>self-excited,</b> {{where some of}} the power output from the rotor is used to power the field coils. The rotor iron retains a magnetism when the generator is turned off. The generator is started with no load connected; the initial weak field creates a weak voltage in the stator coils, which in turn increases the field current, until the machine [...] "builds up" [...] to full voltage.|$|E
50|$|The {{stiffness}} maximum is higher, {{and most}} importantly, this stiffness is achieved for operation-relevant (higher) air gaps. The air bearing technology solely allows {{such a high}} stiffness and distinctive maximum, even for a higher air gap, without any disadvantages.Unlike others, micro-nozzle air bearings do not face any <b>self-excited</b> vibrations even with a higher air pressure (more than 10 bar).With a higher tilt stiffness, the air bearings achieve a higher dynamic (acceleration, jerk, speed) and smoothness of the system.|$|E
5000|$|Schwartz is {{responsible}} for refuting the belief that cosmic rays trapped by <b>self-excited</b> turbolence within a supernova remnant cool irreversibly as the remnant expands. He has also significantly contributed to theoretical and observational analysis of collisionless shocks within the heliosphere. His work on the [...] "quasi-parallel shock", the component of the Earth's bow shock believed {{to be responsible for}} particle heating and acceleration, first theorized in the early 1990s, was later confirmed by observations from the Cluster spacecraft.|$|E
5000|$|Pogo {{oscillation}} is a <b>self-excited</b> vibration in liquid-propellant rocket engines {{caused by}} combustion instability. [...] The unstable combustion results in variations of engine thrust, causing variations of acceleration on the vehicle's flexible structure, {{which in turn}} cause variations in propellant pressure and flow rate, closing the self-excitation cycle. The name is a metaphor comparing the longitudinal vibration to the bouncing of a pogo stick. Pogo oscillation places stress on {{the frame of the}} vehicle, which in severe cases is dangerous.|$|E
50|$|Starling {{resistors}} {{have been}} used both as an instrument {{in the study of}} interesting physiological phenomena (e.g. pharyngeal collapse during obstructed breathing or OSA) and as a rich source of physical phenomena in their own right. Two non-linear behaviours are characteristic: 1) the “waterfall effect” wherein, subsequent to collapse, the flow through the tube becomes independent of the downstream pressure and 2) <b>self-excited</b> oscillations. Expiratory flow-limitation in the disease COPD {{is an example of the}} former behaviour and snoring an example of the latter.|$|E
50|$|Synchronous motors are {{available}} in sub-fractional <b>self-excited</b> sizes to high-horsepower industrial sizes. In the fractional horsepower range, most synchronous motors are used where precise constant speed is required. These machines are commonly used in analog electric clocks, timers and other devices where correct time is required.In high-horsepower industrial sizes, the synchronous motor provides two important functions. First, it is a highly efficient means of converting AC energy to work. Second, it can operate at leading or unity power factor and thereby provide power-factor correction.|$|E
50|$|An {{oscillation}} in a dynamical {{system can}} be easily localized numerically if initial conditions from its open neighborhood lead to long-run behavior that approaches the oscillation. Such an oscillation (or set of oscillations) is called an attractor, and its attracting set is called the basin of attraction. Thus, from a computational point of view the following classification of attractors based on the simplicity of finding basin of attraction in the phase space is suggested: an attractor is called a hidden attractor if its basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria, otherwise it is called a <b>self-excited</b> attractor.|$|E
50|$|With {{conventional}} single nozzle air bearings, {{the compressed}} air flows {{through a few}} relatively large nozzles (diameter 0.1 - 0.5 mm) into the bearing gap. The air consumption thus allows only some flexibility such that the bearing’s features (force, moments, bearing surface, bearing gap height, damping) can be adjusted only insufficiently. However, {{in order to allow}} a uniform air pressure even with only some nozzles, air bearing manufacturers take constructive techniques. In doing so, these air bearings cause dead volumes (non-compressible and thus weak air volume). In effect, this dead volume is very harmful for the air bearing’s dynamic and causes <b>self-excited</b> vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "grand opening" [...] of {{television}} station W9XAP {{took place in}} the evening of August 27, 1930. A number of receivers had been distributed to homes and stores in the Chicago area. Sears, Roebuck had advertised extensively and crowds had assembled to see and hear. Bill Hay was the announcer and several other WMAQ artists performed. The signal was strong and the program good, but ghost images were terrific and the results disappointing. Apparently the nice crystal-steady signal from W9XAP made the ghost images distinct and objectionable, whereas the <b>self-excited</b> oscillator of W9XAO seemed to make them less distinct and quite tolerable.|$|E
50|$|Note, however, that vortex-induced {{vibration}} is a {{far more}} complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal <b>self-excited</b> forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the bluff body has itself linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} dynamos used {{permanent magnets}} {{to create the}} magnetic field. These were referred to as [...] "magneto-electric machines" [...] or magnetos. However, researchers found that stronger magnetic fields, and so more power, could be produced by using electromagnets (field coils) on the stator. These were called [...] "dynamo-electric machines" [...] or dynamos. The field coils of the stator were originally separately excited by a separate, smaller, dynamo or magneto. An important development by Wilde and Siemens was the discovery (by 1866) that a dynamo could also bootstrap itself to be <b>self-excited,</b> using current generated by the dynamo itself. This allowed {{the growth of a}} much more powerful field, thus far greater output power.|$|E
