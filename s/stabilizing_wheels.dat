40|$|Abstract. The {{monorail}} beam (Z 206 - 25) of Chongqing straddle monorail {{transit system}} {{was selected as}} the research object. The spatial coupling vibration model of vehicle-bridge system was established and corresponding procedure was compiled. The effect of travelling, steering and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure respectively and typical combined wheel pressure on the system vibration was studied. The results show that the change of wheel pressure has great effect on the response of the system. The vertical response value increases with travelling wheel pressure increasing. The lateral response value increases with steering wheel pressure increasing, while the effect of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure on the response is irregular. The effect of steering wheel pressure is greater than that of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure on lateral responses. The effect of all of travelling and steering wheel pressure is greater than that of unilateral wheel pressure on the response. The effect tendency of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure on the response is opposite to that of unilateral wheel pressure...|$|R

50|$|The Rebell had low-mid set wings {{built around}} a single wooden spar and wood covered. They had {{dihedral}} only on the outer panels, each 3.75 m (12 ft 3.5 in) long and foldable for storage. The fuselage was a steel tube structure, wood covered and had a roughly rectangular cross-section. The canopy was quite long and normally enclosed just a single seat, but there was space to place a second seat in tandem behind the first. The engine, originally a 40 kW (54 hp) Hirth M28 twin cylinder unit, was placed over the wing behind the cockpit with the propeller shaft {{at the top of}} the fuselage, locating the propeller just behind the trailing edge of the wing. Aft, the fuselage became a low-set boom, bearing wooden tail surfaces including a swept, straight edged vertical tail with a long dorsal fillet. The Rebell had a recessed monowheel undercarriage assisted by a tailwheel and two <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted at the extreme inner wing panels.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s {{more than}} one French {{aircraft}} design was tested with larger scale glider models than could be put into wind-tunnels. These were piloted and launched {{from the top of}} a large aircraft like a SNCASE Languedoc, as was the SCAN 271 or alternatively towed to altitude. [...] The Arsenal 2301 was a full-scale model of a proposed rocket powered fighter aircraft which developed German ideas on swept wing aircraft expressed in the wartime DFS 346. It was a wooden aircraft, with swept, straight tapered mid-wings, square tipped at right angles to the leading edge. The fuselage was long and fine, with the cockpit well forward of the wing. The fuselage began to taper to the pointed nose just behind the canopy. The vertical tail was swept, straight tipped and tapered, though there was a curved fillet between the fin root and the fuselage. An all-moving tail, straight tapered, square tipped and with sweep on its leading edge, was placed about one-third the way up the fin. [...] The 2301 had a bicycle landing gear, with a fixed main wheel under the central fuselage and a small, retractable nose wheel; retracting <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wheels</b> were positioned near the wing tips. Its span was 8 m and length 14 m. Its primary purpose was to explore the low speed characteristics of the design.|$|E

The {{aim is to}} increase the efficiency of the blank cutting operation into the plates by means of rational applying lubricant-coolant, stabilization of the cutting edge in slitting wheels and combined machining of the plates. The relations for design of the plate deflection for determination of te height parameters of plates cutted by a <b>stabilized</b> <b>wheel</b> and thickness of the disturbed layer after combined machining have been obtained firstly by an analytical way. The rational conditions of cutting blanks of the non-metallic materials into the plates have been determined; the role of technological inheritance in the defects of cutted plates by the finished bases has been revealed; the new process for stabilization of the slitted wheels has been developed. The technological recommendations and device for tension degree check of AKVR wheels have been introduced in 1993 in the leading enterprise (Production Enterprise "Itil"). The efficiency is expressed in the increase of cutting productivity (1, 5 - 2 times) at keeping yield of the finished plates and in the prevention of rejection caused by AKVR breakdown at their tension.

When steady wheels on one side and guide wheels on the opposite side leave the track surface, the flexibility coefficient is 0.651. According to the definition of the flexibility coefficient, the greater the flexibility coefficient, the easier it is for the vehicle to capsize on the curves.

The mechanism consists of 2 active lever arms mounted on each side of the wheel and rotating coaxially with the wheel. This mechanism allows slightly lifting the magnetic wheel at any desired position on the wheel circumference and consequently decreasing the magnetic force at this specific location. The same mechanism can also be used to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>wheel,</b> when external forces are unfavorable. This paper also describes the potential of this concept for in-pipe inspection technologies. Indeed it can be used to increase the mobility of magnetic wheels robots which are currently not able to negotiate complex obstacles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} mechanical and control design of single-legged reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>stabilized</b> robots with <b>wheeled</b> and monopedal locomotion capabilities. The incorporation of variable-geometry reaction wheel arrays (RWAs) increases control authority, {{as compared to}} conventional RWAs, and is facilitated by the design of spring-loaded mechanical linkages, which complement high- speed/low-torque actuation and enable the directed release of gradually-accumulated spring energy. The design of the final prototype enables roving, self-uprighting, quasi- static stair-climbing maneuvers, and conventional or end- over-end monopedal locomotion. Linear time-varying (LTV) linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control gains for the stabilization of continuous single-legged hopping maneuvers are solved for, based on the linearization of equations of motion that incorporte nonlinear dampers in order to emulate the no-slip and no-penetration conditions. These controllers are demonstrated in simulation and have been tested on the latest physical prototype. Comparison against high-speed video has revealed that significant angular estimate drift is a key limiting factor towards robust stabilization in practice. A key challenge arises from the excitation of structural modes during the touchdown portion of continuous hopping. The frequencies of these vibrations lie within the controller bandwidth, due to the limited control authority of the system, leading to instability from positive feedback. Significant over-estimation of the forward velocity has been observed to result from foot slip near takeoff. A method of estimating the instantaneous rotation center position using offset accelerometers is developed in order to detect foot sli...|$|R
50|$|The mani wheel, or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, {{generally}} sheet-metal body (often beautifully embossed) {{mounted on}} a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of Turbinella (conch) shell.

The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras (Tib. mani) rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan ‘khor-lo than is “wheel” since {{it is thought that}} the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit.

The control action for yaw is determined by the yaw dynamics as well as the roll dynamics and similarly for the roll. The rules, the distribution of membership function of the FLC, and the linking parameters of the distributed controller are determined based on solving a constraint optimization problem using the genetic algorithms. To get accurate pointing, long-life time, and fast response for the satellite, the deviation of the satellite from its nominal position, the consumed power, and the time of deviation are included in the optimization objective function. With the use of multiple initial conditions in determining the objective function, the designed controller is shown to be stable with a satisfactory performance in a broad range of the operating condition...|$|R

40|$|Railways provide fast, safe, clean, {{and cheap}} {{transportation}} service. The cost efficiency in railway operations can be scrutinized from different perspectives. Here, passenger ride comfort, wheel/rail contact wear, and safety (in particular running stability, track shift force, {{and risk of}} derailment) are considered as objective functions introduced to evaluate the dynamics behaviour of railway vehicles. Running speed also {{plays a key role}} in cost efficiency of railway operations. Higher speeds shorten journey time and make railways more competitive with other types of transportation systems. However, this might increase wear and deteriorate ride comfort and safety. To improve the performance in railway operations advanced designs and technologies are developed during the past decades. Bogie primary and secondary suspension systems of high speed trains can significantly affect the dynamics behaviour of the vehicle. Such components might have conflicting effects on different objective functions. It is important to have the optimum performance of suspension components. In this regard, one of the ultimate goals of this thesis is to improve the vehicle performance from different points of views by studying passive and active suspension systems and using multiobjective optimisation techniques to meet conflicting design requirements. Computational cost is one of the main challenges in multidisciplinary design optimisation. The computational efforts for optimisation can be significantly mitigated by narrowing down the number of input design parameters. Here, an efficient global sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify those suspension components that have prominent influences on different objective functions. Based on the global sensitivity analysis results obtained two multiobjective optimisation problems are formulated and solved. First, multiobjective optimisation of bogie suspension components with respect to safety to improve running speed on curves. Second problem is to reduce wear and improve ride comfort when the vehicle is operating with the enhanced speeds. Consequently, the vehicle runs secure and faster with higher ride comfort and less wear by means of the two optimisation problems solved. The optimisations are carried out using the genetic algorithm. In the case of safety optimisation problem, semi active control strategies are also applied using magnetorheological dampers and the effects on the dynamics behaviour are explored. The robustness of the bogie suspension Pareto optimised solutions against uncertainties in the design parameters is also studied. Active control technology is one of the main targets of this thesis. In this regard, a robust controller is designed using the H∞ control technique to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>wheel</b> set motion and improve curving performance. The controller is robust against track irregularities. Finally, the actuator dynamics is considered and a compensation technique is applied to reduce the actuator’s time delay and improve the performance...|$|R
40|$|CATSAT (Cooperative Astrophysical and Technology SATellite) is one {{of three}} {{missions}} being developed under NASA/USRA 2 ̆ 7 s Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative (STEDI) for launch in 1997 - 98. STEDI is a pilot program to 2 ̆ 2 assess the efficacy of smaller, low-cost spaceflight missions [...] . that is matched to the traditional process of research and development at universities 2 ̆ 2. This program allows 4 million and 2 - 3 years for all aspects of the mission, i. e. instrument and satellite development, integration, testing, mission operations and data analysis. CATSAT is an astrophysics mission being developed in collaboration by three university teams. Its mission is to study the nature and distance scale of Cosmic Gamma Ray Bursters. Its prime instrumentation is a Soft X-Ray spectrometer (0. 5 - 15 keV), with a total area of 190 cm 2 and 5. 5 sr. FOV, to measure the photoelectric absorption along the line-of-sight and thus determine a distance scale to the burst source. This sensor is supported by three context sensors to determine intensity, spectral and directional information. These include four Hard X-Ray spectrometers (15 - 400 keV, 4 x 45 cm 2), a Directional Gamma-ray Spectrometer (0. 3 - 6 MeV, 135 cm 2) and an array of nine X-ray Albedo sensors (15 - 400 keV, 9 x 80 cm 2) which are also sensitive to polarization in the burst 2 ̆ 7 s x-ray emissions. The science payload will generate 24 Mbytes of data per 12 hours. CATSAT is expected to be launched in mid 1998 into a 550 Km polar sun synchronous 6 am- 6 pm orbit. The mission form factor is a rectangular box with a base of 72 cm, a height of 102 cm and a launch mass of 135 Kg. A combination of body mounted cells and deployable solar panels produce a total of 150 watts. The mission is 3 -axis <b>stabilized</b> utilizing reaction <b>wheels</b> and magnetic torquers to provide continuous solar-(near zenith) pointing to 5 °, in orbits up to 30 ° from its initial terminator orbit. Solar and earth-horizon sensors are used for attitude determination and will provide after-the-fact knowledge to 1 °. An onboard GPS receiver will provide universal time and orbital navigation data. The GPS information together with an onboard three-axis magnetometer will be used for a coarse attitude solution during the initial turn-on as well as other orbital emergencies, and also act as a backup for the primary sensors.

5000|$|According to {{the lineage}} texts on prayer wheels, prayer wheels {{are used to}} {{accumulate}} wisdom and merit (good karma) and to purify negativities (bad karma). In Buddhism, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have created a variety of skillful means (upaya) to help bring practitioners ever closer to realizing enlightenment. The idea of spinning mantras relates to numerous Tantric practices whereby the Tantric practitioner visualizes mantras revolving around the nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown. Therefore, prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing one's capacity for these types of Tantric visualizations. The spiritual method for those practicing with a prayer wheel is very specific (with slight variations according to different Buddhist sects). The practitioner most often spins the wheel clockwise, as {{the direction in which}} the mantras are written is that of the movement of the sun across the sky. On rare occasions, advanced Tantric practitioners such as Senge Dongma, the Lion-Faced Dakini, spin prayer wheels counterclockwise to manifest a more wrathful protective energy. As the practitioner turns the wheel, it is best to focus the mind and repeat the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra. Not only does this increase the merit earned by the wheel's use, but it is a mind-stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion. Intoning the mani mantra with mindfulness and the [...] "Bodhicitta" [...] motivation dramatically enhances the effects of the prayer wheel. However, it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits, and it is stated in the lineage text that even insects that cross a prayer wheel's shadow will get some benefit. Each revolution is as meritorious as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll, and this means that the more Om Mani Padme Hum mantras that are inside a prayer wheel, the more powerful it is. It is best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically. While turning smoothly, one keeps in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and bodhichitta (the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings).The benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel are vast. Not only does it help wisdom, compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner, it also enhances siddhis (spiritual powers such as clairvoyance, precognition, reading others thoughts, etc.). The practitioner can repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the <b>wheel,</b> <b>stabilizing</b> a calm, meditative mind. At the end of a practice session, there is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that one may have gathered during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings. Then Om Ah Hum 3 times. This is customary with Tibetans upon completing any Buddhist practice, including the practice of the prayer wheel.|$|R
