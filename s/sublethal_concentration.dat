40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed to {{investigate}} biochemical studies in the different tissue of fish L. rohita exposed to <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentration</b> of Quinolphos. Fish was exposed to lethal and <b>Sublethal</b> <b>concentration</b> for 8 days (1 / 10 th of 96 hrs LC 50 viz., 0. 2322 mg L- 1). In the present study the activity of Acid phosphatase (ACP) and Acetylcholine esterase (AChE), in the liver and kidney, gill, brain and muscle tissue were observed. During the <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentration</b> of quin-olphos the acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase in the liver were increased.

The second experiment was designed to assess the effects of <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cu (0. 47 and 0. 94 mg/L), while the third one allowed us to test the recovery capacity of fish exposed to the <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> Cu and kept in sea water without Cu addition. The LC 50 value for Cu {{was found to be}} 1. 88 mg/L Cu. Fish exposed to the <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cu showed a significant accumulation of Cu in gills at 96 h respect to the control ones (0. 43 µg/g Cu). No significant difference was observed in the accumulation of Cu in gills between fish exposed to 0. 47 mg/L (1. 09 µg/g Cu) and 0. 94 mg/L (1. 26 µg/g Cu). Exposure (24 and 96 h) to the <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cu tested induced DNA damage in the erythrocytes.

In this study the effect of <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of {{abamectin}} (at 10 and 30 % lethal concentrations, LC 10 and LC 30) was investigated on developmental and reproduction parameters of the tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta. Lethal concentrations were estimated by leaf dip bioassay on the fourth instar larvae of the T. absoluta that, LC 50, LC 30 and LC 10 were 0. 23, 0. 15 and 0. 12 mg · l− 1, respectively. The <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> led to significant decreases in adult emergence, the percentage of pupation of the parent generation, fecundity and adult longevity compared to the control. <b>Sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> significantly decreased the net reproductive rate (R 0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), and gross reproduction rate (GRR).

Four concentrations of PCP (0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, and 1. 6 mg/L PCP) and one concentration of copper (0. 02 mg/L Cu 21) in International Standards Organisation (ISO, Geneva, Switzerland) standard medium were applied in the experiments.

40|$|Schistosomisis is endemic in {{many rural}} areas of {{developing}} countries. The life cycle of schistosomes is complex with two hosts, an intermediate snail host and a definitive human host. Biomphalaria arabica is the intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni in Saudi Arabia. One method of controlling the disease is to break the life cycle at the intermediate host snail stage using molluscicides. Snails kill schistosomes by a mechanism involving production of reactive oxygen species. In this study malondialdehyde (MDA), and the antioxidants glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GP(x)) were determined in tissue homogenates of B. arabica treated with <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentration</b> (LC 25) of the plant molluscicide Solanum nigrum.

In addition, the effect of tributyltin (TBT), another important genotoxicant in the aquatic environment, was investigated. Exposure of abalones to <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of TBT and BaP for 21 days resulted in significant decrease of total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. Conversely induction of extra and intra cellular superoxide generation, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase activity was present when the abalones were exposed to TBT and BaP. Most of the immune associated parameters tested showed clear time dependent response to both toxicants. Within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to BaP, recovery was observed as evidenced by most of the parameters returning to their normal level. However, no recovery was observed within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to TBT as evidenced by continued elevation of intra cellular superoxide and nitrite production and decrease in THC, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. This suggested a prolonged TBT-induced impact on the immune reaction and possibly more damage than that caused by BaP. Overall the results suggest that chronic exposure to <b>sublethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of TBT or BaP causes modulations in the immunocompetence of abalones with most of the immune associated parameters tested being stimulated, and this might be harmful to the host.
