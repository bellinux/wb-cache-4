40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of Employee {{benefits}} like salary and <b>staff</b> <b>welfare</b> expenses on the performance of the company. We studied the salary expenses per employee as well as <b>staff</b> <b>welfare</b> expenses per employee and the revenue per employee as well as PBDITA per employee for the two consecutive financial years.

40|$|The paper {{examined}} <b>staff</b> <b>welfare</b> and organization’s productivity, using Patani Local Government Council in Delta State, Nigeria as a reference. The methodology {{was primarily}} qualitative and involved use of In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) to secure information from {{employees at the}} Council. Motivational models and conflict theory of Dahrendorf were used as the theoretical framework. The theory presupposes social changes as an inevitable outcome of activities of societal elements, typified in the contrasting positions of the management and employees that could retard motivation and employee performance. Data revealed general awareness about <b>staff</b> <b>welfare</b> among the employees and ability to identify the elements of welfare. There was absence of <b>staff</b> <b>welfare</b> in the council. The working environment was poor, in terms of office accommodation and furniture, paucity of working materials, scarcely available monetary incentives and unreliable health and safety facilities, which altogether reduce morale (job satisfaction) and efficiency in job performance. In recommendation, pragmatic efforts {{should be made to}} enhance employee’s job capabilities through training; to improve working conditions of the employees and their general welfare in order to elicit job satisfaction and motivation for increased productivity...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study on}} {{motivation}} and job satisfaction of mid-level staff in Kenneth Dike Library (KDL), University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Survey method was adopted where responses were elicited through a questionnaire administered on the staff. Answers were sought to questions on <b>staff</b> <b>welfare,</b> satisfaction and productivity. The data collected was analyzed through frequencies, percentages and inferences. It is shown that the morale of staff in the target group was doused due to: frustration resulting from lack of involvement in decision making and inadequate tools and materials with which to work; over-centralization of authority; lack of proper incentives by way of welfare schemes and adequate remunerations. Suggestions are made on the adoption of genuine participatory management style, the introduction of welfare committees to handle <b>staff</b> <b>welfare</b> matters, stringent measures for disciplinary cases plus the fact that government should improve the working conditions of all employees to enhance their level of productivity...|$|R
