40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{assess and}} compare {{the impact of the}} Bolsa Família Program (Family Allowance) on the {{nutritional}} status of children and adolescents from the Brazilian Northeastern and Southeastern regions. Methods: The study used data from a database derived from a subsample of the Family Budget Survey conducted from 2008 to 2009. The ratios of underweight, stunted, and overweight children were calculated. Impact measurement analysis was preceded by propensity score matching, which matches beneficiary and non-beneficiary families in relation to a set of socioeconomic features. The nearest-neighbor matching algorithm estimated the program impact. Results: The ratio of underweight children and adolescents was, on average, 1. 1 % smaller in the beneficiary families than in the non-beneficiary families in the Northeastern region. As for the Southeastern region, the ratio of overweight children and adolescents was, on average, 4. 2 % smaller in the beneficiary families. The program did not affect stunting in either region. Conclusion: The results showed the positive impact and good focus of the program. Thus, once linked to <b>structural</b> <b>actions,</b> the <b>program</b> may help to improve the nutritional status and quality of life of its beneficiaries...|$|R

Consequently, the strategy-based rewrite semantics describes more faithfully the behavior of the membrane systems than the rewrite logic-based semantics. It is known that the rewrite logic-based semantics implements the maximal concurrency of the evolution rules in membrane systems only by interleaving concurrency. The concurrency degrees of the communication and <b>structural</b> <b>actions</b> are the same for the two rewrite-based semantics...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} based on a {{qualitative}} case study and {{is based on}} a social science perspective. The method of study is a comparative study; content analysis focused on document analysis. Interest is based on examining local basic policy programs for integration, as integration has become more noticeable in recent years, and has become increasingly important for science. The survey will be based on Ager and Strang's framework "good integration". Under the analysis section, various regulations, local <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> and tasks will be understood and explained from different criteria, based on the perspective of integration. The theoretical framework for "good integration" as proven to be very useful, and a high explanation factor. In summary, the analysis shows that the <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> for Malmö and Umeå, differ between each other, in relation to the framework for "good integration". The <b>action</b> <b>Programs</b> in the municipality of Malmö, complies with 3 of 4 categories in the theoretical framework. The categories fulfilled are Employment, Education and Housing. The <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> within the municipality of Umeå however, fulfill only one category; Employment. Both Malmö and Umeå’s <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> demonstrate differences and similarities against "good integration". Accordingly, Umeå's <b>action</b> <b>program</b> has more deficiencies in relation to the criteria for "good integration", in comparison with Malmö's <b>action</b> <b>program.</b> The conclusion is that Malmö's basic policy documents, at a local level; for integration, can be explained to more conditions for a successful integration, in comparison with Umeå's policy documents. However, something that both Malmö and Umeå should focus on is what the analysis showed for the category Health; develop policy documents for dissemination of information, which should include, inter alia and languages other than Swedish, to create conditions that achieve successful integration, according to the framework of "good integration"...|$|R

40|$|This paper assesses whether affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> {{and equal}} {{opportunity}} laws affect {{the output of}} economic agents. More precisely, the authors find that equal opportunity laws and affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> always benefit disadvantaged groups. Equal opportunity laws also increase the effort levels of all subjects and, hence, the profits of the tournament administrator (usually the firm). The effects of affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> depend on the severity of a group's cost disadvantage. When the cost disadvantage is severe, these programs significantly increase effort levels (and, hence, profits). The opposite is true when the disadvantage is slight.
