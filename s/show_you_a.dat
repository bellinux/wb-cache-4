500|$|Swift {{relies on}} 1 Corinthians in this sermon, but unlike other uses by Swift of 1 Corinthians, {{his use of}} the epistle in [...] "On the Trinity" [...] {{describe}} man's inability to understand the complex workings of God. Swift states [...] "Behold I <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." [...] The primarily use of this sermon is to describe the divine mysteries in a simple manner; Swift is not giving answers to the mysteries, but only explaining how Christians are to understand them. Swift attempts to describe the ambiguous nature of the Trinity and how many should understand it when he says: ...|$|E
500|$|The Public Relations Society of America {{publishes a}} code of ethics. Members that violate the code may have their {{membership}} revoked, usually under its mandate that members [...] "not engage in any practice which tends to corrupt the integrity of channels of public communication" [...] and that members act [...] "in accord with public welfare." [...] The code also expects PRSA members to identify {{the source of their}} communications, avoid derogatory methods and avoid abusing insider information. According to the code of conduct, members should [...] "protect and advance the free flow of accurate and truthful information; foster informed decision-making through open communication... and work to strengthen the public's trust in the profession." [...] The code states that members [...] "adhere to the highest standards of accuracy and truth." [...] A story in CBS criticized the code: [...] "Show me a PR person who is 'accurate' and 'truthful,' and I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> PR person who is unemployed." [...] The code of ethics has been revised in 1954, 1959, 1963, 1977, 1983, 1988 and 2000.|$|E

500|$|Kruger {{presented}} the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. [...] "With {{a feeling of}} gratitude to the God of our fathers", he said, [...] "who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice." [...] This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses {{it as one of}} his [...] "most notable utterances". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened {{for the first time in}} Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{reviewed}} Fallout: New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively, {{despite its}} many crash bugs and glitches. Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E

Whedon makes the point that a world without sin is a world without choice, and that choice is ultimately what defines humanity. [...] According to Whedon, the planet [...] "Miranda" [...] was named for William Shakespeare's Miranda in The Tempest, who in Act V, scene I says: [...] "O brave new world, / That has such people in't!" [...] The Alliance had hoped that Miranda would be a new kind of world, filled with peaceful, happy people, and represents the [...] "inane optimism of the Alliance".|$|E
