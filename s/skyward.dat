5|$|<b>Skyward</b> Sword {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from multiple journalistic magazines and websites upon release: it received {{a score of}} 93/100 on aggregate site Metacritic based on 81 reviews. It was the site's 10th highest scoring game of 2011, and also ranked as the 6th best-reviewed Wii game of all time. It received perfect scores from multiple publications: these included Famitsu, IGN, Eurogamer, Game Informer, Edge Magazine and VideoGamer.com. In the case of Famitsu, <b>Skyward</b> Sword was the third Zelda title and sixteenth video game in the magazine's history {{to be given a}} perfect score at that time.|$|E
5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a <b>Skyward</b> Strike. <b>Skyward</b> Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|For the {{commemorative}} ceremony on the 25th {{anniversary of the}} massacre in 2014, the city of Montreal entrusted the technical aspect of the ceremony to the multimedia production company Moment Factory, who installed fourteen searchlights representing the 14 victims of the massacre on the esplanade of Mount Royal. The light beams turned <b>skyward</b> first appeared shortly after four o'clock, the hour when the attack had started 25 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} pitch-black, {{followed}} by a light framing Martin as he reaches <b>skyward</b> out of the shadows. The scene then shifts to the band, as they play the song. When Martin spread his hands, the two-story-high LED lights erupt in a colour of rainbow hues. The LED background changes colours as the band continues. The video concludes its ending with the band lined up, one-by-one, and the LED set displaying a white light background.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skyward</b> Sword {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of the Zelda continuity, detailing the origins of the Master Sword, a recurring weapon within the series. The current incarnation of Link, resident of a floating town called Skyloft, heads on a quest to rescue his childhood friend Zelda after she is kidnapped and spirited to the Surface, an abandoned land below the clouds. Armed with the Goddess Sword and aided by a spirit named Fi, Link must ensure Zelda's safety and stop Ghirahim as he attempts to resurrect his master.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust. Although {{there are a few}} {{variations}} with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing <b>skyward.</b> This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the pie.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: <b>Skyward</b> Sword is an action-adventure {{game for}} the Wii home console, {{developed}} and published by Nintendo. The sixteenth mainline entry in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released worldwide in November 2011. Taking the role of series protagonist Link, players navigate the skies around the floating island of Skyloft and the land below it, completing quests that advance the story and solving environmental and dungeon-based puzzles. Gameplay mechanics and combat, the latter focusing on attacking and blocking with sword and shield, are reliant on the Wii MotionPlus expansion device.|$|E
5|$|Five days later, {{teammate}} {{and close}} friend Vasil Kiryienka rode {{to victory in}} a solo effort, and he too dedicated the stage victory to Tondó, pointing <b>skyward</b> {{as he crossed the}} finish line. The team had met to consider withdrawing from the race after Tondó's death, but instead the riders unanimously voted to ride on. Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while other members of the team grieved with Tondó's family. In {{the final days of the}} race, many fans wrote signs memorializing Tondó as they had with Weylandt earlier on.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected <b>skyward</b> from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked <b>skyward,</b> thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{caused by}} a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands <b>skyward</b> while low-lying basins between them {{gradually}} subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land {{in the area to}} form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed {{as a result of the}} Laramide.|$|E
5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float <b>skyward</b> as Graham films.|$|E
5|$|Multiple promotional {{elements}} were created: a five-part online comic was {{written and illustrated}} by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik under their Penny Arcade Presents series, and television commercials featuring actor and comedian Robin Williams and his daughter Zelda were made, playing on the actor's stated love for the series. <b>Skyward</b> Sword released in all regions in November 2011: it released in Europe on November 18, North America on November 20, Japan on November 23, and Australia on November 24. The game was released as both a standard edition and a limited deluxe edition that included a gold Wii Remote Plus. An anniversary CD was included with both editions containing orchestrated versions of various iconic musical pieces from the series. Following its release, a game-breaking bug that corrupted save files if three late-game events were taken in a certain order was discovered. Once revealed, Nintendo issued instructions on avoiding it and set up a special channel on their Wii site in Japan to gain feedback, along with offering to manually repair corrupted save files.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: <b>Skyward</b> Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The <b>Skyward</b> Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

25|$|The {{eyes are}} {{suspended}} on stalks with heavy crystals on one end, {{acting like a}} gyroscope to orient the eyes <b>skyward.</b> They look upward to navigate from roots in mangrove swamps to the open lagoon and back, watching for the mangrove canopy, where they feed.|$|E
25|$|The 9th Bomb Squadron's patch {{features}} 3 spotlights aiming <b>skyward,</b> {{to represent}} the 3 major campaigns the 9th participated in during WWI. One spotlight shines vertically, while the other two cross each other. This forms an IX, which is the Roman Numeral for 9.|$|E
25|$|The hero is {{presented}} devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, {{as he is}} forever trying to pull Paris's arrow from his heel. His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes <b>skyward,</b> as if to seek help from Olympus. According to Greek mythology, his mother Thetis was a goddess.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the Walna Scar Road are {{the further}} tops of Walna Scar (2,040ft), White Maiden (1,995ft) and White Pike (1,960ft). Richards treats these as one fell (Walna Scar) {{in his recent}} Landranger guide. South of White Pike is a {{profound}} drop to an area of rough country before the shapely pyramid of Caw rises <b>skyward.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} <b>skyward</b> allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E
25|$|Valenzuela in 1981 {{was named}} the opening day starter as a rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 24 hours before his {{scheduled}} start and Burt Hooton {{was not ready to}} fill in. Valenzuela shut out the Houston Astros 2–0. He started the season 8–0 with five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. Punctuating this dominance on the mound, Valenzuela had an unusual, flamboyant wind-up (looking <b>skyward</b> just at the apex of every pitch), which drew attention of its own. It was a habit which he claims to have developed spontaneously, although not until joining the Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held <b>skyward</b> to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. One of the biggest challenges is trying to keep it in one piece.|$|E
25|$|Participants in the {{memorial}} service paddle out to a suitable location with flower leis around their necks or with loose flowers (sometimes held between their teeth). The participants then get into a circular formation, hold hands, and silently pray. Sometimes they will raise their clasped hands <b>skyward</b> before tossing their flowers or leis {{into the center of}} the ring. Afterward, they paddle back toward the beach to begin their surf session. Often these services take place at sunrise or sunset. In locations with a pier, such as Huntington Beach, Orange County, California, the service can take place near the end of the pier so that any non-surfers, such as elderly relatives, can watch and participate. Often the participants on the pier will throw down bouquets of flowers {{into the center of the}} ring.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1999, a {{powerful}} {{beam of light}} was unveiled for the first time. Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining <b>skyward</b> {{from the top of}} the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates. Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year. It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{controversy}} and the delay in relieving Bee, Jackson's brigade, which would thenceforth {{be known as the}} Stonewall Brigade, stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day; Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson. During the battle, Jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm <b>skyward</b> with the palm facing forward – interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to God for success in combat. His hand was struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger. He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated. After the battle, Jackson was promoted to major general (October 7, 1861) and given command of the Valley District, with headquarters in Winchester.|$|E
500|$|When {{development}} {{started on}} the next home console Zelda title, , the developers wanted to improve on what they had achieved with <b>Skyward</b> Sword, along with creating a non-linear world based on player complaints about the linearity of <b>Skyward</b> Sword. Aonuma and Fujibayashi both returned respectively as producer and director. Aonuma's stated wish with Breath of the Wild was [...] "to expand and make a better <b>Skyward</b> Sword". In addition, Aonuma stated {{that it might be}} possible to create an HD remake of <b>Skyward</b> Sword for current hardware. The game was later re-released on the eShop for the Wii U on September 1, 2016: it was released as part of the series' 30th anniversary celebrations.|$|E
500|$|<b>Skyward</b> Sword began {{development}} in 2006, {{after the release}} of [...] for GameCube and Wii. It was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development, a development division of series publisher Nintendo. Its producer was Eiji Aonuma, a major contributor to the Legend of Zelda series. His main preoccupation during these early stages was whether the developers could continue creating The Legend of Zelda titles using the same development mindset that had been used up to Twilight Princess. The game's director was Hidemaro Fujibayashi: previously working as assistant director on [...] for the Nintendo DS, <b>Skyward</b> Sword was his first project for home consoles. He began work on <b>Skyward</b> Sword after finishing Phantom Hourglass, and continued working on the game alongside his work on [...] When Spirit Tracks was finished, Fujibayashi and the game's development team transferred back to working on <b>Skyward</b> Sword.|$|E

500|$|Upon its Japanese debut, <b>Skyward</b> Sword sold nearly 195,000 units, {{reaching}} {{the top of}} sales charts. Sales quickly declined, {{dropping out of the}} Top 20 within a few weeks. By the end of December, it had sold less than 320,000 units: this was below equivalent sales for other recent home console and portable Zelda titles. The game's sales were strong overall going into January 2012, with its largest sales coming from North America. Its first month sales in North America came to around 600,000 units, nearly double its Japanese sales. In the UK, <b>Skyward</b> Sword was the seventh best-selling game of November in the multiformat charts, stated as impressive given the waning popularity of the platform. It was also the region's top-selling Wii title during its week of release, supplanting the previous week's top seller Just Dance 3. It failed to reach the top-five best-selling Wii titles for that year. Its total worldwide first-week sales came to 919,119 units. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, <b>Skyward</b> Sword was the fastest selling title in the series at that time. As of December 2011, the game has sold 3.41 million units worldwide: [...] 380,000 of these units were sold in Japan while 3.04 million units were sold overseas.|$|E

RPGamer's own [...] "Best of 2011" [...] awards named <b>Skyward</b> Sword [...] "Best Console and PC Game" [...] and awarded it for [...] "Best Music". It also received [...] "Game of the Year" [...] awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly, GameSpot, Edge and Nintendo Power. It received [...] "Excellence" [...] and [...] "Most Valuable Character" [...] awards from Famitsu, the latter being awarded for the protagonist Link. It received multiple nominations in 2012 at the D.I.C.E. Awards, Game Developers Choice Awards and the BAFTA Games Awards. At Spike, the game won awards for [...] "Best Wii Game" [...] and [...] "Best Motion Game". <b>Skyward</b> Sword has since been ranked among the best games developed for the Wii.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Tom McShea was notably less {{positive}} {{than other}} critics, praising the storyline, dungeons, enemies and visuals while faulting the controls for being unreliable and feeling {{that most of}} the experience felt both unnecessary and overly familiar. Destructoid's Jonathan Holmes called <b>Skyward</b> Sword his new favorite 3D game from the series, but noted that its exclusive use of motion controls would put off potential players. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer was highly positive, praising the controls, gameplay experience and additional elements such as upgrades: he gave particular praise to the game's visuals, which were impressive despite hardware limitations. Game Informers Phil Kollar echoed both general praise of the gameplay and presentation, and minor issues experienced with the motion controls: he concluded by saying that Nintendo had fulfilled its initial promises for the Wii with <b>Skyward</b> Sword. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson called it [...] "perfectly balanced mix of innovation and classic Zelda gameplay" [...] despite minor control issues.|$|E
