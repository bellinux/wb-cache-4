The shark then causes the boat to break apart with its death contortions, forcing the people on the boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow <b>sprit</b> and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive.

2500|$|Chapter 8 {{contains}} {{references to}} and quotes {{from many of}} the works Blake was exposed to and influenced by at a young age. These references include allusions to Saint Jerome, John Taylor's Urania, or his Heavenly Muse (1630), Abraham Cowley's translation of Anacreon's lyric poem [...] "The Grasshopper" [...] (1656), Henry Wotton's Reliquae Wottonianae (1685), John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1712), Edward Young's Night-Thoughts (1742) and James Hervey's Meditations and Contemplations (1746) and Theron and Aspasio (1755). The Jerome reference is found in Steelyard's comment [...] "Says Jerome happiness is not for us poor crawling reptiles of the earth Talk of happiness & happiness its no such thing – every person has a something." [...] The Taylor reference is Steelyard’s poem; [...] "Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor/His <b>sprit</b> sail fore sail main sail & his mizen/A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer/I know no greater sinner than John Taylor." [...] Although Alicia Ostriker feels this is a reference to the preacher John Taylor, David Erdman argues that the lines closely parallel the opening of the poem Urania , and as such, the reference is more likely to the poet than the preacher. The Cowley reference is found in the poem [...] "Phebe drest like beauties Queen", which contains the lines [...] "Happy people who can be/In happiness compard with ye." [...] Erdman believes this to be derived from the lines in Cowley's translation of Anacreon, [...] "Happy Insect! What can be/In Happiness compar'd to thee?" [...] The Wotton reference is found in Steelyard's [...] "My crop of corn is but a field of tares;" [...] John Sampson believes this to be reference to the Chidiock Tichborne poem [...] "Elegy" [...] (1586), which Blake could have been familiar with from Wotton's Reliquae. Locke is mentioned when Scopprell picks up one of Steelyard's books and reads the cover, [...] "An Easy of Huming Understanding by John Lookye Gent." [...] Addison is referred to indirectly when Steelyard attributes the quote [...] "the wreck of matter & the crush of worlds" [...] to Edward Young, when it is actually from Addison's Cato. Both the reference to Young and Hervey's Meditations are found in the opening sentence of the chapter; [...] "Steelyard the Lawgiver, sitting at his table taking extracts from Herveys Meditations among the tombs & Youngs Night thoughts." [...] The Theron reference is found when Steelyard announces to Obtuse Angle that he is reading the book.|$|E

6000|$|Sprit-sails are {{sometimes}} used in boats. These are fore-and-aft sails, which are kept distended by a <b>sprit</b> {{instead of a}} yard. The <b>sprit</b> is a long pole, one end of which is fixed to the lowest innermost corner, near the mast, and the other end extending to the highest outermost corner; thus it lies diagonally across the sail. It is convenient when a boat [...] "tacks," [...] or [...] "goes about"--in other words, when it goes round frequently, and sails, now leaning on one side, and, at the next tack, on the other side. In this case the <b>sprit</b> requires little shifting or attention. But it is dangerous in squally weather, because, although the sheet or line which holds the lower and outer end of a sail may be let go {{for the sake of}} safety, the upper part remains spread to the wind because of the <b>sprit.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that the sail was impossible. It was. It was one of those things, not that you have to see to believe, but that you cannot believe after you have seen it. The hoist of it and the length of its boom were {{sufficiently}} appalling; but, not content with that, its artificer had given it a tremendous head. So large was the head that no common <b>sprit</b> could carry the strain of it in an ordinary breeze. So a spar had been lashed to the canoe, projecting aft over the water. To this had been made fast a <b>sprit</b> guy: thus, the foot of the sail was held by the main-sheet, and the peak by the guy to the <b>sprit.</b>|$|E
