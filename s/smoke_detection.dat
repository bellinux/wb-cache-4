40|$|Conference on Asia-Pacific Optical Communications, Beijing, China, 7 - 11 November 2004 Smoke {{control is}} one of the {{important}} aspects in atrium fire. For an efficient smoke control strategy, {{it is very important to}} identify the smoke and fire source in a very short period of time. However, traditional methods such as point type detectors are not effective for <b>smoke</b> and fire <b>detection</b> in large space such as atrium. Therefore, video <b>smoke</b> and fire <b>detection</b> systems are proposed. For the development of the system, automatic extraction and tracking of flame are two important problems needed to be solved. Based on entropy theory, region growing and Otsu method, a new automatic integrated algorithm, which is used to track flame from video images, is proposed in this paper. It can successfully identify flames from different environment, different background and in different form. The experimental results show that this integrated algorithm has stronger robustness and wider adaptability. In addition, because of the low computational demand of this algorithm, it is also possible to be used as part of a robust, real-time <b>smoke</b> and fire <b>detection</b> system.

50|$|An {{end-to-end}} optical beam {{smoke detector}} {{is a system}} that has a separate light transmitter and receiver. They are used in applications where there is little available room to install a wide area detector - as the receiver is on a separate element each individual unit is quite small. The small size of the detector is also an advantage for aesthetic installations, where fire protection is required without introducing unsightly or overtly modern devices. Aesthetic considerations are especially important for cultural and heritage sites. End-to-end detectors include open-area <b>smoke</b> imaging <b>detection,</b> in which two wavelengths of light are used to detect smoke. UV and IR wavelengths of light react to smoke differently, and the comparative difference helps to verify real smoke by comparing the reflections and seeing a difference in the profile. UV and IR respond identically to things like blockage (ladder in front to detector path), bugs (blocking beam), fog, steam, and other things that commonly cause false alarms, so the two wavelengths of light are used together to detect smoke accurately.|$|R

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging) can effectively detect smoke plumes from small bonfires up to distances of 6. 5 km, so that the technique {{can be used for}} wildfire surveillance. The aim of the present work is to describe a method for calculating the optimal location and minimum number of lidar stations required for the surveillance of a given forest area, taking the hilly terrain of Sintra-Cascais Nature Park (Portugal) as an example. The placement and horizontal scanning of the lidar sensors must be such that the laser beam passes over the ground, while keeping sufficiently low to enable early <b>smoke</b> plume <b>detection,</b> before the <b>smoke</b> is dispersed by the wind. Simultaneously, the laser beam should not hit the ground at distances shorter than the instrument range. To solve the problem, a terrain rendering was created and the best laser-beam zenith angle for each azimuth and the effective range covered by each lidar were calculated. The computations showed that 95. 2 % of the 146 km 2 of the Nature Park area can be covered by seven detectors with the laser beams scanning at a height of 50 m or less above ground...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Early warning {{systems are}} {{critical}} in providing emergency {{response in the}} event of unexpected hazards. Cheap cameras and improvements in memory and computing power have enabled the design of fire detectors using video surveillance systems. This is critical in scenarios where traditional smoke detectors cannot be installed. In such scenarios, it has been observed that the smoke is visible well before flames can be sighted. This paper proposes a method to detect fire flame and/or smoke in real-time by processing the video data generated by ordinary camera monitoring a scene. The objective of this work is recognizing and modeling fire shape evolution in stochastic visual phenomenon. It focuses on detection of fire in image sequences by applying a hybrid algorithm that depends on optimizing the structure of a feed forward neural network. Fire detection experiments using various algorithms were carried. Results show that the proposed algorithm is very successful in detecting fire and/or <b>smoke.</b> Keywords- Fire <b>detection,</b> neural network, back-propagation, canny edge, wavelet. I...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{neural network}} is use for {{analyzing}} and training the sensed data which gathered by different channels. In this paper we use {{different combinations of}} techniques to detect <b>smoke</b> and flame <b>detection</b> algorithms in a video. The past sensed data cannot respond quickly and fire and smoke may not capture quickly. The region partitioning technique is proposed, which will increase the accuracy and also reduce test data so that rather than using a whole frame in a video it uses on part of that frame. The flame characteristics are used for normalization data we are processing. The use of neural network in combination with image processing can improve the accuracy and also help to predict the data. In improvement the wrong alarm problem is decreased. The double band method is use to detect fire. The region which we are analyzing for detecting fire and smoke is calculated directly {{so that it can}} reduce computational time...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to provide a more}} secure and amiable living {{environment}} in our homes, there has been constant effort to develop more efficient and suitable intelligent sensor technology for household application. Wireless sensors provide an efficient means of sensing without the need for messy wiring, and are ideally suited for the household environment. Although many sensor products have been developed (e. g. temperature, humidity and <b>smoke),</b> automated <b>detection</b> and reporting of an incidence occurring in places hard to observe or reach, such as wetting of diapers or water seepage under carpets, are still not readily available at low cost. Most of the existing technologies consist of complex design architecture and follow specific communication protocols which can be overkill for many simple household applications. In this thesis, we present a new wireless sensor system which is based on the detection of just the ON or OFF state of a condition. This approach overcomes the need for complex architecture and design, but is still able to achieve the functionality that is required for many household applications such as water leakage, food rotting, diaper wetting etc. and thus can be made available very cheaply. The sensor system consisting of an interrogator and a sensor circuit is implemented using inductive coupling. A passive L-C circuit is used for the sensor design and the system is tested using diaper wetting {{as an example of a}} simple household application. The testing results shows that the sensor can detect an ON and OFF condition for sensor and tag separation of 10 cm which is enough for applications like water leakage behind walls and under carpets, diaper wetting, food rotting etc...|$|R
