Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted.

More defeated warriors arrive with reports that Morald has disappeared, captured or dead. Then Harald, who was sent to bring reinforcements, comes. He reports that his army was defeated by one led by Ada. Arindal curses her. Zemina and Farzana express joy that Ada will remain immortal. But she sorrowfully explains that the fairy-king had required {{as a condition of}} her renouncing her immortality, that she conceal her fairy background from Arindal for eight years and on the last day torment him as best she can. If he cursed her, she would remain immortal and be turned to stone for a hundred years while he would go mad and die. In truth, Morald is not dead, the army Harald led was full of traitors, and the children are still alive. Already Arindal can feel his sanity slipping.|$|E

500|$|Through the years, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do you want me to go to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protÃ©gÃ©e at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable Ã©lite.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in Gather Together, {{motherhood}} and family issues are important themes throughout Angelou's autobiographies. The book describes the {{change and the}} importance of Rita's relationship with her own mother, the woman who had abandoned her and her brother as children, demonstrated by Rita's return to her mother {{at the end of the}} book, [...] "after she realizes how close to the edge <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> as a woman and as a mother". Vivian Baxter cares for Rita's young son as Rita attempts to make a living. Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that [...] "one gets a strong sense throughout Gather Together of [...] dependence on her mother". Critic Lyman B. Hagen remarks that Angelou's relationship with her mother becomes more important in Gather Together, and that Vivian is now more influential in the development of Angelou's attitudes. Lupton calls Clyde's kidnapping a [...] "powerful sequence of mother-loss" [...] and connects it to the kidnapping of Clyde's son in the 1980s. Angelou has compared the production of this book to giving birth, an apt metaphor given the birth of her son at the end of Caged Bird. Like many authors, Angelou views the creative writing process and its results as her children.|$|E
500|$|As {{the journey}} continues, Sakura comes to regard Syaoran as her most {{important}} person, {{but at the}} same time he betrays the group to Fei-Wang Reed, the sorcerer who can control him and created him based on [...] Sakura learns that Fei-Wang was responsible for scattering her memories and set up the journey to recover them for his own plans, but she still decides to continue in order to save Syaoran. From that point on, Sakura becomes very distant from the group, especially the newly arrived original Syaoran, because of his similarities to the clone whom <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to know. When she sees a future involving Fai killing the original Syaoran as part of Fei-Wang's curse, Sakura attempts to change it and succeeds in taking Fai's place, in that moment sending her soul to the Dream World and her body to Celes. Her soul is destroyed by the Syaoran clone when trying to recover her feathers. Just before her death, Sakura reveals that she is a clone of the [...] and asks Syaoran to go back to his previous self. Fei-Wang created the clone Sakura to increase the power from the feathers, and as a backup in case the original Sakura died in the journey.

Meanwhile, Pocahontas and Nima witness Grimosco and Miami {{plotting}} to kill the European settlers. [...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill all the White men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating fear about how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larryâ€™s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself.

500|$|The Hebrew word [...] "Alukah" [...] (literal {{translation}} is [...] "leech") {{is synonymous with}} vampirism or vampires, as is [...] "Motetz Dam" [...] (literally, [...] "blood sucker"). Later vampire traditions appear among diaspora Jews in Central Europe, in particular the medieval interpretation of Lilith. In common with vampires, this version of Lilith was held {{to be able to}} transform herself into an animal, usually a cat, and charm her victims into believing that she is benevolent or irresistible. However, she and her daughters usually strangle rather than drain victims, and in the Kabbalah, she retains many attributes found in vampires. A late 17th- or early 18th-century Kabbalah document was found in one of the Ritman library's copies of Jean de Pauly's translation of the Zohar. The text contains two amulets, one for male (lazakhar), the other for female (lanekevah). The invocations on the amulets mention Adam, Eve, and Lilith, Chavah Rishonah and the angelsâ€”Sanoy, Sansinoy, Smangeluf, Shmari'el, and Hasdi'el. A few lines in Yiddish are shown as dialog between the prophet Elijah and Lilith, in which <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> with a host of demons to kill the mother, take her newborn and [...] "to drink her blood, suck her bones and eat her flesh". She informs Elijah that she will lose power if someone uses her secret names, which she reveals at the end.|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to the office of Squiresâ€”a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinxâ€”to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
