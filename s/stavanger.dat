5|$|In 1910, Kommandøren was modernized at <b>Stavanger</b> Støberi & Dok in <b>Stavanger,</b> {{gaining a}} new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white. In January the next year, she ran aground at Rongevær in the Fensfjord. She ran aground again in 1913, in Herdlefjorden.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans to}} build a railway line along the route of the Ålgård Line was as part of the main route between <b>Stavanger</b> and Oslo. In 1873, County Engineer Th. Sejersted {{proposed}} a line running through Høgsfjord, Dirdal, Hunnedalen, Sirdal and Hylestad and onwards through Telemark to Kongsberg. Through Rogaland, it would run further east than the Jæren Line, which was under construction from <b>Stavanger</b> to Egersund. When the plans for a Sørlandet Line—which would connect <b>Stavanger</b> to Oslo via Kristiansand—started to be developed in 1892, some of Sjersted's plans were reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} deficits {{are covered}} through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The trackage and other infrastructure {{is owned by}} the government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the rolling stock is owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The service between <b>Stavanger</b> and Sandnes operate with a fixed schedule every 15 minutes. Of the trains to Sandnes, half continue onwards to Nærbø, giving a 30-minute headway. One train per hour operate all the way to Egersund. On weekends and late evenings, there is a reduced service. Travel time from <b>Stavanger</b> to Sandnes is 19 minutes, from <b>Stavanger</b> to Nærbø is 37 minutes, and from <b>Stavanger</b> to Egersund is 1 hour and 7 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S or Braathens SAFE {{was founded}} by {{ship-owner}} Ludvig G. Braathen in 1946. It started as a charter airline based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in Norway, flying to destinations in the Far East and in South America. At first the airline used Douglas DC-4s, and later also Douglas DC-3s. In 1948, the airline moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and started regular scheduled flights to the Far East. In 1952, the airline started cooperation with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir, where until 1960 the two airlines in cooperation flew flights to Reykjavík. Domestic services started in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo to <b>Stavanger</b> via Tønsberg. Braathens SAFE also established at <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola. A second route was started two years later to Trondheim. The Heron routes also stopped in Farsund, Kristiansand, Notodden to <b>Stavanger</b> and Hamar, Røros to Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|The Jæren Line opened as {{a narrow}} gauge railway between <b>Stavanger</b> and Egersund on 1 March 1878. The railway was {{extended}} from Egersund to Flekkefjord on 1 November 1904 as the Flekkefjord Line. On 21 December 1924, the Jæren Line's only branch opened, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård. On 1 March 1944, the Jæren Line {{became part of}} the Sørland Line, when the line opened between Sira and Kristiansand and the Jæren Line was converted to standard gauge. The Sørland Line from Egersund to <b>Stavanger</b> was opened as electric on 3 June 1956. This resulted in Class 65 and Class 67 electric multiple units being used on local trains on the line. In 1960, the services were replaced by Class 68 units. The section from <b>Stavanger</b> to Sandnes became {{the first part of the}} Norwegian railway network, after the Ofoten Line, to centrally controlled. The centralized traffic control opened from <b>Stavanger</b> to Sandnes on 20 March 1964, and from Sandnes to Egersund on 7 July. The whole line received partial automatic train control on 31 December 1986.|$|E
5|$|The main {{market for}} the charter {{services}} was <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola, mainly serving transport of personnel in the oil industry. By the 1980s, Norsk Air had up to four daily round trips between the two cities. In 1983, the airline received concession to start a regular scheduled service to <b>Stavanger.</b> A ten-seat Beechcraft Super King Air was bought and services started on 12 January 1984. Services to Bergen Airport, Flesland started on 10 July. Soon there were four daily round trips to both cities, supplemented by charter trips operated by Penguin. Starting on 26 March 1984, Norsk Flytjeneste experienced competition on the routes from Sandefjord to Bergen and <b>Stavanger,</b> when Busy Bee, on contract with Braathens SAFE, started flights using 50-passenger Fokker F27s. However, they operated only one round trip, with the same aircraft serving Sandefjord–Stavanger–Haugesund–Bergen.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from <b>Stavanger</b> to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to <b>Stavanger</b> was closed while {{the last part of the}} upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between <b>Stavanger</b> and Sandnes.|$|E
5|$|Geilo Airport {{was opened}} in 1985 as a {{regional}} airport. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession for flying from <b>Stavanger</b> to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air on the service. At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. In 1989, Coast Air received a one-year concession to operate from Geilo to Oslo and <b>Stavanger.</b> The company used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. The service was soon limited to two round trips each week.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} {{concession}} for a route from Oslo to Bodø via Trondheim without subsidies. They {{also stated that}} {{they were willing to}} fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to <b>Stavanger.</b> The plane started in <b>Stavanger</b> in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to <b>Stavanger,</b> which continued onwards to London. The first flight was made on 3 May 1952, with the Heron LN-PSG Per. From 7 to 14 May, the plane went {{on a tour of the}} country, visiting several airports. Regular services started on 18 August and a one-way ticket cost NOK95.|$|E
5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to <b>Stavanger.</b> The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to <b>Stavanger,</b> and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to <b>Stavanger</b> reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, {{after his}} {{appearance}} on Britain's Got Talent {{but before the}} release of his first album, Johnston embarked {{on a tour of}} Norway with the choir, performing at <b>Stavanger</b> Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of <b>Stavanger</b> is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Several {{churches that}} were {{originally}} built as Romanesque structures were modified or extended during the Gothic period.

5|$|The LCS {{attempted}} passive deception {{as part of}} Hardboiled. Agents canvassed Norwegian refugees {{for information}} about <b>Stavanger</b> and for possible interpreters. The hope was that rumours would reach neutral countries and filter back to the German intelligence network. Some deception was also passed on via agents.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration has {{developed}} a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the Ålgård Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, {{which may or may}} not be built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing double track between <b>Stavanger</b> and Sandnes.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's first {{domestic}} service was via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to <b>Stavanger,</b> {{and later a}} route to Trondheim. These were both operated with Heron aircraft. At first the Trondheim route was flown to Lade, but were quickly transferred to the current airport at Værnes. Loftleiðir started flights to Reykjavík in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Busy Bee was {{contracted}} by the Norwegian Armed Forces to fly military charters in June 1968. They had two 50-passenger Fokker F27 Friendships {{stationed at}} Høybuktmoen and flew two daily services from Kirkenes and other locations in Northern Norway to Bodø, with onwards connection to <b>Stavanger</b> and Oslo on Fridays. This arrangement continued until Busy Bee's bankruptcy in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, {{there was a lot}} of opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed that it would be better if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to make money on the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the <b>Stavanger</b> route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, the Norwegian Skating Association {{announced}} that they indented that the Norwegian World Cup events would be moved to Sørmarka Arena in <b>Stavanger,</b> due to low attendance at Vikingskipet. Vikingskipet has been selected to host the 2013 World Allround Speed Skating Championships. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Vikingskipet to host long track speed skating events.|$|E
5|$|In October, an {{agreement}} was {{signed with the}} Avitrans of Sweden to take over operations. This also included a second aircraft, so the airline could start operations to <b>Stavanger</b> and Molde in 2007. From 18 March, Vildanden also started three weekly departures from Skien to Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. The route was necessary to transport personnel from Avitrans' hub at Bromma to Skien.|$|E
5|$|Loder {{returned}} to Newfoundland on April 2; the following month, she performed at Gros Morne National Park's Trails, Tails & Tunes Festival with Dave Paddon. That July, she performed alongside Nick Hamlyn at Corner Brook's Downtown Days festival. In December 2012, she held two free coffeehouses in Newfoundland: at the <b>Stavanger</b> Drive Second Cup on the 15th and at Cornerstone Ministry Centre on the 21st. Over the subsequent {{months into the}} middle of 2013, she performed on a monthly basis at the <b>Stavanger</b> Drive Second Cup, which is owned by Newman. She also performed at the Majestic Theatre and the Fat Cat Blues Bar in St. John's. In 2013, she was named a showcase winner by the Christian Women in Media Association (CWIMA) and was selected to perform at the organization's national conference.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi's {{first attempt}} at {{entering}} the helicopter market was in 1982, when it applied for a concession from the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications to operate offshore helicopters, which it was awarded in 1983. As a protest, the incumbent Helikopter Service applied for the airline routes that Braathens SAFE operated from <b>Stavanger,</b> but this application was rejected.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, Braathens SAFE {{increased}} the number of services. The daily number of flights from Oslo to Bergen increased to nine, and the airline introduced four new services to Northern Norway from Oslo: two each to Tromsø and Harstad/Narvik. Later, the frequency to Tromsø increased to four, and from 28 June there were also two daily round trips to Bodø. SAS increased its services on the routes from Oslo to <b>Stavanger</b> and Trondheim, and from Bergen to <b>Stavanger.</b> The liberalization did not result in a price war, and prices remained constant. The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2014, Ødegaard {{was called}} {{up for a}} senior {{international}} against the United Arab Emirates in <b>Stavanger</b> and played the entire goalless draw on 27 August, becoming the youngest player to play for Norway at senior level, at 15 years and 253 days. The record was previously held by Tormod Kjellsen, who was 15 years and 351 days on his debut in 1910.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April 2002, SAS and Braathens split all {{the routes}} between them. SAS started flying on the main-haul routes from Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and <b>Stavanger,</b> {{with only a}} few flights to <b>Stavanger</b> flown by Braathens to get planes to the {{technical}} base there. From Oslo and Trondheim to Northern Norway, all routes were taken over by Braathens, with exception of a few flights made by SAS to Tromsø and Bodø. SAS also withdrew their flights from Oslo to Kristiansand and Ålesund, and Braathens increased their frequency on the route. Braathens retained the routes it had flown where SAS had not formerly flown. Braathens also kept the international flights to Barcelona, Nice, Málaga and Alicante. This reduced the overcapacity in the market, and allowed the SAS Group to save between NOK600 and 900 million.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines {{route from}} Molde to Bergen {{was taken over}} by Widerøe. However, while Scandinavian Airlines {{previously}} flew from Molde at 06:45, Widerøe's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen. The Bergen service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and <b>Stavanger</b> were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Operation Clambake {{was founded}} in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an {{information}} technology manager in <b>Stavanger,</b> Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net. This domain name {{has been described as}} provocative, because it is seen by some as a caricature of the character Xenu from Scientology cosmogony. Operation Clambake is registered in Norway as a non-profit organization.|$|E
5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from <b>Stavanger</b> and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from <b>Stavanger</b> on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E
5|$|The airline sent an {{application}} {{to register the}} Caravelle in April, but the application was cancelled later in the month, and the aircraft was subsequently registered in Sweden. By June the airline had still not received permission to operate, causing problems for Vestlandsreiser, who had to make last-minute leases of aircraft, and had to terminate all flights from <b>Stavanger.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{commuter}} rail system was introduced from 1 January 1992, after {{an agreement between}} NSB, Rogaland County Municipality and the six municipalities along the line. NSB introduced new Class 69 multiple units, while the county municipality introduced a fare coordination with the corresponding bus services. The increase in service involved 15 departures per direction per day, and the travel time from <b>Stavanger</b> to Egersund was reduced from 80 to 55 minutes. In addition, NSB started with a half-hour headway between <b>Stavanger</b> and Sandnes. A new station, Sandnes Sentrum, was opened in the city center of Sandnes {{at the time the}} new service started. NSB stated that the goal was to increase the daily ridership from 2,900 to 5,000 passengers by 1994. The stations were also upgraded, including new sheds. The Scanet train radio system was installed between 1993 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|The port town of Esbjerg {{is a large}} {{transport}} hub for both rail and road traffic, and an important port for Danish North Sea oil offshore activity. It is also served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen and <b>Stavanger,</b> while the nearby Billund Airport offers additional travel options.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two {{pilots were}} hired {{along with a}} total staff of 70, and {{services}} started on 1 September 1990. In June 1991, Braathens Helikopter signed a three-year agreement with Amoco for flights from <b>Stavanger</b> to Valhall. The contract had an option for a two-year extension. The revenue was between NOK100 and 200 million, depending {{on the length of}} the contract and the capacity needed. Operations started in February 1992, and involved the company purchasing another two Super Pumas. On 10 September, Braathens Helikopter was awarded the contract with British Petroleum for flights from <b>Stavanger</b> to Ula and Gyda. The contract gave a revenue of up to NOK300 million in the course five years. Operations started on 1 November 1992, and involved about 2,000 hours of flying per year. With this contract, Braathens Helikopter had about a 30% market share. Braathens purchased one more Super Puma {{as a consequence of the}} contract. After operations started, the company had grown to 120 employees and was the second-largest helicopter operator in the country.|$|E
5|$|When established, {{the company}} was based at Tananger in Sola outside <b>Stavanger</b> and had its main {{operative}} base at <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola. The head office was later moved to Fornebu in Bærum outside Oslo, and the main base moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At its peak the company had 196 employees, of which 144 were based in Norway. At the time of bankruptcy, the company had 120 employees, of which 78 were flight staff. Air Europe's CEO Rod Lynch stated that Air Europe, and in extension Norway Airlines, had forty percent lower operating costs than Lufthansa and twenty percent lower than British Airways. Lynch emphasized the lack of trade unions {{as a key to}} holding costs down. Air Europe claimed a thirty-four percent market share on passengers between Oslo and London.|$|E
5|$|Braathens (until 1998 {{known as}} Braathens SAFE) was a Norwegian {{scheduled}} and charter airline that operated from 1946 to 2004. The airline used 53 airports serving 50 destinations, 23 {{of which were}} in Norway and 6 in Sweden. Braathens provided international services to 24 airports serving 22 cities in 17 countries. Seven of these cities are in Asia, the rest in Europe. In addition, Braathens served numerous destinations as both a regular and an ad-hoc charter airline. Braathens' main hubs were Oslo Airport, Fornebu (1949–98), Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (1998–2007) and Stockholm Arlanda Airport (1997–99). The main technical base was at <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola.|$|E
5|$|Braathens Helikopter A/S was a Norwegian {{helicopter}} airline {{based at}} <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola, and Bergen Airport, Flesland. It used {{a fleet of}} seven Aérospatiale Super Pumas to serve offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. The customers were Phillips Petroleum, Norsk Hydro, Statoil, Amoco and British Petroleum, serving their oil fields Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk, Valhall, Ula and Gyda. Braathens Helikopter operated from 1989 to 1993, after which it was sold to and merged with the main competitor, Helikopter Service. Braathens Helikopter was owned by Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and was a sister company of the airline Braathens SAFE.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE {{started as}} a charter airline, flying {{predominantly}} to the Far East and South America. In 1949, the airline was granted a concession on the Far East route that was flown until 1954, using Douglas DC-4s. The main airport in Norway was Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and the main technical base was at <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola. From 1952 to 1960, the airline cooperated on flights to Reykjavík with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir. Braathens SAFE started domestic services in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo via Tønsberg to <b>Stavanger.</b> Services from Oslo to Trondheim were introduced in 1953. This was supplemented with stops in Farsund and Kristiansand in 1955, and Hamar, Røros and Notodden the following year. However, with the delivery of the Fokker F-27s, many of the smaller airports were cut from the service. The airline started flying from Oslo to Ålesund and along the West Coast in 1958. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg, Denmark. Services to Bodø and Tromsø started in 1967, and Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s were taken into use two years later. Kristiansund was added as a destination in 1970 and Molde two years later. The F-28s were retired in 1986, while services to Longyearbyen started the following year.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or <b>Stavanger</b> – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at <b>Stavanger</b> Airport, Sola.|$|E
