METHODS: Demineralized dentin disks {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups (N= 4) : (1) immersion in artificial saliva at 37 °C for 30 days; (2) pre-treatment with 0. 5 M EDC for 60 s, then stored as in Group 1; (3) CS challenge (50 N occlusal load, 30 s occlusal time plus 30 s with no load, for 30 days); (4) pre-treatment with 0. 5 M EDC as in Group 2 and CS challenge as in Group 3. Collagen degradation was evaluated by <b>sampling</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> for ICTP and CTX telopeptides. RESULTS: EDC treated specimens showed no significant telopeptides release, irrespective of the aging method. Cyclic stressing of EDC-untreated specimens caused significantly higher ICTP release at day 1, compared to static storage, while by days 3 and 4, the ICTP release in the cyclic group fell significantly below the static group, and then remained undetectable from 5 to 30 days. CTX release in the cyclic groups, on EDC-untreated control specimens was always lower than in the static group in days 1 - 4, and then fell to undetectable for 30 days. SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed that chewing stresses applied to control untreated demineralized dentin increased degradation of collagen in terms of CTX release, while collagen crosslinking agents may prevent dentin collagen degradation, irrespective of simulated occlusal function...|$|R

40|$|Viterbi Algorithm Decoder Enhanced with Non-transmittable Codewords {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{decoding}} algorithm which effectively improves forward error correction performance. HoweverViterbi decoder enhanced with NTCs is not yet designed to work in <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> devices. Currently Reed Solomon (RS) Algorithm is almost the dominant algorithm used in correcting error in <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> Conversely, recent studies show that there still exist low reliability of data in <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> while the demand for <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> increases drastically. This study proposes a design of the Soft Viterbi Algorithm decoder enhanced with Non-transmittable Codewords (SVAD-NTCs) to be used in <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> for error correction. Matlab simulation was used in this design in order to investigate behavior and effectiveness of SVAD-NTCs in correcting errors in data retrieving from <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> <b>Sample</b> data of one million bits are randomly generated, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) was used as data distortion model and Binary Phase- Shift Keying (BPSK) was applied for simulation modulation. Results show that,behaviors of SVAD-NTC performance increase as you increase the NTCs, but beyond 6 NTCs there is no significant change and SVAD-NTCs design drastically reduce the total residual error from 216, 878 of Reed Solomon to 23, 900...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Despite {{the fact}} that Solid State Disk (SSD) data <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> had offered a revolutionary {{property}} storages community, but the unavailability of a comprehensive allocation strategy in SSDs <b>storage</b> <b>media,</b> leads to consuming the available space, random writing processes, time-consuming reading processes, and system resources consumption. In order to overcome these challenges, an efficient allocation algorithm is a desirable option. In this paper, we had executed an intensive investigation on the SSD-based allocation algorithms that had been proposed by the knowledge community. An explanatory comparison had been made between these algorithms. We reviewed these algorithms in order to building advanced knowledge armature that would help in inventing new allocation algorithms {{for this type of}} <b>storage</b> <b>media...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{era of the}} International Space Station {{with its}} longer {{duration}} missions will pose unique challenges to microgravity life sciences research. The Space Station Biological Research Project (SSBRP) is responsible for addressing these challenges and defining the science requirements necessary to conduct life science research on-board the International Space Station. Space Station will support {{a wide range of}} cell and tissue culture experiments for durations of 1 to 30 days. Space Shuttle flights to bring experimental samples back to Earth for analyses will only occur every 90 days. Therefore, samples may have to be retained for periods up to 60 days. This presents a new challenge in fresh specimen <b>sample</b> <b>storage</b> for cell biology. Fresh specimen samples are defined as samples that are preserved by means other than fixation and cryopreservation. The challenge of long-term storage of fresh specimen samples includes the need to suspend or inhibit proliferation and metabolism pending return to Earth-based laboratories. With this challenge being unique to space research, there have not been any ground based studies performed to address this issue. It was decided hy SSBRP that experiment support studies to address the following issues were needed: Fixative Solution Management; <b>Media</b> <b>Storage</b> Conditions; Fresh Specimen <b>Sample</b> <b>Storage</b> of Mammalian Cell/Tissue Cultures; Fresh Specimen <b>Sample</b> <b>Storage</b> of Plant Cell/Tissue Cultures; Fresh Specimen <b>Sample</b> <b>Storage</b> of Aquatic Cell/Tissue Cultures; and Fresh Specimen <b>Sample</b> <b>Storage</b> of Microbial Cell/Tissue Cultures.
