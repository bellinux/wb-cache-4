40|$|This thesis covers both {{experimental}} and computer {{investigations into the}} dynamic behaviour of mechanical seals. The literature survey shows no investigations {{on the effect of}} vibration on mechanical seals of the type common in the various process industries. Typical seal designs are discussed. A form of Reynolds' equation has been developed that permits the calculation of stiffnesses and damping coefficients for the fluid film. The dynamics of the mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>floating</b> ring have been investigated using approximate formulae, and {{it has been shown that}} the floating ring will behave as a rigid body. Some elements, such as the radial damping due to the fluid film, are small and may be neglected. The equations of motion of the floating ring have been developed utilising the significant elements, and a solution technique described. The stiffness and damping coefficients of nitrile rubber o-rings have been obtained. These show a wide variation, with a constant stiffness up to 60 Hz. The importance of the effect of temperature on the properties is discussed. An unsuccessful test rig is described in the appendices. The dynamic behaviour of a mechanical seal has been investigated experimentally, including the effect of changes of speed, sealed pressure and seal geometry. The results, as expected, show that high vibration levels result in both high leakage and seal temperatures. Computer programs have been developed to solve Reynolds' Equation and the equations of motion. Two solution techniques for this latter program were developed, the unsuccesful technique is described in the appendices. Some stability problems were encountered, but despite these the solution shows good agreement with some of the experimental conditions. Possible reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. Various suggestions for future work in this field are given. These include the combining of the programs and more extensive {{experimental and}} computer modelling...|$|E

50|$|A {{ballcock}} (also balltap or float valve) is {{a mechanism}} or machine for filling water tanks, {{such as those}} found in flush toilets, while avoiding overflow and (in the event of low water pressure) backflow. The modern ballcock was invented by José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, a Mexican priest and scientist, who described the device in 1790 in the Gaceta de Literatura Méxicana. It consists of a valve connected to a hollow <b>sealed</b> <b>float</b> {{by means of a}} lever, mounted {{near the top of the}} tank. The float is often ball-shaped, hence the name ballcock. The valve is connected to the incoming water supply, and is opened and closed by the lever which has the float mounted on the end. When the water level rises, the float rises with it; once it rises to a pre-set level, the mechanism forces the lever to close the valve and shut off the water flow. This is an example of negative feedback and of proportional control.|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} of energy from ocean waves {{has been investigated}} in Europe since the 1970 s. During the research process hundreds of devices have been proposed {{and a few of}} them have been built full scale and deployed to the ocean. Unlike other renewable energies, so far {{there has not been a}} device standing out to be the most suitable to exploit wave power. One of the practical problems to be solved in a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is durability in the harsh marine environment.

40|$|Wave {{energy is}} one of the most {{promising}} renewable energy sources of the last few decades. Wave power has been investigated in Europe since the Seventies. In 1974 Prof. Stephen Salter proposed one of the first Wave Energy Converters (WEC), called Duck, at the University of Edinburgh. In the past four decades, hundreds of Wave Energy Converters have been proposed and studied, but so far a final architecture to harvest wave power has not been identified. Many engineering problems are still to be solved, like survivability, durability and effective power capture in a variable wave climate. ISWEC (Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter) is a system that exploits the gyroscopic reactions provided from a spinning flywheel for the wave power conversion similarly to what the gyroscopic stabilizer do to reduce the roll motion of a boat. The flywheel works inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>floating</b> body in order to be protected from the outer environment and to grant reliable and durable operation conditions. Such a body is retained by means of two slack mooring lines connected to a deadweight lying on the seabed. The wave action induces the body pitching oscillation that may be damped to obtain the power transfer from the waves to the body. Furthermore an action torque is provided from the PTO on the gyroscope aiming at the energy conversion, while a reaction torque is given from the gyroscope to the hull. In such a way the power transfer from the floater to the PTO is obtained. The aim of the current thesis is to introduce the ISWEC as a possible technology for the wave power conversion. The mathematical model of the device and its validation by means of the experimental tests is here presented and its application for the full scale ISWEC prototype design porocess is shown. Finally an optimal control strategy has been proposed as a possible alternative to the basic linear control techniqu...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of renewable energy, Wave Power represents a highly promising resource {{for the production of}} green energy as it is characterized by very high power density values. Moreover, Marine Energy is currently still an open field, even though the amount of research investments and patents in this field has been rising in the past 40 years. Real waves are not monochromatic and are in fact a classical example of stochastic phenomena. As such, real waves are highly complex and can be studied by means of statistical frequency domain analysis. Devices able to transform this kind of energy in a more usable form, i. e. electricity, are called WECs (Wave Energy Converters). In 2009 Politecnico di Torino started studying and designing ISWEC (Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter) to be deployed in Pantelleria Island, {{one of the most powerful}} sites in Italy. The core of the system is a one degree of freedom gyroscope enclosed in a <b>sealed</b> <b>floating</b> hull: the spinning motion of the flywheel, combined with the motion of the floating hull, produces a gyroscopic torque that can be exploited by means of a generator called PTO (Power Take Off). The gyroscope motion unloads an inertial reaction on the hull that combined with the waves, allows power absorption. The geometry of the hull and the hydrodynamic description of the system are key factors in designing such a device. The team in Politecnico di Torino chose ANSYS AQWA to tackle the hydrodynamic subproblem. The software capability that allows for the calculation of the hydrodynamic of the floating system, was fundamental in determining the most suitable geometry of ISWEC hull. The article presents and explains the results obtained using the software for the following tasks. As a first step, a parametric analysis comparing numerous geometries was carried out with AQWA-LINE. Furthermore, it was possible to use ANSYS AQWA as the core software for dynamic simulation of the whole system, implementing the gyroscope model and the dynamic interaction between the spinning gyroscope and the floating hull by means of a DLL developed in Fortran environment...|$|R

30|$|For the WC 55 Y shield hauler, {{a moving}} speed brake was developed, which {{integrates}} a planetary speed retarder {{and a large}} torque wetted multi-disc safe brake. Traditional brake concentrates on the high-speed end of wheel-side retarder, and is small in dimension. However, under a larger braking torque and repeated braking, the system generates large amount of heat and consistently fails. The working condition of the shield hauler is harsh. In the aspect of driveless axle hydraulic-driven design, {{there have been no}} successful braking studies anywhere in the world. Fully enclosed, high torque and large brake power, small in size, and high efficiency heat dissipation are the difficulties in the study. Meanwhile, the road underground is potholed, thus during the movement of heavy-loaded vehicles, the wheel-side retarder will withstand a greater shock load, and therefore must have enough strength. Otherwise, it will cause failures in the retarder’s bearing, such as broken parts. In response to these technical bottlenecks, a “modular integrated technology” was used to design a new planetary gear of wetted multiple-disc brake. Also, an integrated motor-cartridge wheel drive and brake retarder was invented. It is a wheel-side planetary retarder, and integrates all brake functions. The brake was designed as a fully closed wetted-type multi-disc brake with spring braking and hydraulic release. Through the spline, friction tablets and steel tablets are coupled with fixed parts and turned parts respectively. Through the motor input, retarder part input torque, delivered via a two level planetary deceleration device, the torque will be transmitted to the wheels. The brake cavity and retarder cavity are completely insulated by a pair of high reliable <b>floating</b> <b>seals</b> to avoid the interference of two different functions. The braking torque of the integrated brake-retarder is greater than 60, 000  N m, thermal equilibrium temperature is less than 90 C° under long term braking, and the average life of the friction disc is greater than 5000  h.
